(the “Corporation” or “First BanCorp.”) (NYSE: FBP), the bank holding company for FirstBank Puerto Rico (“FirstBank” or “the Bank”), today reported a net income of $73.7 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $75.8 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2024, and $82.0 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**_Aurelio Alemán, President and Chief Executive Officer of First BanCorp, commented:_ ** _“Our third quarter results reflect our commitment to deliver consistent performance and our ability to generate organic capital on the back of a stable environment in our main market. We posted a strong return on assets of 1.55%, maintained positive credit performance and stable deposit trends, and made good progress on our capital deployment strategy._ _The economy remains on solid footing driven by positive labor market trends and increased business activity. This environment continues to support credit demand and has enabled our strongest quarter of commercial loan originations this year. Our loan portfolio grew by $63 million despite higher levels of unexpected commercial prepayments that amounted to approximately $122 million in the third quarter. Our teams remain focused on expanding existing relationships, building loan pipelines, and adopting new platforms to enable future growth as we close out 2024 and enter 2025._ _Net interest income and the margin continued to expand after reaching a trough in the first quarter. We continue to expect that our bond book repricing opportunities will allow for some net interest income expansion in 2025. Finally, consistent with our guidance, we deployed over 100% of our quarterly earnings for the redemption of $50 million in junior subordinated debentures and the payment of common stock dividends. Our franchise is delivering solid results, we have a strong capital base, and we have ample flexibility to prudently allocate that capital into opportunities that best serve the long-term interests of our clients, communities and shareholders.”_ |  **Q3** |  **Q2** |  **Q3** |  **YTD**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**2024** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Financial Highlights (1)**  \nNet interest income  |  $  |  202,064  |  $  |  199,628  |  $  |  199,728  |  $  |  598,212  |  $  |  600,428   \nProvision for credit losses  |  15,245  |  11,605  |  4,396  |  39,017  |  42,128   \nNon-interest income  |  32,502  |  32,038  |  30,296  |  98,523  |  99,085   \nNon-interest expenses  |  122,935  |  118,682  |  116,638  |  362,540  |  344,823   \nIncome before income taxes  |  96,386  |  101,379  |  108,990  |  295,178  |  312,562   \nIncome tax expense  |  22,659  |  25,541  |  26,968  |  72,155  |  89,187   \n**Net income** |  $  |  73,727  |  $  |  75,838  |  $  |  82,022  |  $  |  223,023  |  $  |  223,375   \n**Selected Financial Data (1)**  \nNet interest margin  |  4.25  |  %  |  4.22  |  %  |  4.15  |  %  |  4.21  |  %  |  4.24  |  %   \nEfficiency ratio  |  52.41  |  %  |  51.23  |  %  |  50.71  |  %  |  52.03  |  %  |  49.29  |  %   \nEarnings per share - diluted  |  $  |  0.45  |  $  |  0.46  |  $  |  0.46  |  $  |  1.35  |  $  |  1.25   \nBook value per share  |  $  |  10.38  |  $  |  9.10  |  $  |  7.47  |  $  |  10.38  |  $  |  7.47   \nTangible book value per share  (2) |  $  |  10.09  |  $  |  8.81  |  $  |  7.16  |  $  |  10.09  |  $  |  7.16   \nReturn on average equity  |  18.31  |  %  |  20.80  |  %  |  20.70  |  %  |  19.52  |  %  |  19.00  |  %   \nReturn on average assets  |  1.55  |  %  |  1.61  |  %  |  1.72  |  %  |  1.57  |  %  |  1.59  |  %   \n**Results for Third Quarter of 2024 compared to Second Quarter of 2024**  \n---  \n**Profitability** |  **Net income –** $73.7 million, or $0.45 per diluted share compared to $75.8 million, or $0.46 per diluted share.  **Income before income taxes** **–** $96.4 million compared to $101.3 million.  **Adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision income (Non-GAAP)** (2) **–** $111.6 million, compared to $113.1 million.  **Net interest income –** $202.1 million compared to $199.6 million. The increase was mainly due to a higher volume of loans and an increase of approximately $1.2 million associated with the effect of an additional day in the third quarter of 2024. Net interest margin increased to 4.25%, compared to 4.22%.  **Provision for credit losses –** $15.2 million compared to $11.6 million. The increase in provision reflects the impact of higher charge-off levels in the consumer loan and finance lease portfolios, partially offset by reductions associated with the improved financial condition from certain commercial borrowers and improvements in the long-term projections of the unemployment rate primarily in the Puerto Rico region and the commercial real estate (“CRE”) price index.  **Non-interest income –** $32.5 million compared to $32.0 million. The increase was driven by insurance proceeds of $0.8 million received in the third quarter of 2024.  **Non-interest expenses** – $122.9 million compared to $118.7 million. The increase was mainly due to a $2.3 million realized gain on the sale of a commercial other real estate owned (“OREO”) property in the Puerto Rico region in the second quarter of 2024 and a $1.6 million increase in employees’ compensation and benefits expense, driven by annual salary merit increases and an additional working day in the third quarter of 2024. The efficiency ratio was 52.41%, compared to 51.23%.   \n**Balance** **Sheet** |  **Total loans –** grew by $62.8 million to $12.5 billion, primarily reflecting growth in the consumer and commercial loan portfolios. Total loan originations, other than credit card utilization activity, of $1.2 billion, up $43.1 million, mainly in commercial and construction loans.  **Core deposits (other than brokered and government deposits) –** decreased by $36.8 million to $12.7 billion, reflecting a decline of $51.0 million in the Virgin Islands region and $31.5 million in the Puerto Rico region, partially offset by a $45.7 million increase in the Florida region. This decline includes a $96.9 million decrease in non-interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a $35.9 million increase in time deposits.  **Government deposits (fully collateralized) –** decreased by $40.1 million to $3.2 billion, mainly in the Virgin Islands region.  **Brokered certificates of deposits (“CDs”) –** decreased by $104.7 million to $520.0 million, mainly in the Puerto Rico region.   \n**Asset** **Quality** |  **Allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) coverage ratio –** amounted to 1.98%, compared to 2.06%.  **Annualized net charge-offs to average loans ratio** increased to 0.78%, compared to 0.69%; the increase includes a $1.2 million fully reserved charge-off taken in connection with the sale of an $8.2 million nonaccrual commercial and industrial (“C&I”) loan in the Puerto Rico region.  **Non-performing assets –** decreased by $7.8 million, driven by the sale and charge-off of the aforementioned nonaccrual C&I loan.   \n**Liquidity** **and** **Capital** |  **Liquidity –** Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $685.4 million, compared to $586.3 million. When adding $1.8 billion of free high-quality liquid securities that could be liquidated or pledged within one day and $964.7 million in available lending capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”), available liquidity amounted to 18.43% of total assets, compared to 18.50%.  **Capital –** Repurchased $50.0 million of junior subordinated debentures and paid $26.1 million in common stock dividends. Capital ratios exceeded required regulatory levels. The Corporation’s estimated total capital, common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, tier 1 capital, and leverage ratios were 18.25%, 16.18%, 16.18%, and 10.96%, respectively, as of September 30, 2024. On a non-GAAP basis, the tangible common equity ratio (2) increased to 8.79% when compared to 7.66%, driven by the $160.1 million increase in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities due to changes in market interest rates which is recognized as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss.   \n(1) In thousands, except per share information and financial ratios.

The increase in net interest income reflects the following: \n\n  * A $3.8 million increase in interest income on loans, driven by: \n\n\n\n- A $1.6 million increase in interest income on commercial and construction loans, driven by increases of $1.1 million associated with the effect of an additional day in the third quarter of 2024, and a $0.4 million increase associated with a $37.8 million increase in the average balance. \n\n- A $1.4 million increase in interest income on consumer loans and finance leases, of which $0.7 million was associated with a $35.3 million increase in the average balance, mainly in the auto loans and finance leases portfolios, and $0.7 million was associated with the effect of an additional day in the third quarter of 2024. \n\n- An $0.8 million increase in interest income in residential mortgage loans driven by higher interest income recognized on nonaccrual loans that returned to accrual status. \n\nPartially offset by: \n\n  * A $1.0 million decrease in interest income from investment securities driven by a $168.7 million decrease in the average balance. \n\n\n  * A $0.3 million decrease in interest income from interest-bearing cash balances driven by a $22.2 million reduction in the average cash balances deposited at the Federal Reserve Bank (the “FED”). \n\n\n\nInterest expense on interest-bearing liabilities remained relatively flat during the third and second quarters of 2024, as further explained below. \n\n  * A $1.2 million increase in interest expense on time deposits, excluding brokered CDs, mainly due to increases of approximately $0.5 million associated with a $55.8 million increase in the average balance, $0.4 million associated with higher interest rates paid in the third quarter of 2024 on renewals, and $0.3 million associated with the effect of an additional day in the third quarter of 2024. The average cost of non-brokered time deposits in the third quarter of 2024 increased 5 basis points to 3.60% when compared to the previous quarter. \n\n\n\nPartially offset by: \n\n  * A $1.0 million decrease in interest expense on brokered CDs, primarily related to a $76.1 million reduction in the average balance. \n\n\n  * A $0.2 million decrease in interest expense on interest-bearing checking and saving accounts, mainly due to a decrease of approximately $0.4 million associated with a $99.2 million reduction in the average balance, partially offset by a $0.3 million increase associated with the effect of an additional day in the third quarter of 2024. The average cost of interest-bearing checking and saving accounts, excluding public sector deposits, remained relatively flat at 0.76% in the third quarter of 2024, when compared to 0.75% in the second quarter. \n\n\n\nNet interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 4.25%, a 3 basis points increase when compared to the second quarter of 2024, mostly reflecting a change in asset mix resulting from the deployment of cash flows from lower-yielding investment securities to fund loan growth while simultaneously repaying higher rate brokered CDs. \n\n**NON-INTEREST INCOME**\n\nThe following table sets forth information concerning non-interest income for the last five quarters: \n\n**Quarter Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **March 31, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n(In thousands)   \nService charges and fees on deposit accounts  |  $  |  9,684  |  $  |  9,725  |  $  |  9,662  |  $  |  9,662  |  $  |  9,552   \nMortgage banking activities  |  3,199  |  3,419  |  2,882  |  2,094  |  2,821   \nInsurance commission income  |  3,003  |  2,786  |  5,507  |  2,379  |  2,790   \nCard and processing income  |  11,768  |  11,523  |  11,312  |  11,015  |  10,841   \nOther non-interest income  |  4,848  |  4,585  |  4,620  |  8,459  |  4,292   \nNon-interest income  |  $  |  32,502  |  $  |  32,038  |  $  |  33,983  |  $  |  33,609  |  $  |  30,296   \n  \nNon-interest income increased by $0.5 million to $32.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $32.0 million for the second quarter of 2024, mainly due to: \n\n  * A $0.3 million increase in other non-interest income driven by $0.8 million in insurance proceeds received in the third quarter of 2024 related to a 2020 outstanding insurance claim, partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease related to lower realized gains from purchased income tax credits. \n\n\n  * A $0.2 million increase in card and processing income, mainly in merchant-related referral fees and interchange income due to higher transactional volumes. \n\n\n  * A $0.2 million increase in insurance commission income. \n\n\n\nPartially offset by: \n\n  * A $0.2 million decrease in revenues from mortgage banking activities driven by a lower volume of sales of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. During the third and second quarters of 2024, Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”) securitization transactions and whole loan sales to U.S. government-sponsored enterprises amounted to $38.2 million and $43.5 million, respectively. \n\n\n\n**NON-INTEREST EXPENSES**\n\nThe following table sets forth information concerning non-interest expenses for the last five quarters: \n\n**Quarter Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **March 31, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n(In thousands)   \nEmployees' compensation and benefits  |  $  |  59,081  |  $  |  57,456  |  $  |  59,506  |  $  |  55,584  |  $  |  56,535   \nOccupancy and equipment  |  22,424  |  21,851  |  21,381  |  21,847  |  21,781   \nBusiness promotion  |  4,116  |  4,359  |  3,842  |  6,725  |  4,759   \nProfessional service fees:   \nCollections, appraisals and other credit-related fees  |  688  |  1,149  |  1,366  |  952  |  930   \nOutsourcing technology services  |  7,771  |  7,698  |  7,469  |  7,003  |  7,261   \nOther professional fees  |  4,079  |  3,584  |  3,841  |  3,295  |  2,831   \nTaxes, other than income taxes  |  5,665  |  5,408  |  5,129  |  5,535  |  5,465   \nFDIC deposit insurance  |  2,164  |  2,316  |  3,102  |  8,454  |  2,143   \nOther insurance and supervisory fees  |  2,092  |  2,287  |  2,293  |  2,308  |  2,356   \nNet gain on OREO operations  |  (1,339)  |  (3,609)  |  (1,452)  |  (1,005)  |  (2,153)   \nCredit and debit card processing expenses  |  7,095  |  7,607  |  5,751  |  7,360  |  6,779   \nCommunications  |  2,170  |  2,261  |  2,097  |  2,134  |  2,219   \nOther non-interest expenses  |  6,929  |  6,315  |  6,598  |  6,413  |  5,732   \nTotal non-interest expenses  |  $  |  122,935  |  $  |  118,682  |  $  |  120,923  |  $  |  126,605  |  $  |  116,638   \n  \nNon-interest expenses amounted to $122.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $4.2 million, from $118.7 million in the second quarter of 2024.

Refer to _Non-GAAP Disclosures - Special Items_ for additional information. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the effect of this Special Item (as defined below in _Non-GAAP Disclosures - Special Items_ ), adjusted non-interest expenses increased by $4.4 million mainly due to: \n\n  * A $2.3 million decrease in net gain on OREO operations, driven by the aforementioned $2.3 million realized gain on the sale of a commercial real estate OREO property in the Puerto Rico region in the second quarter of 2024. \n\n\n  * A $1.6 million increase in employees’ compensation and benefits expense, driven by annual salary merit increases and an additional working day in the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by a decrease in payroll taxes due to employees reaching maximum taxable amounts. \n\n\n  * A $0.6 million increase in other non-interest expenses, mainly due to higher charges for operational and fraud losses, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets. \n\n\n  * A $0.6 million increase in occupancy and equipment expenses, including a $0.1 million increase in rent expense related to a branch which is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2024. \n\n\n\nPartially offset by: \n\n  * A $0.5 million decrease in credit and debit card processing expenses, mainly due to higher reimbursements from credit card networks compared to the second quarter of 2024. \n\n\n\n**INCOME TAXES**\n\nThe Corporation recorded an income tax expense of $22.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $25.5 million for the second quarter of 2024, mainly due to lower pre-tax income and a $0.4 million tax contingency accrual release in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitation on some uncertain tax positions. \n\nThe Corporation’s estimated annual effective tax rate, excluding entities with pre-tax losses from which a tax benefit cannot be recognized and discrete items, was 23.7% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 24.1% for the second quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had a deferred tax asset of $137.5 million, net of a valuation allowance of $121.6 million against the deferred tax assets. \n\n**CREDIT QUALITY**\n\n**Non-Performing Assets**\n\nThe following table sets forth information concerning non-performing assets for the last five quarters: \n\n(Dollars in thousands)  |  **September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **March 31, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nNonaccrual loans held for investment:   \nResidential mortgage  |  $  |  31,729  |  $  |  31,396  |  $  |  32,685  |  $  |  32,239  |  $  |  31,946   \nConstruction  |  4,651  |  4,742  |  1,498  |  1,569  |  1,640   \nCommercial mortgage  |  11,496  |  11,736  |  11,976  |  12,205  |  21,632   \nC&I  |  18,362  |  27,661  |  25,067  |  15,250  |  18,809   \nConsumer and finance leases  |  23,106  |  20,638  |  21,739  |  22,444  |  19,137   \nTotal nonaccrual loans held for investment  |  $  |  89,344  |  $  |  96,173  |  $  |  92,965  |  $  |  83,707  |  $  |  93,164   \nOREO  |  19,330  |  21,682  |  28,864  |  32,669  |  28,563   \nOther repossessed property  |  8,844  |  7,513  |  6,226  |  8,115  |  7,063   \nOther assets (1) |  1,567  |  1,532  |  1,551  |  1,415  |  1,448   \nTotal non-performing assets (2) |  $  |  119,085  |  $  |  126,900  |  $  |  129,606  |  $  |  125,906  |  $  |  130,238   \nPast due loans 90 days and still accruing (3) |  $  |  43,610  |  $  |  47,173  |  $  |  57,515  |  $  |  59,452  |  $  |  62,892   \nNonaccrual loans held for investment to total loans held for investment  |  0.72  |  %  |  0.78  |  %  |  0.76  |  %  |  0.69  |  %  |  0.78  |  %   \nNonaccrual loans to total loans  |  0.72  |  %  |  0.78  |  %  |  0.75  |  %  |  0.69  |  %  |  0.78  |  %   \nNon-performing assets to total assets  |  0.63  |  %  |  0.67  |  %  |  0.69  |  %  |  0.67  |  %  |  0.70  |  %   \n(1)  |  Residential pass-through mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) issued by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority (“PRHFA”) held as part of the available-for-sale debt securities portfolio.   \n(2)  |  Excludes purchased-credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans previously accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 310-30 for which the Corporation made the accounting policy election of maintaining pools of loans as “units of account” both at the time of adoption of current expected credit losses (“CECL”) on January 1, 2020 and on an ongoing basis for credit loss measurement. These loans will continue to be excluded from nonaccrual loan statistics as long as the Corporation can reasonably estimate the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected on the loan pools. The portion of such loans contractually past due 90 days or more amounted to $6.5 million as of September 30, 2024 (June 30, 2024- $7.4 million; March 31, 2024 - $8.6 million; December 31, 2023 - $8.3 million; September 30, 2023 - $8.9 million).   \n(3)  |  These include rebooked loans, which were previously pooled into GNMA securities, amounting to $6.6 million as of September 30, 2024 (June 30, 2024- $6.8 million; March 31, 2024 - $8.8 million; December 31, 2023 - $7.9 million; September 30, 2023 - $8.5 million). Under the GNMA program, the Corporation has the option but not the obligation to repurchase loans that meet GNMA’s specified delinquency criteria. For accounting purposes, the loans subject to the repurchase option are required to be reflected on the financial statements with an offsetting liability.   \n  \nVariances in credit quality metrics: \n\n  * Total non-performing assets decreased by $7.8 million to $119.1 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $126.9 million as of June 30, 2024. Total nonaccrual loans held for investment decreased by $6.9 million to $89.3 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $96.2 million as of June 30, 2024. \n\n\n\nThe decrease in non-performing assets was driven by: \n\n- A $9.6 million decrease in nonaccrual commercial and construction loans, mainly associated with the sale of an $8.2 million nonaccrual C&I loan in the Puerto Rico region. The sale resulted in a $1.2 million charge-off that had been previously reserved. \n\n- A $2.3 million decrease in the OREO portfolio balance, mainly attributable to the sale of residential properties in the Puerto Rico region. \n\nPartially offset by: \n\n- A $2.5 million increase in nonaccrual consumer loans, consisting mainly of auto loans. \n\n- A $1.3 million increase in other repossessed property, consisting of repossessed automobiles. \n\n- A $0.3 million increase in nonaccrual residential mortgage loans. \n\n  * Inflows to nonaccrual loans held for investment were $38.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $5.3 million, when compared to the second quarter of 2024. Inflows to nonaccrual commercial and construction loans were $1.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $17.1 million when compared to the second quarter of 2024, related to the inflow in the second quarter of a $16.5 million commercial relationship in the Puerto Rico region. Inflows to nonaccrual consumer loans were $33.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $10.5 million compared to inflows of $22.5 million in the second quarter of 2024. Inflows to nonaccrual residential mortgage loans were $4.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.3 million compared to inflows of $3.4 million in the second quarter of 2024. See _Early Delinquency_ below for additional information. \n\n\n  * Adversely classified commercial and construction loans decreased by $9.1 million to $77.7 million as of September 30, 2024, also driven by the sale and charge-off of the aforementioned nonaccrual C&I loan. \n\n\n\n**Early Delinquency**\n\nTotal loans held for investment in early delinquency (i.e., 30-89 days past due accruing loans, as defined in regulatory reporting instructions) amounted to $143.4 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of $4.0 million, compared to $147.4 million as of June 30, 2024. The variances by major portfolio are as follows: \n\n  * Consumer loans in early delinquency decreased by $7.9 million to $103.9 million, mainly in the auto loans and finance leases portfolios. \n\n\n  * Residential mortgage loans in early delinquency decreased by $0.4 million to $31.9 million. \n\n\n\nPartially offset by: \n\n  * Commercial and construction loans in early delinquency increased by $4.3 million to $7.6 million, mainly due to a C&I loan in the Florida region that matured and is in the process of renewal but for which the Corporation continued to receive interest and principal payments from the borrower. \n\n\n\n**Allowance for Credit Losses**\n\nThe following table summarizes the activity of the ACL for on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures during the third and second quarters of 2024: \n\n**Quarter Ended September 30, 2024**  \n---  \n**Loans and Finance Leases** |  **Debt Securities**  \n(Dollars in thousands)  |  **Residential Mortgage Loans** |  **Commercial and Construction Loans** |  **Consumer Loans and Finance Leases** |  **Total Loans and Finance Leases** |  **Unfunded Loans Commitments** |  **Held-to Maturity** |  **Available- for-Sale** |  **Total ACL**  \n**Allowance for Credit Losses**  \nAllowance for credit losses, beginning balance  |  $  |  46,051  |  $  |  70,172  |  $  |  138,309  |  $  |  254,532  |  $  |  4,502  |  $  |  1,267  |  $  |  549  |  $  |  260,850   \nProvision for credit losses - (benefit) expense  |  (5,476  |  )  |  (6,435  |  )  |  28,381  |  16,470  |  (1,041  |  )  |  (148  |  )  |  (36  |  )  |  15,245   \nNet recoveries (charge-offs)  |  76  |  (1,088  |  )  |  (22,994  |  )  |  (24,006  |  )  |  -  |  -  |  13  |  (23,993  |  )   \nAllowance for credit losses, end of period  |  $  |  40,651  |  $  |  62,649  |  $  |  143,696  |  $  |  246,996  |  $  |  3,461  |  $  |  1,119  |  $  |  526  |  $  |  252,102   \nAmortized cost of loans and finance leases  |  $  |  2,820,147  |  $  |  5,884,535  |  $  |  3,741,342  |  $  |  12,446,024   \nAllowance for credit losses on loans to amortized cost  |  1.44  |  %  |  1.06  |  %  |  3.84  |  %  |  1.98  |  %   \n**Quarter Ended June 30, 2024**  \n**Loans and Finance Leases** |  **Debt Securities**  \n(Dollars in thousands)  |  **Residential Mortgage Loans** |  **Commercial and Construction Loans** |  **Consumer Loans and Finance Leases** |  **Total Loans and Finance Leases** |  **Unfunded Loans Commitments** |  **Held-to- Maturity** |  **Available- for-Sale** |  **Total ACL**  \n**Allowance for Credit Losses**  \nAllowance for credit losses, beginning balance  |  $  |  56,689  |  $  |  73,337  |  $  |  133,566  |  $  |  263,592  |  $  |  4,919  |  $  |  1,235  |  $  |  442  |  $  |  270,188   \nProvision for credit losses - (benefit) expense  |  (10,593  |  )  |  (4,198  |  )  |  26,721  |  11,930  |  (417  |  )  |  32  |  60  |  11,605   \nNet (charge-offs) recoveries  |  (45  |  )  |  1,033  |  (21,978  |  )  |  (20,990  |  )  |  -  |  -  |  47  |  (20,943  |  )   \nAllowance for credit losses, end of period  |  $  |  46,051  |  $  |  70,172  |  $  |  138,309  |  $  |  254,532  |  $  |  4,502  |  $  |  1,267  |  $  |  549  |  $  |  260,850   \nAmortized cost of loans and finance leases  |  $  |  2,809,666  |  $  |  5,863,843  |  $  |  3,711,999  |  $  |  12,385,508   \nAllowance for credit losses on loans to amortized cost  |  1.64  |  %  |  1.20  |  %  |  3.73  |  %  |  2.06  |  %   \n  \n_Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans and Finance Leases_\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the ACL for loans and finance leases was $247.0 million, a decrease of $7.5 million, from $254.5 million as of June 30, 2024. The decrease was mainly related to the ACL for commercial and construction loans, which decreased by $7.5 million, mainly due to releases associated with the improved financial condition of certain commercial borrowers and the improvement in the forecasted CRE price index, as well as the effect of the aforementioned $1.2 million charge-off recorded on the sale of a nonaccrual C&I loan that had been previously reserved. The ACL for residential mortgage loans decreased by $5.4 million, driven by updated macroeconomic variables, mainly in the long-term projection of the unemployment rate in the Puerto Rico region. Meanwhile, the ACL for consumer loans increased by $5.4 million, driven by higher charge-off levels and loan portfolio growth. \n\nThe provision for credit losses on loans and finance leases was $16.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $11.9 million in the second quarter of 2024, as detailed below: \n\n  * Provision for credit losses for the residential mortgage loan portfolio was a net benefit of $5.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a net benefit of $10.6 million for the second quarter of 2024. The net benefit recorded during the third quarter of 2024 was driven by the aforementioned changes in macroeconomic variables. Meanwhile, the net benefit recorded during the second quarter of 2024 was driven by updated historical loss experience used for determining the ACL estimate resulting in a downward revision of estimated loss severities and lower required reserve levels. \n\n\n  * Provision for credit losses for the consumer loan and finance lease portfolios was an expense of $28.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to an expense of $26.7 million for the second quarter of 2024. The increase in provision expense was driven by higher charge-off levels in these portfolios. \n\n\n  * Provision for credit losses for the commercial and construction loan portfolios was a net benefit of $6.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a net benefit of $4.2 million for the second quarter of 2024. The increase in net benefit during the third quarter of 2024 was driven by the aforementioned improvement in the financial condition of certain commercial borrowers, and, to a lesser extent, an improvement in the forecasted CRE price index. \n\n\n\nThe ratio of the ACL for loans and finance leases to total loans held for investment was 1.98% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 2.06% as of June 30, 2024. The ratio of the total ACL for loans and finance leases to nonaccrual loans held for investment was 276.46% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 264.66% as of June 30, 2024. \n\n_Net Charge-Offs_\n\nThe following table presents ratios of annualized net (recoveries) charge-offs to average loans held-in-portfolio for the last five quarters: \n\n**Quarter Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **March 31, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023** |  **September 30, 2023**  \nResidential mortgage  |  -0.01%  |  0.01%  |  0.03%  |  -0.04%  |  -0.01%   \nConstruction  |  -0.02%  |  -0.02%  |  -0.02%  |  0.01%  |  -3.18%   \nCommercial mortgage  |  -0.01%  |  -0.07%  |  -0.01%  |  0.09%  |  -0.01%   \nCommercial and Industrial  |  0.14%  |  -0.08%  |  -0.59%  |  0.00%  |  -0.02%   \nConsumer loans and finance leases  |  2.47%  |  2.38%  |  1.70%  |  (1) |  2.26%  |  1.79%   \nTotal loans  |  0.78%  |  0.69%  |  0.37%  |  (1) |  0.69%  |  0.48%   \n(1)  |  The $9.5 million recovery associated with the bulk sale of fully charged-off consumer loans during the first quarter of 2024 reduced the consumer loans and finance leases and total net charge-offs to related average loans ratio for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 by 104 basis points and 31 basis points, respectively.   \n  \nThe ratios above are based on annualized net charge-offs and are not necessarily indicative of the results expected in subsequent periods. \n\nNet charge-offs were $24.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, or an annualized 0.78% of average loans, compared to $21.0 million, or an annualized 0.69% of average loans, in the second quarter of 2024. The $3.0 million increase in net charge-offs was driven by the aforementioned $1.2 million charge-off recorded on the sale of a nonaccrual C&I loan in the third quarter of 2024; $1.2 million in recoveries recorded on two commercial loans in the Florida region during the second quarter of 2024; and a $1.0 million increase in net charge-offs in consumer loans and finance leases. \n\n_Allowance for Credit Losses for Unfunded Loan Commitments_\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the ACL for off-balance sheet credit exposures decreased to $3.5 million, compared to $4.5 million as of June 30, 2024, driven by an improvement on the economic outlook of certain macroeconomic variables, particularly in variables associated with the CRE price index. \n\n_Allowance for Credit Losses for Debt Securities_\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the ACL for debt securities was $1.6 million, of which $1.1 million related to Puerto Rico municipal bonds classified as held-to-maturity, compared to $1.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2024. \n\n**STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION**\n\nTotal assets were approximately $18.9 billion as of September 30, 2024, down $22.2 million from June 30, 2024. \n\nThe following variances within the main components of total assets are noted: \n\n  * A $99.1 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, mainly related to net cash inflows from the investment securities portfolio, partially offset by repayments of brokered CDs, the redemption of $50.0 million in outstanding trust-preferred securities (“TruPS”) and loan growth funding. The redemption of TruPS was aligned with the Corporation’s plan for optimization of its capital structure while reducing financing costs. \n\n\n  * An $82.3 million decrease in investment securities, driven by maturities of $140.8 million and principal repayments of $117.3 million, which include repayments of $101.7 million of U.S. agencies MBS and debentures and $15.6 million of municipal bonds, partially offset by a $160.1 million increase in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities attributable to changes in market interest rates and $16.1 million in purchases of Community Reinvestment Act qualified debt securities during the third quarter of 2024. \n\n\n  * A $62.8 million increase in total loans. The growth consisted of increases of $65.3 million in the Puerto Rico region and $47.5 million in the Florida region, partially offset by a $50.0 million decrease in the Virgin Islands region. On a portfolio basis, the variance consisted of increases of $29.4 million in consumer loans, primarily auto loans and finance leases in the Puerto Rico region, $20.7 million in commercial and construction loans, and $12.7 million in residential mortgage loans. The increase in commercial and construction loans was mainly related to growth in the Florida and Puerto Rico regions of approximately $40.8 million and $29.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $49.2 million decrease in the Virgin Islands region. The increase is net of multiple repayments, including a $54.8 million repayment of a government line of credit in the Virgin Islands region, a $36.3 million repayment of a commercial loan in the Puerto Rico region, and $31.0 million in repayments prior to maturity of three commercial loans in the Florida region. \n\n\n\nTotal loan originations, including refinancings, renewals, and draws from existing commitments (excluding credit card utilization activity), amounted to $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $43.1 million compared to the second quarter of 2024. \n\nTotal loan originations in the Puerto Rico region amounted to $902.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $840.5 million in the second quarter of 2024. The $61.7 million increase in total loan originations was mainly in commercial and construction loans, driven by five C&I originations totaling $107.1 million, each in excess of $10 million, partially offset by decreases in commercial mortgage and construction loan originations. \n\nTotal loan originations in the Virgin Islands region amounted to $34.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $20.8 million in the second quarter of 2024. The $13.9 million increase in total loan originations was mainly in commercial and construction loans. \n\nTotal loan originations in the Florida region amounted to $248.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $280.9 million in the second quarter of 2024. The $32.5 million decline in total loan originations consisted of decreases of $23.0 million in commercial and construction loans, mainly in C&I loans; $7.0 million in residential mortgage loans; and $2.5 million in consumer loans. \n\n  * An $87.3 million decrease in other assets, in part due to the settlement in the third quarter of 2024 of certain receivables associated with amounts in transit related to customer payments and prepaid assets. \n\n\n\nTotal liabilities were approximately $17.2 billion as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of $231.6 million from June 30, 2024. \n\n  * Total deposits decreased $181.6 million consisting of: \n\n\n  * A $104.7 million decrease in brokered CDs, mainly in the Puerto Rico region. The decline reflects maturing short-term brokered CDs amounting to $170.2 million with an all-in cost of 5.38% that were paid off during the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by $65.5 million of new issuances with original average maturities of approximately 1 year and an all-in cost of 4.86%. \n\n\n  * A $40.1 million decrease in government deposits, which includes a decline of $47.9 million in the Virgin Islands region, partially offset by increases of $7.6 million in the Puerto Rico region and $0.2 million in the Florida region. \n\n\n  * A $36.8 million decrease in deposits, excluding brokered CDs and government deposits, reflecting decreases of $51.0 million in the Virgin Islands region and $31.5 million in the Puerto Rico region, partially offset by a $45.7 million increase in the Florida region. The decrease in such deposits includes a $96.9 million decrease in non-interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a $35.9 million increase in time deposits. \n\n\n  * A $50.0 million decrease in other borrowings related to the aforementioned redemption of outstanding TruPS issued by FBP Statutory Trust II. \n\n\n\nTotal stockholders’ equity amounted to $1.7 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $209.4 million from June 30, 2024, driven by a $160.1 million increase in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities due to changes in market interest rates recognized as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss and the net income generated in the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by $26.3 million in common stock dividends declared in the third quarter of 2024. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, capital ratios exceeded the required regulatory levels for bank holding companies and well-capitalized banks. The Corporation’s estimated CET1 capital, tier 1 capital, total capital and leverage ratios under the Basel III rules were 16.18%, 16.18%, 18.25%, and 10.96%, respectively, as of September 30, 2024, compared to CET1 capital, tier 1 capital, total capital, and leverage ratios of 15.77%, 15.77%, 18.21%, and 10.63%, respectively, as of June 30, 2024. \n\nMeanwhile, estimated CET1 capital, tier 1 capital, total capital and leverage ratios of our banking subsidiary, FirstBank, were 16.00%, 16.76%, 18.01%, and 11.36%, respectively, as of September 30, 2024, compared to CET1 capital, tier 1 capital, total capital and leverage ratios of 15.97%, 16.73%, 17.98%, and 11.29%, respectively, as of June 30, 2024. \n\n**LIQUIDITY**\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased by $99.1 million to $685.4 million as of September 30, 2024. When adding $1.8 billion of free high-quality liquid securities that could be liquidated or pledged within one day, total core liquidity amounted to $2.5 billion as of September 30, 2024, or 13.32% of total assets, compared to $2.5 billion, or 13.37% of total assets as of June 30, 2024. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had $964.7 million available for credit with the FHLB based on the value of collateral pledged with the FHLB. As such, the basic liquidity ratio (which includes cash, free high-quality liquid assets such as U.S. government and government-sponsored enterprises’ obligations that could be liquidated or pledged within one day, and available secured lines of credit with the FHLB to total assets) was approximately 18.43% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 18.50% as of June 30, 2024. \n\nIn addition to the aforementioned available credit from the FHLB, the Corporation also maintains borrowing capacity at the FED Discount Window Program. The Corporation had approximately $2.6 billion available for funding under the FED’s Borrower-In-Custody Program as of September 30, 2024. In the aggregate, as of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had $6.1 billion, or 131% of estimated uninsured deposits (excluding fully collateralized government deposits), available to meet liquidity needs. \n\nThe Corporation’s total deposits, excluding brokered CDs, amounted to $15.8 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to $15.9 billion as of June 30, 2024, which includes $3.2 billion in government deposits that are fully collateralized as of each of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. Excluding fully collateralized government deposits and FDIC-insured deposits, as of September 30, 2024, the estimated amount of uninsured deposits was $4.6 billion, which represents 29.25% of total deposits, compared to $4.5 billion, or 28.46% of total deposits, as of June 30, 2024. Refer to Table 11 in the accompanying tables (Exhibit A) for additional information about the deposits composition. \n\n**Tangible Common Equity (Non-GAAP)**\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, the Corporation’s tangible common equity ratio increased to 8.79% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 7.66% as of June 30, 2024, driven by the $160.1 million increase in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities. Refer to _Non-GAAP Disclosures- Non-GAAP Financial Measures_ for the definition of and additional information about this non-GAAP financial measure. \n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the Corporation’s tangible common equity and tangible assets to the most comparable GAAP items as of the indicated dates: \n\n**September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **March 31, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n(In thousands, except ratios and per share information)   \n**Tangible Equity:**  \nTotal common equity - GAAP  |  $  |  1,700,885  |  $  |  1,491,460  |  $  |  1,479,717  |  $  |  1,497,609  |  $  |  1,303,068   \nGoodwill  |  (38,611  |  )  |  (38,611  |  )  |  (38,611  |  )  |  (38,611  |  )  |  (38,611  |  )   \nOther intangible assets  |  (8,260  |  )  |  (9,700  |  )  |  (11,542  |  )  |  (13,383  |  )  |  (15,229  |  )   \n**Tangible common equity - non-GAAP** |  **$** |  **1,654,014** |  **$** |  **1,443,149** |  **$** |  **1,429,564** |  **$** |  **1,445,615** |  **$** |  **1,249,228**  \n**Tangible Assets:**  \nTotal assets - GAAP  |  $  |  18,859,170  |  $  |  18,881,374  |  $  |  18,890,961  |  $  |  18,909,549  |  $  |  18,594,608   \nGoodwill  |  (38,611  |  )  |  (38,611  |  )  |  (38,611  |  )  |  (38,611  |  )  |  (38,611  |  )   \nOther intangible assets  |  (8,260  |  )  |  (9,700  |  )  |  (11,542  |  )  |  (13,383  |  )  |  (15,229  |  )   \n**Tangible assets - non-GAAP** |  **$** |  **18,812,299** |  **$** |  **18,833,063** |  **$** |  **18,840,808** |  **$** |  **18,857,555** |  **$** |  **18,540,768**  \n**Common shares outstanding** |  **163,876** |  **163,865** |  **166,707** |  **169,303** |  **174,386**  \n**Tangible common equity ratio - non-GAAP** |  **8.79** |  **%** |  **7.66** |  **%** |  **7.59** |  **%** |  **7.67** |  **%** |  **6.74** |  **%**  \n**Tangible book value per common share - non-GAAP** |  $  |  **10.09** |  $  |  **8.81** |  $  |  **8.58** |  $  |  **8.54** |  $  |  **7.16**  \n  \n**Exposure to Puerto Rico Government**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had $309.0 million of direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government, its municipalities, and public corporations, a decrease of $7.7 million when compared to $316.7 million as of June 30, 2024, mainly due to multiple repayments. As of September 30, 2024, approximately $195.6 million of the exposure consisted of loans and obligations of municipalities in Puerto Rico that are supported by assigned property tax revenues and for which, in most cases, the good faith, credit, and unlimited taxing power of the applicable municipality have been pledged to their repayment, and $50.9 million consisted of loans and obligations which are supported by one or more specific sources of municipal revenues. The Corporation’s total direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government also included $8.8 million in a loan extended to an affiliate of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority and $50.7 million in loans to agencies of Puerto Rico public corporations. In addition, the total direct exposure included an obligation of the Puerto Rico government, specifically a residential pass-through MBS issued by the PRHFA, at an amortized cost of $3.0 million (fair value of $1.6 million as of September 30, 2024), included as part of the Corporation’s available-for-sale debt securities portfolio. This residential pass-through MBS issued by the PRHFA is collateralized by certain second mortgages and had an unrealized loss of $1.4 million as of September 30, 2024, of which $0.3 million is due to credit deterioration. \n\nThe aforementioned exposure to municipalities in Puerto Rico included $92.1 million of financing arrangements with Puerto Rico municipalities that were issued in bond form but underwritten as loans with features that are typically found in commercial loans. These bonds are accounted for as held-to-maturity debt securities. \n\nAs of each of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Corporation had $2.7 billion of public sector deposits in Puerto Rico. Approximately 22% of the public sector deposits as of September 30, 2024 were from municipalities and municipal agencies in Puerto Rico, and 78% were from public corporations, the Puerto Rico central government and agencies, and U.S. federal government agencies in Puerto Rico. \n\n**NON-GAAP DISCLOSURES**\n\nThis press release contains GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are used when management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures enhances the ability of analysts and investors to analyze trends in the Corporation’s business and understand the performance of the Corporation. The Corporation may utilize these non-GAAP financial measures as guides in its budgeting and long-term planning process. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in the text or in the tables in or attached to this press release. Any analysis of these non-GAAP financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. \n\nCertain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision income, and adjusted non-interest expenses exclude the effect of items that management believes are not reflective of core operating performance (the “Special Items”). Other non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net interest income and adjusted net interest income margin, tangible common equity, tangible book value per common share, and certain capital ratios. These measures should be read in conjunction with the accompanying tables (Exhibit A), which are an integral part of this press release, and the Corporation’s other financial information that is presented in accordance with GAAP. \n\n**Special Items**\n\nThe financial results for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included the following Special Items: \n\nQuarter Ended June 30, 2024 and Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2024\n\n_FDIC Special Assessment Expense_\n\nCharges of $0.2 million ($0.1 million after-tax, calculated based on the statutory tax rate of 37.5%) and $1.1 million ($0.7 million after-tax, calculated based on the statutory tax rate of 37.5%) were recorded in the second quarter of 2024 and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, respectively, to increase the initial estimated FDIC special assessment resulting from the FDIC’s updates related to the loss estimate in connection with losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund associated with protecting uninsured deposits following the failures of certain financial institutions during the first half of 2023. The aforementioned charges increased the estimated FDIC special assessment to a total of $7.4 million, which was the revised estimated loss reflected in the FDIC invoice for the first quarterly collection period with a payment date of June 28, 2024. The FDIC deposit special assessment is reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of income as part of “FDIC deposit insurance” expenses. \n\nNine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2023\n\n_Gain Recognized from Legal Settlement_\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Corporation recognized a $3.6 million ($2.3 million after-tax, calculated based on the statutory tax rate of 37.5%) gain from a legal settlement reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of income as part of other non-interest income. \n\n_Gain on Early Extinguishment of Debt_\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Corporation recognized a $1.6 million gain on the repurchase of $21.4 million in junior subordinated debentures reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of income as “Gain on early extinguishment of debt.” The junior subordinated debentures are reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as “Other borrowings.” The purchase price equated to 92.5% of the $21.4 million par value. The 7.5% discount resulted in the gain of $1.6 million. The gain, realized at the holding company level, had no effect on the income tax expense in the second quarter of 2023. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\n_Adjusted Pre-Tax, Pre-Provision Income_\n\nAdjusted pre-tax, pre-provision income is a non-GAAP performance metric that management uses and believes that investors may find useful in analyzing underlying performance trends, particularly in times of economic stress, including as a result of natural catastrophes or health epidemics. Adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision income, as defined by management, represents income before income taxes adjusted to exclude the provisions for credit losses on loans, unfunded loan commitments and debt securities. In addition, from time to time, earnings are also adjusted for certain items that management believes are not reflective of core operating performance, which are regarded as Special Items. \n\n_Tangible Common Equity Ratio and Tangible Book Value per Common Share_\n\nThe tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are generally used by the financial community to evaluate capital adequacy. Tangible common equity is total common equity less goodwill and other intangible assets. Tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets. Tangible common equity ratio is tangible common equity divided by tangible assets. Tangible book value per common share is tangible assets divided by common shares outstanding. Refer to _Statement of Financial Condition - Tangible Common Equity (Non-GAAP)_ for a reconciliation of the Corporation’s total stockholders’ equity and total assets in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures of tangible common equity and tangible assets, respectively. Management uses and believes that many stock analysts use the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share in conjunction with other more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, typically stemming from the use of the purchase method of accounting for mergers and acquisitions. Accordingly, the Corporation believes that disclosure of these financial measures may be useful to investors. Neither tangible common equity nor tangible assets, or the related measures, should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders’ equity, total assets, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which the Corporation calculates its tangible common equity, tangible assets, and any other related measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. \n\n_Net Interest Income Excluding Valuations, and on a Tax-Equivalent Basis_\n\nNet interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin are reported excluding the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and on a tax-equivalent basis in order to provide to investors additional information about the Corporation’s net interest income that management uses and believes should facilitate comparability and analysis of the periods presented. The changes in the fair value of derivative instruments have no effect on interest due or interest earned on interest-bearing liabilities or interest-earning assets, respectively. The tax-equivalent adjustment to net interest income recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets and assumes a marginal income tax rate. Income from tax-exempt earning assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. Refer to Table 4 in the accompanying tables (Exhibit A) for a reconciliation of the Corporation’s net interest income to adjusted net interest income excluding valuations, and on a tax-equivalent basis. Management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt securities and tax-exempt loans, on a common basis that management believes facilitates comparison of results to the results of peers. \n\n**NET INCOME AND RECONCILIATION TO ADJUSTED NET INCOME (NON-GAAP)**\n\nThe following table shows, for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, net income and earnings per diluted share, and reconciles, for the second quarter of 2024 and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net income to adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share, which are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the significant Special Items discussed in the _Non-GAAP Disclosures - Special Items_ section. \n\n**Quarter Ended** |  **Nine-Month Period Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023** |  **September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n(In thousands, except per share information)   \nNet income, as reported (GAAP)  |  $  |  73,727  |  $  |  75,838  |  $  |  82,022  |  $  |  223,023  |  $  |  223,375   \nAdjustments:   \nFDIC special assessment expense  |  -  |  152  |  -  |  1,099  |  -   \nGain recognized from legal settlement  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  (3,600  |  )   \nGain on early extinguishment of debt  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  (1,605  |  )   \nIncome tax impact of adjustments (1) |  -  |  (57  |  )  |  -  |  (412  |  )  |  1,350   \nAdjusted net income attributable to common stockholders (non-GAAP)  |  $  |  73,727  |  $  |  75,933  |  $  |  82,022  |  $  |  223,710  |  $  |  219,520   \nWeighted-average diluted shares outstanding  |  163,872  |  165,543  |  176,962  |  165,730  |  179,144   \nEarnings Per Share - diluted (GAAP)  |  $  |  0.45  |  $  |  0.46  |  $  |  0.46  |  $  |  1.35  |  $  |  1.25   \nAdjusted Earnings Per Share - diluted (non-GAAP)  |  $  |  0.45  |  $  |  0.46  |  $  |  0.46  |  $  |  1.35  |  $  |  1.23   \n(1) See _Non-GAAP Disclosures - Special Items_ above for discussion of the individual tax impact related to the above adjustments.   \n  \n**INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES AND RECONCILIATION TO ADJUSTED PRE-TAX, PRE-PROVISION INCOME (NON-GAAP)**\n\nThe following table reconciles income before income taxes to adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision income for the last five quarters and for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: \n\n**Quarter Ended** |  **Nine-Month Period Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **March 31, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023** |  **September 30, 2023** |  **September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n(Dollars in thousands)   \nIncome before income taxes  |  $  |  96,386  |  $  |  101,379  |  $  |  97,413  |  $  |  84,874  |  $  |  108,990  |  $  |  295,178  |  $  |  312,562   \nAdd: Provision for credit losses expense  |  15,245  |  11,605  |  12,167  |  18,812  |  4,396  |  39,017  |  42,128   \nAdd: FDIC special assessment expense  |  -  |  152  |  947  |  6,311  |  -  |  1,099  |  -   \nLess: Gain recognized from legal settlement  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  (3,600  |  )   \nLess: Gain on early extinguishment of debt  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  (1,605  |  )   \nAdjusted pre-tax, pre-provision income (1) |  $  |  111,631  |  $  |  113,136  |  $  |  110,527  |  $  |  109,997  |  $  |  113,386  |  $  |  335,294  |  $  |  349,485   \nChange from most recent prior period (amount)  |  $  |  (1,505  |  )  |  $  |  2,609  |  $  |  530  |  $  |  (3,389  |  )  |  $  |  (4,578  |  )  |  $  |  (14,191  |  )  |  $  |  (3,553  |  )   \nChange from most recent prior period (percentage)  |  -1.3  |  %  |  2.4  |  %  |  0.5  |  %  |  -3.0  |  %  |  -3.9  |  %  |  -4.1  |  %  |  -1.0  |  %   \n(1)  |  Non-GAAP financial measure.

The words or phrases “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “should,” “would,” “will,” “plans,” “forecast,” “believe,” and similar expressions are meant to identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the safe harbor created by such sections. The Corporation cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof, and advises readers that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, estimates, and assumptions by us that are difficult to predict. Various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the uncertainties more fully discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of the Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as updated in the Corporation’s subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and the following, could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such forward-looking statements: the effect of the current global interest rate environment (including the potential for ongoing reductions in interest rates) and inflation levels on the level, composition and performance of the Corporation’s assets and liabilities, and corresponding effects on the Corporation’s net interest income, net interest margin, loan originations, deposit attrition, overall results of operations, and liquidity position; the effects of changes in the interest rate environment, including any adverse change in the Corporation’s ability to attract and retain clients and gain acceptance from current and prospective customers for new products and services, including those related to the offering of digital banking and financial services; volatility in the financial services industry, including failures or rumored failures of other depository institutions, and actions taken by governmental agencies to stabilize the financial system, which could result in, among other things, bank deposit runoffs, liquidity constraints, and increased regulatory requirements and costs; the effect of continued changes in the fiscal and monetary policies and regulations of the U.S. federal government, the Puerto Rico government and other governments, including those determined by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the FDIC, government-sponsored housing agencies and regulators in Puerto Rico, the U.S., and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, that may affect the future results of the Corporation; uncertainty as to the ability of FirstBank to retain its core deposits and generate sufficient cash flow through its wholesale funding sources, such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase, FHLB advances, and brokered CDs, which may require us to sell investment securities at a loss; adverse changes in general political and economic conditions in Puerto Rico, the U.S., and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, including in the interest rate environment, unemployment rates, market liquidity, housing absorption rates, real estate markets, and U.S. capital markets, which may affect funding sources, loan portfolio performance and credit quality, market prices of investment securities, and demand for the Corporation’s products and services, and which may reduce the Corporation’s revenues and earnings and the value of the Corporation’s assets; the impact of government financial assistance for hurricane recovery and other disaster relief on economic activity in Puerto Rico, and the timing and pace of disbursements of funds earmarked for disaster relief; the ability of the Corporation, FirstBank, and third-party service providers to identify and prevent cyber-security incidents, such as data security breaches, ransomware, malware, “denial of service” attacks, “hacking,” identity theft, and state-sponsored cyberthreats, and the occurrence of and response to any incidents that occur, which may result in misuse or misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, disruption, or damage to our systems or those of third-party service providers on which we rely, increased costs and losses and/or adverse effects to our reputation; general competitive factors and other market risks as well as the implementation of existent or planned strategic growth opportunities, including risks, uncertainties, and other factors or events related to any business acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, strategic operational investments, including systems conversions, and any anticipated efficiencies or other expected results related thereto; uncertainty as to the implementation of the debt restructuring plan of Puerto Rico and the fiscal plan for Puerto Rico as certified on June 5, 2024, by the oversight board established by the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act, or any revisions to it, on our clients and loan portfolios, and any potential impact from future economic or political developments and tax regulations in Puerto Rico; the impact of changes in accounting standards, or determinations and assumptions in applying those standards, and of forecasts of economic variables considered for the determination of the ACL; the ability of FirstBank to realize the benefits of its net deferred tax assets; the ability of FirstBank to generate sufficient cash flow to pay dividends to the Corporation; environmental, social, and governance matters, including our climate-related initiatives and commitments; the impacts of natural or man-made disasters, the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies, geopolitical conflicts (including sanctions, war or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East, and the possible expansion of such conflicts in surrounding areas and potential geopolitical consequences), terrorist attacks, or other catastrophic external events, including impacts of such events on general economic conditions and on the Corporation’s assumptions regarding forecasts of economic variables; the risk that additional portions of the unrealized losses in the Corporation’s debt securities portfolio are determined to be credit-related, resulting in additional charges to the provision for credit losses on the Corporation’s debt securities portfolio, and the potential for additional credit losses that could emerge from the downgrade of the U.S.’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating to ‘AA+’ from ‘AAA’ in August 2023 and subsequent negative ratings outlooks; the impacts of applicable legislative, tax, or regulatory changes or changes in legislative, tax, or regulatory priorities, potential government shutdowns, and political impasses, including uncertainties regarding the U.S. debt ceiling and federal budget, as well as of the 2024 U.S. and Puerto Rico general election, on the Corporation’s financial condition or performance; the risk of possible failure or circumvention of the Corporation’s internal controls and procedures and the risk that the Corporation’s risk management policies may not be adequate; the risk that the FDIC may further increase the deposit insurance premium and/or require further special assessments, causing an additional increase in the Corporation’s non-interest expenses; any need to recognize impairments on the Corporation’s financial instruments, goodwill, and other intangible assets; the risk that the impact of the occurrence of any of these uncertainties on the Corporation’s capital would preclude further growth of FirstBank and preclude the Corporation’s Board of Directors from declaring dividends; and uncertainty as to whether FirstBank will be able to continue to satisfy its regulators regarding, among other things, its asset quality, liquidity plans, maintenance of capital levels, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and related requirements. The Corporation does not undertake to, and specifically disclaims any obligation to update any “forward-looking statements” to reflect occurrences or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements, except as required by the federal securities laws. \n\n**About First BanCorp.**\n\nFirst BanCorp. is the parent corporation of FirstBank Puerto Rico, a state-chartered commercial bank with operations in Puerto Rico, the U.S., and the British Virgin Islands and Florida, and of FirstBank Insurance Agency.

These loans will continue to be excluded from nonaccrual loan statistics as long as the Corporation can reasonably estimate the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected on the loan pools. The portion of such loans contractually past due 90 days or more amounted to $6.5 million as of September 30, 2024 (June 30, 2024 - $7.4 million; December 31, 2023 - $8.3 million).   \n(3)  |  These include rebooked loans, which were previously pooled into GNMA securities, amounting to $6.6 million as of September 30, 2024 (June 30, 2024 - $6.8 million; December 31, 2023 - $7.9 million). Under the GNMA program, the Corporation has the option but not the obligation to repurchase loans that meet GNMA's specified delinquency criteria. For accounting purposes, the loans subject to the repurchase option are required to be reflected on the financial statements with an offsetting liability.   \n  \n**Table 9 – Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Finance Leases**\n\n**Quarter Ended** |  **Nine-Month Period Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30,** |  **June 30,** |  **September 30,** |  **September 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n(Dollars in thousands)   \nAllowance for credit losses on loans and finance leases, beginning of period  |  $  |  254,532  |  $  |  263,592  |  $  |  267,058  |  $  |  261,843  |  $  |  260,464   \nImpact of adoption of ASU 2022-02  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  2,116   \nProvision for credit losses on loans and finance leases expense  |  16,470  |  11,930  |  10,643  |  41,317  |  47,669   \nNet recoveries (charge-offs) of loans and finance leases:   \nResidential mortgage  |  76  |  (45  |  )  |  35  |  (213  |  )  |  (840  |  )   \nConstruction  |  11  |  14  |  1,459  |  35  |  1,893   \nCommercial mortgage  |  41  |  393  |  74  |  474  |  192   \nCommercial and Industrial  |  (1,140  |  )  |  626  |  152  |  4,146  |  (6,094  |  )   \nConsumer loans and finance leases  |  (22,994  |  )  |  (21,978  |  )  |  (15,806  |  )  |  (60,606  |  )  |  (1) |  (41,785  |  )   \nNet charge-offs  |  (24,006  |  )  |  (20,990  |  )  |  (14,086  |  )  |  (56,164  |  )  |  (1) |  (46,634  |  )   \nAllowance for credit losses on loans and finance leases, end of period  |  $  |  246,996  |  $  |  254,532  |  $  |  263,615  |  $  |  246,996  |  $  |  263,615   \nAllowance for credit losses on loans and finance leases to period end total loans held for investment  |  1.98  |  %  |  2.06  |  %  |  2.21  |  %  |  1.98  |  %  |  2.21  |  %   \nNet charge-offs (annualized) to average loans outstanding during the period  |  0.78  |  %  |  0.69  |  %  |  0.48  |  %  |  0.61  |  %  |  0.54  |  %   \nProvision for credit losses on loans and finance leases to net charge-offs during the period  |  0.69x  |  0.57x  |  0.76x  |  0.74x  |  1.02x   \n(1)  |  For the nine-month period ended September 30 2024, includes a recovery totaling $10.0 million associated with the aforementioned bulk sale of fully charged-off consumer loans and finance leases.   \n  \n**Table 10 – Annualized Net (Recoveries) Charge-Offs to Average Loans**\n\n**Quarter Ended** |  **Nine-Month Period Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023** |  **September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023**  \nResidential mortgage  |  -0.01%  |  0.01%  |  -0.01%  |  0.01%  |  0.04%   \nConstruction  |  -0.02%  |  -0.02%  |  -3.18%  |  -0.02%  |  -1.58%   \nCommercial mortgage  |  -0.01%  |  -0.07%  |  -0.01%  |  -0.03%  |  -0.01%   \nCommercial and Industrial  |  0.14%  |  -0.08%  |  -0.02%  |  -0.17%  |  0.28%   \nConsumer loans and finance leases  |  2.47%  |  2.38%  |  1.79%  |  2.19%  |  (1) |  1.61%   \nTotal loans  |  0.78%  |  0.69%  |  0.48%  |  0.61%  |  (1) |  0.54%   \n(1)  |  The $10.0 million recovery associated with the aforementioned bulk sale reduced the consumer loans and finance leases and total net charge-offs to related average loans ratio for the for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 by 36 basis points and 11 basis points, respectively.   \n  \n**Table 11 – Deposits**\n\n**As of**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n(In thousands)   \nTime deposits  |  $  |  3,067,261  |  $  |  3,037,120  |  $  |  2,833,730   \nInterest-bearing saving and checking accounts  |  7,484,348  |  7,461,003  |  7,534,800   \nNon-interest-bearing deposits  |  5,275,733  |  5,406,054  |  5,404,121   \nTotal deposits, excluding brokered CDs (1) |  15,827,342  |  15,904,177  |  15,772,651   \nBrokered CDs  |  520,048  |  624,779  |  783,334   \nTotal deposits  |  $  |  16,347,390  |  $  |  16,528,956  |  $  |  16,555,985   \nTotal deposits, excluding brokered CDs and government deposits  |  $  |  12,669,900  |  $  |  12,706,646  |  $  |  12,600,719   \n(1)  |  As of each of September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, government deposits amounted to $3.2 billion.   \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241023947356r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**First BanCorp.** Ramon Rodriguez Senior Vice President Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations ramon.rodriguez@firstbankpr.com  (787) 729-8200 Ext. 82179 \n\nSource: First BanCorp.\n\n**Multimedia Files:**\n\n[ ![Multimedia JPG file for First BanCorp.

Announces Earnings for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 – Page 3 of 28\nPartially offset by:\n• A $1.0 million decrease in interest expense on brokered CDs, primarily related to a $76.1 million reduction in the average\nbalance.\n• A $0.2 million decrease in interest expense on interest-bearing checking and saving accounts, mainly due to a decrease of\napproximately $0.4 million associated with a $99.2 million reduction in the average balance, partially offset by a $0.3 million\nincrease associated with the effect of an additional day in the third quarter of 2024. The average cost of interest-bearing\nchecking and saving accounts, excluding public sector deposits, remained relatively flat at 0.76% in the third quarter of 2024,\nwhen compared to 0.75% in the second quarter.\nNet interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 4.25%, a 3 basis points increase when compared to the second quarter of 2024,\nmostly reflecting a change in asset mix resulting from the deployment of cash flows from lower-yielding investment securities to fund\nloan growth while simultaneously repaying higher rate brokered CDs.\nNON-INTEREST INCOME\nThe following table sets forth information concerning non-interest income for the last five quarters:\nQuarter Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023\n(In thousands)\nService charges and fees on deposit accounts $ 9,684 $ 9,725 $ 9,662 $ 9,662 $ 9,552\nMortgage banking activities 3,199 3,419 2,882 2,094 2,821\nInsurance commission income 3,003 2,786 5,507 2,379 2,790\nCard and processing income 11,768 11,523 11,312 11,015 10,841\nOther non-interest income 4,848 4,585 4,620 8,459 4,292\nNon-interest income $ 32,502 $ 32,038 $ 33,983 $ 33,609 $ 30,296\nNon-interest income increased by $0.5 million to $32.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $32.0 million for the second\nquarter of 2024, mainly due to:\n• A $0.3 million increase in other non-interest income driven by $0.8 million in insurance proceeds received in the third quarter\nof 2024 related to a 2020 outstanding insurance claim, partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease related to lower realized gains\nfrom purchased income tax credits.\n• A $0.2 million increase in card and processing income, mainly in merchant-related referral fees and interchange income due to\nhigher transactional volumes.\n• A $0.2 million increase in insurance commission income.\nPartially offset by:\n• A $0.2 million decrease in revenues from mortgage banking activities driven by a lower volume of sales of residential mortgage\nloans in the secondary market.

The Corporation’s total direct exposure to the Puerto Rico\ngovernment also included $8.8 million in a loan extended to an affiliate of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority and $50.7 million\nin loans to agencies of Puerto Rico public corporations. In addition, the total direct exposure included an obligation of the Puerto Rico\ngovernment, specifically a residential pass-through MBS issued by the PRHFA, at an amortized cost of $3.0 million (fair value of $1.6\nmillion as of September 30, 2024), included as part of the Corporation’s available-for-sale debt securities portfolio.

Announces Earnings for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 – Page 13 of 28\nNON-GAAP DISCLOSURES\nThis press release contains GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are used when\nmanagement believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures enhances the ability of analysts and investors to\nanalyze trends in the Corporation’s business and understand the performance of the Corporation. The Corporation may utilize these non-\nGAAP financial measures as guides in its budgeting and long-term planning process. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used,\nthe most comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable\nGAAP financial measure, can be found in the text or in the tables in or attached to this press release. Any analysis of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP.\nCertain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision\nincome, and adjusted non-interest expenses exclude the effect of items that management believes are not reflective of core operating\nperformance (the “Special Items”). Other non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net interest income and adjusted net interest\nincome margin, tangible common equity, tangible book value per common share, and certain capital ratios. These measures should be\nread in conjunction with the accompanying tables (Exhibit A), which are an integral part of this press release, and the Corporation’s\nother financial information that is presented in accordance with GAAP.\nSpecial Items\nThe financial results for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included the following Special Items:\nQuarter Ended June 30, 2024 and Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2024\nFDIC Special Assessment Expense\nCharges of $0.2 million ($0.1 million after-tax, calculated based on the statutory tax rate of 37.5%) and $1.1 million ($0.7 million after-\ntax, calculated based on the statutory tax rate of 37.5%) were recorded in the second quarter of 2024 and nine-month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, to increase the initial estimated FDIC special assessment resulting from the FDIC’s updates related\nto the loss estimate in connection with losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund associated with protecting uninsured deposits following the\nfailures of certain financial institutions during the first half of 2023. The aforementioned charges increased the estimated FDIC special\nassessment to a total of $7.4 million, which was the revised estimated loss reflected in the FDIC invoice for the first quarterly collection\nperiod with a payment date of June 28, 2024. The FDIC deposit special assessment is reflected in the condensed consolidated statements\nof income as part of “FDIC deposit insurance” expenses.\nNine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2023\nGain Recognized from Legal Settlement\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Corporation recognized a $3.6 million ($2.3 million after-tax, calculated based on the statutory\ntax rate of 37.5%) gain from a legal settlement reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of income as part of other non-interest\nincome.\nGain on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Corporation recognized a $1.6 million gain on the repurchase of $21.4 million in junior\nsubordinated debentures reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of income as “Gain on early extinguishment of debt.” The\njunior subordinated debentures are reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as “Other borrowings.” The\npurchase price equated to 92.5% of the $21.4 million par value. The 7.5% discount resulted in the gain of $1.6 million. The gain, realized\nat the holding company level, had no effect on the income tax expense in the second quarter of 2023.\nFirst BanCorp. Announces Earnings for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 – Page 14 of 28\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted Pre-Tax, Pre-Provision Income\nAdjusted pre-tax, pre-provision income is a non-GAAP performance metric that management uses and believes that investors may find\nuseful in analyzing underlying performance trends, particularly in times of economic stress, including as a result of natural catastrophes\nor health epidemics. Adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision income, as defined by management, represents income before income taxes adjusted\nto exclude the provisions for credit losses on loans, unfunded loan commitments and debt securities. In addition, from time to time,\nearnings are also adjusted for certain items that management believes are not reflective of core operating performance, which are\nregarded as Special Items.\nTangible Common Equity Ratio and Tangible Book Value per Common Share\nThe tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP financial measures that management\nbelieves are generally used by the financial community to evaluate capital adequacy. Tangible common equity is total common equity\nless goodwill and other intangible assets. Tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets. Tangible common\nequity ratio is tangible common equity divided by tangible assets. Tangible book value per common share is tangible assets divided by\ncommon shares outstanding. Refer to Statement of Financial Condition - Tangible Common Equity (Non-GAAP) for a reconciliation of\nthe Corporation’s total stockholders’ equity and total assets in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures of tangible\ncommon equity and tangible assets, respectively. Management uses and believes that many stock analysts use the tangible common\nequity ratio and tangible book value per common share in conjunction with other more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the\ncapital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, typically stemming from the\nuse of the purchase method of accounting for mergers and acquisitions. Accordingly, the Corporation believes that disclosure of these\nfinancial measures may be useful to investors. Neither tangible common equity nor tangible assets, or the related measures, should be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders’ equity, total assets, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nMoreover, the manner in which the Corporation calculates its tangible common equity, tangible assets, and any other related measures\nmay differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names.\nNet Interest Income Excluding Valuations, and on a Tax-Equivalent Basis\nNet interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin are reported excluding the changes in the fair value of derivative\ninstruments and on a tax-equivalent basis in order to provide to investors additional information about the Corporation’s net interest\nincome that management uses and believes should facilitate comparability and analysis of the periods presented. The changes in the fair\nvalue of derivative instruments have no effect on interest due or interest earned on interest-bearing liabilities or interest-earning assets,\nrespectively. The tax-equivalent adjustment to net interest income recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-\nexempt assets and assumes a marginal income tax rate. Income from tax-exempt earning assets is increased by an amount equivalent to\nthe taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. Refer to Table 4 in the accompanying tables\n(Exhibit A) for a reconciliation of the Corporation’s net interest income to adjusted net interest income excluding valuations, and on a\ntax-equivalent basis. Management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income, interest\nrate spread, and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt\nsecurities and tax-exempt loans, on a common basis that management believes facilitates comparison of results to the results of peers.\nFirst BanCorp.

Non-GAAP financial measures are used when management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures enhances the ability of analysts and\ninvestors to analyze trends in the Corporation’s business and understand the performance of the Corporation. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the\nreconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in the text or in the attached tables to this earnings presentation. Any analysis of these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP.\nTangible Common Equity Ratio and Tangible Book Value per Common Share\nThe tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are generally used by the financial community to evaluate capital adequacy. Tangible\ncommon equity is total common equity less goodwill and other intangibles. Tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangibles. Management and many stock analysts use the tangible common equity ratio and\ntangible book value per common share in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets,\ntypically stemming from the use of the purchase method of accounting for mergers and acquisitions. Accordingly, the Corporation believes that disclosure of these financial measures may be useful to investors. Neither\ntangible common equity nor tangible assets, or the related measures, should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders’ equity, total assets, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nMoreover, the way the Corporation calculates its tangible common equity, tangible assets, and any other related measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names.\n(In thousands, except ratios and per share information) As of 3Q 2024 2Q 2024 1Q 2024 4Q 2023 3Q 2023\nTangible Equity:\nTotal common equity - GAAP $ 1 ,700,885 $ 1 ,491,460 $ 1 ,479,717 $ 1 ,497,609 $ 1 ,303,068\nGoodwill ( 38,611) ( 38,611) ( 38,611) ( 38,611) ( 38,611)\nOther intangible assets ( 8,260) ( 9,700) ( 11,542) ( 13,383) ( 15,229)\nTangible common equity (Non-GAAP) $ 1,654,014 $ 1,443,149 $ 1,429,564 $ 1,445,615 $ 1,249,228\nTangible Assets:\nTotal assets - GAAP $ 1 8,859,170 $ 1 8,881,374 $ 1 8,890,961 $ 1 8,909,549 $ 1 8,594,608\nGoodwill ( 38,611) ( 38,611) ( 38,611) ( 38,611) ( 38,611)\nOther intangible assets ( 8,260) ( 9,700) ( 11,542) ( 13,383) ( 15,229)\nTangible assets (Non-GAAP) $ 18,812,299 $ 18,833,063 $ 18,840,808 $ 18,857,555 $ 18,540,768\nCommon shares outstanding 1 63,876 1 63,865 1 66,707 1 69,303 1 74,386\nTangible common equity ratio (Non-GAAP) 8.79% 7.66% 7.59% 7.67% 6.74%\nTangible book value per common share (Non-GAAP) $ 10.09 $ 8.81 $ 8.58 $ 8.54 $ 7.16\n16\nTHIRD QUARTER 2024\nAppendix - Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nBasis of Presentation:\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures.

Adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision income, as defined by management, represents income before income\ntaxes adjusted to exclude the provision for credit losses expense, as well as certain items that management believes are not reflective of core operating performance.\n17\n( $ i n t h o u s a n d s )\nIn c o m e b e f o r e in c o m e t a\nA d d : P r o v is io n f o r c r e d it\nA d d : F D IC s p e c ia l a s s e s s\nA d j u s t e d p r e - t a x , p r e\nC h a n g e f r o m m o s t r e c e n\nC h a n g e f r o m m o s t r e c e n\nx e s\nlo s s e s e x\nm e n t e x p\n- p r o v is io\nt p r io r p e\nt p r io r p e\np e n s e\ne n s e\nn in c o m\nr io d ( a\nr io d ( p\nm\ne\ne\no\nr c\nu\ne\nn\nn\nt\nt\n)\na g e )\n3 Q 2 0 2 4\n$ 9 6 , 3 8\n1 5 , 2 4\n-\n$ 1 1 1 , 6 3\n$ ( 1 , 5 0\n- 1 .\n6\n5\n1\n5\n3\n)\n%\n2 Q 2 0 2 4\n$ 1 0 1 , 3\n1 1 , 6\n1\n$ 1 1 3 , 1\n$ 2 , 6\n2\n7 9\n0 5\n5 2\n3 6\n0 9\n. 4 %\n1 Q 2 0 2 4\n$ 9 7 , 4\n1 2 , 1\n9\n$ 1 1 0 , 5\n$ 5\n0\n1 3\n6 7\n4 7\n2 7\n3 0\n. 5 %\n4 Q 2 0\n$ 8\n1\n$ 1 0 9\n$ (\n2 3\n4 , 8\n8 , 8\n6 , 3\n, 9\n3 , 3\n- 3\n7\n1\n1\n9\n8\n.\n4\n2\n1\n7\n9\n0\n)\n%\n3 Q 2 0 2 3\n$ 1 0 8 , 9 9\n4 , 3 9\n-\n$ 1 1 3 , 3 8\n$ ( 4 , 5 7\n- 3 .\n0\n6\n6\n8\n9\n)\n%\nTHIRD QUARTER 2024\nAppendix - Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nBasis of Presentation:\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures.

Exhibits 133\nSIGNATURES\n2\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Form 10-Q”) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A\nof the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the “Exchange Act”), which are subject to the safe harbor created by such sections. When used in this Form 10-Q or future filings by\nFirst BanCorp. (the “Corporation,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), in the\nCorporation’s press releases or in other public or stockholder communications made by the Corporation, or in oral statements made on\nbehalf of the Corporation by, or with the approval of, an authorized executive officer of the Corporation, the words or phrases\n“would,” “intends,” “will,” “expect,” “should,” “plans,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “look forward,” “believes,” and other terms of\nsimilar meaning or import, or the negatives of these terms or variations of them, in connection with any discussion of future operating,\nfinancial or other performance are meant to identify “forward-looking statements.”\nThe Corporation cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such “forward-looking statements,” which speak only as of the\ndate made or, with respect to such forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q, the date hereof, and advises readers that\nany such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, estimates, and\nassumptions by us that are difficult to predict . Various factors, some of which are beyond our control, could cause actual results to\ndiffer materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such forward-looking statements.\nFactors that could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the Corporation’s forward-looking\nstatements include, but are not limited to, risks described or referenced in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in the Corporation’s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K”), Part II, Item 1A., “Risk\nFactors,” in the Corporation’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and the following:\n● the effect of the current global interest rate environment (including the potential for ongoing reductions in interest rates) and\ninflation levels on the level, composition and performance of the Corporation’s assets and liabilities, and corresponding\neffects on the Corporation’s net interest income, net interest margin, loan originations, deposit attrition, overall results of\noperations, and liquidity position;\n● the effects of changes in the interest rate environment, including any adverse change in the Corporation’s ability to attract and\nretain clients and gain acceptance from current and prospective customers for new and existing products and services,\nincluding those related to the offering of digital banking and financial services;\n● volatility in the financial services industry, which could result in, among other things, bank deposit runoffs, liquidity\nconstraints, and increased regulatory requirements and costs;\n● the effect of continued changes in the fiscal and monetary policies and regulations of the United States (“U.S.”) federal\ngovernment, the Puerto Rico government and other governments, including those determined by the Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”), the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the “FED”), the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”), government-sponsored housing agencies and regulators in Puerto Rico, the\nU.S., and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the “USVI”) and British Virgin Islands (the “BVI”), that may affect the future results of\nthe Corporation;\n● uncertainty as to the ability of the Corporation’s banking subsidiary, FirstBank Puerto Rico (“FirstBank” or the “Bank”), to\nretain its core deposits and generate sufficient cash flow through its wholesale funding sources, such as securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase, Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, and brokered certificates of deposit (“brokered\nCDs”), which may require us to sell investment securities at a loss;\n● adverse changes in general political and economic conditions in Puerto Rico, the U.S., and the USVI and the BVI, including\nin the interest rate environment, unemployment rates, market liquidity, housing absorption rates, real estate markets, and U.S.\ncapital markets, which may affect funding sources, loan portfolio performance and credit quality, market prices of investment\nsecurities, and demand for the Corporation’s products and services, and which may reduce the Corporation’s revenues and\nearnings and the value of the Corporation’s assets;\n● the impact of government financial assistance for hurricane recovery and other disaster relief on economic activity in Puerto\nRico, and the timing and pace of disbursements of funds earmarked for disaster relief;\n● the ability of the Corporation, FirstBank, and third-party service providers to identify and prevent cyber-security incidents,\nsuch as data security breaches, ransomware, malware, “denial of service” attacks, “hacking,” identity theft, and state-\nsponsored cyberthreats, and the occurrence of and response to any incidents that occur, which may result in misuse or\nmisappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, disruption, or damage to our systems or those of third-party\nservice providers on which we rely, increased costs and losses and/or adverse effects to our reputation;\n3\n● general competitive factors and other market risks as well as the implementation of existent or planned strategic growth\nopportunities, including risks, uncertainties, and other factors or events related to any business acquisitions, dispositions,\nstrategic partnerships, strategic operational investments, including systems conversions, and any anticipated efficiencies or\nother expected results related thereto;\n● uncertainty as to the implementation of the debt restructuring plan of Puerto Rico (“Plan of Adjustment” or “PoA”) and the\nfiscal plan for Puerto Rico as certified on June 5, 2024 (the “2024 Fiscal Plan”) by the oversight board established by the\nPuerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (“PROMESA”), or any revisions to it, on our clients and\nloan portfolios, and any potential impact from future economic or political developments and tax regulations in Puerto Rico;\n● the impact of changes in accounting standards, or determinations and assumptions in applying those standards, and of\nforecasts of economic variables considered for the determination of the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”);\n● the ability of FirstBank to realize the benefits of its net deferred tax assets;\n● the ability of FirstBank to generate sufficient cash flow to pay dividends to the Corporation;\n● environmental, social, and governance matters, including our climate-related initiatives and commitments;\n● the impacts of natural or man-made disasters, widespread health emergencies, geopolitical conflicts (including sanctions, war\nor armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East, and the possible expansion of such\nconflicts in surrounding areas and potential geopolitical consequences), terrorist attacks, or other catastrophic external events,\nincluding impacts of such events on general economic conditions and on the Corporation’s assumptions regarding forecasts\nof economic variables;\n● the risk that additional portions of the unrealized losses in the Corporation’s debt securities portfolio are determined to be\ncredit-related, resulting in additional charges to the provision for credit losses on the Corporation’s debt securities portfolio,\nand the potential for additional credit losses that could emerge from further downgrades of the U.S.’s Long-Term Foreign-\nCurrency Issuer Default Rating and negative ratings outlooks;\n● the impacts of applicable legislative, tax, or regulatory changes or changes in legislative, tax, or regulatory priorities,\npotential government shutdowns, and political impasses, including uncertainties regarding the U.S. debt ceiling and federal\nbudget, as well as the change in administration as a result of the 2024 U.S. and Puerto Rico general elections, on the\nCorporation’s financial condition or performance;\n● the risk of possible failure or circumvention of the Corporation’s internal controls and procedures and the risk that the\nCorporation’s risk management policies may not be adequate;\n● the risk that the FDIC may further increase the deposit insurance premium and/or require further special assessments, causing\nan additional increase in the Corporation’s non-interest expenses;\n● any need to recognize impairments on the Corporation’s financial instruments, goodwill, and other intangible assets;\n● the risk that the impact of the occurrence of any of these uncertainties on the Corporation’s capital would preclude further\ngrowth of FirstBank and preclude the Corporation’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) from declaring dividends; and\n● uncertainty as to whether FirstBank will be able to continue to satisfy its regulators regarding, among other things, its asset\nquality, liquidity plans, maintenance of capital levels, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and related\nrequirements.\nThe Corporation does not undertake to, and specifically disclaims any obligation to update any “forward-looking statements” to\nreflect occurrences or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements, except as required by the federal\nsecurities laws.\n4\nFIRST BANCORP.\nCONSOLIDATED

Among other\nthings, the amendments in this ASU require disclosure on an interim and annual basis of the following: significant segment expenses that\nare regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or\nloss; and an amount for other segment items (to reconcile segment revenues less significant expenses to the reported measure(s) of a\nsegment’s profit or loss) by reportable segment and a description of its composition. This ASU also requires disclosure on an annual basis\nof the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in\nassessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. In addition, this ASU requires interim disclosure of segment-related\ndisclosures that were previously only required on an annual basis and permits disclosure of multiple measures of segment profit or loss,\nprovided that disclosure of the measure that is closest to GAAP is also provided and certain other criteria are met.\n11\nFIRST BANCORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nThe Corporation has carried out the necessary data updates to be able to include the above information in its footnote disclosures for all\nperiods presented.

Because the decline in fair value\nis attributable to changes in interest rates, and not credit quality, and because, as of September 30, 2024, the Corporation did not have\nthe intent to sell these U.S. government and agencies debt securities and determined that it was likely that it will not be required to sell\nthese securities before their anticipated recovery, the Corporation does not consider impairments on these securities to be credit\nrelated. The Corporation’s credit loss assessment was concentrated mainly on private label MBS and on Puerto Rico government debt\nsecurities, for which credit losses are evaluated on a quarterly basis.\nPrivate label MBS held as part of the Corporation’s available for sale portfolio consist of trust certificates issued by an unaffiliated\nparty backed by fixed-rate, single-family residential mortgage loans in the U.S. mainland with original FICO scores over 700 and\nmoderate loan-to-value ratios (under 80%), as well as moderate delinquency levels. The interest rate on these private label MBS is\nvariable, tied to 3-month CME Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus a tenor spread adjustment of0.26161% and\nthe original spread limited to the weighted-average coupon of the underlying collateral. The Corporation determined the ACL for\nprivate label MBS based on a risk-adjusted discounted cash flow methodology that considers the structure and terms of the\ninstruments. The Corporation utilized probability of default (“PDs”) and loss-given default (“LGDs”) that considered, among other\nthings, historical payment performance, loan-to-value attributes, and relevant current and forward-looking macroeconomic variables,\nsuch as regional unemployment rates and the housing price index. Under this approach, expected cash flows (interest and principal)\nwere discounted at the U.S. Treasury yield curve as of the reporting date. See Note 17 – “Fair Value ” for the significant assumptions\nused in the valuation of the private label MBS as of September 30, 2024 and December 31 2023.\nFor the residential pass-through MBS issued by the PRHFA held as part of the Corporation’s available-for-sale portfolio backed by\nsecond mortgage residential loans in Puerto Rico, the ACL was determined based on a discounted cash flow methodology that\nconsidered the structure and terms of the debt security. The expected cash flows were discounted at the U.S. Treasury yield curve plus\na spread as of the reporting date and compared to the amortized cost. The Corporation utilized PDs and LGDs that considered, among\nother things, historical payment performance, loan-to-value attributes, and relevant current and forward-looking macroeconomic\nvariables, such as regional unemployment rates, the housing price index, and expected recovery from the PRHFA guarantee. PRHFA,\nnot the Puerto Rico government, provides a guarantee in the event of default and subsequent foreclosure of the properties underlying\nthe second mortgage loans. In the event that the second mortgage loans default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the\noutstanding balance of this residential pass-through MBS, PRHFA’s ability to honor such guarantee will depend on, among other\nfactors, its financial condition at the time such obligation becomes due and payable.

The Corporation does not recognize an ACL for MBS\nissued or guaranteed by GSEs since they are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. In the case of\nPuerto Rico municipal bonds, the Corporation determines the ACL based on the product of a cumulative PD and LGD, and the amortized\ncost basis of the bonds over their remaining expected life as described in Note 1 – “Nature of Business and Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies,” to the audited financial statements included in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Corporation performs periodic credit quality reviews on these issuers. All of the Puerto Rico municipal bonds were current as to\nscheduled contractual payments as of September 30, 2024. The ACL of Puerto Rico municipal bonds decreased to $1.1 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, from $2.2 million as of December 31, 2023, mostly related to updated financial information of a bond issuer received\nduring the first quarter of 2024.\nThe following tables present the activity in the ACL for held-to-maturity debt securities by major security type for the quarters and\nnine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nPuerto Rico Municipal Bonds\nQuarter Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nBeginning balance $ 1,267 $ 8,401\nProvision for credit losses – benefit (148) (6,151)\nACL on held-to-maturity debt securities $ 1,119 $ 2,250\nPuerto Rico Municipal Bonds\nNine-Month Period Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nBeginning Balance $ 2,197 $ 8,286\nProvision for credit losses - benefit (1,078) (6,036)\nACL on held-to-maturity debt securities $ 1,119 $ 2,250\nMunicipalities, which are covered instrumentalities under PROMESA, may be affected by the negative economic and other effects\nresulting from expense, revenue, or cash management measures taken by the Puerto Rico government to address its fiscal situation, or\nmeasures included in its fiscal plan or fiscal plans of other government entities. Given the inherent uncertainties about the fiscal\nsituation of the Puerto Rico central government and the measures taken, or to be taken, by other government entities in response to\neconomic and fiscal challenges, the Corporation cannot be certain whether future charges to the ACL on these securities will be\nrequired.\nFrom time to time, the Corporation has held-to-maturity securities with an original maturity of three months or less that are\nconsidered cash and cash equivalents and are classified as money market investments in the consolidated statements of financial\ncondition. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation had no outstanding held-to-maturity securities that were\nclassified as cash and cash equivalents.\n21\nFIRST BANCORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nCredit Quality Indicators:\nThe held-to-maturity debt securities portfolio consisted of GSEs’ MBS, for which the Corporation expects no credit losses, and\nfinancing arrangements with Puerto Rico municipalities issued in bond form. The Puerto Rico municipal bonds are accounted for as\nsecurities but are underwritten as loans with features that are typically found in commercial loans. Accordingly, the Corporation\nmonitors the credit quality of these municipal bonds through the use of internal credit-risk ratings, which are generally updated on a\nquarterly basis. The Corporation considers a municipal bond as a criticized asset if its risk rating is Special Mention, Substandard,\nDoubtful, or Loss. Puerto Rico municipal bonds that do not meet the criteria for classification as criticized assets are considered to be\nPass-rated securities. For the definitions of the internal-credit ratings, see Note 3 – “Debt Securities,” to the audited consolidated\nfinancial statements included in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Corporation periodically reviews its Puerto Rico municipal bonds to evaluate if they are properly classified, and to measure\ncredit losses on these securities. The frequency of these reviews will depend on the amount of the aggregate outstanding debt, and the\nrisk rating classification of the obligor.\nThe Corporation has a Loan Review Group that reports directly to the Corporation’s Risk Management Committee and\nadministratively to the Chief Risk Officer. The Loan Review Group performs annual comprehensive credit process reviews of the\nBank’s commercial loan portfolios, including the above-mentioned Puerto Rico municipal bonds accounted for as held-to-maturity\ndebt securities. The objective of these loan reviews is to assess accuracy of the Bank’s determination and maintenance of loan risk\nrating and its adherence to lending policies, practices and procedures. The monitoring performed by this group contributes to the\nassessment of compliance with credit policies and underwriting standards, the determination of the current level of credit risk, the\nevaluation of the effectiveness of the credit management process, and the identification of any deficiency that may arise in the credit-\ngranting process. Based on its findings, the Loan Review Group recommends corrective actions, if necessary, that help in maintaining\na sound credit process. The Loan Review Group reports the results of the credit process reviews to the Risk Management Committee.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all Puerto Rico municipal bonds classified as held-to-maturity were classified as\nPass.\nNo held-to-maturity debt securities were on nonaccrual status, 90 days past due and still accruing, or past due as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023. A security is considered to be past due once it is 30 days contractually past due under the terms of the\nagreement.\n22\nFIRST BANCORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nNOTE 3 – LOANS HELD FOR INVESTMENT\nThe following table provides information about the loan portfolio held for investment by portfolio segment and disaggregated by\ngeographic locations as of the indicated dates:\nAs of September 30, As of December 31,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nPuerto Rico and Virgin Islands region:\nResidential mortgage loans, mainly secured by first mortgages $ 2,327,678 $ 2,356,006\nConstruction loans 175,353 115,401\nCommercial mortgage loans 1,797,333 1,790,637\nCommercial and Industrial (“C&I”) loans 2,243,630 2,249,408\nConsumer loans 3,733,741 3,651,770\nLoans held for investment $ 10,277,735 $ 10,163,222\nFlorida region:\nResidential mortgage loans, mainly secured by first mortgages $ 492,469 $ 465,720\nConstruction loans 31,989 99,376\nCommercial mortgage loans 674,547 526,446\nC&I loans 961,683 924,824\nConsumer loans 7,601 5,895\nLoans held for investment $ 2,168,289 $ 2,022,261\nTotal:\nResidential mortgage loans, mainly secured by first mortgages $ 2,820,147 $ 2,821,726\nConstruction loans 207,342 214,777\nCommercial mortgage loans 2,471,880 2,317,083\nC&I loans(1) 3,205,313 3,174,232\nConsumer loans 3,741,342 3,657,665\nLoans held for investment(2) 12,446,024 12,185,483\nACL on loans and finance leases (246,996) (261,843)\nLoans held for investment, net $ 12,199,028 $ 11,923,640\n(1)As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, includes $769.8 million and $ 78 7.5 million, respectively, of commercia l l o ans that were secured by real estate\nand for which the primary source of repayment at origination was not dependent upon such real estate.\n(2)Includes accretable fair value net purchase discounts of $24.5 million and $24.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nVarious loans were assigned as collateral for borrowings, government deposits, time deposits accounts, and related unused\ncommitments.

FHA/VA government-guaranteed loans,\nconventional residential mortgage loans, and commercial mortgage loans past due 30-59 days, but less than two payments in arrears, as of December 31, 2023 amounted to $8.2 million, $69.9 million, and $1.1 million,\nrespectively.\nWhen a loan is placed in nonaccrual status, any accrued but uncollected interest income is reversed and charged against interest\nincome and the amortization of any net deferred fees is suspended. The amount of accrued interest reversed against interest income\ntotaled $0.8 million and $2.3 million for the quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $0.9\nmillion and $2.0 million for the same periods in 2023, respectively. For the quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024,\nthe cash interest income recognized on nonaccrual loans amounted to $0.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, compared to $0.4\nmillion and $1.4 million for the same periods in 2023, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the recorded investment on residential mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property\nthat were in the process of foreclosure amounted to $32.1 million, including $12.3 million of FHA/VA government-guaranteed\nmortgage loans, and $4.5 million of PCD loans acquired prior to the adoption, on January 1, 2020, of CECL. The Corporation\ncommences the foreclosure process on residential real estate loans when a borrower becomes 120 days delinquent. Foreclosure\nprocedures and timelines vary depending on whether the property is located in a judicial or non-judicial state. Occasionally,\nforeclosures may be delayed due to, among other reasons, mandatory mediations, bankruptcy, court delays, and title issues.\nCredit Quality Indicators:\nThe Corporation categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to service\ntheir debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current\neconomic trends, among other factors. The Corporation analyzes non-homogeneous loans, such as commercial mortgage, C&I, and\nconstruction loans individually to classify the loans’ credit risk. The Corporation periodically reviews its commercial and construction\nloans to evaluate if they are properly classified. The frequency of these reviews will depend on the amount of the aggregate\noutstanding debt, and the risk rating classification of the obligor. In addition, during the renewal and annual review process of\napplicable credit facilities, the Corporation evaluates the corresponding loan grades. The Corporation uses the same definition for risk\nratings as those described for Puerto Rico municipal bonds accounted for as held-to-maturity debt securities, as discussed in Note 3 –\n“Debt Securities,” to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor residential mortgage and consumer loans, the Corporation evaluates credit quality based on its interest accrual status.\n25\nFIRST BANCORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nBased on the most recent analysis performed, the amortized cost of commercial and construction loans by portfolio classes and by\norigination year based on the internal credit-risk category as of September 30, 2024, the gross charge -offs for the nine-month period\nended September 30, 2024 by portfolio classes and by origination year, and the amortized cost of commercial and construction loans\nby portfolio classes based on the internal credit-risk category as of December 31, 2023, were as follows:\nAs of September 30,2024 As of\nTerm Loans December 31,\nPuerto Rico and Virgin Islands Regions Amortized Cost Basis by Origination Year(1) 2023\nR evolving\nLoans\nAmortized\n2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Prior Cost Basis Total Total\n(In thousands)\nC ONSTRUCTION\nRisk Ratings:\nPass $ 22,083 $ 94,800 $ 40,799 $ 7,553 $ -

The weighted-average loan-to-value coverage for collateral dependent loans as of September 30, 2024 was 72%,\ncompared to 65% as of December 31, 2023, mainly related to the inflow to nonaccrual status of a $16.5 million commercial\nrelationship in the Puerto Rico region in the food retail industry, with a loan-to-value over100%, classified as collateral dependent,\npartially offset by the sale of an $8.2 million nonaccrual C&I loan in the Puerto Rico region, which resulted in a $1.2 million charge-\noff that had been previously reserved.\n34\nFIRST BANCORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nPurchases and Sales of Loans\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into securitization transactions and whole loan sales with GNMA and\nGSEs, such as FNMA and FHLMC. During the first nine months of 2024, loans pooled into GNMA MBS amounted to approximately\n$87.4 million, compared to $102.9 million, for the first nine months of 2023, for which the Corporation recognized a net gain on sale\nof $3.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively. Also, during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, the Corporation sold\napproximately $25.8 million and $28.6 million, respectively, of performing residential mortgage loans to GSEs, for which the\nCorporation recognized a net gain on sale of $0.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The Corporation’s continuing involvement\nwith the loans that it sells consists primarily of servicing the loans. In addition, the Corporation agrees to repurchase loans if it\nbreaches any of the representations and warranties included in the sale agreement. These representations and warranties are consistent\nwith the GSEs’ selling and servicing guidelines (i.e., ensuring that the mortgage was properly underwritten according to established\nguidelines).\nFor loans pooled into GNMA MBS, the Corporation, as servicer, holds an option to repurchase individual delinquent loans issued\non or after January 1, 2003, when certain delinquency criteria are met. This option gives the Corporation the unilateral ability, but not\nthe obligation, to repurchase the delinquent loans at par without prior authorization from GNMA. Since the Corporation is considered\nto have regained effective control over the loans, it is required to recognize the loans and a corresponding repurchase liability\nregardless of its intent to repurchase the loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, rebooked GNMA delinquent loans\nthat were included in the residential mortgage loan portfolio amounted to $6.6 million and $7.9 million, respectively.\nDuring the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, the Corporation repurchased, pursuant to the aforementioned repurchase option,\n$1.7 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of loans previously pooled into GNMA MBS. The principal balance of these loans is fully\nguaranteed, and the risk of loss related to the repurchased loans is generally limited to the difference between the delinquent interest\npayment advanced to GNMA, which is computed at the loan’s interest rate, and the interest payments reimbursed by FHA, which are\ncomputed at a pre-determined debenture rate. Repurchases of GNMA loans allow the Corporation, among other things, to maintain\nacceptable delinquency rates on outstanding GNMA pools and remain as a seller and servicer in good standing with GNMA.\nHistorically, losses on these repurchases of GNMA delinquent loans have been immaterial and no provision has been made at the time\nof sale.\nLoan sales to FNMA and FHLMC are without recourse in relation to the future performance of the loans. The Corporation’s risk of\nloss with respect to these loans is also minimal as these repurchased loans are generally performing loans with documentation\ndeficiencies.\nDuring the first nine months of 2024, the Corporation purchased commercial loan participations in the Florida region totaling\n$178.2 million, which consisted of approximately $164.5 million in the C&I portfolio and $13.7 million in the commercial mortgage\nportfolio, compared to C&I loan participations purchased in the Florida region totaling $61.3 million during the same period of 2023.\nIn addition, during the first nine months of 2024, the Corporation purchased commercial mortgage loan participations in the Puerto\nRico region totaling $38.9 million.\nDuring the first nine months of 2024, the Corporation recognized a $10.0 million recovery associated with the bulk sale of fully\ncharged-off consumer loans. There were no significant sales of loans during the first nine months of 2023, other than the sales of\nconforming residential mortgage loans mentioned above. In addition, during the first nine months of 2024, the Corporation sold the\naforementioned $8.2 million nonaccrual C&I loan in the Puerto Rico region, net of a $1.2 million charge-off.\n35\nFIRST BANCORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nLoan Portfolio Concentration\nThe Corporation’s primary lending area is Puerto Rico. The Corporation’s banking subsidiary, FirstBank, also lends in the USVI\nand the BVI markets and in the United States (principally in the state of Florida). Of the total gross loans held for investment portfolio\nof $12.4 billion as of September 30, 2024, credit risk concentration was approximately 80% in Puerto Rico,17% in the U.S., and3%\nin the USVI and the BVI.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had $213.9 million outstanding in loans extended to the Puerto Rico government, its\nmunicipalities and public corporations, compared to $187.7 million as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024,\napproximately $132.2 million consisted of loans extended to municipalities in Puerto Rico that are general obligations supported by\nassigned property tax revenues, and $22.2 million of loans which are supported by one or more specific sources of municipal\nrevenues. The vast majority of revenues of the municipalities included in the Corporation’s loan portfolio are independent of\nbudgetary subsidies provided by the Puerto Rico central government. These municipalities are required by law to levy special property\ntaxes in such amounts as are required to satisfy the payment of all of their respective general obligation bonds and notes. In addition to\nloans extended to municipalities, the Corporation’s exposure to the Puerto Rico government as of September 30, 2024 included $8.8\nmillion in loans granted to an affiliate of the P uerto R ico Electric P ower Authority (“PREPA”) and $50.7 million in loans to agencies\nor public corporations of the Puerto Rico government.\nIn addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had $73.5 million in exposure to residential mortgage loans that are\nguaranteed by the PRHFA, a government instrumentality that has been designated as a covered entity under PROMESA, compared to\n$77.7 million as of December 31, 2023. Residential mortgage loans guaranteed by the PRHFA are secured by the underlying\nproperties and the guarantees serve to cover shortfalls in collateral in the event of a borrower default.\nThe Corporation also has credit exposure to USVI government entities. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had $48.4\nmillion in loans to USVI government public corporations, compared to $90.5 million as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30,\n2024, all loans were currently performing and up to date on principal and interest payments.\n36\nFIRST BANCORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nLoss Mitigation Program for Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty\nThe Corporation provides assistance to its customers through a loss mitigation program. Depending upon the nature of a borrower’s\nfinancial condition, restructurings or loan modifications through this program are provided, as well as other restructurings of\nindividual C&I, commercial mortgage, construction, and residential mortgage loans. The Corporation may also modify contractual\nterms to comply with regulations regarding the treatment of certain bankruptcy filings and discharge situations.\nThe loan modifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that are associated with payment delays typically\ninclude the following:\n- Forbearance plans – Payments of either interest and/or principal are deferred for a pre-established period of time, generally not\nexceeding six months in any given year. The deferred interest and/or principal is repaid as either a lump sum payment at\nmaturity date or by extending the loan’s maturity date by the number of forbearance months granted.\n- Payment plans – Borrowers are allowed to pay the regular monthly payment plus the pre-established delinquent amounts\nduring a period generally not exceeding six months. At the end of the payment plan, the borrower is required to resume making\nits regularly scheduled loan payments.\n- Trial modifications – These types of loan modifications are granted for residential mortgage loans. Borrower s continue making\nreduced monthly payments during the trial period, which is generally of up to six months. The reduced payments that are made\nby the borrower during the trial period will result in a payment delay with respect to the original contractual terms of the loan\nsince the loan has not yet been contractually modified. After successful completion of the trial period, the mortgage loan is\ncontractually modified.\nModifications in the form of a reduction in interest rate, term extension, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, or any\ncombination of these types of loan modifications that have occurred in the current reporting period for a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty are disclosed in the tables below.

The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting given to\neach scenario for the different loan portfolio categories depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading\nnational and regional economic indicators, and industry trends. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation\napplied 100% probability to the baseline scenario for the commercial mortgage and construction loan portfolios since certain\nmacroeconomic variables associated with commercial real estate property performance and the commercial real estate (“CRE”) price\nindex, particularly in the Puerto Rico region, are expected to continue to perform in a more favorable manner than the alternative\ndownside economic scenario.\nAt least every other year, the Corporation reviews the credit models used in determining the ACL. Such exercise consists primarily\nin updating the model with recent historical losses and determining if other changes are required for purposes of estimating credit\nlosses. During the first nine months of 2024, the Corporation completed the aforementioned review for the residential mortgage, auto\nloan, and finance lease portfolios, primarily for the Puerto Rico region. The residential mortgage loan portfolio, which has recently\nexperienced a historically low level of credit losses, as a result of high collateral values in the Puerto Rico region, resulted in a lower\nrequired reserve level. For the auto loan and finance lease portfolios, historical loss trends were updated and resulted in an increase in\nthe required reserve levels as the loss experience in such portfolios have been trending higher towards historical loss experience.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the ACL for loans and finance leases was $247.0 million, a decrease of $14.8 million, from $261.8\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. The ACL for residential mortgage loans decreased by $16.7 million, driven by the aforementioned\nupdated historical loss experience used for determining the ACL estimate resulting in a downward revision of estimated loss severities\nand improvements in the long-term projections of the unemployment rate in the Puerto Rico region, partially offset by newly\noriginated loans. The ACL for commercial and construction loans decreased by $8.8 million, mainly due to reserve releases associated\nwith the improved financial condition of certain borrowers and an improvement on the economic outlook of certain macroeconomic\nvariables, particularly variables associated with commercial real estate property performance and the forecasted CRE price index,\npartially offset by increased volume.\nMeanwhile, the ACL for consumer loans increased by $10.7 million driven by higher charge-off levels and loan portfolio growth,\nmainly in auto loans.\nNet charge-offs were $24.0 million and $56.2 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to\n$14.1 million and $46.6 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The $9.9 million increase in net charge-offs for the third\nquarter of 2024 was driven by an increase in consumer loans and finance leases charge-offs across all major portfolio classes, a $1.4\nmillion recovery recorded on a construction loan in the Puerto Rico region during the third quarter of 2023, and a $1.2 million charge-\noff recorded on the sale of a nonaccrual C&I loan in the Puerto Rico region in the third quarter of 2024. The $9.5 million increase in\nnet charge-offs for the first nine months of 2024 was driven by the aforementioned increase in consumer loans and finance leases\ncharge-offs, partially offset by the effect during the first nine months of 2024 of both the $10.0 million recovery associated with the\nbulk sale of fully charged-off consumer loans and finance leases and a $5.0 million recovery associated with a C&I loan in the Puerto\nRico region, and a $6.2 million charge-off recorded on a C&I participated loan in the Florida region during the first nine months of\n2023.\n44\nFIRST BANCORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nThe tables below present the ACL related to loans and finance leases and the carrying values of loans by portfolio segment as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nAs of September 30, 2024\nResidential Mortgage Construction Commercial Mortgage C&I\nLoans Loans Loans Loans Consumer Loans Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTotal loans held for investment:\nAmortized cost of loans $ 2,820,147 $ 207,342 $ 2,471,880 $ 3,205,313 $ 3,741,342 $ 12,446,024\nAllowance for credit losses 40,651 3,998 24,205 34,446 143,696 246,996\nAllowance for credit losses to\namortized cost 1.44% 1.93 % 0.98 % 1.07 % 3.84 % 1.98 %\nAs of December 31, 2023\nResidential Mortgage Construction Commercial Mortgage C&I\nLoans Loans Loans Loans Consumer Loans Total\n(Dol lars in thousands)\nTotal loans held for investment:\nAmortized cost of loans $ 2,821,726 $ 214,777 $ 2,317,083 $ 3,174,232 $ 3,657,665 $ 12,185,483\nAllowance for credit losses 57,397 5,605 32,631 33,190 133,020 261,843\nAllowance for credit losses to\namortized cost 2.03% 2.61% 1.41% 1.05% 3.64% 2.15%\nIn addition, the Corporation estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Corporation is exposed to\ncredit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, such as unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit for\ncommercial and construction loans, unless the obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Corporation. See Note 21 –\n“Regulatory Matters, Commitments and Contingencies” for information on off -balance sheet exposures as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023.

As of September 30, 2024, the ACL for off-balance sheet credit exposures\namounted to $3.5 million, compared to $4.6 million as of December 31, 2023.

The Corporation’s policy is to\nassess goodwill and other intangibles for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each year, and more frequently if\nevents or circumstances lead management to believe that the values of goodwill or other intangibles may be impaired. During the\nfourth quarter of 2023, management performed a qualitative analysis of the carrying amount of each relevant reporting units’ goodwill\nand concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value. This assessment\ninvolved identifying the inputs and assumptions that most affect fair value, including evaluating significant and relevant events\nimpacting each reporting entity, and evaluating such factors to determine if a positive assertion can be made that it is more-likely-\nthan-not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying amount. As of December 31, 2023, the Corporation\nconcluded that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value. The Corporation\ndetermined that there have been no significant events since the last annual assessment that could indicate potential goodwill\nimpairment on reporting units for which the goodwill is allocated. As a result, no impairment charges for goodwill were recorded\nduring the first nine months of 2024.\nThere were no changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the quarters and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023.\nOther Intangible Assets\nThe following table presents the gross amount and accumulated amortization of the Corporation’s intangible assets subject to\namortization as of the indicated dates:\nAs of As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(D ollars in thousands)\nCore deposit intangible:\nGross amount $ 87,544 $ 87,544\nAccumulated amortization (79,284) (74,161)\nNet carrying amount $ 8,260 $ 13,383\nR emaining amortization period (in years) 5.3 6.0\nDuring the quarter and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation recognized $1.4 million and $5.1 million,\nrespectively, in amortization expense on its other intangibles subject to amortization, compared to $1.9 million and $5.9 million for\nthe same periods in 2023, respectively\nThe Corporation amortizes core deposit intangibles based on the projected useful lives of the related deposits. Core deposit\nintangibles are analyzed annually for impairment, or sooner if events and circumstances indicate possible impairment. Factors that\nmay suggest impairment include customer attrition and run-off.

All such transfers have been accounted for as sales as required by\napplicable accounting guidance.\nWhen evaluating the need to consolidate counterparties to which the Corporation has transferred assets, or with which the\nCorporation has entered into other transactions, the Corporation first determines if the counterparty is an entity for which a variable\ninterest exists. If no scope exception is applicable and a variable interest exists, the Corporation then evaluates whether it is the\nprimary beneficiary of the VIE and whether the entity should be consolidated or not.\nBelow is a summary of transactions with VIEs for which the Corporation has retained some level of continuing involvement:\nTrust-Preferred Securities (“TruPS”)\nIn April 2004, FBP Statutory Trust I, a financing trust that is wholly owned by the Corporation, sold to institutional investors $100\nmillion of its variable-rate TruPS. FBP Statutory Trust I used the proceeds of the issuance, together with the proceeds of the purchase\nby the Corporation of $3.1 million of FBP Statutory Trust I variable-rate common securities, to purchase $103.1 million aggregate\nprincipal amount of the Corporation’s Junior Subordinated Deferrable Debentures. In September 2004, FBP Statutory Trust II, a\nfinancing trust that is wholly owned by the Corporation, sold to institutional investors $125 million of its variable-rate TruPS. FBP\nStatutory Trust II used the proceeds of the issuance, together with the proceeds of the purchase by the Corporation of $3.9 million of\nFBP Statutory Trust II variable-rate common securities, to purchase $128.9 million aggregate principal amount of the Corporation’s\nJunior Subordinated Deferrable Debentures. The debentures, net of related issuance costs, are presented in the Corporation’s\nconsolidated statements of financial condition as other long-term borrowings. These TruPS are variable-rate instruments indexed to 3-\nmonth CME Term SOFR plus a tenor spread adjustment of 0.26161% and the original spread of 2.75% for the FBP Statutory Trust I\nand 2.50% for the FBP Statutory Trust II. The Junior Subordinated Deferrable Debentures mature on June 17, 2034, and September\n20, 2034, respectively; however, under certain circumstances, the maturity of Junior Subordinated Deferrable Debentures may be\nshortened (such shortening would result in a mandatory redemption of the variable-rate TruPS).\nIn September 2024, the Corporation redeemed $50.0 million, or42%, of outstanding TruPS issued by FBP Statutory Trust II (or\n$48.5 million after excluding the Corporation’s interest in the Trust of approximately $1.5 million) at a contractual call price of100%\nas part of the 2024 repurchase program, as further explained in Note 13 – “Stockholders’ Equity” to the unaudited consolidated\nfinancial statements herein. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, these Junior Subordinated Deferrable Debentures\namounted to $111.7 million and $161.7 million, respectively. The Corporation expects to execute the redemption of the remaining\njunior subordinated debentures through the end of the fourth quarter of 2025.\nUnder the indentures of these instruments, the Corporation has the right, from time to time, and without causing an event of default,\nto defer payments of interest on the Junior Subordinated Deferrable Debentures by extending the interest payment period at any time\nand from time to time during the term of the subordinated debentures for up to twenty consecutive quarterly periods. As of September\n30, 2024, the Corporation was current on all interest payments due on its subordinated debt.\n48\nFIRST BANCORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nPrivate Label MBS\nDuring 2004 and 2005, an unaffiliated party, referred to in this subsection as the seller, established a series of statutory trusts to\neffect the securitization of mortgage loans and the sale of trust certificates (“private label MBS”). The seller initially provided the\nservicing for a fee, which is senior to the obligations to pay private label MBS holders. The seller then entered into a sales agreement\nthrough which it sold and issued the private label MBS in favor of the Corporation’s banking subsidiary, FirstBank. Currently, the\nBank is the sole owner of these private label MBS; the servicing of the underlying residential mortgages that generate the principal\nand interest cash flows is performed by another third party, which receives a servicing fee. These private label MBS are variable -rate\nsecurities indexed to 3-month CME Term SOFR plus a tenor spread adjustment of0.26161% and the original spread limited to the\nweighted-average coupon of the underlying collateral. The principal payments from the underlying loans are remitted to a paying\nagent (servicer), who then remits interest to the Bank. Interest income is shared to a certain extent with the FDIC, which has an\ninterest only strip (“IO”) tied to the cash flows of the underlying loans and is entitled to receive the excess of the interest income less a\nservicing fee over the variable rate income that the Bank earns on the securities. The FDIC became the owner of the IO upon its\nintervention of the seller, a failed financial institution. No recourse agreement exists, and the Bank, as the sole holder of the securities,\nabsorbs all risks from losses on non-accruing loans and repossessed collateral. As of September 30, 2024, the amortized cost and fair\nvalue of these private label MBS amounted to $6.3 million and $4.3 million, respectively, with a weighted-average yield of 6.92%,\nwhich is included as part of the Corporation’s available -for-sale debt securities portfolio, compared to an amortized cost and fair value\nof $7.1 million and $4.8 million, respectively, with a weighted average yield of7.66% as of December 31, 2023. As described in Note\n2 – “Debt Securities,” the ACL on these private label MBS amounted to $0.2 million as of September 30, 2024.\nServicing Assets, or Mortgage Servicing Rights (“MSRs”)\nThe Corporation typically transfers first lien residential mortgage loans in conjunction with GNMA securitization transactions in\nwhich the loans are exchanged for cash or securities that are readily redeemed for cash proceeds and servicing rights. The securities\nissued through these transactions are guaranteed by GNMA and, under seller/servicer agreements, the Corporation is required to\nservice the loans in accordance with the issuers’ servicing guidelines and standards. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation\nserviced loans securitized through GNMA with a principal balance of $2.1 billion. Also, certain conventional conforming loans are\nsold to FNMA or FHLMC with servicing retained. The Corporation recognizes as separate assets the rights to service loans for others,\nwhether those servicing assets are originated or purchased. MSRs are included as part of other assets in the consolidated statements of\nfinancial condition.\nThe changes in MSRs are shown below for the indicated periods:\nQuarter Ended September 30, Nine-Month Period Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nBalance at beginning of period $ 25,952 $ 28,034 $ 26,941 $ 29,037\nCapitalization of servicing assets 525 601 1,632 1,839\nAmortization (1,060) (1,035) (3,135) (3,265)\nTemporary impairment recoveries - 7 - 12\nOther(1) (14) (6) (35) (22)\nBalance at end of period $ 25,403 $ 27,601 $ 25,403 $ 27,601\n(1) Mainly represents adjustments related to the repu rch a se of loans serviced for ot her s.\nImpairment charges are recognized through a valuation allowance for each individual stratum of servicing assets. The valuation\nallowance is adjusted to reflect the amount, if any, by which the cost basis of the servicing asset for a given stratum of loans being\nserviced exceeds its fair value. Any fair value in excess of the cost basis of the servicing asset for a given stratum is not recognized.\n49\nFIRST BANCORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nChanges in the impairment allowance were as follows for the indicated periods:\nQuarter Ended September 30, Nine-Month Period Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nBalance at beginning of period $ - $ 7 $ - $ 12\nTemporary impairment recoveries - (7) - (12)\nBalance at end of period $ - $ - $ - $ -\nThe components of net servicing income, included as part of mortgage banking activities in the consolidated statements of income,\nare shown below for the indicated periods:\nQuarter Ended September 30, Nine-Month Period Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nServicing fees $ 2,588 $ 2,606 $ 7,766 $ 7,984\nLate charges and prepayment penalties 158 137 528 547\nOther(1) (14) (6) (35) (22)\nServicing income, gross 2,732 2,737 8,259 8,509\nAmortization and impairment of servicing assets (1,060) (1,028) (3,135) (3,253)\nServicing income, net $ 1,672 $ 1,709 $ 5,124 $ 5,256\n(1) Mainly represents adjustments related to the repurchase of l oans serviced for other s.\nThe Corporation’s MSRs are subject to prepayment and interest rate risks.

As the figures indicate, changes in fair value based on a 10%\nvariation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship between the change in assumption and the change\nin fair value may not be linear. Also, in this table, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSR is\ncalculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example,\nincreases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments), which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities.\n51\nFIRST BANCORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nNOTE 8 – DEPOSITS\nThe following table summarizes deposit balances as of the indicated dates:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(In thousands)\nType of account:\nNon-interest-bearing deposit accounts $ 5,275,733 $ 5,404,121\nInterest-bearing checking accounts 3,909,255 3,937,945\nInterest-bearing saving accounts 3,575,093 3,596,855\nTime deposits 3,067,261 2,833,730\nBrokered certificates of deposits (“CDs”) 520,048 783,334\nTotal $ 16,347,390 $ 16,555,985\nThe following table presents the remaining contractual maturities of time deposits, including brokered CDs, as of September 30,\n2024:\nTotal\n(In thousands)\nThree months or less $ 1,089,421\nOver three months to six months 774,943\nOver six months to one year 902,524\nOver one year to two years 526,478\nOver two years to three years 82,095\nOver three years to four years 119,118\nOver four years to five years 70,914\nOver five years 21,816\nTotal $ 3,587,309\nTotal Puerto Rico and U.S. time deposits with balances of more than $250,000 amounted to $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Basic weighted-average common shares outstanding exclude unvested shares of\nrestricted stock that do not contain non-forfeitable dividend rights .\nPotential dilutive common shares consist of unvested shares of restricted stock and performance units (if any of the performance\nconditions are met as of the end of the reporting period) that do not contain non-forfeitable dividend or dividend equivalent rights\nusing the treasury stock method. This method assumes that proceeds equal to the amount of compensation cost attributable to future\nservices is used to repurchase shares on the open market at the average market price for the period. The difference between the\nnumber of potential dilutive shares issued and the shares purchased is added as incremental shares to the actual number of shares\noutstanding to compute diluted earnings per share. Unvested shares of restricted stock outstanding during the period that result in\nlower potentially dilutive shares issued than shares purchased under the treasury stock method are not included in the computation of\ndilutive earnings per share since their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect on earnings per share.

As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation has remaining authorization to repurchase\napproximately $50.0 million of common stock under this stock repurchase program.\nFurthermore, on July 22, 2024, the Corporation announced that its Board of Directors approved a new repurchase program (“the\n2024 repurchase program”), under which the Corporation may repurchase up to an additional $250 million that could include\nrepurchases of common stock or junior subordinated debentures, which it expects to execute through the end of the fourth quarter of\n2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation has remaining authorization to repurchase approximately $200.0 million, under the\n2024 repurchase program, after the $50.0 million redemption of junior subordinated debentures in September 2024, as further\nexplained in Note 7 - “Non-Consolidated Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”) and Servicing Assets.”\nRepurchases under these programs may be executed through open market purchases, accelerated share repurchases, privately\nnegotiated transactions or plans, including plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, redemption of junior\nsubordinated debentures (in the case of the 2024 repurchase program), and will be conducted in accordance with applicable legal and\nregulatory requirements. The Corporation’s repurchase programs are subject to various factors, including the Corporation’s capital\nposition, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, and general market conditions. The\nCorporation’s repurchase programs do not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares and do not have an expiration date. The\nrepurchase programs may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time at the Corporation’s discretion. Any repurchased shares\nof common stock are expected to be held as treasury shares. The Corporation’s holding company has no operations and depends on\ndividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividend payments, stock repurchases, and to fund all\npayments on its obligations, including debt obligations.\nCommon Stock\nThe following table shows the change in shares of common stock outstanding for the quarters and nine-month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023:\nTotal Number of Shares\nQuarter Ended Nine-Month Period Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCom mo n stock outstanding, beginning balance 163,865,453 179,756,622 169,302,812 182,709,059\nCommon stock repurchased(1) (898) (5,393,236) (5,984,078) (9,258,611)\nCommon stock reissued under stock-based compensation plan 14,947 23,903 564,232 994,332\nRestricted stock forfeited (3,692) (963) (7,156) (58,454)\nCom mon stock outstanding, ending balance 163,875,810 174,386,326 163,875,810 174,386,326\n(1) For the quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 includes898 and 137,206 sha res, respectively of co mmon stock surrender ed to cover plan parti cipants' payroll and\nincome taxes.

Amounts transferred to the legal surplus reserve from retained earnings are not available for distribution\nto the Corporation without the prior consent of the Puerto Rico Commissioner of Financial Institutions. The Puerto Rico Banking Law\nprovides that, when the expenditures of a Puerto Rico commercial bank are greater than receipts, the excess of the expenditures over\nreceipts must be charged against the undistributed profits of the bank, and the balance, if any, must be charged against the legal\nsurplus reserve, as a reduction thereof. If the legal surplus reserve is not sufficient to cover such balance in whole or in part, the\noutstanding amount must be charged against the capital account and the Bank cannot pay dividends until it can replenish the legal\nsurplus reserve to an amount of at least 20% of the original capital contributed. FirstBank’s legal surplus reserve, included as part of\nretained earnings in the Corporation’s consolidated statements of financial condition, amounted to $199.6 million as of each of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

One defined benefit\npension plan covers substantially all of BSPR’s former employees who were active before January 1, 2007, while the other defined\nbenefit pension plan covers personnel of an institution previously acquired by BSPR. Benefits are based on salary and years of service.\nThe accrual of benefits under the Pension Plans is frozen to all participants.\nThe following table presents the components of net periodic (benefit) cost for the indicated periods:\nAffected Line Item\nin the Consolidated Quarter Ended September 30, Nine-Month Period Ended September 30,\nStatements of Income 2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nNet periodic (benefit) cost, pension plans:\nInterest cost Other expenses $ 900 $ 950 $ 2,702 $ 2,850\nExpected return on plan assets Other expenses (1,017) (886) (3,053) (2,657)\nNet periodic (benefit) cost, pension plans (117) 64 (351) 193\nNet periodic cost, postretirement plan Other expenses 17 7 49 19\nNet periodic (benefit) cost $ (100) $ 71 $ (302) $ 212\n60\nFIRST BANCORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nNOTE 16 – INCOME TAXES\nThe Corporation is subject to Puerto Rico income tax on its income from all sources. Under the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code,\nas amended (the “PR Tax Code”), the Corporation and its subsidiaries are treated as separate taxable entities and are not entitled to file\nconsolidated tax returns. However, certain subsidiaries that are organized as limited liability companies with a partnership election are\ntreated as pass-through entities for Puerto Rico tax purposes. Furthermore, the Corporation conducts business through certain entities\nthat have special tax treatments, including doing business through an IBE unit of the Bank and through FirstBank Overseas\nCorporation, each of which are generally exempt from Puerto Rico income taxation under the International Banking Entity Act of\nPuerto Rico (“IBE Act”), and through a wholly-owned subsidiary that engages in certain Puerto Rico qualified investing and lending\nactivities that have certain tax advantages under Act 60 of 2019.\nFor the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, the Corporation recorded an income tax expense of $22.7 million and $72.2\nmillion, respectively, compared to $27.0 million and $89.2 million, respectively, for the same periods of 2023. The decrease in income\ntax expense for the third quarter of 2024 was mainly due to lower pre-tax income and, to a lesser extent, a lower estimated effective\ntax rate due to increased business activities with preferential tax treatment under the PR Tax Code and a $0.4 million tax contingency\naccrual release in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitation on some uncertain tax positions. Meanwhile, the decrease\nin income tax expense for the first nine months of 2024 was driven by a lower estimated effective tax rate due to the aforementioned\nincreased business activities with preferential tax treatment and, to a lesser extent, lower pre-tax income. The Corporation has\nmaintained an effective tax rate lower than the Puerto Rico maximum statutory rate of37.5%. The Corporation’s estimated annual\neffective tax rate, excluding entities with pre-tax losses from which a tax benefit cannot be recognized and discrete items, was 23.7%\nfor the first nine months of 2024, compared to 28.2% for the same period in 2023.\nIncome tax expense also includes USVI income taxes, as well as applicable U.S. federal and state taxes. As a Puerto Rico\ncorporation, FirstBank is treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. and USVI income tax purposes and is generally subject to U.S. and\nUSVI income tax only on its income from sources within the U.S. and USVI or income effectively connected with the conduct of a\ntrade or business in those jurisdictions. Such tax paid in the U.S. and USVI is also creditable against the Corporation’s Puerto Rico tax\nliability, subject to certain conditions and limitations. For the quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, FirstBank\nincurred current income tax expense of approximately $2.8 million and $7.7 million, respectively, related to its U.S. operations,\ncompared to $2.8 million and $6.8 million, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had a net deferred tax asset of $137.5 million, net of a valuation allowance of $121.6\nmillion against the deferred tax asset, compared to a net deferred tax asset of $150.1 million, net of a valuation allowance of $139.2\nmillion, as of December 31, 2023. The net deferred tax asset of the Corporation’s banking subsidiary, FirstBank, amounted to $137.5\nmillion as of September 30, 2024, net of a valuation allowance of $93.4 million, compared to a net deferred tax asset of $150.1\nmillion, net of a valuation allowance of $111.4 million, as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in the net deferred tax asset was\nmainly related to the usage of alternative minimum tax credits and the decrease in the ACL. Meanwhile, the decrease in the valuation\nallowance was related primarily to changes in the market value of available-for -sale debt securities which resulted in an equal change\nin the net deferred tax asset without impacting earnings. The Corporation maintains a full valuation allowance for its deferred tax\nassets associated with capital loss carryforwards, NOL carryforwards and unrealized losses of available-for-sale debt securities.\nSee Note 22 – “Income Taxes,” to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor information on the tax treatment of net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and dividend received deduction under the PR Tax\nCode and the limitation under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.\nThe Corporation accounts for uncertain tax positions under the provisions of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes.” The Corporation’s\npolicy is to report interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in income tax expense. As of September 30, 2024, the\nCorporation had $0.4 million in uncertain tax positions acquired from BSPR, which includes $0.1 million of accrued interest and\npenalties, which, if recognized, would decrease the effective income tax rate in future periods.The amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits may increase or decrease in the future for various reasons, including adding amounts for current tax year positions, expiration\nof open income tax returns due to the statute of limitations, changes in management’s judgment about the level of uncertainty, the\nstatus of examinations, litigation and legislative activity, and the addition or elimination of uncertain tax positions. The statute of\nlimitations under the PR Tax Code is four years after a tax return is due or filed, whichever is later; the statute of limitations for U.S.\nand USVI income tax purposes is three years after a tax return is due or filed, whichever is later. The completion of an audit by the\ntaxing authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the\nCorporation’s liability for income taxes. Any such adjustment could be material to the results of operations for any given quarterly or\nannual period based, in part, upon the results of operations for the given period. For U.S. and USVI income tax purposes, all tax years\nsubsequent to 2020 remain open to examination. For Puerto Rico tax purposes, all tax years subsequent to 2018 remain open to\nexamination.\n61\nFIRST BANCORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nNOTE 17 – FAIR VALUE\nFair Value Measurement\nASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants on the measurement date. This guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy for classifying assets and\nliabilities, which is based on whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable.\nOne of three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 Valuations of Level 1 assets and liabilities are obtained from readily-available pricing sources for market\ntransactions involving identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 Valuations of Level 2 assets and liabilities are based on observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted\nprices for similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market\ndata for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 Valuations of Level 3 assets and liabilities are based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market\nactivity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial\ninstruments whose value is determined by using pricing models for which the determination of fair value requires\nsignificant management judgment as to the estimation.\nSee Note 25 – “Fair Value,” to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for\na description of the valuation methodologies used to measure financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis.\nThere were no transfers of assets and liabilities measured at fair value between Level 1 and Level 2 measurements during the\nquarters and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023:\nAs of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023\nFair Value Measurements Using Fair Value Measurements Using\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n(In thousands)\nAssets:\nDebt securities available for sale:\nU.S. Treasury securities $ 98,612 $ - $ - $ 98,612 $ 135,393 $ - $ - $ 135,393\nNoncallable U.S. agencies debt securities - 700,299 - 700,299 - 433,437 - 433,437\nCallable U.S. agencies debt securities - 1,462,866 - 1,462,866 - 1,874,960 - 1,874,960\nMBS - 2,626,116 4,321(1) 2,630,437 - 2,779,994 4,785(1) 2,784,779\nPuerto Rico government obligation - - 1,567 1,567 - - 1,415 1,415\nOther investments - - 1,000 1,000 - - - -\nEquity securities 5,012 - - 5,012 4,893 - - 4,893\nDerivative assets - 322 - 322 - 341 - 341\nLiabilities:\nDerivative liabilities - 392 - 392 - 317 - 317\n(1) Related to private label MBS.\n62\nFIRST BANCORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of all assets measured at fair value on a recurring\nbasis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the quarters and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nQuarter Ended September 30, Nine-Month Period Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSecurities Available Securities Available Securities Available Securities Available\nLevel 3 Instruments Only for Sale(1) for Sale(1) for Sale(1) for Sale(1)\n(In thousands)\nBeginning balance $ 7,099 $ 7,357 $ 6,200 $ 8,495\nTotal gains (losses):\nIncluded in other comprehensive income (loss) (unrealized) 178 (722) 592 (903)\nIncluded in earnings (unrealized)(2) 36 (32) 45 (7)\nPurchases - - 1,000 -\nPrincipal repayments and amortization(3) (425) (237) (949) (1,219)\nEnding balance $ 6,888 $ 6,366 $ 6,888 $ 6,366\n(1) _A_m_o_un_t_s _m_o_st_ly_ r_el_at_e_d _to_ p_r_ivate label MBS.\n(2) Changes in unrealized gains (losses) included in earnings were recognized within provision for credit losses – expense and relate to assets still held as of the reporting date.\n(3) For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 includes a $0.5 million repayment of a matured debt security.\nThe tables below present quantitative information for significant assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using\nsignificant unobservable inputs (Level 3) as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nRange Weighted\nFair Value Valuation Technique Unobservable Input Minimum Maximum Average\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities:\nPrivate label MBS $ 4,321 D iscounted cash flows D iscount rate 15.7% 15.7% 15.7%\nPrepayment rate 0.0% 4.6% 3.0%\nP rojected cumulative loss rate 1.1% 4.6% 3.8%\nPuerto Rico government obligation $ 1,567 Discounted cash flows Discount rate 12.1% 12.1% 12.1%\nP rojected cumulative loss rate 23.8% 23.8% 23.8%\nDecember 31, 2023\nRange Weighted\nFair Value Valuation Technique Unobservable Input Minimum Maximum Average\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities:\nPrivate label MBS $ 4,785 Discounted cash flows Discount rate 16.1% 16.1% 16.1%\nPrepayment rate 0.0% 6.9% 3.7%\nProjected cumulative loss rate 0.1% 10.9% 4.2%\nPuerto Rico government obligation $ 1,415 Discounted cash flows Discount rate 14.1% 14.1% 14.1%\nProjected cumulative loss rate 25.8% 25.8% 25.8%\nInformation about Sensitivity to Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs\nPrivate label MBS: The significant unobservable inputs in the valuation include probability of default, the loss severity assumption,\nand prepayment rates. Shifts in those inputs would result in different fair value measurements. Increases in the probability of default,\nloss severity assumptions, and prepayment rates in isolation would generally result in an adverse effect on the fair value of the\ninstruments. The Corporation modeled meaningful and possible shifts of each input to assess the effect on the fair value estimation.\nPuerto Rico Government Obligation: The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement is the assumed loss rate of\nthe underlying residential mortgage loans that collateralize a pass-through MBS guaranteed by the PRHFA. A significant increase\n(decrease) in the assumed rate would lead to a (lower) higher fair value estimate.

The haircuts applied ranged from2% to27% for the quarter and nine-month period ended September 30,\n2023.\n(3) The Corporation derived the fair value of these loans based on published secondary market prices of MBS with similar characteristics.\nSee Note 25 – “Fair Value,” to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nqualitative information regarding the fair value measurements for Level 3 financial instruments measured at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis.\n64\nFIRST BANCORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nThe following tables present the carrying value, estimated fair value and estimated fair value level of the hierarchy of financial\ninstruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nTotal Carrying Amount\nin Statement of\nFinancial Condition as Fair Value Estimate as of\nof September 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\n(In thousands)\nAssets:\nCash and due from banks and money market investments (amortized cost) $ 685,371 $ 685,371 $ 685,371 $ - $ -\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities (fair value) 4,894,781 4,894,781 98,612 4,789,281 6,888\nHeld-to-maturity debt securities:\nHeld-to-maturity debt securities (amortized cost) 323,142\nLess: ACL on held-to-maturity debt securities (1,119)\nHeld-to-maturity debt securities, net of ACL $ 322,023 316,854 - 222,248 94,606\nEquity securities (amortized cost) 47,420 47,420 - 47,420(1) -\nOther equity securities (fair value) 5,012 5,012 5,012 - -\nLoans held for sale (lower of cost or market) 12,641 12,729 - 12,729 -\nLoans held for investment:\nLoans held for investment (amortized cost) 12,446,024\nLess: ACL for loans and finance leases (246,996)\nLoans held for investment, net of ACL $ 12,199,028 12,100,106 - - 12,100,106\nMSRs (amortized cost) 25,403 42,416 - - 42,416\nDerivative assets (fair value) (2) 322 322 - 322 -\nLiabilities:\nDeposits (amortized cost) $ 16,347,390 $ 16,358,466 $ - $ 16,358,466 $ -\nLong-term advances from the FHLB (amortized cost) 500,000 503,960 - 503,960 -\nOther long-term borrowings (amortized cost) 111,700 113,088 - - 113,088\nDerivative liabilities (fair value) (2) 392 392 - 392 -\n(1) Includes FHLB stock with a carrying value of $34.0 million, which is considered restricted.\n(2) Includes interest rate swap agreements, interest rate caps, forward contracts, interest rate lock commitments, and forward loan sales commitments.\n65\nFIRST BANCORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nTotal Carrying Amount\nin Statement of\nFinancial Condition as Fair Value Estimate as of\nof December 31, 2023 December 31, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\n(In thousands)\nAssets:\nCash and due from banks and money market investments (amortized cost) $ 663,164 $ 663,164 $ 663,164 $ - $ -\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities (fair value) 5,229,984 5,229,984 135,393 5,088,391 6,200\nHeld-to-maturity debt securities:\nHeld-to-maturity debt securities (amortized cost) 354,178\nLess: ACL on held-to-maturity debt securities (2,197)\nHeld-to-maturity debt securities, net of ACL $ 351,981 346,132 - 235,239 110,893\nEquity securities (amortized cost) 44,782 44,782 - 44,782 (1) -\nOther equity securities (fair value) 4,893 4,893 4,893 - -\nLoans held for sale (lower of cost or market) 7,368 7,476 - 7,476 -\nLoans held for investment:\nLoans held for investment (amortized cost) 12,185,483\nLess: ACL for loans and finance leases (261,843)\nLoans held for investment, net of ACL $ 11,923,640 11,762,855 - - 11,762,855\nMSRs (amortized cost) 26,941 45,244 - - 45,244\nDerivative assets (fair value)(2) 341 341 - 341 -\nLiabilities:\nDeposits (amortized cost) $ 16,555,985 $ 16,565,435 $ - $ 16,565,435 $ -\nLong-term advances from the FHLB (amortized cost) 500,000 500,522 - 500,522 -\nOther long-term borrowings (amortized cost) 161,700 159,999 - - 159,999\nDerivative liabilities (fair value)(2) 317 317 - 317 -\n(1) Includes FHLB stock with a carrying value of $34.6 million, which is considered restricted.\n(2) Includes interest rate swap agreements, interest rate caps, forward contracts and interest rate lock commitments.\nThe short-term nature of certain assets and liabilities result in their carrying value approximating fair value.

At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be\nwithin the scope of ASC Topic 606, the Corporation assesses the goods or services that are promised within each contract, identifies\nthe respective performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Corporation then\nrecognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the\nperformance obligation is satisfied.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following tables summarize the Corporation’s revenue, which includes net interest income on financial instruments that is\noutside of ASC Topic 606 and non-interest income, disaggregated by type of service and business segment for the quarters and nine-\nmonth periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nConsumer\nMortgage (Retail) Commercial Treasury and United States Virgin Islands\nQuarter ended September 30, 2024 Banking Banking and Corporate Investments Operations Operations Total\n(In thousands)\nNet interest income (loss)(1) $ 13,590 $ 146,585 $ 19,932 $ (1,634) $ 19,007 $ 4,584 $ 202,064\nService charges and fees on deposit accounts - 5,226 3,556 - 149 753 9,684\nInsurance commission income - 2,824 - - 75 104 3,003\nCard and processing income - 10,851 10 - 10 897 11,768\nOther service charges and fees 55 979 842 - 698 157 2,731\nNot in scope of ASC Topic 606 (1) 3,353 1,334 306 238 19 66 5,316\nTotal non-interest income 3,408 21,214 4,714 238 951 1,977 32,502\nTotal Revenue (Loss) $ 16,998 $ 167,799 $ 24,646 $ (1,396) $ 19,958 $ 6,561 $ 234,566\nConsumer\nMortgage (Retail) Commercial Treasury and United States Virgin Islands\nQuarter ended September 30, 2023 Banking Banking and Corporate Investments Operations Operations Total\n(In thousands)\nNet interest income (loss)(1) $ 18,279 $ 147,066 $ 13,212 $ (4,055) $ 19,749 $ 5,477 $ 199,728\nService charges and fees on deposit accounts - 5,286 3,406 - 155 705 9,552\nInsurance commission income - 2,596 - - 68 126 2,790\nCard and processing income - 9,982 24 - 23 812 10,841\nOther service charges and fees 50 1,262 853 - 615 163 2,943\nNot in scope of ASC Topic 606(1) 2,971 1,044 185 (3) (14) (13) 4,170\nTotal non-interest income (loss) 3,021 20,170 4,468 (3) 847 1,793 30,296\nTotal Revenue (Loss) $ 21,300 $ 167,236 $ 17,680 $ (4,058) $ 20,596 $ 7,270 $ 230,024\n67\nFIRST BANCORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nConsumer\nMortgage (Retail) Commercial and Treasury and United States Virgin Islands\nNine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 Banking Banking Corporate Investments Operations Operations Total\n(In thousands)\nNet interest income loss(1) $ 43,745 $ 446,801 $ 49,787 $ (13,017) $ 56,139 $ 14,757 $ 598,212\nService charges and fees on deposit accounts - 15,761 10,584 - 452 2,274 29,071\nInsurance commission income - 10,621 - - 161 514 11,296\nCard and processing income - 31,561 52 - 119 2,871 34,603\nOther service charges and fees 154 2,995 2,736 - 1,932 451 8,268\nNot in scope of ASC Topic 606 (1) 9,934 4,145 659 419 22 106 15,285\nTotal non-interest income 10,088 65,083 14,031 419 2,686 6,216 98,523\nTotal Revenue (Loss) $ 53,833 $ 511,884 $ 63,818 $ (12,598) $ 58,825 $ 20,973 $ 696,735\nConsumer\nMortgage (Retail) Commercial and Treasury and United States Virgin Islands\nNine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2023 Banking Banking Corporate Investments Operations Operations Total\n(In thousands)\nNet interest income (loss)(1) $ 61,427 $ 427,407 $ 41,085 $ (7,502) $ 60,369 $ 17,642 $ 600,428\nService charges and fees on deposit accounts - 15,859 9,886 - 492 2,143 28,380\nInsurance commission income - 9,700 - - 175 509 10,384\nCard and processing income - 30,035 74 - 103 2,682 32,894\nOther service charges and fees 244 3,922 2,801 - 1,858 714 9,539\nNot in scope of ASC Topic 606 (1) 8,913 2,909 4,027 1,837 221 (19) 17,888\nTotal non-interest income 9,157 62,425 16,788 1,837 2,849 6,029 99,085\nTotal Revenue (Loss) $ 70,584 $ 489,832 $ 57,873 $ (5,665) $ 63,218 $ 23,671 $ 699,513\n(1) Most of the Corporation’s revenue is not within the sco pe o f ASC Topic 606 .

As of September 30, 2024, the\nCorporation had six reportable segments: Mortgage Banking; Consumer (Retail) Banking; Commercial and Corporate Banking;\nTreasury and Investments; United States Operations; and Virgin Islands Operations. Management determined the reportable segments\nbased on the internal structure used to evaluate performance and to assess where to allocate resources. Other factors, such as the\nCorporation’s organizational chart, nature of the products, distribution channels, and the economic characteristics of the products,\nwere also considered in the determination of the reportable segments.\nThe Mortgage Banking segment consists of the origination, sale, and servicing of a variety of residential mortgage loans. The\nMortgage Banking segment also acquires and sells mortgages in the secondary markets. The Consumer (Retail) Banking segment\nconsists of the Corporation’s consumer lending and deposit -taking activities conducted mainly through its branch network and loan\ncenters. The Commercial and Corporate Banking segment consists of the Corporation’s lending and other services for large customers\nrepresented by specialized and middle-market clients and the government sector. The Commercial and Corporate Banking segment\noffers commercial loans, including commercial real estate and construction loans, and floor plan financings, as well as other products,\nsuch as cash management and business management services. The Treasury and Investments segment is responsible for the\nCorporation’s investment portfolio and treasury functions that are executed to manage and enhance liquidity. This segment lends\nfunds to the Commercial and Corporate Banking, the Mortgage Banking, the Consumer (Retail) Banking, and the United States\nOperations segments to finance their lending activities and borrows from those segments. The Consumer (Retail) Banking segment\nalso lends funds to other segments. The interest rates charged or credited by the Treasury and Investments and the Consumer (Retail)\nBanking segments are allocated based on market rates. The difference between the allocated interest income or expense and the\nCorporation’s actual net interest income from centralized management of funding costs is reported in the Treasury and Investments\nsegment. The United States Operations segment consists of all banking activities conducted by FirstBank in the United States\nmainland, including commercial and consumer banking services. The Virgin Islands Operations segment consists of all banking\nactivities conducted by the Corporation in the USVI and the BVI, including commercial and consumer banking services.\nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those referred to in Note 1 – “Nature of Business and Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies,” to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Corporation evaluates the performance of the segments based on net interest income, the provision for credit losses, non-\ninterest income and direct non-interest expenses. The segments are also evaluated based on the average volume of their interest-\nearning assets less the ACL.\n69\nFIRST BANCORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nThe following tables present information about the reportable segments for the indicated periods:\nCommercial and\nMortgage Consumer Corporate Treasury and United States Virgin Islands\nBanking (Retail) Banking Banking Investments Operations Operations Total\n(In thousands)\nQuarter ended September 30, 2024:\nInterest income $ 31,997 $ 96,478 $ 74,065 $ 28,099 $ 37,049 $ 6,987 $ 274,675\nNet (charge) credit for transfer of funds (18,407) 93,854 (54,133) (18,687) (2,627) -

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions\nby regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial statements and activities.\nUnder capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Corporation must meet specific\ncapital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Corporation’s and FirstBank’s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance\nsheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Corporation’s capital amounts and classification are also subject\nto qualitative judgments and adjustment by the regulators with respect to minimum capital requirements, components, risk weightings,\nand other factors. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation and FirstBank exceeded the minimum\nregulatory capital ratios for capital adequacy purposes and FirstBank exceeded the minimum regulatory capital ratios to be considered\na well-capitalized institution under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. As of September 30, 2024, management\ndoes not believe that any condition has changed or event has occurred that would have changed the institution’s status.\nThe Corporation and FirstBank compute risk-weighted assets using the standardized approach required by the U.S. Basel III capital\nrules (“Basel III rules”).\nThe Basel III rules require the Corporation to maintain an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% on certain regulatory\ncapital ratios to avoid limitations on both (i) capital distributions (e.g., repurchases of capital instruments, dividends and interest\npayments on capital instruments) and (ii) discretionary bonus payments to executive officers and heads of major business lines.\nAs part of its response to the impact of COVID-19, on March 31, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule\nthat provided the option to temporarily delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year\ntransition period. The interim final rule provides that, at the election of a qualified banking organization, the day one impact to\nretained earnings plus 25% of the change in the ACL (as defined in the final rule) from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021 will be\ndelayed for two years and phased-in at25% per year beginning on January 1, 2022 over a three-year period, resulting in a total\ntransition period of five years. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, the capital measures of the Corporation and the Bank included\n$48.6 million associated with the CECL day one impact to retained earnings plus 25% of the increase in the ACL (as defined in the\ninterim final rule) from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021, and $16.2 million remains excluded to be phased-in on January 1,\n2025.\n72\nFIRST BANCORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nThe regulatory capital position of the Corporation and FirstBank as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which reflects\nthe delay in the full effect of CECL on regulatory capital, were as follows:\nRegulatory Requirements\nTo be Well -Capitalized\nActual For Capital Adequacy Purposes Thresholds\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAs of September 30, 2024\nTotal Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)\nFirst BanCorp. $ 2,399,483 18.25% $ 1,051,684 8.0% N/A N/A\nFirstBank $ 2,367,463 18.01% $ 1,051,456 8.0% $ 1,314,320 10.0%\nCET1 Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)\nFirst BanCorp. $ 2,126,527 16.18% $ 591,572 4.5% N/A N/A\nFirstBank $ 2,102,892 16.00% $ 591,444 4.5% $ 854,308 6.5%\nTier I Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)\nFirst BanCorp. $ 2,126,527 16.18% $ 788,763 6.0% N/A N/A\nFirstBank $ 2,202,892 16.76% $ 788,592 6.0% $ 1,051,456 8.0%\nLeverage ratio\nFirst BanCorp. $ 2,126,527 10.96% $ 775,896 4.0% N/A N/A\nFirstBank $ 2,202,892 11.36% $ 775,647 4.0% $ 969,558 5.0%\nAs of December 31, 2023\nTotal Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)\nFirst BanCorp. $ 2,403,319 18.57% $ 1,035,589 8.0% N/A N/A\nFirstBank $ 2,376,003 18.36% $ 1,035,406 8.0% $ 1,294,257 10.0%\nCET1 Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)\nFirst BanCorp. $ 2,084,432 16.10% $ 528,519 4.5% N/A N/A%\nFirstBank $ 2,113,995 16.33% $ 582,416 4.5% $ 841,267 6.5%\nTier I Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)\nFirst BanCorp. $ 2,084,432 16.10% $ 776,692 6.0% N/A N/A\nFirstBank $ 2,213,995 17.11% $ 776,554 6.0% $ 1,035,406 8.0%\nLeverage ratio\nFirst BanCorp. $ 2,084,432 10.78% $ 773,615 4.0% N/A N/A\nFirstBank $ 2,213,995 11.45% $ 773,345 4.0% $ 966,682 5.0%\nCommitments\nThe Corporation enters into financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing\nneeds of its customers. These financial instruments may include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any conditions established in the\ncontract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since certain commitments are expected to\nexpire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. For most of\nthe commercial lines of credit, the Corporation has the option to reevaluate the agreement prior to additional disbursements. In the\ncase of credit cards and personal lines of credit, the Corporation can cancel the unused credit facility at any time and without cause. As\nof September 30, 2024, commitments to extend credit amounted to approximately $2.1 billion, of which $0.8 billion relates to retail\ncredit card loans. In addition, commercial and financial standby letters of credit as of September 30, 2024 amounted to approximately\n$67.5 million.\nContingencies\nAs of September 30, 2024, First BanCorp. and its subsidiaries were defendants in various legal proceedings, claims and other loss\ncontingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. On at least a quarterly basis, the Corporation assesses its liabilities and\ncontingencies in connection with threatened and outstanding legal proceedings, claims and other loss contingencies utilizing the latest\ninformation available. For legal proceedings, claims and other loss contingencies where it is both probable that the Corporation will\nincur a loss and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Corporation establishes an accrual for the loss. Once established, the\naccrual is adjusted as appropriate to reflect any relevant developments. For legal proceedings, claims and other loss contingencies\nwhere a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be estimated, no accrual is established.\n73\nFIRST BANCORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nAny estimate involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that some of them are\ncurrently in preliminary stages), the existence in some of the current proceedings of multiple defendants whose share of liability has\nyet to be determined, the numerous unresolved issues in the proceedings, and the inherent uncertainty of the various potential\noutcomes of such proceedings. Accordingly, the Corporation’s estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more\nor less than the current estimate.\nWhile the final outcome of legal proceedings, claims, and other loss contingencies is inherently uncertain, based on information\ncurrently available, management believes that the final disposition of the Corporation’s legal proceedings, claims and other loss\ncontingencies, to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s consolidated\nfinancial position as a whole.\nIf management believes that, based on available information, it is at least reasonably possible that a material loss (or material loss in\nexcess of any accrual) will be incurred in connection with any legal contingencies, the Corporation discloses an estimate of the\npossible loss or range of loss, either individually or in the aggregate, as appropriate, if such an estimate can be made, or discloses that\nan estimate cannot be made. Based on the Corporation’s assessment as of September 30, 2024, no such disclosures were necessary.\nIn 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to impose a special assessment to recover certain estimated losses to the Deposit Insurance\nFund (“DIF”) arising from the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The estimated losses will be recovered through\nquarterly special assessments collected from certain insured depository institutions, including the Bank, and collection began during\nthe quarter ended June 30, 2024. In connection with updates made by the FDIC to the initial estimated losses to the DIF, the\nCorporation recorded charges of $1.1 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 in the consolidated statements\nof income as part of “FDIC deposit insurance” expenses. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation’s total estimated FDIC special\nassessment amounted to $7.4 million, of which $1.6 million has been paid. The Corporation continues to monitor the FDIC’s\nestimated loss to the DIF, which could affect the amount of its accrued liability.\n74\nFIRST BANCORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nNOTE 22 – FIRST BANCORP.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (“MD&A”)\nThe following MD&A relates to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of First BanCorp. (the\n“Corporation,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or “First BanCorp.”) and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements and the notes\nthereto, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report on Form 10-\nK”). This section also presents certain financial measures that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates of America (“GAAP”). See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations” below for information about why non-\nGAAP financial measures are presented, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial\nmeasures, and references to non-GAAP financial measures reconciliations presented in other sections.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nFirst BanCorp. is a diversified financial holding company headquartered in San Juan, Puerto Rico, offering a full range of financial\nproducts to consumers and commercial customers through various subsidiaries. First BanCorp. is the holding company of FirstBank\nPuerto Rico (“FirstBank” or the “Bank”) and FirstBank Insurance Agency. Through its wholly -owned subsidiaries, the Corporation\noperates in Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands (“USVI”), the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”), and the state of Florida,\nconcentrating on commercial banking, residential mortgage loans, credit cards, personal loans, small loans, auto loans and leases, and\ninsurance agency activities.\nRecent Developments\nEconomy and Market Update\nIn light of the progress on inflation and a slower than expected growth in the labor market during August 2024, on September 18,\n2024 and November 11, 2024, the Federal Reserve (the “FED”) decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis\npoints (“bps”) and 25 bps, respectively. Nevertheless, recent indicators suggest that the U.S. economy has continued to expand at a\nsolid pace. Nonfarm payrolls for the month of September 2024 added 254,000 jobs and the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. Gross\nDomestic Product (“GDP”) rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.8% in the third quarter of 2024, slightly below estimates\nwhich were expecting a 3% growth.\nThe Corporation maintained positive credit performance and stable deposit trends and made good progress on its capital\ndeployment strategy. The U.S. and Puerto Rico economy remain on solid footing driven by positive labor market trends and increased\nbusiness activity. This environment continues to support credit demand and has enabled the Corporation to have its strongest quarter\nof commercial loan originations for the year thus far. The Corporation remains focused on expanding existing relationships, building\nloan pipeline, and adopting new platforms to enable future growth for the remainder of 2024 and for 2025.\nThe market expectations are for the FED to continue lowering rates and the federal funds rate is expected to be at 4.4% at the end of\nthis year and at 3.4% at the end of 2025. The Corporation expects the net interest margin to remain flat for the fourth quarter of 2024\nbut to improve for 2025. The Corporation expects the downward repricing of the commercial variable-rate portfolio to be\ncompensated by the repricing of the cash flows from the lower yielding investment portfolio, the redeployment of cash inflows from\nrepayments of investment securities into loans or higher yielding securities, and the repricing of deposits. In addition, the replacement\nof higher cost of funding such as brokered certificates of deposit (“CDs”) and junior subordinated debentures with lower cost of\nfunding is expected to improve the net interest margin as well.\nRepurchase of Trust -Preferred Securities (“TruPS”)\nIn September 2024, the Corporation redeemed $50.0 million, or 42%, of outstanding TruPS issued by FBP Statutory Trust II (or\n$48.5 million after excluding the Corporation’s interest in the Trust of approximately $1.5 million) at a contractual call price of 100%.\nThe redemption was part of the repurchase program approved in the third quarter of 2024 under which the Corporation may\nrepurchase up to $250 million of common stock or junior subordinated debentures, which it expects to execute through the end of the\nfourth quarter of 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation has remaining authorization of approximately $250.0 million in\ncombination with the remaining availability under the 2023 stock repurchase program.\n77\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES\nThe accounting principles of the Corporation and the methods of applying these principles conform to GAAP. In preparing the\nconsolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts\nrecorded for assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues\nand expenses during the reporting periods. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, as supplemented by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including this MD&A, describes the significant\naccounting policies we used in our consolidated financial statements.\nNot all significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Critical accounting\nestimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of uncertainty and have had or are\nreasonably likely to have a material impact on the Corporation’s financial condition and results of operations. The Corporation’s\ncritical accounting estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes include, but are not limited to, the following: (i)\nthe allowance for credit losses (“ACL”); (ii) valuation of financial instruments; and (iii) income taxes. For more information regarding\nvaluation of financial instruments and income tax policies, assumptions, and judgments, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Part\nII, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”),” in the 2023\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. The “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management” section of this MD&A details the policies,\nassumptions, and judgments related to the ACL. Actual results could differ from estimates and assumptions if different outcomes or\nconditions prevail.\nOverview of Results of Operations\nThe Corporation’s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income, which is the difference between the interest\nincome earned on its interest-earning assets, including investment securities and loans, and the interest expense incurred on its\ninterest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is affected by various factors, including the\nfollowing: (i) the interest rate environment; (ii) the volumes, mix, and composition of interest-earning assets, and interest-bearing\nliabilities; and (iii) the repricing characteristics of these assets and liabilities. The Corporation ’s results of operations also depend on\nthe provision for credit losses, non-interest expenses (such as personnel, occupancy, professional service fees, the FDIC insurance\npremium, and other costs), non-interest income (mainly service charges and fees on deposits, cards and processing income, and\ninsurance income), gains (losses) on mortgage banking activities, and income taxes.\nFor the quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation had net income of $73.7 million ($0.45 per\ndiluted common share) and $223.0 million ($1.35 per diluted common share), respectively, compared to $82.0 million ($0.46 per\ndiluted common share) and $223.4 million ($1.25 per diluted common share), respectively, for the comparable periods in 2023.

See “Results of Operations – Net Interest Income” below for additional information.\n● The provision for credit losses on loans, finance leases, unfunded loan commitments and debt securities for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was $15.2 million, compared to $4.4 million for the third quarter of 2023 . The increase in the provision\nexpense was driven by a $14.4 million increase in the provision for the consumer loan and finance lease portfolios due to\nhigher charge-off levels.\nNet charge-offs totaled $24.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, or 0.78% of average loans on an annualized\nbasis, compared to $14.1 million, or an annualized 0.48% of average loans, for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in net\ncharge-offs was mainly due to an increase in consumer loans and finance leases net charge -offs. See “Results of Operations –\nProvision for Credit Losses” and “Risk Management” below for analyses of the ACL and non-performing assets and related\nratios.\n● Non-interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased by $2.2 million, reflecting, among other things, $0.8\nmillion in insurance proceeds received in the third quarter of 2024 and an increase in revenues from mortgage banking\nactivities mainly due to a $0.8 million increase in the net realized gain on sales of residential mortgage loans in the secondary\nmarket.\n● Non-interest expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased by $6.3 million to $122.9 million, reflecting,\namong other things, a $2.5 million increase in employees’ compensation and benefits expenses driven by annual salary merit\nincreases, a $1.5 million increase in professional services fees driven by information technology infrastructure enhancements,\na $1.8 million increase in charges for operational and fraud losses, and a $0.8 million decrease in net gains on other real\nestate owned (“OREO”) operations. See “Results of Operations – Non-Interest Expenses” below for additional information.\n● Income tax expense decreased to $22.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $27.0 million for the same period in\n2023, driven by lower pre-tax income and a lower estimated effective tax rate due to increased business activities with\npreferential tax treatment under the PR Tax Code. The Corporation’s estimated effective tax rate, excluding entities with pre-\ntax losses from which a tax benefit cannot be recognized and discrete items, decreased to 23.7% for the first nine months of\n2024, compared to 28.2% for the same period of 2023. See “Income Taxes” below and Note 16 – “Income Taxes,” to the\nunaudited consolidated financial statements herein for additional information.\n● As of September 30, 2024, total assets were approximately $18.9 billion, a decrease of $50.4 million from December 31,\n2023, primarily related to repayments of investment securities, partially offset by an increase in total loans and cash and cash\nequivalents.\n● As of September 30, 2024, total liabilities were $17.2 billion, a decrease of $253.6 million from December 31, 2023, which\nincludes an increase in core deposits, which was more than offset by a decrease in brokered CDs and the redemption of\noutstanding TruPS issued by FBP Statutory Trust II. See “Risk Management – Liquidity Risk” below for additional\ninformation about the Corporation’s funding sources and strategy.\n● The Bank’s primary sources of funding are consumer and commercial core deposits, which exclude government deposits and\nbrokered CDs. As of September 30, 2024, these core deposits, amounting to $12.7 billion, funded 67.18% of total assets.\nExcluding fully collateralized government deposits, estimated uninsured deposits amounted to $4.6 billion as of September\n30, 2024. In addition to approximately $1.8 billion in cash and free high-quality liquid assets, the Bank maintains borrowing\ncapacity at the FHLB and the FED’s Discount Window. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had approximately $2.6\nbillion available for funding under the FED’s Discount Window and $964.7 million available for additional borrowing\ncapacity on FHLB lines of credit based on collateral pledged at these entities. In the aggregate, as of September 30, 2024, the\nCorporation had $6.1 billion, or 131% of estimated uninsured deposits (excluding fully collateralized government deposits),\navailable to meet liquidity needs. See “Risk Management – Liquidity Risk” below for additional information about the\nCorporation’s funding sources and strategy.\n79\n● As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation’s total stockholders’ equity was $1.7 billion, an increase of $203.3 million from\nDecember 31, 2023. The increase was driven by net income generated in the first nine months of 2024 and a $155.5 million\nincrease in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the\nconsolidated statements of financial condition, partially offset by $100.0 million in common stock repurchases under the\n2023 stock repurchase program and common stock dividends declared in the first nine months of 2024 totaling $79.7 million\nor $0.48 per common share. The Corporation’s CET1 capital, tier 1 capital, total capital, and leverage ratios were 16.18%,\n16.18%, 18.25%, and 10.96%, respectively, as of September 30, 2024, compared to CET1 capital, tier 1 capital, total capital,\nand leverage ratios of 16.10%, 16.10%, 18.57%, and 10.78%, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. See “Risk\nManagement – Capital” below for additional information.\n● Total loan production, including purchases, refinancings, renewals, and draws from existing revolving and non-revolving\ncommitments, increased by $4.8 million to $1.3 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the third\nquarter of 2023, driven by a higher volume of commercial and construction loan originations. See “Results of Operations –\nLoan Production” below for additional information.\n● Total non-performing assets were $119.1 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of $6.8 million, from December 31,\n2023, driven by a $13.3 million decrease in the OREO portfolio balance in the Puerto Rico region, mainly attributable to the\nsale of a $5.3 million commercial real estate OREO property and sales of residential OREO properties. This variance is net of\na $5.6 million increase in total nonaccrual loans held for investment mainly due to the inflow of a $16.5 million commercial\nrelationship in the food retail industry in the Puerto Rico region, partially offset by the sale of an $8.2 million nonaccrual\nC&I loan in the Puerto Rico region, that resulted in a $1.2 million charge -off that had been previously reserved. See “Risk\nManagement – Nonaccrual Loans and Non-Performing Assets” below for additional information.\n● Adversely classified commercial and construction loans increased by $10.2 million to $77.7 million as of September 30,\n2024, compared to December 31, 2023, also driven by the aforementioned inflow to nonaccrual status of a $16.5 million\ncommercial relationship in the Puerto Rico region and the downgrade of a $5.1 million commercial mortgage loan in the\nPuerto Rico region , partially offset by the aforementioned sale and charge -off of an $8.2 million nonaccrual C&I loan in the\nPuerto Rico region.\n80\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS\nThe Corporation has included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q the following financial measures that are not recognized under\nGAAP, which are referred to as non-GAAP financial measures:\nNet Interest Income, Interest Rate Spread, and Net Interest Margin, Excluding Valuations , and on a Tax -Equivalent Basis\nNet interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin are reported excluding the changes in the fair value of derivative\ninstruments and on a tax-equivalent basis in order to provide to investors additional information about the Corporation’s net interest\nincome that management uses and believes should facilitate comparability and analysis of the periods presented. The changes in the\nfair value of derivative instruments have no effect on interest due or interest earned on interest-bearing liabilities or interest-earning\nassets, respectively. The tax-equivalent adjustment to net interest income recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable\nand tax-exempt assets and assumes a marginal income tax rate. Income from tax-exempt earning assets is increased by an amount\nequivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. Management believes that it is a\nstandard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin on a fully tax-\nequivalent basis. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt securities and tax-exempt loans, on a common basis\nthat facilitates comparison of results to the results of peers.\nSee “Results of Operations – Net Interest Income” below, for the table that reconciles net interest income in accordance with GAAP\nto the non-GAAP financial measure of net interest income, excluding valuations, and on a tax-equivalent basis for the indicated\nperiods. The table also reconciles net interest spread and net interest margin on a GAAP basis to these items excluding valuations, and\non a tax-equivalent basis.\nTangible Common Equity Ratio and Tangible Book Value Per Common Share\nThe tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP financial measures that management\nbelieves are generally used by the financial community to evaluate capital adequacy. Tangible common equity is total common equity\nless goodwill and other intangibles. Similarly, tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangibles. Tangible common\nequity ratio is tangible common equity divided by tangible assets. Tangible book value per common share is tangible assets divided by\nthe number of common shares outstanding. Management uses and believes that many stock analysts use the tangible common equity\nratio and tangible book value per common share in conjunction with other more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital\nadequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, typically stemming from the use of\nthe purchase method of accounting for mergers and acquisitions. Accordingly, the Corporation believes that disclosures of these\nfinancial measures may be useful to investors. Neither tangible common equity nor tangible assets, or the related measures, should be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders’ equity, total assets, or any other measure calculated in accordance with\nGAAP. Moreover, the manner in which the Corporation calculates its tangible common equity, tangible assets, and any other related\nmeasures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names.\nSee “Risk Management – Capital” below for the table that reconciles the Corporation’s total equity and total assets in accordance\nwith GAAP to the tangible common equity and tangible assets figures used to calculate the non-GAAP financial measures of tangible\ncommon equity ratio and tangible book value per common share.\n81\nAdjusted Net Income, Adjusted Non-Interest Income, and Adjusted Non-Interest Expenses\nTo supplement the Corporation’s financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Corporation uses, and believes that\ninvestors benefit from disclosure of, non-GAAP financial measures that reflect adjustments to net income, non-interest income and\nnon-interest expenses to exclude items that management believes are not reflective of core operating performance (“Special Items”).\nThe financial results for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 did not include any significant Special Items. The financial\nresults for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included the following Special Items:\nNine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2024\n- Charges of $1.1 million ($0.7 million after-tax, calculated based on the statutory tax rate of 37.5%) were recorded in the nine-\nmonth period ended September 30, 2024, respectively, to increase the initial estimated FDIC special assessment resulting\nfrom the FDIC’s updates related to the loss estimate in connection with losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund associated with\nprotecting uninsured deposits following the failures of certain financial institutions during the first half of 2023. The\naforementioned charges increased the estimated FDIC special assessment to a total of $7.4 million, which was the revised\nestimated loss reflected in the FDIC invoice for the first quarterly collection period with a payment date of June 28, 2024.\nThe FDIC special assessment is reflected in the consolidated statements of income as part of “FDIC deposit insurance”\nexpenses.\nNine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2023\n- A $3.6 million ($2.3 million after-tax, calculated based on the statutory tax rate of 37.5%) gain recognized from a legal\nsettlement reflected in the consolidated statements of income as part of “other non-interest income.”\n- A $1.6 million gain on the repurchase of $21.4 million in junior subordinated debentures reflected in the consolidated\nstatements of income as “Gain on early extinguishment of debt.” The junior subordinated debentures are reflected in the\nconsolidated statements of financial condition as “Other long-term borrowings.” The purchase price equated to 92.5% of the\n$21.4 million par value of the trust preferred securities. The 7.5% discount resulted in the gain of $1.6 million. The gain,\nrealized at the holding company level, had no effect on the income tax expense in 2023.\nAdjusted Net Income – The following table reconciles for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net income\nto adjusted net income, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the Special Items identified above.\nNine-Month Period Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nNet income, as reported (GAAP) $ 223,023 $ 223,375\nAdjustments:\nFDIC special assessment expense 1,099 -\nGain recognized from a legal settlement - (3,600)\nGain on early extinguishment of debt - (1,605)\nIncome tax impact of adjustments(1) (412) 1,350\nAdjusted net income (Non-GAAP) $ 223,710 $ 219,520\n(1) See “Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Non-Interest Income, and Adjusted Non-Intere st Expenses” above for the individual tax impact rela ted to the above adjustments, which were based on\nthe Puerto Rico statutory tax rate of 37.5%, as applicable.\n82\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the excess of interest earned by First BanCorp. on its interest-earning assets over the interest incurred on its\ninterest-bearing liabilities. First BanCorp.’s net interest income is subject to interest rate risk due to the repricing and maturity\nmismatch of the Corporation’s assets and liabilities. In addition, variable sources of interest income, such as loan fees, periodic\ndividends, and collection of interest in nonaccrual loans, can fluctuate from period to period. Net interest income for the quarter and\nnine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was $202.1 million and $598.2 million, respectively, compared to $199.7 million and\n$600.4 million for the comparable periods in 2023, respectively. On a tax-equivalent basis and excluding the changes in the fair value\nof derivative instruments, net interest income for the quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was $206.6 million and\n$612.4 million, respectively, compared to $204.4 million and $617.0 million for the comparable periods in 2023, respectively.\nThe following tables include a detailed analysis of net interest income for the indicated periods. Part I presents average volumes\n(based on the average daily balance) and rates on an adjusted tax-equivalent basis and Part II presents, also on an adjusted tax-\nequivalent basis, the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-related assets and liabilities have\naffected the Corporation’s net interest income. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the tables\nprovide information on changes in (i) volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior period rates), and (ii) rate (changes in rate\nmultiplied by prior period volumes). The Corporation has allocated rate-volume variances (changes in rate multiplied by changes in\nvolume) to either the changes in volume or the changes in rate based upon the effect of each factor on the combined totals.\nNet interest income on an adjusted tax-equivalent basis and excluding the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments is a\nnon-GAAP financial measure. For the definition of this non-GAAP financial measure, refer to the discussion in “Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures and Reconciliations” above.\nPart I\nAverage volume Interest income(1) / expense Average rate(1)\nQuarter ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest-earning assets:\nMoney market and other short-term investments $ 645,398 $ 807,883 $ 8,782 $ 10,956 5.40% 5.38%\nGovernment obligations(2) 2,520,133 2,817,646 8,458 9,415 1.33% 1.33%\nMBS 3,290,547 3,650,737 13,830 15,677 1.67% 1.70%\nFHLB stock 33,985 34,666 804 768 9.39% 8.79%\nOther investments 19,726 14,294 73 61 1.47% 1.69%\nTotal investments(3) 6,509,789 7,325,226 31,947 36,877 1.95% 2.00%\nResidential mortgage loans 2,816,343 2,800,675 41,505 39,640 5.85% 5.62%\nConstruction loans 195,001 183,507 4,417 4,937 8.99% 10.67%\nC&I and commercial mortgage loans 5,616,658 5,261,849 102,768 93,711 7.26% 7.07%\nFinance leases 885,807 808,480 17,290 15,802 7.74% 7.75%\nConsumer loans 2,840,870 2,728,945 81,281 77,125 11.35% 11.21%\nTotal loans(4)(5) 12,354,679 11,783,456 247,261 231,215 7.94% 7.78%\nTotal interest-earning assets $ 18,864,468 $ 19,108,682 $ 279,208 $ 268,092 5.87% 5.57%\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nTime deposits $ 3,057,918 $ 2,708,297 $ 27,768 $ 19,852 3.60% 2.91%\nBrokered CDs 600,319 318,831 7,656 3,830 5.06% 4.77%\nOther interest-bearing deposits 7,429,163 7,956,856 28,280 30,616 1.51% 1.53%\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase - 26,254 - 359 -% 5.43%\nAdvances from the FHLB 500,000 500,000 5,672 5,675 4.50% 4.50%\nOther borrowings 155,722 161,700 3,235 3,345 8.24% 8.21%\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities $ 11,743,122 $ 11,671,938 $ 72,611 $ 63,677 2.45% 2.16%\nNet interest income on a tax-equivalent basis and excluding\nvaluations - non-GAAP $ 206,597 $ 204,415\nInterest rate spread 3.42% 3.41%\nNet interest margin 4.34% 4.24%\n83\nPart I\nAverage volume Interest income(1) / expense Average rate(1)\nNine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest-earning assets:\nMoney market and other short-term investments $ 615,679 $ 611,308 $ 25,096 $ 23,486 5.43% 5.14%\nGovernment obligations(2) 2,607,706 2,878,603 26,458 31,153 1.35% 1.45%\nMBS 3,366,866 3,756,654 43,407 52,160 1.72% 1.86%\nFHLB stock 34,217 37,234 2,476 1,969 9.64% 7.07%\nOther investments 17,978 13,729 383 258 2.84% 2.51%\nTotal investments(3) 6,642,446 7,297,528 97,820 109,026 1.96% 2.00%\nResidential mortgage loans 2,811,447 2,814,667 122,664 119,298 5.81% 5.67%\nConstruction loans 219,601 159,914 13,909 10,516 8.44% 8.79%\nC&I and commercial mortgage loans 5,550,259 5,207,216 302,761 268,886 7.27% 6.90%\nFinance leases 874,508 771,366 51,672 44,325 7.87% 7.68%\nConsumer loans 2,822,909 2,679,261 240,809 222,531 11.36% 11.10%\nTotal loans(4)(5) 12,278,724 11,632,424 731,815 665,556 7.94% 7.65%\nTotal interest-earning assets $ 18,921,170 $ 18,929,952 $ 829,635 $ 774,582 5.84% 5.47%\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nTime deposits $ 2,984,413 $ 2,522,061 $ 78,766 $ 46,301 3.52% 2.45%\nBrokered CDs 675,226 273,586 25,926 9,178 5.11% 4.49%\nOther interest-bearing deposits 7,497,046 7,674,759 85,708 70,308 1.52% 1.22%\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase - 72,648 - 2,756 -% 5.07%\nAdvances from the FHLB 500,000 553,993 16,892 18,899 4.50% 4.56%\nOther borrowings 159,693 174,307 9,921 10,135 8.28% 7.77%\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities $ 11,816,378 $ 11,271,354 $ 217,213 $ 157,577 2.45% 1.87%\nNet interest income on a tax-equivalent basis and excluding\nvaluations - non-GAAP $ 612,422 $ 617,005\nInterest rate spread 3.39% 3.60%\nNet interest margin 4.31% 4.36%\n(1) On an adjusted tax-equivalent basis. The Corporation estimated the adjusted tax-equivalent yield by dividing the interest rate spread on exempt assets by 1 less the Puerto Rico statutory tax\nrate of 37.5% and adding to it the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The tax-equivalent adjustment recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets.\nManagement believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income, interest rate spread and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis. Therefore,\nmanagement believes these measures provide useful information to investors by allowing them to make peer comparisons. The Corporation excludes changes in the fair value of derivatives\nfrom interest income because the changes in valuation do not affect interest received. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations\" above.\n(2) Government obligations include debt issued by government-sponsored agencies.\n(3) Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are excluded from the average volumes.\n(4) Average loan balances include the average of nonaccrual loans.\n(5) Interest income on loans includes $3.2 million and $2.9 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $9.5 million and $8.9 million for the nine-month\nperiods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of income from prepayment penalties and late fees related to the Corporation’s loan portfolio.\n84\nPart II Quarter Ended September 30, Nine-Month Period Ended September 30,\n2024 Compared to 2023 2024 Compared to 2023\nVariance due to: Variance due to:\nVolume Rate Total Volume Rate Total\n(In thousands)\nInterest income on interest-earning assets:\nMoney market and other short-term investments $ (2,207) $ 33 $ (2,174) $ 170 $ 1,440 $ 1,610\nGovernment obligations (996) 39 (957) (2,822) (1,873) (4,695)\nMBS (1,520) (327) (1,847) (5,185) (3,568) (8,753)\nFHLB stock (16) 52 36 (189) 696 507\nOther investments 22 (10) 12 87 38 125\nTotal investments (4,717) (213) (4,930) (7,939) (3,267) (11,206)\nResidential mortgage loans 223 1,642 1,865 (138) 3,504 3,366\nConstruction loans 285 (805) (520) 3,853 (460) 3,393\nC&I and commercial mortgage loans 6,442 2,615 9,057 18,261 15,614 33,875\nFinance leases 1,511 (23) 1,488 6,053 1,294 7,347\nConsumer loans 3,193 963 4,156 12,138 6,140 18,278\nTotal loans 11,654 4,392 16,046 40,167 26,092 66,259\nTotal interest income $ 6,937 $ 4,179 $ 11,116 $ 32,228 $ 22,825 $ 55,053\nInterest expense on interest-bearing liabilities:\nTime deposits $ 2,778 $ 5,138 $ 7,916 $ 9,605 $ 22,860 $ 32,465\nBrokered CDs 3,576 250 3,826 15,205 1,543 16,748\nOther interest-bearing deposits (2,011) (325) (2,336) (1,829) 17,229 15,400\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase (359) - (359) (2,756) - (2,756)\nAdvances from the FHLB - (3) (3) (1,821) (186) (2,007)\nOther borrowings (125) 15 (110) (879) 665 (214)\nTotal interest expense 3,859 5,075 8,934 17,525 42,111 59,636\nChange in net interest income $ 3,078 $ (896) $ 2,182 $ 14,703 $ (19,286) $ (4,583)\nPortions of the Corporation’s interest-earning assets, mostly investments in obligations of some U.S. government agencies and U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored entities (“GSEs”), generate interest that is exempt from income tax, principally in Puerto Rico. Also, interest\nand gains on sales of investments held by the Corporation’s international banking entities (“IBEs”) are tax-exempt under Puerto Rico\ntax law (see Note 16 – “Income Taxes” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein for additional information).\nManagement believes that the presentation of interest income on an adjusted tax-equivalent basis facilitates the comparison of all\ninterest data related to these assets. The Corporation estimated the tax equivalent yield by dividing the interest rate spread on exempt\nassets by 1 less the Puerto Rico statutory tax rate (37.5%) and adding to it the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The\ncomputation considers the interest expense disallowance required by Puerto Rico tax law.\nManagement believes that the presentation of net interest income, excluding the effects of the changes in the fair value of the\nderivative instruments (“valuations”), provides additional information about the Corporation’s net interest income and facilitates\ncomparability and analysis from period to period. The changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments have no effect on interest\nearned on interest-earning assets.\n85\nThe following table reconciles net interest income in accordance with GAAP to net interest income, excluding valuations, and net\ninterest income on an adjusted tax-equivalent basis for the indicated periods.

The $2.4 million increase in net interest income was primarily due to:\n● A $15.8 million increase in interest income on loans, including:\n- An $8.3 million increase in interest income on commercial and construction loans, driven by a $6.6 million increase\nassociated with a $366.3 million increase in the average balance, and a $2.9 million increase related to the effect of\nhigher market interest rates on the upward repricing of variable-rate loans and on new loan originations. These variances\nwere partially offset by interest income of $1.2 million recognized in the third quarter of 2023 due to the collection of a\npreviously charged-off construction loan in the Puerto Rico region.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the interest rate on approximately 54% of the Corporation’s commercial and construction\nloans was tied to variable rates, with 33% based upon SOFR of 3 months or less, 12% based upon the Prime rate index,\nand 9% based on other indexes.\n- A $5.6 million increase in interest income on consumer loans and finance leases, primarily associated with a $189.3\nmillion increase in the average balance of this portfolio, mainly auto loans and finance leases.\nPartially offset by:\n● An $8.9 million increase in interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, including :\n- A $7.9 million increase in interest expense on time deposits, excluding brokered CDs, of which $5.1 million was related\nto higher rates on renewals, associated with the overall higher interest rate environment, and $2.8 million was driven by a\n$349.6 million increase in the average balance. The average cost of time deposits in the third quarter of 2024, excluding\nbrokered CDs, increased 69 bps to 3.60% when compared to the same period in 2023.\n- A $3.8 million increase in interest expense on brokered CDs, driven by a $281.5 million increase in the average balance.\nPartially offset by:\n- A $2.3 million decrease in interest expense on interest-bearing checking and saving accounts, driven by a $527.7 million\ndecrease in the average balance.\n● A $4.5 million decrease in interest income from total investments, consisting of a $2.4 million decrease in interest income\nfrom debt securities, mainly associated with a $657.7 million decrease in the average balance, and a $2.1 million decrease in\ninterest income from interest-bearing cash balances, primarily cash balances deposited at the FED, driven by a $162.5 million\ndecrease in the average balance.\nNet interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 4.25%, compared to 4.15% for the same period in 2023. The increase in the\nnet interest margin was driven by a change in asset mix resulting from the deployment of cash flows from lower-yielding investment\nsecurities to fund loan growth as well as the effect of the higher interest rate environment on commercial and consumer loans yields.\nThese variances were partially offset by the higher cost of funds associated with the higher interest rate environment combined with a\nchange in deposit mix reflecting a continued migration from non-interest-bearing and other low-cost deposits to higher-cost deposits.\n87\nNet interest income amounted to $598.2 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $2.2 million,\nwhen compared to $600.4 million for same period in 2023. The $2.2 million decrease in net interest income was primarily due to:\n● A $59.6 million increase in interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, consisting of:\n- A $32.5 million increase in interest expense on time deposits, excluding brokered CDs, of which $22.9 million was\nrelated to higher rates in the first nine months of 2024 on new issuances and renewals , also associated with the higher\ninterest rate environment , and $9.6 million was driven by a $462.4 million increase in the average balance. The average\ncost of time deposits for the first nine months of 2024, excluding brokered CDs, increased 107 bps to 3.52% as compared\nto 2.45% for the same period in 2023.\n- A $16.7 million increase in interest expense on brokered CDs, driven by a $401.6 million increase in the average\nbalance.\n- A $15.4 million increase in interest expense on interest-bearing checking and saving accounts, also related to the overall\nhigher interest rate environment. The average cost of interest-bearing checking and saving accounts increased by 30 bps\nto 1.52% for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 1.22% for the same period in 2023, mostly driven by\ngovernment deposits in the Puerto Rico region. Excluding government deposits, the average cost of interest-bearing\nchecking and savings accounts for the first nine months of 2024 was 0.75%, compared to 0.69% for the same period in\n2023.\nPartially offset by:\n- A $5.0 million decrease in interest expense on borrowings, mainly due to a $2.8 million decrease on short-term\nrepurchase agreements since they were not used as a funding source in the first nine months of 2024, and a $2.0 million\ndecrease on advances from the FHLB, mainly associated with a $54.0 million decrease in the average balance.\n● A $6.7 million decrease in interest income from total investments, mainly due to a $9.0 million net decrease in interest\nincome from debt securities, mainly associated with a $660.7 million decrease in the average balance, partially offset by a\n$1.6 million increase in interest income from interest-bearing cash balances, which consisted primarily of cash balances\ndeposited at the FED, due to the effect of higher market interest rates.\nPartially offset by:\n● A $64.1 million increase in interest income on loans, including:\n- A $35.1 million increase in interest income on commercial and construction loans, driven by a $23.1 million increase\nassociated with a $402.7 million increase in the average balance, and a $12.0 million increase related to the effect of\nhigher market interest rates on the upward repricing of variable-rate loans and on new loan originations.\n- A $25.6 million increase in interest income on consumer loans and finance leases, primarily due to a $246.8 million\nincrease in the average balance of this portfolio, mainly auto loans and finance leases.\nNet interest margin for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 4.21%, compared to 4.24% for the same period in\n2023. The decrease in the net interest margin was driven by the higher cost of funds associated with the higher interest rate\nenvironment combined with a change in deposit mix reflecting a continued migration from non-interest-bearing and other low-cost\ndeposits to higher-cost deposits, as well as the increase in balance of brokered CDs. These variances were partially offset by a change\nin asset mix resulting from the deployment of cash flows from lower-yielding investment securities to fund loan growth as well as the\neffect of the higher interest rate environment on commercial and consumer loans yields.\n88\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses consists of provisions for credit losses on loans and finance leases, unfunded loan commitments, as\nwell as the debt securities portfolio. The principal changes in the provision for credit losses by main categories follow:\nProvision for credit losses for loans and finance leases\nThe provision for credit losses for loans and finance leases was $16.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $10.6\nmillion for the third quarter of 2023. The variances by major portfolio category were as follows:\n● Provision for credit losses for the consumer loan and finance lease portfolios was an expense of $28.4 million for the third\nquarter of 2024, compared to an expense of $14.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in provision expense was\ndriven by higher charge-off levels in these portfolios.\n● Provision for credit losses for the commercial and construction loan portfolios was a net benefit of $6.4 million for the third\nquarter of 2024, compared to a net benefit of $0.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The net benefit recorded during the\nthird quarter of 2024 was associated with the improved financial condition of certain borrowers and, to a lesser extent, an\nimprovement on the economic outlook of certain macroeconomic variables, particularly variables associated with commercial\nreal estate property performance and the forecasted commercial real estate (“CRE”) price index.\n● Provision for credit losses for the residential mortgage loan portfolio was a net benefit of $5.5 million for the third quarter of\n2024, compared to a net benefit of $3.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. The net benefit recorded during the third quarter\nof 2024 was driven by a higher benefit associated with updated macroeconomic variables, mainly in the long-term projection\nof the unemployment rate in the Puerto Rico region.\nThe provision for credit losses for loans and finance leases was $41.3 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $47.7\nmillion for the same period of 2023. The variances by major portfolio category were as follows:\n● Provision for credit losses for the commercial and construction loan portfolios was a net benefit of $13.4 million for the first\nnine months of 2024, compared to an expense of $10.6 million for the same period of 2023. The net benefit recorded during\nthe first nine months of 2024 was driven by the aforementioned improved financial condition of certain borrowers, a recovery\nof $5.0 million associated with a C&I loan in the Puerto Rico region, and $1.2 million in recoveries of two commercial loans\nin the Florida region, partially offset by increased volume. Meanwhile, the expense recorded during the first nine months of\n2023 was mainly due to a deterioration in the forecasted CRE price index, a $6.2 million charge associated with a nonaccrual\nparticipated C&I loan in the Florida region associated with the power generation industry, the aforementioned incremental\nreserve associated with the inflow to nonaccrual status of a $9.5 million C&I loan in the Puerto Rico region and, to a lesser\nextent, portfolio growth.\n● Provision for credit losses for the residential mortgage loan portfolio was a net benefit of $16.6 million for the first nine\nmonths of 2024, compared to a net benefit of $6.8 million for the same period of 2023. The increase in net benefit recorded\nduring the first nine months of 2024 was driven by updated historical loss experience used for determining the ACL estimate\nresulting in a downward revision of estimated loss severities and lower required reserve levels as further explained in Note 3\n– “Loans Held for Investment” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein, and the aforementioned updated\nmacroeconomic variables, partially offset by newly originated loans.\n● Provision for credit losses for the consumer loan and finance lease portfolios was an expense of $71.3 million for the first\nnine months of 2024, compared to an expense of $43.9 million for the same period of 2023. The increase in provision\nexpense was driven by higher charge -off levels in these portfolios and increases in portfolio volumes, partially offset by a\n$10.0 million recovery associated with the bulk sale of fully charged -off loans recorded during the first nine months of 2024.\n89\nProvision for credit losses for unfunded loan commitments\nThe provision for credit losses for unfunded commercial and construction loan commitments and standby letters of credit for the\nthird quarter and the first nine months of 2024 was a net benefit of $1.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively, compared to a net\nbenefit of $0.1 million and an expense of $0.5 million, for the same periods in 2023, respectively. The net benefit recorded during the\nthird quarter and first nine months of 2024 was driven by an improvement on the economic outlook of certain macroeconomic\nvariables, particularly in variables associated with the CRE price index.\nProvision for credit losses for held-to-maturity and available-for-sale debt securities\nT he provision for credit losses for held-to-maturity debt securities was a net benefit of $0.1 million and a net benefit of $1.1 million\nfor the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to a net benefit of $6.2 million and $6.0 million,\nrespectively, for the same periods in 2023. The net benefit recorded during the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 was driven\nby the refinancing of a $46.5 million municipal bond into a shorter-term commercial loan structure and, to a lesser extent, a reduction\nin qualitative reserves driven by updated financial information of certain bond issuers received during the third quarter of 2023.\nThe provision for credit losses for available-for-sale debt securities for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was a net\nbenefit of $36 thousand and a net benefit of $45 thousand, respectively, compared to an expense of $32 thousand and $7 thousand,\nrespectively, for the same periods in 2023.\n90\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income amounted to $32.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $30.3 million for the same period in\n2023. The $2.2 million increase in non-interest income was primarily due to:\n● A $0.9 million increase in card and processing income, mainly in merchant-related fees and interchange income due to higher\ntransactional volumes.\n● A $0.6 million increase in other non-interest income, driven by $0.8 million in insurance proceeds received in the third\nquarter of 2024 related to a 2020 outstanding insurance claim.\n● A $0.4 million increase in revenues from mortgage banking activities, driven by a $0.8 million increase in the net realized\ngain on sales of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market due to higher margins, partially offset by a $0.3 million\ndecrease in the fair value of to-be-announced (“TBA”) forward contracts. During the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, net\nrealized gains of $1.7 million and $0.9 million, respectively, were recognized as a result of GNMA securitization transactions\nand whole loan sales to U.S. GSEs amounting to $38.2 million and $42.3 million, respectively.\nNon-interest income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 amounted to $98.5 million, compared to $99.1 million\nfor the same period in 2023. Non-interest income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 included the following Special\nItems: the $3.6 million gain recognized from a legal settlement, included as part of “other non-interest income,” and the $1.6 million\ngain on the repurchase of $21.4 million in junior subordinated debentures, reported as “gain on early extinguishment of debt.” See\n“Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations” above for additional information. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the effect\nof these Special Items, adjusted non-interest income increased by $4.6 million primarily due to:\n● A $1.7 million increase in card and processing income, mainly in merchant-related fees and interchange income due to\nhigher transactional volumes.\n● A $1.0 million increase in revenues from mortgage banking activities, driven by a $1.4 million increase in the net realized\ngain on sales of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market due to higher margins. During the first nine months of\n2024 and 2023, net realized gains of $4.3 million and $2.9 million, respectively, were recognized as a result of GNMA\nsecuritization transactions and whole loan sales to U.S. GSEs amounting to $113.2 million and $131.5 million,\nrespectively.\n● A $0.9 million increase in insurance commission income, mainly related to higher contingent commissions.\n● The aforementioned $0.8 million in insurance proceeds received in the third quarter of 2024, included as part of “other\nnon-interest income.”\n91\nNon-Interest Expenses\nNon-interest expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 amounted to $122.9 million, compared to $116.6 million for the\nsame period in 2023. The efficiency ratio for the third quarter of 2024 was 52.41%, compared to 50.71% for the third quarter of 2023.\nThe $6.3 million increase was primarily due to:\n● A $2.5 million increase in employees’ compensation and benefits expenses, driven by annual salary merit increases.\n● A $1.5 million increase in professional service fees, due to increases of $1.0 million in consulting fees driven by\ninformation technology infrastructure enhancements and $0.5 million in outsourced technology service fees.\n● A $0.9 million increase in other non-interest expenses, mainly due to a $1.8 million increase in charges for operational and\nfraud losses, partially offset by decreases of $0.4 million in amortization of intangible assets (mainly from core deposit\nintangible assets related to savings accounts from the Banco Santander Puerto Rico acquisition, which were fully\namortized in 2024), $0.3 million in insurance fees, and $0.2 million in net periodic cost of pension plans.\n● A $0.8 million decrease in net gains on OREO operations, driven by a decrease in net realized gains on sales of residential\nOREO properties in the Puerto Rico region.\nNon-interest expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 amounted to $362.5 million, compared to $344.8\nmillion for the same period in 2023. The efficiency ratio for the first nine months of 2024 was 52.03%, compared to 49.29% for the\nfirst nine months of 2023. Non-interest expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 include the $1.1 million\nadditional FDIC special assessment expense. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations” above for additional\ninformation. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the effect of this Special Item, adjusted non-interest expenses increased by $16.6\nmillion primarily due to:\n● An $8.8 million increase in employees’ compensation and benefits expenses, driven by annual salary merit increases and\nincreases in stock-based compensation expense, matching contributions to the employees’ retirement plan and medical\ninsurance premium costs.\n● A $3.1 million increase in professional service fees, mainly due to a $2.4 million increase in consulting fees driven by\ninformation technology infrastructure enhancements.\n● A $1.8 million increase in credit and debit card processing fees, driven by higher transactional volumes.\n● A $1.6 million increase in occupancy and equipment expenses, mainly related to an increase in maintenance charges,\npartially offset by a decrease in depreciation charges.\n● A $1.6 million increase in other non-interest expenses, mainly due to a $2.8 million increase in charges for operational and\nfraud losses, partially offset by decreases of $0.8 million in amortization of intangible assets due to the aforementioned\ncore deposit intangible assets which were fully amortized in 2024, and $0.5 million in net periodic cost of pension plans.\n92\nIncome Taxes\nFor the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, the Corporation recorded an income tax expense of $22.7 million and $72.2\nmillion, respectively, compared to $27.0 million and $89.2 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The decrease in income\ntax expense for the third quarter of 2024 was mainly due to lower pre-tax income and, to a lesser extent, a lower estimated effective\ntax rate due to increased business activities with preferential tax treatment under the PR Tax Code and a $0.4 million tax contingency\naccrual release in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitation on some uncertain tax positions. Meanwhile, the decrease\nin income tax expense for the first nine months of 2024 was driven by a lower estimated effective tax rate due to the aforementioned\nincreased business activities with preferential tax treatment and, to a lesser extent, lower pre-tax income.\nThe Corporation’s annual estimated effective tax rate, excluding entities with pre-tax losses from which a tax benefit cannot be\nrecognized and discrete items, was 23.7% for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 28.2% for the same period in 2023. The\nestimated effective tax rate of the Corporation is impacted by, among other things, the composition and source of its taxable income.\nSee Note 16 – “Income Taxes, ” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein for additional information.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had a net deferred tax asset of $137.5 million, net of a valuation allowance of $121.6\nmillion against the deferred tax asset, compared to a net deferred tax asset of $150.1 million, net of a valuation allowance of $139.2\nmillion, as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in the net deferred tax asset was mainly related to the usage of alternative minimum\ntax credits and the decrease in the ACL. Meanwhile, the decrease in the valuation allowance was related primarily to changes in the\nmarket value of available -for-sale debt securities which resulted in an equal change in the net deferred tax asset without impacting\nearnings.\n93\nAssets\nThe Corporation’s total assets were $18.9 billion as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of $50.4 million from December 31, 2023,\nprimarily related to repayments of investment securities, partially offset by an increase in total loans and cash and cash equivalents.\nLoans Receivable, including Loans Held for Sale\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Corporation’s total loan portfolio before the ACL amounted to $12.5 billion, an increase of $265.8\nmillion compared to December 31, 2023. In terms of geography, the growth consisted of increases of $162.9 million in the Puerto\nRico region and $146.0 million in the Florida region, partially offset by a decrease of $43.1 million in the Virgin Islands region. On a\nportfolio basis, the growth consisted of increases of $178.4 million in commercial and construction loans, $83.7 million in consumer\nloans, primarily auto loans and finance leases, and $3.7 million in residential mortgage loans.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Corporation’s loans held-for-investment portfolio was comprised of commercial and construction\nloans (48%), consumer and finance leases (29%), and residential real estate loans (23%). Of the total gross loan portfolio held for\ninvestment of $12.4 billion as of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had credit risk concentration of approximately 80% in the\nPuerto Rico region, 17% in the United States region (mainly in the state of Florida), and 3% in the Virgin Islands region, as shown in\nthe following table:\nAs of September 30, 2024 Puerto Rico Virgin Islands United States Total\n(In thousands)\nResidential mortgage loans $ 2,168,590 $ 159,088 $ 492,469 $ 2,820,147\nConstruction loans 173,352 2,001 31,989 207,342\nCommercial mortgage loans 1,728,552 68,781 674,547 2,471,880\nC&I loans 2,161,688 81,942 961,683 3,205,313\nTotal commercial loans 4,063,592 152,724 1,668,219 5,884,535\nConsumer loans and finance leases 3,663,990 69,751 7,601 3,741,342\nTotal loans held for investment, gross $ 9,896,172 $ 381,563 $ 2,168,289 $ 12,446,024\nLoans held for sale 12,641 - - 12,641\nTotal loans, gross $ 9,908,813 $ 381,563 $ 2,168,289 $ 12,458,665\nAs of December 31, 2023 Puerto Rico Virgin Islands United States Total\n(In thousands)\nResidential mortgage loans $ 2,187,875 $ 168,131 $ 465,720 $ 2,821,726\nConstruction loans 111,664 3,737 99,376 214,777\nCommercial mortgage loans 1,725,325 65,312 526,446 2,317,083\nC&I loans 2,130,368 119,040 924,824 3,174,232\nTotal commercial loans 3,967,357 188,089 1,550,646 5,706,092\nConsumer loans and finance leases 3,583,272 68,498 5,895 3,657,665\nTotal loans held for investment, gross $ 9,738,504 $ 424,718 $ 2,022,261 $ 12,185,483\nLoans held for sale 7,368 - - 7,368\nTotal loans, gross $ 9,745,872 $ 424,718 $ 2,022,261 $ 12,192,851\n94\nResidential Real Estate Loans\nA s of September 30, 2024, the Corporation’s total residential mortgage loan portfolio, including loans held for sale, increased by\n$3.7 million compared to the balance as of December 31, 2023. The increase in the residential mortgage loan portfolio reflects an\nincrease of $26.7 million in the Florida region, partially offset by decreases of $14.0 million in the Puerto Rico region and $9.0 million\nin the Virgin Islands region. The increase was driven by the volume of new loan originations kept on the balance sheet, which more\nthan offset repayments. Approximately 48% of the $254.5 million residential mortgage loan originations in the Puerto Rico region\nduring the first nine monthso f 2024 consisted of conforming loans, compared to 52% of the $243.2 million originated for the first\nnine months of 2023.\nA s of September 30, 2024, the majority of the Corporation’s outstanding balance of residential mortgage loans in the Puerto Rico\nand the Virgin Islands regions consisted of fixed-rate loans that traditionally carry higher yields than residential mortgage loans in the\nFlorida region. In the Florida region, approximately 35% of the residential mortgage loan portfolio consisted of hybrid adjustable-rate\nmortgages. In accordance with the Corporation’s underwriting guidelines, residential mortgage loans are primarily fully documented\nloans, and the Corporation does not originate negative amortization loans.\nCommercial and Construction Loans\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Corporation’s commercial and construction loans portfolio increased by $178.4 million, as compared\nto the balance as of December 31, 2023. The growth included an increase of $117.6 million in the Florida region, reflecting, among\nother things, the effect of the origination of various commercial and construction relationships, each in excess of $10 million, of which\n$109.3 million are related to six C&I relationships and $52.3 million are related to three commercial mortgage relationships. These\nvariances were partially offset by payoffs and paydowns of four C&I relationships totaling $56.6 million and lower utilization of C&I\nlines of credit.\nThe Puerto Rico region also grew by $96.2 million, when compared to the balance as of December 31, 2023. This increase was\ndriven by a $61.7 million increase in construction loans; the origination of two commercial relationships with an aggregate balance of\n$72.4 million; higher utilization of C&I lines of credit; and the origination of two loans to municipalities with an aggregate balance of\n$27.7 million. These variances were partially offset by multiple payoffs and paydowns, including the payoffs of three commercial and\nconstruction relationships totaling $47.5 million and the sale of an $8.2 million nonaccrual C&I loan, net of a $1.2 million charge -off.\nIn the Virgin Islands region, commercial and construction loans decreased by $35.4 million, as compared to the balance as of\nDecember 31, 2023, mainly associated with a $42.6 million repayment of a government line of credit.\nSee “Risk Management – Exposure to Puerto Rico Government” and “Risk Management – Exposure to USVI Government” below\nfor information on the Corporation’s credit exposure to PR and USVI government entities.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Corporation’s total commercial mortgage loan exposure amounted to $2.5 billion, or 20% of the\ntotal loan portfolio. In terms of geography, $1.7 billion of the exposure was in the Puerto Rico region, $0.7 billion of the exposure was\nin the Florida region, and $0.1 billion of the exposure was in the Virgin Islands region. The $1.7 billion exposure in the Puerto Rico\nregion was comprised mainly of 41% in the retail industry, 26% in office real estate, and 21% in the hotel industry. The $0.7 billion\nexposure in the Florida region was comprised mainly of 33% in the retail industry, 23% in the hotel industry, and 8% in office real\nestate. Of the Corporation’s total commercial mortgage loan exposure of $2.5 billion, $400.2 million matures within the next 12\nmonths and has a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 6.17%. Commercial mortgage loan exposure in the office real estate\nindustry, which matures within the next 12 months, amounted to $108.1 million and has a weighted-average interest rate of\napproximately 6.22%.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation’s total exposure to shared national credit (“SNC”) loans\n(including unused commitments) amounted to $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, approximately\n$385.3 million of the SNC exposure is related to the portfolio in the Puerto Rico region and $870.3 million is related to the portfolio in\nthe Florida region.\nConsumer Loans and Finance Leases\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Corporation’s consumer loans and finance leases portfolio increased by $83.7 million to $3.7 billion,\nmainly in the Puerto Rico region, reflecting growth of $69.4 million and $36.6 million in the auto loan and finance lease portfolios,\nrespectively, partially offset by decreases in the remaining portfolio classes.\n95\nLoan Production\nFirst BanCorp. relies primarily on its retail network of branches to originate residential and consumer loans. The Corporation may\nsupplement its residential mortgage originations with wholesale servicing released mortgage loan purchases from mortgage bankers.\nThe Corporation manages its construction and commercial loan originations through centralized units and most of its originations\ncome from existing customers, as well as through referrals and direct solicitations. Auto loans and finance leases originations rely\nprimarily on relationships with auto dealers and dedicated sales professionals who serve selected locations to facilitate originations.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of First BanCorp.’s loan production, including purchases, refinancings, renewals and\ndraws from existing revolving and non-revolving commitments by geographic segment, for the indicated periods:\nQuarter Ended September 30, Nine-Month Period Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nPuerto Rico:\nResidential mortgage $ 94,258 $ 93,237 $ 254,525 $ 243,202\nConstruction 33,898 36,758 108,008 94,025\nCommercial mortgage 63,646 25,763 165,400 122,454\nC&I 419,673 452,889 1,162,239 1,267,866\nConsumer 406,448 452,264 1,204,999 1,318,950\nTotal loan production $ 1,017,923 $ 1,060,911 $ 2,895,171 $ 3,046,497\nVirgin Islands:\nResidential mortgage $ 791 $ 1,320 $ 2,913 $ 3,089\nConstruction 131 - 293 6\nCommercial mortgage 6,949 112 7,372 3,971\nC&I 18,447 21,545 41,907 96,159\nConsumer 9,995 9,581 26,788 31,189\nTotal loan production $ 36,313 $ 32,558 $ 79,273 $ 134,414\nFlorida:\nResidential mortgage $ 21,864 $ 35,295 $ 69,849 $ 76,114\nConstruction 10,510 9,585 31,165 34,817\nCommercial mortgage 30,539 33,357 108,472 63,883\nC&I 184,936 125,947 576,189 342,812\nConsumer 530 187 3,957 1,216\nTotal loan production $ 248,379 $ 204,371 $ 789,632 $ 518,842\nTotal:\nResidential mortgage $ 116,913 $ 129,852 $ 327,287 $ 322,405\nConstruction 44,539 46,343 139,466 128,848\nCommercial mortgage 101,134 59,232 281,244 190,308\nC&I 623,056 600,381 1,780,335 1,706,837\nConsumer 416,973 462,032 1,235,744 1,351,355\nTotal loan production $ 1,302,615 $ 1,297,840 $ 3,764,076 $ 3,699,753\n96\nCommercial and construction loan originations (excluding government loans) for the quarter and nine-month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 increased by $102.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, mainly due to\nincreases of $57.1 million in the Florida region and $39.9 million in the Puerto Rico region. For the first nine monthsof 2024, the\nincrease of $259.8 million was mainly due to an increase of $274.3 million in the Florida region. The growth in the Florida region for\nthe f irst nine months of 2024 includes the effect of the origination of ten C&I relationships, each in excess of $10 million, with an\naggregate balance of $193.7 million, increased utilization of C&I lines of credit, and an increase in the commercial mortgage loan\nportfolio of $44.6 million.\nGovernment loan originations for the quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 amounted to $45.1 million and\n$83.9 million, respectively, compared to $85.1 million and $168.7 million, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2023. The\ndecrease for the first nine months of 2024 was mainly related to the refinancing of a $46.5 million municipal bond into a commercial\nloan in the Puerto Rico region for the first nine months of 2023 and lower line of credit utilization in the Virgin Islands region.\nOriginations of auto loans (including finance leases) for the quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 amounted to\n$238.8 million and $700.8 million, respectively, compared to $259.2 million and $754.6 million, respectively, for the comparable\nperiods in 2023. The decrease in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, as compared with the same periods in 2023, was\nmainly in the Puerto Rico region. Other consumer loan originations, other than credit cards, for the quarter and nine-month period\nended September 30, 2024 amounted to $60.9 million and $185.4 million, respectively, compared to $79.5 million and $229.0 million,\nrespectively, for the comparable periods in 2023. Most of the decrease in other consumer loan originations for the third quarter and\nfirst nine months of 2024, as compared with the same periods in 2023, was in the Puerto Rico region. The utilization activity on the\noutstanding credit card portfolio for the quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 amounted to $117.2 million and\n$349.5 million, respectively, compared to $123.4 million and $367.8 million, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2023.\n97\nInvestment Activities\nAs part of its liquidity, revenue diversification, and interest rate risk management strategies, First BanCorp. maintains a debt\nsecurities portfolio classified as available for sale or held to maturity.\nThe Corporation’s total available-for-sale debt securities portfolio as of September 30, 2024 amounted to $4.9 billion, a $335.2\nmillion decrease from December 31, 2023. The decrease was driven by repayments of approximately $274.3 million of U.S. agencies\nMBS and debentures, and repayments of $255.9 million associated to matured securities . These variances were partially offset by a\n$155.5 million increase in fair value attributable to changes in market interest rates and $44.1 million in purchases of Community\nReinvestment Act qualified debt securities, mainly commercial MBS, during the first nine months of 2024. As of September 30, 2024,\nthe Corporation had a net unrealized loss on available-for-sale debt securities of $477.3 million. This net unrealized loss is attributable\nto instruments on books carrying a lower interest rate than market rates. The Corporation expects that this unrealized loss will reverse\nover time and it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery. The Corporation expects the\nportfolio will continue to decrease and the accumulated other comprehensive loss will decrease accordingly, excluding the impact of\nmarket interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, approximately $480 million and $350 million in cash inflows, which are expected to\nbe received during the remainder of 2024 and in the first quarter of 2025, respectively, from contractual maturities of the available-for-\nsale debt securities portfolio, are expected to be redeployed to fund loan growth, reinvested into higher-yielding securities, or used to\nrepay maturing brokered CDs.\nAs of September 30, 2024, substantially all of the Corporation’s available-for-sale debt securities portfolio was invested in U.S.\ngovernment and agencies debentures and fixed-rate GSEs’ MBS. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Corporation held a bond\nissued by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority (“PRHFA”), classified as available for sale, specifically a residential pass-\nthrough MBS in the aggregate amount of $3.0 million (fair value - $1.6 million). This residential pass-through MBS issued by the\nPRHFA is collateralized by certain second mortgages originated under a program launched by the Puerto Rico government in 2010\nand had an unrealized loss of $1.4 million as of September 30, 2024, of which $0.3 million is due to credit deterioration. During 2021,\nthe Corporation placed this instrument in nonaccrual status based on the delinquency status of the underlying second mortgage loans\ncollateral.\nHeld-to-maturity debt securities include fixed-rate GSEs’ MBS with a carrying value of $231.0 million (fair value of $222.2\nmillion) as of September 30, 2024, compared to $247.1 million as of December 31, 2023. Held-to-maturity debt securities also include\nfinancing arrangements with Puerto Rico municipalities issued in bond form, which the Corporation accounts for as securities, but\nwhich were underwritten as loans with features that are typically found in commercial loans. Puerto Rico municipal bonds typically\nare not issued in bearer form, are not registered with the SEC, and are not rated by external credit agencies. These bonds have\nseniority to the payment of operating costs and expenses of the municipality and, in most cases, are supported by assigned property tax\nrevenues. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 57% of the Corporation’s municipal bonds consisted of obligations issued by\nthree of the largest municipalities in Puerto Rico. The municipalities are required by law to levy special property taxes in such\namounts as are required for the payment of all of their respective general obligation bonds and loans. As of September 30, 2024, the\nCorporation’s held-to-maturity debt securities portfolio, before the ACL, decreased to $323.1 million, compared to $354.2 million as\nof December 31, 2023, driven by repayments of approximately $16.6 million of U.S. agencies MBS and $15.9 million of Puerto Rico\nmunicipal bonds.\nSee “Risk Management – Exposure to Puerto Rico Government” below for information and details about the Corporation’s total\ndirect exposure to the Puerto Rico government, including municipalities, and “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management” below\nand Note 2 – “Debt Securities” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein for the ACL of the exposure to Puerto Rico\nmunicipal bonds.\n98\nThe following table presents the carrying values of investments as of the indicated dates:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(In thousands)\nMoney market investments $ 1,343 $ 1,239\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities, at fair value:\nU.S. government and agencies obligations 2,261,777 2,443,790\nPuerto Rico government obligations 1,567 1,415\nMBS:\nResidential 2,438,532 2,633,161\nCommercial 191,905 151,618\nOther 1,000 -\nTotal available-for-sale debt securities, at fair value 4,894,781 5,229,984\nHeld-to-maturity debt securities, at amortized cost:\nMBS:\nResidential 133,852 146,468\nCommercial 97,164 100,670\nPuerto Rico municipal bonds 92,126 107,040\nACL for held-to-maturity Puerto Rico municipal bonds (1,119) (2,197)\nTotal held-to-maturity debt securities 322,023 351,981\nEquity securities, including $34.0 million and $34.6 million of FHLB stock\nas of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 52,432 49,675\nTotal money market investments and investment securities $ 5,270,579 $ 5,632,879\nThe carrying values of debt securities as of September 30, 2024 by contractual maturity (excluding MBS), are shown below:\nCarrying Amount Weighted-Average Yield %\n(Dollars in thousands)\nU.S. government and agencies obligations:\nDue within one year $ 1,037,767 0.82\nDue after one year through five years 1,215,849 0.85\nDue after ten years 8,161 5.21\n2,261,777 0.85\nPuerto Rico government and municipalities obligations:\nDue within one year 2,131 5.62\nDue after one year through five years 61,119 7.81\nDue after five years through ten years 13,121 6.42\nDue after ten years 17,322 7.39\n93,693 7.48\nOther 1,000 2.34\nMBS 2,861,453 1.72\nACL on held-to-maturity debt securities (1,119) -\nTotal debt securities $ 5,216,804 1.46\n99\nNet interest income in future periods could be affected by prepayments of MBS. Any acceleration in the prepayments of MBS\npurchased at a premium would lower yields on these securities, since the amortization of premiums paid upon acquisition would\naccelerate. Conversely, acceleration of the prepayments of MBS would increase yields on securities purchased at a discount, since the\naccretion of the discount would accelerate. These risks are directly linked to future period market interest rate fluctuations. Net interest\nincome in future periods might also be affected by the Corporation’s investment in callable securities. As of September 30, 2024, the\nCorporation had approximately $1.5 billion in callable debt securities (U.S. agencies debt securities) with an average yield of 0.81%\nof which approximately 62% were purchased at a discount and 2% at a premium. See “Risk Management” below for further analysis\nof the effects of changing interest rates on the Corporation’s net interest income and the Corporation’s interest rate risk management\nstrategies. Also, refer to Note 2 – “Debt Securities” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein for additional\ninformation regarding the Corporation’s debt securities portfolio.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nGeneral\nRisks are inherent in virtually all aspects of the Corporation’s business activities and operations. Consequently, effective risk\nmanagement is fundamental to the success of the Corporation. The primary goals of risk management are to ensure that the\nCorporation’s risk-taking activities are consistent with the Corporation’s objectives and risk tolerance, and that there is an appropriate\nbalance between risks and rewards to maximize stockholder value.\nThe Corporation has in place a risk management framework to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks assumed in\nconducting its activities. First BanCorp.’s business is subject to eleven broad categories of risks: (i) liquidity risk; (ii) interest rate risk;\n(iii) market risk; (iv) credit risk; (v) operational risk; (vi) legal and regulatory risk; (vii) reputational risk; (viii) model risk; (ix) capital\nrisk; (x) strategic risk; and (xi) information technology risk. First BanCorp. has adopted policies and procedures designed to identify\nand manage the risks to which the Corporation is exposed.\nThe Corporation’s risk management policies are described below, as well as in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk involves the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and\nbusiness operations, and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates. Liquidity\nmanagement involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet liquidity needs and\naccommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in the Corporation’s business operations or unanticipated\nevents.\nThe Corporation manages liquidity at two levels. The first is the liquidity of the parent company, or First Bancorp., which is the\nholding company that owns the banking and non-banking subsidiaries. The second is the liquidity of the banking subsidiary,\nFirstBank.\nThe Asset and Liability Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing management’s\nestablishment of the Corporation’s liquidity policy, as well as approving operating and contingency procedures and monitoring\nliquidity on an ongoing basis. The Management’s Investment and Asset Liability Committee (“MIALCO”), which reports to the\nBoard’s Asset and Liability Committee, uses measures of liquidity developed by management that involve the use of several\nassumptions to review the Corporation’s liquidity position on a monthly basis. The MIALCO oversees liquidity management,\ninterest rate risk, market risk, and other related matters.\nThe MIALCO is composed of senior management officers, including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the\nChief Risk Officer, the Corporate Strategic and Business Development Director, the Business Group Director, the Treasury and\nInvestments Risk Manager, the Financial Planning and Asset and Liability Management (“ALM”) Director, and the Treasurer. The\nTreasury and Investments Division is responsible for planning and executing the Corporation’s funding activities and strategy,\nmonitoring liquidity availability on a daily basis, and reviewing liquidity measures on a weekly basis. The Financial Planning and\nALM Division is responsible for estimating the liquidity gap.\n100\nTo ensure adequate liquidity through the full range of potential operating environments and market conditions, the Corporation\nconducts its liquidity management and business activities in a manner that is intended to preserve and enhance funding stability,\nflexibility, and diversity. Key components of this operating strategy include a strong focus on the continued development of\ncustomer-based funding, the maintenance of direct relationships with wholesale market funding providers, and the maintenance of\nthe ability to liquidate certain assets when, and if, requirements warrant.\nThe Corporation develops and maintains contingency funding plans. These plans evaluate the Corporation’s liquidity position\nunder various operating circumstances and are designed to help ensure that the Corporation will be able to operate through periods\nof stress when access to normal sources of funds is constrained. The plans project funding requirements during a potential period of\nstress, specify and quantify sources of liquidity, outline actions and procedures for effectively managing liquidity through a period of\nstress, and define roles and responsibilities for the Corporation’s employees. Under the contingency funding plans, the Corporation\nstresses the balance sheet and the liquidity position to critical levels that mimic difficulties in generating funds or even maintaining\nthe current funding position of the Corporation and the Bank and are designed to help ensure the ability of the Corporation and the\nBank to honor their respective commitments. The Corporation has established liquidity triggers that the MIALCO monitors in order\nto maintain the ordinary funding of the banking business. The MIALCO has developed contingency funding plans for the following\nthree scenarios: a credit rating downgrade, an economic cycle downturn event, and a concentration event. The Board’s Asset and\nLiability Committee reviews and approves these plans on an annual basis.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nThe Corporation manages its liquidity in a proactive manner and in an effort to maintain a sound liquidity position. It uses multiple\nmeasures to monitor its liquidity position, including core liquidity, basic liquidity, and time-based reserve measures. Cash and cash\nequivalents amounted to $685.4 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $663.2 million as of December 31, 2023. When\nadding $1.8 billion of free high-quality liquid securities that could be liquidated or pledged within one day (which includes assets such\nas U.S. government and GSEs obligations), the total core liquidity amounted to $2.5 billion as of September 30, 2024, or 13.32% of\ntotal assets, compared to $2.8 billion, or 14.93% of total assets as of December 31, 2023.\nIn addition to the aforementioned $1.8 billion in cash and free high quality liquid assets, the Corporation had $964.7 million\navailable for credit with the FHLB based on the value of loan collateral pledged with the FHLB. As such, the basic liquidity ratio\n(which adds such available secured lines of credit to the core liquidity) was approximately 18.43% of total assets as of September 30,\n2024, compared to 19.82% of total assets as of December 31, 2023.\nFurther, the Corporation also maintains borrowing capacity at the FED Discount Window and had approximately $2.6 billion\navailable for funding under the FED’s Borrower-in-Custody (“BIC”) Program as of September 30, 2024 as an additional source of\nliquidity. Total loans pledged to the FED BIC Program amounted to $3.4 billion as of September 30, 2024. The Corporation also does\nnot rely on uncommitted inter-bank lines of credit (federal funds lines) to fund its operations. In the aggregate, as of September 30,\n2024, the Corporation had $6.1 billion available to meet liquidity needs, or 131% of estimated uninsured deposits, excluding fully\ncollateralized government deposits.\nLiquidity at the Bank level is highly dependent on bank deposits, which fund 86.9% of the Bank’s assets (or 84.1% excluding\nbrokered CDs). In addition, as further discussed below, the Corporation maintains a diversified base of readily available wholesale\nfunding sources, including advances from the FHLB through pledged borrowing capacity, securities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase, and access to brokered CDs. Funding through wholesale funding may continue to increase the overall cost of funding for\nthe Corporation and adversely affect the net interest margin.\n101\nCommitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit\nAs a provider of financial services, the Corporation routinely enters into commitments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the\nfinancial needs of its customers. These financial instruments may include loan commitments and standby letters of credit. These\ncommitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval processes used for on-balance sheet instruments. These\ninstruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the statements\nof financial condition. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation’s commitments to extend credit amounted to approximately $2.1\nbillion. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition\nestablished in the contract. Since certain commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment\namount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. For most of the commercial lines of credit, the Corporation has the\noption to reevaluate the agreement prior to additional disbursements. There have been no significant or unexpected draws on\nexisting commitments. In the case of credit cards and personal lines of credit, the Corporation can cancel the unused credit facility at\nany time and without cause.\nThe following table summarizes commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit as of the indicated dates:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(In thousands)\nFinancial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk:\nCommitments to extend credit:\nConstruction undisbursed funds $ 250,597 $ 234,974\nUnused credit card lines 795,338 882,486\nUnused personal lines of credit 37,869 38,956\nCommercial lines of credit 1,026,159 862,963\nLetters of credit:\nCommercial letters of credit 48,507 69,543\nStandby letters of credit 18,968 8,313\nThe Corporation engages in the ordinary course of business in other financial transactions that are not recorded on the balance\nsheet or may be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different from the full contract or notional amount of the\ntransaction and, thus, affect the Corporation’s liquidity position. These transactions are designed to (i) meet the financial needs of\ncustomers, (ii) manage the Corporation’s credit, market and liquidity risks, (iii) diversify the Corporation’s funding sources, and (iv)\noptimize capital.\nIn addition to the aforementioned off-balance sheet debt obligations and unfunded commitments to extend credit, the Corporation\nhas obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, amounting to approximately $4.3 billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. Our material cash requirements comprise primarily of contractual obligations to make future payments related\nto time deposits, long-term borrowings, and operating lease obligations. We also have other contractual cash obligations related to\ncertain binding agreements we have entered into for services including outsourcing of technology services, security, advertising and\nother services which are not material to our liquidity needs.We currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facilities, and\ncash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and support loan growth and capital plan execution\nfor the foreseeable future.\nOff-balance sheet transactions are continuously monitored to consider their potential impact to our liquidity position and changes\nare applied to the balance between sources and uses of funds, as deemed appropriate, to maintain a sound liquidity position.\n102\nSources of Funding\nThe Corporation utilizes different sources of funding to help ensure that adequate levels of liquidity are available when needed.\nDiversification of funding sources is of great importance to protect the Corporation’s liquidity from market disruptions. The\nprincipal sources of short-term funding are deposits, including brokered CDs. Additional funding is provided by securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase and lines of credit with the FHLB. In addition, the Corporation also maintains as additional sources\nborrowing capacity at the FED’s BIC Program , as discussed above.\nThe Asset and Liability Committee reviews credit availability on a regular basis. The Corporation may also sell mortgage loans as\na supplementary source of funding and obtain long-term funding through the issuance of notes and long-term brokered CDs.\nWhile liquidity is an ongoing challenge for all financial institutions, management believes that the Corporation’s available\nborrowing capacity and efforts to grow core deposits will be adequate to provide the necessary funding for the Corporation’s business\nplans in the next 12 months and beyond.\nRetail and commercial core deposits – The Corporation’s deposit products include regular saving accounts, demand deposit\naccounts, money market accounts, and retail CDs. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the Corporation’s core deposits,\nwhich exclude government deposits and brokered CDs, totaled $12.7 billion and $12.6 billion, respectively. The $69.2 million\nincrease in such deposits consisted of increases of $58.8 million in the Florida region and $40.2 million in the Puerto Rico region,\npartially offset by a $29.8 million decrease in the Virgin Islands region. This increase includes a $198.2 million increase in time\ndeposits.\nGovernment deposits (fully collateralized) – As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had $2.7 billion of Puerto Rico public\nsector deposits ($2.5 billion in transactional accounts and $150.1 million in time deposits), relatively unchanged compared to the\nbalance as of December 31, 2023. Government deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits and the uninsured portions\nare fully collateralized. A pproximately 22% of the public sector deposits as of September 30, 2024 w ere from municipalities and\nmunicipal agencies in Puerto Rico and 78% were from public corporations, the central government and its agencies, and U.S. federal\ngovernment agencies in Puerto Rico.\nIn addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had $443.9 million of government deposits in the Virgin Islands region, as\ncompared to $449.4 million as of December 31, 2023, and $19.2 million in the Florida region as compared to $10.2 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThe uninsured portions of government deposits were collateralized by securities and loans with an amortized cost of $3.3 billion\nand $3.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and an estimated market value of $3.1 billion as of\neach of such periods. In addition to securities and loans, as of each of September 30, 2024 and December 31,2023, the Corporation\nused $175.0 million in letters of credit issued by the FHLB as pledges for a portion of public deposits in the Virgin Islands.\nEstimate of Uninsured Deposits – As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated amounts of uninsured deposits\ntotaled $7.6 billion and $7.4 billion, respectively, generally representing the portion of deposits that exceed the FDIC insurance limit\nof $250,000 and amounts in any other uninsured deposit account. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the uninsured\nportion of fully collateralized government deposits amounted to $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. Excluding fully\ncollateralized government deposits, the estimated amounts of uninsured deposits amounted to $4.6 billion, which represent 29.25% of\ntotal deposits (excluding brokered CDs), as of September 30, 2024, compared to $4.4 billion, or 28.13%, as of December 31, 2023.\nThe amount of uninsured deposits is calculated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for our bank regulatory\nreporting requirements adjusted for cash held by wholly-owned subsidiaries at the Bank.\n103\nThe following table presents by contractual maturities the amount of U.S. time deposits in excess of FDIC insurance limits (over\n$250,000) and other time deposits that are otherwise uninsured as of September 30, 2024:\n3 months or 3 months to 6 months to\n(In thousands) less 6 months 1 year Over 1 year Total\nU.S. time deposits in excess of FDIC insurance limits $ 400,953 $ 322,432 $ 223,200 $ 143,931 $ 1,090,516\nOther uninsured time deposits $ 18,400 $ 11,720 $ 16,134 $ 2,133 $ 48,387\nBrokered CDs – Total brokered CDs decreased by $263.3 million to $520.0 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $783.3\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. The decline reflects maturing brokered CDs amounting to $540.5 million with an all-in cost of\n5.43% that were paid off during the first nine months of 2024, partially offset by $277.2 million of new issuances with original\naverage maturities of approximately 2 years and an all-in cost of 4.91%.\nThe average remaining term to maturity of the brokered CDs outstanding as of September 30, 2024 was approximately 1.2 years.\nT he future use of brokered CDs will depend on multiple factors including excess liquidity at each of the regions, future cash needs\nand any tax implications. Also, depending on lending or other investment opportunities available, cash inflows from repayments of\ninvestment securities may be used as well to repay brokered CDs. Brokered CDs are insured by the FDIC up to regulatory limits and\ncan be obtained faster than regular retail deposits.\nThe following table presents the remaining contractual maturities and weighted-average interest rates of brokered CDs as of\nSeptember 30, 2024:\nWeighted-average\nTotal interest rate %\n(In thousands)\nThree months or less $ 173,980 5.15\nOver three months to six months 35,698 4.79\nOver six months to one year 100,287 4.86\nOver one year to two years 121,687 4.65\nOver two years to three years 15,328 4.13\nOver three years to four years 30,280 4.03\nOver four years to five years 27,342 4.44\nOver five years 15,446 4.61\nTotal $ 520,048 4.80\nRefer to “Net Interest Income” above for information about average balances of interest-bearing deposits and the average interest\nrate paid on such deposits for the quarters and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase – From time to time, the Corporation enters into repurchase agreements as an\nadditional source of funding. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding repurchase agreements.\nWhen the Corporation enters into repurchase agreements, as is the case with derivative contracts, the Corporation is required to\npledge cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements. To the extent that the value of securities previously pledged as\ncollateral declines due to changes in interest rates, a liquidity crisis or any other factor, the Corporation is required to deposit\nadditional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements, thereby adversely affecting its liquidity. Given the quality of the\ncollateral pledged, the Corporation has not experienced margin calls from counterparties arising from credit-quality-related write-\ndowns in valuations.\n104\nAdvances from the FHLB – The Bank is a member of the FHLB system and obtains advances to fund its operations under a\ncollateral agreement with the FHLB that requires the Bank to maintain qualifying mortgages and/or investments as collateral for\nadvances taken. As of each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance of long-term fixed-rate FHLB\nadvances was $500.0 million. Of the $500.0 million in FHLB advances as of September 30, 2024, $400.0 million were pledged with\ninvestment securities and $100.0 million were pledged with mortgage loans. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had $964.7\nmillion available for additional credit on FHLB lines of credit based on collateral pledged at the FHLB of New York.\nThe following table presents the remaining contractual maturities and weighted-average interest rates of advances from the FHLB\nas of September 30, 2024:\nWeighted-average\nTotal interest rate %\n(In thousands)\nOver three months to six months $ 180,000 4.60\nOver six months to one year 30,000 4.83\nOver one year to two years 90,000 4.49\nOver three years to four years 200,000 4.25\nTotal (1) $ 500,000 4.45\n(1) Average remaining term to maturity of 1.73 years.\nTrust-Preferred Securities – In 2004, FBP Statutory Trusts I and II, statutory trusts that are wholly-owned by the Corporation and\nnot consolidated in the Corporation’s financial statements, sold to institutional investors variable-rate TruPS and used the proceeds of\nthese issuances, together with the proceeds of the purchases by the Corporation of variable rate common securities, to purchase junior\nsubordinated deferrable debentures. The subordinated debentures are presented in the Corporation’s consolidated statements of\nfinancial condition as other long-term borrowings. Under the indentures, the Corporation has the right, from time to time, and without\ncausing an event of default, to defer payments of interest on the Junior Subordinated Deferrable Debentures by extending the interest\npayment period at any time and from time to time during the term of the subordinated debentures for up to twenty consecutive\nquarterly periods.\nIn September 2024, the Corporation redeemed $50.0 million, or 42%, of outstanding TruPS issued by FBP Statutory Trust II (or\n$48.5 million after excluding the Corporation’s interest in the Trust of approximately $1.5 million) at a contractual call price of 100%\nas part of the 2024 repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation had junior subordinated\ndebentures outstanding in the aggregate amount of $111.7 million and $161.7 million, respectively, with maturity dates ranging from\nJune 17, 2034 through September 20, 2034. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation was current on all interest payments due on its\nsubordinated debt. See Note 10 – “Other Long-Term Borrowings” and Note 7 – “Non-Consolidated Variable Interest Entities\n(“VIEs”) and Servicing Assets” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein for additional information. Also, see Note 13\n– “Stockholders’ Equity” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein for additional details of capital actions that include\nthe approval of a 2024 repurchase program of $250 million that could include repurchases of common stock or junior subordinated\ndebentures.\nOther Sources of Funds and Liquidity - The Corporation’s principal uses of funds are for the origination of loans, the repayment of\nmaturing deposits and borrowings, and deposits withdrawals. Over the years, in connection with its mortgage banking activities, the\nCorporation has invested in technology and personnel to enhance the Corporation’s secondary mortgage market capabilities.\nThese enhanced capabilities improve the Corporation’s liquidity profile as they allow the Corporation to derive liquidity, if needed,\nfrom the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market. The U.S. (including Puerto Rico) secondary mortgage market is still highly\nliquid, in large part because of the sale of mortgages through guarantee programs of the Federal Housing Authority (“FHA”), U.S.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation (“FNMA”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (“FHLMC”). During the first nine months of 2024, loans pooled into\nGovernment National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”) MBS amounted to approximately $87.4 million. Also, during the first nine\nmonths of 2024, the Corporation sold approximately $25.8 million of performing residential mortgage loans to FNMA.\nThe FED Discount Window is a cost-efficient source of short-term funding for the Corporation in highly-volatile market\nconditions. As previously mentioned, as of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had approximately $2.6 billion fully available for\nfunding under the FED’s Discount Window based on collateral pledged at the FED.\n105\nEffect of Credit Ratings on Access to Liquidity\nThe Corporation’s liquidity is contingent upon its ability to obtain deposits and other external sources of funding to finance its\noperations. The Corporation’s current credit ratings and any downgrade in credit ratings can hinder the Corporation’s access to new\nforms of external funding and/or cause external funding to be more expensive, which could, in turn, adversely affect its results of\noperations. Also, changes in credit ratings may further affect the fair value of unsecured derivatives whose value takes into account the\nCorporation’s own credit risk.\nThe Corporation does not have any outstanding debt or derivative agreements that would be affected by credit rating downgrades.\nFurthermore, given the Corporation’s non-reliance on corporate debt or other instruments directly linked in terms of pricing or volume\nto credit ratings, the liquidity of the Corporation has not been affected in any material way by downgrades. The Corporation’s ability\nto access new non-deposit sources of funding, however, could be adversely affected by credit downgrades.\nAs of the date hereof, the Corporation’s credit as a long-term issuer is rated BB+ by S&P and BB by Fitch. As of the date hereof,\nFirstBank’s credit ratings as a long -term issuer are BB+ by S&P and Fitch, one notch below the minimum BBB- level required to be\nconsidered investment grade. The Corporation’s credit ratings are dependent on a number of factors, both quantitative and qualitative,\nand are subject to change at any time. The disclosure of credit ratings is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold the Corporation’s\nsecurities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\n106\nCash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents were $685.4 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $22.2 million when compared to\nDecember 31, 2023. The following discussion highlights the major activities and transactions that affected the Corporation’s cash\nflows during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023:\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFirst BanCorp.’s operating assets and liabilities vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of\ncash flows. Management believes that cash flows from operations, available cash balances, and the Corporation’s ability to generate\ncash through short and long-term borrowings will be sufficient to fund the Corporation’s operating liquidity needs for the foreseeable\nfuture.\nFor the first nine months of September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $307.3 million and $283.7\nmillion, respectively. Net cash generated from operating activities was higher than reported net income largely as a result of\nadjustments for non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax expense and the provision for credit losses,\nas well as cash generated from sales and repayments of loans held for sale.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nThe Corporation’s investing activities primarily relate to originating loans to be held for investment, as well as purchasing, selling,\nand repaying available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities. For the nine -month period ended September 30, 2024 , net cash\nprovided by investing activities was $213.8 million, primarily due to repayments of U.S. agencies MBS, U.S. agencies debentures, and\nPuerto Rico municipal bonds; proceeds from sales of repossessed assets; and proceeds from sales of loans, driven by the bulk sale of\nfully charged-off consumer loans during the first quarter of 2024 and the sale of an $8.2 million nonaccrual C&I loan; partially offset\nby net disbursements on loans held for investment and purchases of Community Reinvestment Act qualified debt securities during the\nfirst nine months of 2024.\nFor the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by investing activities was $17.5 million, primarily due to\nrepayments of U.S. agencies MBS, U.S. agencies debentures, and Puerto Rico municipal bonds; and proceeds from sales of\nrepossessed assets; partially offset by net disbursements on loans held for investment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe Corporation’s financing activities primarily include the receipt of deposits and the issuance of brokered CDs, the issuance of\nand payments on long-term debt, the issuance of equity instruments, return of capital, and activities related to its short-term funding.\nFor the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $498.9 million, mainly reflecting a\ndecrease in total deposits, capital returned to stockholders and the redemption of junior subordinated debentures in September 2024, as\nfurther explained in Note 7 – “Non-Consolidated Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”) and Servicing Assets”.\nFor the nine -month period ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was $196.8 million, mainly reflecting a\n$269.9 million net decrease in borrowings and $200.8 million of capital returned to stockholders, partially offset by a $275.8 million\nnet increase in deposits.\n107\nCapital\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Corporation’s stockholders’ equity was $1.7 billion, an increase of $203.3 million from December\n31, 2023. The increase was driven by net income generated in the first nine months of 2024 and a $155.5 million increase in the fair\nvalue of available-for-sale debt securities recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statements of\nfinancial condition, partially offset by $100.0 million in common stock repurchases under the 2023 stock repurchase program, and\ncommon stock dividends declared in the first nine months of 2024 totaling $79.7 million or $0.48 per common share.\nOn October 30, 2024, the Corporation’s Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per common share. The dividend is\npayable on December 13, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 29, 2024. The Corporation intends to\ncontinue to pay quarterly dividends on common stock. However, the Corporation’s common stock dividends, including the\ndeclaration, timing and amount, remain subject to the consideration and approval by the Corporation’s Board at the relevant times.\nOn July 24, 2023, the Corporation announced that its Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, under which the\nCorporation may repurchase up to $225 million of its outstanding common stock, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nDuring the first nine months of 2024, the Corporation repurchased approximately 5.8 million shares of common stock for a total cost\nof $100.0 million. Furthermore, on July 22, 2024, the Corporation announced that its Board of Directors approved a new repurchase\nprogram, under which the Corporation may repurchase up to an additional $250 million that could include repurchases of common\nstock or junior subordinated debentures, which it expects to execute through the end of the fourth quarter of 2025. As of September\n30, 2024, the Corporation has remaining authorization of approximately $250.0 million under both repurchase programs after the\n$50.0 million redemption of junior subordinated debentures in September 2024, as further explained above. For more information, see\nPart II, Item 2, “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds,” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nRepurchases under the programs may be executed through open market purchases, accelerated share repurchases, privately\nnegotiated transactions or plans, including plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, and/or redemption of junior\nsubordinated debentures, and will be conducted in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The Corporation’s\nrepurchase programs are subject to various factors, including the Corporation’s capital position, liquidity, financial performance and\nalternative uses of capital, stock trading price, and general market conditions. The Corporation’s repurchase programs do not obligate\nit to acquire any specific number of shares and do not have an expiration date. The repurchase programs may be modified, suspended,\nor terminated at any time at the Corporation’s discretion. The Corporation’s holding company has no operations and depends on\ndividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividend payments, stock repurchases, and to fund all\npayments on its obligations, including debt obligations.\nThe tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP financial measures generally used by\nthe financial community to evaluate capital adequacy. Tangible common equity is total common equity less goodwill and other\nintangible assets. Tangible assets are total assets less the previously mentioned intangible assets. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nand Reconciliations” above for additional information.\n108\nThe following table is a reconciliation of the Corporation’s tangible common equity and tangible assets, non-GAAP financial\nmeasures, to total equity and total assets, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(In thousands, except ratios and per share information)\nTotal common equity - GAAP $ 1,700,885 $ 1,497,609\nGoodwill (38,611) (38,611)\nOther intangible assets (8,260) (13,383)\nTangible common equity - non-GAAP $ 1,654,014 $ 1,445,615\nTotal assets - GAAP $ 18,859,170 $ 18,909,549\nGoodwill (38,611) (38,611)\nOther intangible assets (8,260) (13,383)\nTangible assets - non -GAAP $ 18,812,299 $ 18,857,555\nCommon shares outstanding 163,876 169,303\nTangible common equity ratio - non-GAAP 8.79% 7.67%\nTangible book value per common share - non-GAAP $ 10.09 $ 8.54\nS ee Note 21 – “Regulatory Matters, Commitments and Contingencies” to the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein for\nthe regulatory capital positions of the Corporation and FirstBank as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe Puerto Rico Banking Law of 1933, as amended (the “Puerto Rico Banking Law”), requires that a minimum of 10% of\nFirstBank’s net income for the year be transferred to a legal surplus reserve until such surplus equals the total of paid-in-capital on\ncommon and preferred stock. Amounts transferred to the legal surplus reserve from retained earnings are not available for distribution\nto the Corporation without the prior consent of the Puerto Rico Commissioner of Financial Institutions. The Puerto Rico Banking Law\nprovides that, when the expenditures of a Puerto Rico commercial bank are greater than receipts, the excess of the expenditures over\nreceipts must be charged against the undistributed profits of the bank, and the balance, if any, must be charged against the legal\nsurplus reserve, as a reduction thereof. If the legal surplus reserve is not sufficient to cover such balance in whole or in part, the\noutstanding amount must be charged against the capital account and the Bank cannot pay dividends until it can replenish the legal\nsurplus reserve to an amount of at least 20% of the original capital contributed. FirstBank’s legal surplus reserve, included as part of\nretained earnings in the Corporation’s consolidated statements of financial condition, amounted to $199.6 million as of each of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. There were no transfers to the legal surplus reserve during the first nine\nmonths of 2024.\n109\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nFirst BanCorp manages its asset/liability position to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on net interest income and to\nmaintain stability of profitability under varying interest rate scenarios. The MIALCO oversees interest rate risk and monitors, among\nother things, current and expected conditions in global financial markets, competition and prevailing rates in the local deposit market,\nliquidity, loan originations pipeline, securities market values, recent or proposed changes to the investment portfolio, alternative\nfunding sources and related costs, hedging and the possible purchase of derivatives such as swaps and caps, and any tax or regulatory\nissues which may be pertinent to these areas. The MIALCO approves funding decisions in light of the Corporation’s overall strategies\nand objectives.\nOn at least a quarterly basis, the Corporation performs a consolidated net interest income simulation analysis to estimate the\npotential change in future earnings from projected changes in interest rates. These simulations are carried out over a one-to-five-year\ntime horizon. The rate scenarios considered in these simulations reflect gradual upward or downward interest rate movements in the\nyield curve, for gradual (ramp) parallel shifts in the yield curve of 200 and 300 bps during a twelve-month period, or immediate\nupward or downward changes in interest rate movements of 200 bps, for interest rate shock scenarios. The Corporation carries out the\nsimulations in two ways:\n(1) Using a static balance sheet, as the Corporation had on the simulation date, and\n(2) Using a dynamic balance sheet based on recent patterns and current strategies.\nThe balance sheet is divided into groups of assets and liabilities by maturity or repricing structure and their corresponding interest\nyields and costs. As interest rates rise or fall, these simulations incorporate expected future lending rates, current and expected future\nfunding sources and costs, the possible exercise of options, changes in prepayment rates, deposit decay and other factors, which may\nbe important in projecting net interest income.\nThe Corporation uses a simulation model to project future movements in the Corporation’s balance sheet and income statement.\nThe starting point of the projections corresponds to the actual values on the balance sheet on the simulation date. These simulations\nare highly complex and are based on many assumptions that are intended to reflect the general behavior of the balance sheet\ncomponents over the modeled periods. It is unlikely that actual events will match these assumptions in all cases. For this reason, the\nresults of these forward-looking computations are only approximations of the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market\ninterest rates. Several benchmark and market rate curves were used in the modeling process, primarily, SOFR curve, Prime Rate, U.S.\nTreasury yield curve, FHLB rates, brokered CDs rates, and repurchase agreements rates.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Corporation forecasted the 12-month net interest income assuming September 30, 2024 interest rate\ncurves remain constant. Then, net interest income was estimated under rising and falling rates scenarios. For the rising rate scenario, a\ngradual (ramp) and immediate (shock) parallel upward shift of the yield curve is assumed during the first twelve months (the “+300\nramp”, “+200 ramp” and “+200 shock” scenarios). Conversely, for the falling rate scenario, a gradual (ramp) and immediate (shock)\nparallel downward shift of the yield curve is assumed during the first twelve months (the “-300 ramp”, “-200 ramp” and “-200 shock”\nscenarios).\nThe SOFR curve for September 30, 2024, as compared with December 31, 2023, reflects a decrease of 74 bps on average in the\nshort-term sector of the curve, or between one to twelve months; a decrease of 55 bps in the medium-term sector of the curve, or\nbetween 2 to 5 years; and a decrease of 13 bps in the long-term sector of the curve, or over 5-year maturities. A similar change in\nmarket rates was observed in the Constant Maturity Treasury yield curve with a decrease of 76 bps in the short-term sector and a\ndecrease of 42 bps in the medium-term sector. However, the long-term sector of the curve remains practically unchanged.\n110\nThe following table presents the results of the static simulations as of September 30,2024 and December 31, 2023. Consistent with\nprior years, these exclude non-cash changes in the fair value of derivatives:\nNet Interest Income Risk\n(% Change Projected for the next 12 months)\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nGradual Change in Interest Rates:\n+ 300 bps ramp 2.55% 1.08%\n+ 200 bps ramp 1.71% 0.73%\n- 300 bps ramp -4.15% -3.09%\n- 200 bps ramp -2.70% -2.02%\nImmediate Change in Interest Rates:\n+ 200 bps shock 4.90% 2.45%\n- 200 bps shock -7.45% -5.67%\nThe Corporation continues to manage its balance sheet structure to control and limit the overall interest rate risk by managing its\nasset composition while maintaining a sound liquidity position. See “Risk Management – Liquidity Risk Management” above for\nliquidity ratios.\nAs of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the net interest income simulations show that the Corporation continues to have\nan asset sensitive position for the next twelve months under a static balance sheet simulation.\nUnder gradual rising and falling rate scenarios, the net interest income simulation shows an increase in interest rate sensitivity,\nwhen compared with December 31, 2023, due to lower sensitivity in the liabilities side as a result of updated assumptions. Deposit\nbetas and repricing lags were modified for some deposit categories to reflect current behavior and expectations under current and\nprojected interest rate scenarios. Also, the sensitivity in the liabilities side was impacted by higher cost shorter term brokered CDs that\nare either being repriced at lower rates or are not being renewed.\nUnder the static simulation, the Corporation assumes that maturing instruments are replaced with similar instruments at the\nrepricing rate upon maturity. The Corporation’s results may vary significantly from the ones presented above under alternative balance\nsheet compositions, such as a dynamic balance sheet scenario which, for example, would assume that cash flows from the investment\nsecurities portfolio and loan repayments will be redeployed into higher yielding alternatives.\n111\nCredit Risk Management\nFirst BanCorp. is subject to credit risk mainly with respect to its portfolio of loans receivable and off-balance-sheet instruments,\nprincipally loan commitments. Loans receivable represents loans that First BanCorp. holds for investment and, therefore, First\nBanCorp. is at risk for the term of the loan. Loan commitments represent commitments to extend credit, subject to specific conditions,\nfor specific amounts and maturities. These commitments may expose the Corporation to credit risk and are subject to the same review\nand approval process as for loans made by the Bank. See “Risk Management – Liquidity Risk” and “Risk Management – Capital”\nabove for further details. The Corporation manages its credit risk through its credit policy, underwriting, monitoring of loan\nconcentrations and related credit quality, counterparty credit risk, economic and market conditions, and legislative or regulatory\nmandates. The Corporation also performs independent loan review and quality control procedures, statistical analysis, comprehensive\nfinancial analysis, established management committees, and employs proactive collection and loss mitigation efforts. Furthermore,\npersonnel performing structured loan workout functions are responsible for mitigating defaults and minimizing losses upon default\nwithin each region and for each business segment. In the case of the C&I, commercial mortgage and construction loan portfolios, the\nSpecial Asset Group (“SAG”) focuses on strategies for the accelerated reduction of non-performing assets through note sales, short\nsales, loss mitigation programs, and sales of OREO. In addition to the management of the resolution process for problem loans, the\nSAG oversees collection efforts for all loans to prevent migration to the nonaccrual and/or adversely classified status. The SAG\nutilizes relationship officers, collection specialists and attorneys.\nThe Corporation may also have risk of default in the securities portfolio. The securities held by the Corporation are principally\nfixed-rate U.S. agencies MBS and U.S. Treasury and agencies securities. Thus, a substantial portion of these instruments is backed by\nmortgages, a guarantee of a U.S. GSE or the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\nManagement, consisting of the Corporation’s Chief Risk Officer, Commercial Credit Risk Officer, Retail Credit Risk Officer, Chief\nCredit Officer, and other senior executives, has the primary responsibility for setting strategies to achieve the Corporation’s credit risk\ngoals and objectives. Management has documented these goals and objectives in the Corporation’s Credit Policy.\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Non-Performing Assets\nAllowance for Credit Losses for Loans and Finance Leases\nThe ACL for loans and finance leases represents the estimate of the level of reserves appropriate to absorb expected credit losses\nover the estimated life of the loans. The amount of the allowance is determined using relevant available information, from internal and\nexternal sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience\nis a significant input for the estimation of expected credit losses, as well as adjustments to historical loss information made for\ndifferences in current loan-specific risk characteristics, such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level,\nor term. Additionally, the Corporation’s assessment involves evaluating key factors, which include credit and macroeconomic\nindicators, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values, and other relevant factors to account for current and forecasted\nmarket conditions that are likely to cause estimated credit losses over the life of the loans to differ from historical credit losses. Such\nfactors are subject to regular review and may change to reflect updated performance trends and expectations, particularly in times of\nsevere stress. The process includes judgments and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change. Further, the\nCorporation periodically considers the need for qualitative reserves to the ACL. Qualitative adjustments may be related to and include,\nbut are not limited to, factors such as the following: (i) management’s assessment of economic forecasts used in the model and how\nthose forecasts align with management’s overall evaluation of current and expected economic conditions; (ii) organization specific\nrisks such as credit concentrations, collateral specific risks, nature and size of the portfolio and external factors that may ultimately\nimpact credit quality, and (iii) other limitations associated with factors such as changes in underwriting and loan resolution strategies,\namong others. The ACL for loans and finance leases is reviewed at least on a quarterly basis as part of the Corporation’s continued\nevaluation of its asset quality.\nThe Corporation generally applies probability weights to the baseline and alternative downside economic scenarios to estimate\nthe ACL with the baseline scenario carrying the highest weight. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting given to\neach scenario for the different loan portfolio categories depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading\nnational and regional economic indicators, and industry trends. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation\napplied 100% probability to the baseline scenario for the commercial mortgage and construction loan portfolios since certain\nmacroeconomic variables associated with commercial real estate property performance and the CRE price index, particularly in the\nPuerto Rico region, are expected to continue to perform in a more favorable manner than the alternative downside economic scenario.\nThe economic scenarios used in the ACL determination contained assumptions related to economic uncertainties associated with\ngeopolitical instability, the CRE price index, unemployment rate, inflation levels, and expected future interest rate adjustments in the\nFederal Reserve Board’s funds rate.\n112\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Corporation’s ACL model considered the following assumptions for key economic variables in\nthe probability-weighted economic scenarios:\n● CRE price index at the national level with an average projected contraction of 4.00% for the remainder of 2024 and an\naverage projected appreciation of 0.92% for the year 2025, compared to an average projected contraction of 6.24% for the\nremainder of 2024 and an average projected appreciation of 2.01% for the year 2025 as of December 31, 2023.\n● Regional Home Price Index forecast in Puerto Rico (purchase only prices) is projected to remain relatively flat for the\nremainder of 2024, while for the year 2025 shows a deterioration of 1.48%, when compared to the same period projection as\nof December 31, 2023. For the Florida region, the Home Price Index forecast shows an improvement of 8.50% and 7.05% for\nthe remainder of 2024 and for the year 2025, respectively, when compared to the same period as of December 31, 2023.\n● Average regional unemployment rate in Puerto Rico is forecasted at 6.07% for the remainder of 2024 and 6.30% for the year\n2025, compared to 7.68% for the remainder of 2024 and 8.08% for the year 2025 as of December 31, 2023. For the Florida\nand the U.S. mainland, average unemployment rate is forecasted at 3.94% and 4.45%, respectively, for the remainder of\n2024, and 4.51% and 4.96%, respectively, for the year 2025, compared to 4.51% and 4.94%, respectively, for the remainder\nof 2024, and 4.12% and 4.52%, respectively, for the year 2025 as of December 31, 2023.\n● Annualized change in GDP in the U.S. mainland of 1.69% for the remainder of 2024 and 1.04% for the year 2025, compared\nto 0.53% for the remainder of 2024 and 1.64% for the year 2025 as of December 31, 2023.\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in one factor or input might affect the overall ACL because management considers a\nwide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the ACL. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate\nand may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent,\nsuch that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others. However, to demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss\nestimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of September 30, 2024, management compared the modeled estimates under the probability-\nweighted economic scenarios against a more adverse scenario. Such scenario incorporates an additional adverse scenario and\ndecreases the weight applied to the baseline scenario. Under this more adverse scenario, as an example, average unemployment rate\nfor the Puerto Rico region increases to 6.33% for the remainder of 2024, compared to 6.07% for the same period on the probability-\nweighted economic scenario projections.\nTo demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters used in the calculation of the ACL at September 30, 2024, management\ncalculated the difference between the quantitative ACL and this more adverse scenario. Excluding consideration of qualitative\nadjustments, this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase in the ACL of approximately $40 million at September 30,\n2024. This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall ACL as it\ndoes not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the qualitative calculation, which would also be influenced by the\njudgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these estimates\nbased on current circumstances and conditions. Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain,\nparticularly in light of recent economic conditions and challenges, which continue to evolve, management believes that its process to\nconsider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected\ncredit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended September 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the ACL for loans and finance leases was $247.0 million, or 1.98% of total loans, a decrease of $14.8\nmillion, from $261.8 million, or 2.15% of total loans, as of December 31, 2023. The ACL for residential mortgage loans decreased by\n$16.7 million, driven by updated historical loss experience used for determining the ACL estimate resulting in a downward revision of\nestimated loss severities and improvements in the long-term projections of the unemployment rate in the Puerto Rico region, partially\noffset by newly originated loans. The ACL for commercial and construction loans decreased by $8.8 million, mainly due to reserve\nreleases associated with the improved financial condition of certain borrowers and an improvement on the economic outlook of certain\nmacroeconomic variables, particularly variables associated with commercial real estate property performance and the forecasted CRE\nprice index, particularly in the Puerto Rico region, partially offset by increased volume.\nMeanwhile, the ACL for consumer loans increased by $10.7 million driven by higher charge-off levels and loan portfolio growth,\nmainly in auto loans.\nThe ratio of the ACL for loans and finance leases to total loans held for investment decreased to 1.98% as of September 30, 2024,\ncompared to 2.15% as of December 31, 2023. An explanation for the change for each portfolio follows:\n● The ACL to total loans ratio for the residential mortgage loan portfolio decreased from 2.03% as of December 31, 2023 to\n1.44% as of September 30, 2024, mainly due to the aforementioned updated historical loss experience and improvements\nin the long-term projections of the unemployment rate, partially offset by the aforementioned newly originated loans.\n113\n● The ACL to total loans ratio for the construction loan portfolio decreased from 2.61% as of December 31, 2023 to 1.93%\nas of September 30, 2024, mainly due to an improvement on the economic outlook of certain macroeconomic variables\nassociated with commercial real estate property performance and the CRE price index.\n● The ACL to total loans ratio for the commercial mortgage loan portfolio decreased from 1.41% as of December 31, 2023\nto 0.98% as of September 30, 2024, driven by the aforementioned reserve releases associated with the improved financial\ncondition of certain borrowers and an improvement on the economic outlook of certain macroeconomic variables\nassociated with commercial real estate property performance and the CRE price index.\n● The ACL to total loans ratio for the C&I loan portfolio remained relatively flat at 1.07% as of September 30, 2024,\ncompared to 1.05% as of December 31, 2023.\n● The ACL to total loans ratio for the consumer loan portfolio increased from 3.64% as of December 31, 2023 to 3.84% as\nof September 30, 2024, driven by increases in charge-off levels.\nThe ratio of the total ACL for loans and finance leases to nonaccrual loans held for investment was 276.46% as of September 30,\n2024, compared to 312.81% as of December 31, 2023.\nSee “Results of Operations -

The ACL for off-balance\nsheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. As of September 30, 2024, the ACL for off-balance sheet\ncredit exposures decreased by $1.1 million to $3.5 million, when compared to December 31, 2023, driven by an improvement on the\neconomic outlook of certain macroeconomic variables, particularly in variables associated with the CRE price index.\nAllowance for Credit Losses for Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities\nAs of September 30, 2024, the ACL for held-to-maturity securities portfolio was entirely related to financing arrangements with\nPuerto Rico municipalities issued in bond form, which the Corporation accounts for as securities, but which were underwritten as\nloans with features that are typically found in commercial loans. As of September 30, 2024, the ACL for held-to-maturity debt\nsecurities was $1.1 million, compared to $2.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease was driven by improvements in the\nunderlying updated financial information of a Puerto Rico municipal bond issuer.\nAllowance for Credit Losses for Available -for-Sale Debt Securities\nThe ACL for available-for-sale debt securities, which is associated with private label MBS and a residential pass-through MBS\nissued by the PRHFA, was $0.5 million as of each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nNonaccrual Loans and Non-Performing Assets\nTotal non-performing assets consist of nonaccrual loans (generally loans held for investment or loans held for sale for which the\nrecognition of interest income was discontinued when the loan became 90 days past due or earlier if the full and timely collection of\ninterest or principal is uncertain), foreclosed real estate and other repossessed properties, and non-performing investment securities, if\nany. When a loan is placed in nonaccrual status, any interest previously recognized and not collected is reversed and charged against\ninterest income. Cash payments received are recognized when collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the loans. The\nprincipal portion of the payment is used to reduce the principal balance of the loan, whereas the interest portion is recognized on a\ncash basis (when collected). However, when management believes that the ultimate collectability of principal is in doubt, the interest\nportion is applied to the outstanding principal. The risk exposure of this portfolio is diversified as to individual borrowers and\nindustries, among other factors. In addition, a large portion is secured with real estate collateral.\n115\nNonaccrual Loans Policy\nResidential Real Estate Loans — The Corporation generally classifies real estate loans in nonaccrual status when it has not received\ninterest and principal for a period of 90 days or more.\nCommercial and Construction Loans — The Corporation classifies commercial loans (including commercial real estate and\nconstruction loans) in nonaccrual status when it has not received interest and principal for a period of 90 days or more or when it does\nnot expect to collect all of the principal or interest due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower.\nFinance Leases — The Corporation classifies finance leases in nonaccrual status when it has not received interest and principal for\na period of 90 days or more.\nConsumer Loans — The Corporation classifies consumer loans in nonaccrual status when it has not received interest and principal\nfor a period of 90 days or more. Credit card loans continue to accrue finance charges and fees until charged-off at 180 days delinquent.\nPurchased Credit Deteriorated Loans (“PCD”)— For PCD loans, the nonaccrual status is determined in the same manner as for\nother loans, except for PCD loans that prior to the adoption of CECL were classified as purchased credit impaired (“PCI”) loans and\naccounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30, “Receivables – Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality”\n(“ASC Subtopic 310-30”). As allowed by CECL, the Corporation elected to maintain pools of loans accounted for under ASC\nSubtopic 310-30 as “units of accounts,” conceptually treating each pool as a single asset. Regarding interest income recognition, the\nprospective transition approach for PCD loans was applied at a pool level, which froze the effective interest rate of the pools as of\nJanuary 1, 2020. According to regulatory guidance, the determination of nonaccrual or accrual status for PCD loans with respect to\nwhich the Corporation has made a policy election to maintain previously existing pools upon adoption of CECL should be made at the\npool level, not the individual asset level. In addition, the guidance provides that the Corporation can continue accruing interest and not\nreport the PCD loans as being in nonaccrual status if the following criteria are met: (i) the Corporation can reasonably estimate the\ntiming and amounts of cash flows expected to be collected; and (ii) the Corporation did not acquire the asset primarily for the rewards\nof ownership of the underlying collateral, such as the use in operations or improving the collateral for resale. Thus, the Corporation\ncontinues to exclude these pools of PCD loans from nonaccrual loan statistics.\nLoans Past-Due 90 Days and Still Accruing — These are accruing loans that are contractually delinquent 90 days or more. These\npast-due loans are either current as to interest but delinquent as to the payment of principal (i.e., well secured and in process of\ncollection) or are insured or guaranteed under applicable FHA, VA, or other government-guaranteed programs for residential\nmortgage loans. Furthermore, as required by instructions in regulatory reports, loans past due 90 days and still accruing include loans\npreviously pooled into GNMA securities for which the Corporation has the option but not the obligation to repurchase loans that meet\nGNMA’s specified delinquency criteria (e.g., borrowers fail to make any payment for three consecutive months). For accounting\npurposes, these GNMA loans subject to the repurchase option are required to be reflected in the financial statements with an offsetting\nliability. In addition, loans past due 90 days and still accruing include PCD loans, as mentioned above, and credit cards that continue\naccruing interest until charged-off at 180 days.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOREO acquired in settlement of loans is carried at fair value less estimated costs to sell the real estate acquired.

Coupled with external influences, such as market conditions, security risks, and legal risks, the\npotential for operational and reputational loss has increased. To mitigate and control operational risk, the Corporation has developed,\nand continues to enhance, specific internal controls, policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk\nat appropriate levels throughout the organization. The purpose of these mechanisms is to provide reasonable assurance that the\nCorporation’s business operations are functioning within the policies and limits established by management.\nThe Corporation classifies operational risk into two major categories: business-specific and corporate-wide affecting all business\nlines. For business specific risks, Enterprise Risk Management works with the various business units to ensure consistency in policies,\nprocesses and assessments. With respect to corporate-wide risks, such as information security, business recovery, and legal and\ncompliance, the Corporation has specialized groups, such as the Legal Department, Information Security, Corporate Compliance,\nOperations and Enterprise Risk Management. These groups assist the lines of business in the development and implementation of risk\nmanagement practices specific to the needs of the business groups.\nLegal and Compliance Risk\nL egal and compliance risk includes the risk of noncompliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, the risk of adverse\nlegal judgments against the Corporation, and the risk that a counterparty’s performance obligations will be unenforceable. The\nCorporation is subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts its business, and this regulatory\nscrutiny has been significantly increasing over the years. The Corporation has established, and continues to enhance, procedures that\nare designed to ensure compliance with all applicable statutory, regulatory and any other legal requirements. The Corporation has a\nCompliance Director who reports to the Chief Risk Officer and is responsible for the oversight of regulatory compliance and\nimplementation of an enterprise-wide compliance risk assessment process. The Compliance division has officer roles in each major\nbusiness area with direct reporting responsibilities to the Corporate Compliance Group.\nConcentration Risk\nThe Corporation conducts its operations in a geographically concentrated area, as its main market is Puerto Rico. O f the total gross\nloan portfolio held for investment of $12.4 billion as of September 30, 2024 , the Corporation had credit risk of approximately 80% in\nthe Puerto Rico region, 17% in the United States region, and 3% in the Virgin Islands region.\nUpdate on the Puerto Rico Fiscal and Economic Situation\nA significant portion of the Corporation’s business activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the Commonwealth of Puerto\nRico, which has experienced economic and fiscal distress over the last decade. See “Risk Management — Exposure to Puerto Rico\nGovernment” below. Since declaring bankruptcy and benefitting from the enactment of the federal Puerto Rico Oversight,\nManagement and Economic Stability Act (“PROMESA”) in 2016, the Government of Puerto Rico has made progress on fiscal matters\nprimarily by restructuring a large portion of its outstanding public debt and identifying funding sources for its underfunded pension\nsystem.\nEconomic Indicators\nOn March 18, 2024, the Puerto Rico Planning Board (“PRPB”) published an analysis of the Puerto Rico’s economy during fiscal\nyear 2023, as well as a short-term forecast for fiscal years 2024 and 2025. According to the preliminary estimates issued by the PRPB,\nPuerto Rico’s real gross national product (“GNP”) grew by 0.7% in fiscal year 2023, the third consecutive year with a positive year-\nover-year variance. The main drivers behind growth in fiscal year 2023 were personal consumption expenditures and fixed\ninvestments in both construction, and machinery and equipment. The PRPB also revised previously published real GNP growth\nestimates for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 from 3.7% to 3.8% and from 0.9% to 1.4%, respectively.\nThere are other indicators that gauge economic activity and are published with greater frequency, for example, the Economic\nDevelopment Bank for Puerto Rico’s Economic Activity Index (“EDB-EAI”). Although not a direct measure of Puerto Rico’s real\nGNP, the EDB-EAI is correlated to Puerto Rico’s real GNP. For August 2024, estimates showed that the EDB-EAI stood at 126.9,\ndown 0.8% on a year-over-year basis. Over the 12-month period ended August 31, 2024, the EDB-EAI averaged 126.5, 1.0% above\nthe comparable figure a year earlier.\n125\nLabor market trends remain positive. Data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that non-farm payrolls in September\n2024 in Puerto Rico increased by 1.6% when compared to September 2023, primarily driven by payrolls in the private sector as these\nincreased by 2.2% from the comparable figure a year earlier. Key industries driving private-sector payroll growth include Leisure &\nHospitality with a year-over-year increase of 6.5% and Construction with a positive variance of 5.0%. The unemployment rate\ncontinued to trend in the right direction to a record-low level of 5.5% in September 2024.\nFiscal Plan\nOn June 5, 2024, the PROMESA oversight board certified the 2024 Fiscal Plan for Puerto Rico (the “2024 Fiscal Plan”), updated\nwith the most recent data and projections for revenues and expenses, and renewed roadmap for Puerto Rico to achieve fiscal\nresponsibility. The 2024 Fiscal Plan is made up of four parts: (i) progress made in stabilizing government finances, (ii) Puerto Rico’s\ncurrent financial conditions and risks, (iii) details of the actions required to achieve fiscal responsibility and adequate access to credit\nmarkets, and (iv) description of the actions the PROMESA oversight board and the Government must take to complete PROMESA’s\nmandate.\nThe 2024 Fiscal Plan outlines eight areas of focus to achieve long-term fiscal responsibility: (i) improved economic and revenue\nforecasting, (ii) adoption of budget best practices, (iii) comprehensive capital delivery program, (iv) improved management of\neducation resources, (v) improved government service delivery and labor relations, (vi) outcome-based, data-driven, and controlled\nhealthcare spending, (vii) improved, transparent financial reporting, and (viii) optimized municipal fiscal management. Success in\nthese areas, which aim to address the most crucial financial management challenges that Puerto Rico faces, is critical for Puerto Rico\nto fully recover from bankruptcy and to fulfill the mandate of PROMESA to achieve fiscal responsibility.\nAs the debt restructurings come to an end, a significant portion of the uncertainty that has plagued the economy over the past ten\nyears has faded away. To generate revenues that are resilient even when the unprecedented influx of federal funding subsides, fiscal\nstability alone will not suffice. The 2024 Fiscal Plan describes an effort to develop an integrated plan that will serve as a roadmap to\nunlock future growth. While that plan is developed, the PROMESA oversight board and the Government will continue to support\nspecific priorities through a first wave of economic growth initiatives that aim to address the most crucial challenges that Puerto Rico\nfaces. The list of focus areas outlined in the 2024 Fiscal Plan to promote economic growth include: (i) integrated framework for\neconomic growth, (ii) human capital, focused on robust, highly-skilled, and health workforce, (iii) economic strategies, focused on\nimproved ease of doing business, (iv) economic policies, focused on reforms of Puerto Rico’s tax system, and (v) infrastructure,\nfocused on reduced cost and increased reliability of energy, transportation, and internet connectivity.\nSimilar to previous fiscal plans, the 2024 Fiscal Plan includes an updated macroeconomic forecast reflecting the impact of fiscal\nand structural measures, natural disasters, COVID-19, and federal funding in response to natural disasters and the pandemic on the\nbaseline economic trajectory. The 2024 Fiscal Plan projects Puerto Rico GNP growth in fiscal year 2024 to be 1.0%, followed by\ndeclines of 0.8% and 0.1% in fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year 2026, respectively. On average, Puerto Rico’s GNP is projected to grow\napproximately 0.4% between fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2026. Contrary to previous fiscal plans where Puerto Rico’s population\nwas projected to decline, the 2024 Fiscal Plan includes a stable population projection through 2029 mainly due to the offset between a\nnegative natural population decline and positive net migration. Specifically, the revised fiscal plan projections contemplate a net\ninflow of over 20,000 people annually through 2029, compared to an average of less than 5,000 people in the 2023 fiscal plan.\nThe 2024 Fiscal Plan projects that approximately $54.5 billion in total disaster relief funding, from federal and private sources, will\nbe disbursed as part of the reconstruction efforts over a span of 9 years (fiscal years 2024 through 2035). These funds will benefit\nindividuals, the public (e.g., reconstruction of major infrastructure, roads, and schools), and will cover part of Puerto Rico’s share of\nthe cost of disaster relief funding. Also, the 2024 Fiscal Plan projects the $5.9 billion in remaining COVID-19 relief funds to be\ndeployed in fiscal years 2024 and 2025. Additionally, the 2024 Fiscal Plan continues to account for $2.1 billion in federal funds to\nPuerto Rico from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law directed towards improving Puerto Rico’s infrastructure over fiscal years 2024\nthrough 2026. Overall, Puerto Rico’s economic growth is highly dependent on the Government’s ability to efficiently deploy these\nfederal funds.\n126\nDebt Restructuring\nOver 80% of Puerto Rico’s outstanding debt has been restructured to date. On March 15, 2022, the Plan of Adjustment of the\ncentral government’s debt became effective through the exchange of more than $33 billion of existing bonds and other claims into\napproximately $7 billion of new bonds, saving Puerto Rico more than $50 billion in debt payments to creditors. Also, the\nrestructurings of the Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (“COFINA”), the Highways and Transportation Authority\n(“HTA”), and the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (“PRASA”) are expected to yield savings of approximately $17.5\nbillion, $3.0 billion, and $400 million, respectively, in future debt service payments. The main restructuring pending is that of the\nPuerto Rico Electric Power Authority (“PREPA”). All PREPA plan confirmation and bond-related litigation is currently stayed until\nNovember 13, 2024, pursuant to a Court order dated October 7, 2024, as the mediation team continues to participate in multiple\ndiscussions with the PROMESA oversight board, certain mediation parties and additional parties who filed objections to conformation\nof the PREPA plan of adjustment.\nOther Developments\nNotable progress continues to be made as part of the ongoing efforts of prioritizing the restoration, improvement, and\nmodernization of Puerto Rico’s infrastructure, particularly in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017. During the 12-month period\nended August 31, 2024, over $3.4 billion in disaster relief funds were disbursed through the Federal Emergency Management Agency\n(“FEMA”) Public Assistance program and the HUD Community Development Block Grant (“CDBG”) program, an 11% increase\nwhen compared to the same period in 2023. These funds will continue to play a key role in supporting Puerto Rico’s economic\nstability and are expected to have a positive impact on the Island’s infrastructure. For example, approximately 86% of the projects that\nFEMA has obligated to address damage caused by Hurricane Maria have resources to reinforce their infrastructure, among other\nhazard mitigation measures, that will prepare these facilities for future weather events. As of October 10, 2024, over 3,411 projects\nhad already been completed under FEMA’s Public Assistance programs while over 20,600 projects were active across different stages\nof execution for a total cost of $11.5 billion, equivalent to approximately 32% of the agency’s $36.0 billion obligation, according to\nthe Central Office for Recovery, Reconstruction and Resiliency (“COR3”).\nAfter more than five years since the confirmation of the COFINA plan of adjustment, on October 30, 2024, the Court granted the\nPROMESA oversight board’s request for entry of an order closing the COFINA Title III case, making it the first closed bankruptcy\ncase since the enactment of PROMESA.\n127\nExposure to Puerto Rico Government\nA s of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had $309.0 million of direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government, its municipalities\nand public corporations, compared to $297.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The $11.1 million increase was mainly due to the\norigination of two loans to municipalities, with an aggregate balance of $27.7 million, that are supported by assigned property tax\nrevenues and $15.5 million in disbursements on two construction loans to an agency and a public corporation, partially offset by\nmultiple repayments. As of September 30, 2024, approximately $195.6 million of the exposure consisted of loans and obligations of\nmunicipalities in Puerto Rico that are supported by assigned property tax revenues and for which, in most cases, the good faith, credit\nand unlimited taxing power of the applicable municipality have been pledged to their repayment, and $50.9 million consisted of loans\nand obligations which are supported by one or more specific sources of municipal revenues. Approximately 72% of the Corporation’s\nexposure to Puerto Rico municipalities consisted primarily of senior priority loans and obligations concentrated in four of the largest\nmunicipalities in Puerto Rico. The municipalities are required by law to levy special property taxes in such amounts as are required for\nthe payment of all of their respective general obligation bonds and notes. In addition to municipalities, the total direct exposure also\nincluded $8.8 million in a loan extended to an affiliate of PREPA, $50.7 million in loans to agencies or public corporations of the\nPuerto Rico government , and obligations of the Puerto Rico government, specifically a residential pass-through MBS issued by the\nPRHFA, at an amortized cost of $3.0 million as part of its available-for-sale debt securities portfolio (fair value of $1.6 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024) .\nThe following table details the Corporation’s total direct exposure to Puerto Rico government obligations according to their\nmaturities:\nAs of September 30,2024\nInvestment\nPortfolio Total\n(Amortized cost) Loans Exposure\n(In thousands)\nPuerto Rico Housing Finance Authority:\nAfter 10 years $ 3,008 $ - $ 3,008\nTotal Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority 3,008 - 3,008\nAgencies and public corporation of the Puerto Rico government:\nAfter 1 to 5 years - 28,303 28,303\nAfter 5 to 10 years - 22,363 22,363\nTotal agencies and public corporation of the Puerto Rico government - 50,666 50,666\nAffiliate of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority:\nAfter 1 to 5 years - 8,819 8,819\nTotal Puerto Rico government affiliate - 8,819 8,819\nTotal Puerto Rico public corporations and government affiliate - 59,485 59,485\nMunicipalities:\nDue within one year 2,131 26,337 28,468\nAfter 1 to 5 years 61,119 39,220 100,339\nAfter 5 to 10 years 13,121 88,818 101,939\nAfter 10 years 15,755 - 15,755\nTotal Municipalities 92,126 154,375 246,501\nTotal Direct Government Exposure $ 95,134 $ 213,860 $ 308,994\nI n addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had $73.5 million in exposure to residential mortgage loans that are\nguaranteed by the PRHFA, a governmental instrumentality that has been designated as a covered entity under PROMESA (December\n31, 2023 – $77.7 million). Residential mortgage loans guaranteed by the PRHFA are secured by the underlying properties and the\nguarantees serve to cover shortfalls in collateral in the event of a borrower default. The Puerto Rico government guarantees up to $75\nmillion of the principal for all loans under the mortgage loan insurance program. According to the most recently released audited\nfinancial statements of the PRHFA, as of June 30, 2023, the PRHFA’s mortgage loans insurance program covered loans in an\naggregate amount of approximately $388 million. The regulations adopted by the PRHFA require the establishment of adequate\nreserves to guarantee the solvency of the mortgage loans insurance program. As of June 30, 2023, the most recent date as of which\ninformation is available, the PRHFA had a liability of approximately $1.3 million as an estimate of the losses inherent in the portfolio.\nAs of each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation had $2.7 billion of public sector deposits in Puerto\nRico. Approximately 22% of the public sector deposits as of September 30, 2024 were from municipalities and municipal agencies in\nPuerto Rico and 78% were from public corporations, the Puerto Rico central government and agencies, and U.S. federal government\nagencies in Puerto Rico.\n128\nExposure to USVI Government\nThe Corporation has operations in the USVI and has credit exposure to USVI government entities.\nFor many years, the USVI has been experiencing several fiscal and economic challenges that have deteriorated the overall financial\nand economic conditions in the area. On June 17, 2024, the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis (the “BEA”) released its\nestimates of GDP for 2022. According to the BEA, the USVI’s real GDP decreased 1.3% in 2022 after increasing 3.7% in 2021. The\ndecrease in real GDP reflected declines in exports, private fixed investment, government spending, and personal consumption\nexpenditures. These negative variances were partly offset by an increase in inventory investment, while imports, a subtraction item in\nthe calculation of GDP, decreased.\nOver the past three years, the USVI has been recovering from the adverse impact caused by COVID-19 and has continued to make\nprogress on its rebuilding efforts related to Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which occurred in September 2017. According to data\npublished by FEMA, over $5.5 billion in disaster recovery funds had been disbursed through August 2024 and nearly $11 billion were\nremaining obligated funds pending to be disbursed. Moreover, labor market trends remain stable with non-farm payrolls during the\nthird quarter of 2024 slightly down by 0.4% and 0.8% on a quarter -over-quarter and year-over-year basis, respectively.\nOn December 14, 2023, Fitch Ratings announced that it withdrew the ratings of the U.S. Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority\n(“WAPA”) primarily due to limited availability of the authority’s operating and financial information from public sources or from\nWAPA’s management.\nFinally, PROMESA does not apply to the USVI and, as such, there is currently no federal legislation permitting the restructuring of\nthe debts of the USVI and its public corporations and instrumentalities. To the extent that the fiscal condition of the USVI government\ndeteriorates again, the U.S. Congress or the government of the USVI may enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the\nfinancial obligations of the USVI government entities or imposing a stay on creditor remedies, including by making PROMESA\napplicable to the USVI.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation had $48.4 million and $90.5 million, respectively, in loans to\nUSVI public corporations, of which $15.0 million and $57.2 million, respectively, were fully collateralized by cash balances held at\nthe Bank. As of September 30, 2024, all loans were currently performing and up to date on principal and interest payments.\n129\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nFor information regarding market risk to which the Corporation is exposed, see the information contained in Part I, Item 2,\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management” in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nF irst BanCorp.’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of\nFirst BanCorp.’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, the Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as\nof September 30, 2024 and provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in reports\nthat the Corporation files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nspecified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and reported to the Corporation’s management, including the Chief Executive\nOffice and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes to the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)\nunder the Exchange Act) during our most recent quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.\n130\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nIn accordance with the instructions to Part II of Form 10-Q, the other specified items in this part have been omitted because they are not\napplicable, or the information has been previously reported.\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFor a discussion of legal proceedings, see Note 21 – “Regulatory Matters, Commitments and Contingencies,” to the unaudited\nconsolidated financial statements herein, which is incorporated by reference in this Part II, Item 1.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Corporation’s business, operating results and/or the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by a number of\nfactors. A detailed discussion of certain risk factors that could affect the Corporation’s future operations, financial condition or results for\nfuture periods is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors, and others, could\ncause actual results to differ materially from historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in\nthis report. Also, refer to the discussion in “Forward-Looking Statements” and Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations,” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information that may supplement or\nupdate the discussion of risk factors in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther than as described below, there have been no material changes from those risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk\nFactors,” in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe volatility in the financial services industry, including failures or rumored failures of other depository institutions, and\nactions taken by governmental agencies to stabilize the financial system, could result in, among other things, bank deposit runoffs,\nliquidity constraints, and increased regulatory requirements and costs.\nThe closure and placement into receivership with the FDIC of certain large U.S. regional banks with assets over $100 billion in March\nand May 2023, and adverse developments affecting other banks, resulted in heightened levels of market volatility and consequently\nnegatively impacted customer confidence in the safety and soundness of financial institutions. These developments resulted in certain\nregional banks experiencing higher than normal deposit outflows and an elevated level of competition for available deposits in the market.\nThe impact of market volatility from the adverse developments in the banking industry, along with continued elevated interest rates on our\nbusiness and related financial results, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.\nIn the aftermath of these recent bank failures, the banking agencies have increased regulatory requirements and costs that may impact\ncapital ratios or the FDIC deposit insurance premium. For example, in 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to impose a special assessment to\nrecover certain estimated losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) arising from the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature\nBank. The estimated losses will be recovered through quarterly special assessments collected from certain insured depository institutions,\nincluding the Bank, and collection began during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. In connection with updates made by the FDIC to the\ninitial estimated losses to the DIF, the Corporation recorded charges of $1.1 million during the nine-month period ended September 30,\n2024 in the consolidated statements of income as part of “FDIC deposit insurance” expenses. As of September 30, 2024, the estimated\nFDIC special assessment amounted to $7.4 million, of which $1.6 million has been paid. The Corporation continues to monitor the FDIC’s\nestimated loss to the DIF, which could affect the amount of its accrued liability.\n131\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nThe Corporation did not have any unregistered sales of equity securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe following table provides information in relation to the Corporation’s purchases of its common stock during the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nTotal Number of Approximate Dollar Value\nShares Purchased as of Shares that May Yet be\nPart of Publicly Purchased Under the Plans\nTotal Number of Shares Average Price Announced Plans or or Programs (in\nPeriod Purchased Paid per Share Programs (1) thousands) (1)\nJuly 1, 2024 - July 31, 2024 - $ - - $ 300,000\nAugust 1, 2024 - August 31, 2024 - - - 300,000\nSeptember 1, 2024 - September 30, 2024 898 21.17 - 250,000\nTotal 898(2) -\n(1) A s of September 30, 2024, the Corporation was authorized to purchase up to $225 million of the Corporation’s common stock under the program that was publicly announced on July 24,\n2023, of which $175 million had been utilized. In addition, the Corporation was authorized to purchase up to $250 million that could include repurchases of common stock or junior\nsubordinated debentures under the program that was publicly announced on July 22, 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, the Corporation redeemed $50.0 million of junior\nsubordinated debentures under the $250 million repurchase program, as further explained in Note 7 - “Non-Consolidated Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”) and Servicing Assets. The\nremaining $250.0 million in the table represents the remaining amount authorized under both repurchase programs. The Corporation’s repurchase programs do not obligate it to acquire\nany specific number of shares and do not have an expiration date. The repurchase programs may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time at the Corporation's discretion. Under\nthe stock repurchase program, shares may be repurchased through open market purchases, accelerated share repurchases and/or privately negotiated transactions, including under plans\ncomplying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.\n(2) Consists of 898 shares of common stock acquired by the Corporation to cover minimum tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of equity-based awards.

The CSO Officer also serves as Chief Information Security Officer. The CSO provides the\nBoard’s Risk Committee with regular reports and engages in discussions throughout the year on the effectiveness\nof the CISP, including risk mitigation strategy and progress.

The CISP\nalso addresses cybersecurity breaches and procedures for appropriate response efforts, including any required\nnotification, depending on the severity of the specific security incident.\nPeriodic scans and penetration tests are conducted using different tools and providers to detect and correct\nsecurity vulnerabilities. These are remediated using a risk-based approach and at the management level, monitored\nthrough the Vulnerability Management Committee and Patch Management Board, which report to the Board’s Risk\nCommittee periodically. In the case of potential security incidents, our Corporate Incident Response Program\nincludes a risk-based escalation process to manage corporate incidents, including cybersecurity incidents, and to\nnotify the Board’s Risk Committee and applicable stakeholders, as appropriate.\nWe conduct multiple annual external and internal independent audits and report information security key\nperformance indicators periodically to the Board’s Risk Committee. As part of our information security and\ncybersecurity risk evaluation, we continuously assess how new products, technology deployments, internal\nchanges, external events, and threat evolution might impact our information security framework, and determine if\nadditional resources, processes, or technology are needed. This ongoing process's purpose is to modify or\nenhance our layers of defense as needed and to remediate any vulnerabilities.\nAn independent cybersecurity assessment of our risk and preparedness is performed and validated by our\nregulators on an annual basis.

This group considers climate risks and opportunities related to banking, underwriting\nactivities, and our operations.\nThe ESG Committee is composed of leaders from our Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations, Corporate Affairs, Credit, Marketing, Human Resources, Finance, Risk\nManagement, and Compliance Teams. The ESG Committee aligns ESG priorities with initiatives for the year for GNC Committee approval, sets long-term objectives and goals,\nand leads the annual reporting process on ESG-related topics.\nThe ESG Committee meets periodically and reports to the Chief Executive Officer and the GNC Committee. In 2023, the ESG Committee reported to the GNC Committee\ntwice. These reports and action items included considerations for enhancing our operational environmental footprint, including LED lighting, a new recycling program, the\nviability of renewable energy installations within our branches, and the integration of certain ESG-related risks into our credit policy.\nThe Corporation’s Sustainability Policy outlines our ESG focus areas, including energy management and climate change risk. This policy applies to all Corporation employees,\nthe Board, and other relevant stakeholders. It is updated at least once every two years and is reviewed and approved by our management team and the Board.\nIn addition to our ESG Committee, there are several management-level committees that support risk oversight. These committees include the following:\n• Executive Risk Management Committee: Oversees risk governance across the corporation at the management level\n• Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) Committee: Oversees CECL-related processes, resources, models, and calculations\n• Management Investments and Asset-Liability Committee: Assists the Board in its oversight of the Corporation’s policies and procedures relating to asset and liability\nmanagement\n• Vendor Management Committee: Oversees the Corporation’s policies, procedures, and practices relating to the Corporation’s vendor management efforts and evaluates\nthe risks of third-party providers\n• Business Continuity Management Committee: Oversees our enterprise Business Continuity Management program to ensure continued business operations in the event\nof a major disruption\n• Emergency Committee: Activates emergency and disaster recovery procedures to ensure the safety of personnel and the continuity of critical services\nOur Risk Management Policy guides our risk management processes and ongoing efforts to identify and realize opportunities.\n77\nFIRST BANCORP 2023 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT INTRODUCTION LEADERSHIP AND RESPONSIBLE SUSTAINABLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL OUR COLLEAGUES SUPPORTING APPENDIX\nGOVERNANCE BANKING ACCESSIBLE FINANCE STEWARDSHIP OUR COMMUNITIES\nReporting Recommendation Response\nStrategy\nDisclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the\ncompany’s businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.\na. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities The Corporation understands that the key to climate resilience lies within our ability to manage potential climate risks and maximize climate-related opportunities. We have\nthe company has identified over the short, medium, identified several risks and opportunities, outlined below, and have processes in place to take appropriate action in the pursuit of long-term sustainability.\nand long term\nRISKS\nThrough our ERM process, we have identified potential business risks that may be exacerbated by climate-related drivers. These risks may fall into one or more categories of\nrisk, including policy and legal risk, reputational risk, market risk, and physical risk (acute and chronic).\nWe are subject to ESG risks that could adversely affect our reputation and the market price of our securities.\nThere is an increased focus from certain government regulators, investors, customers, business partners, and other stakeholders concerning ESG matters, and the\nexpectations related to ESG matters are rapidly evolving. The increased focus by investors and other stakeholders on the ESG practices of publicly traded companies, like us,\nhas included or may in the future include expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure on topics such as climate change, human capital, labor, and\nrisk oversight and could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report. These requirements would likely result in\nincreased ESG-related compliance costs, which could result in increases in our overall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor\nor stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation, our ability to do business with certain partners, and our stock price.\nFor example, we may be exposed to negative publicity based on the identity and activities of those to whom we lend and with whom we otherwise do business and the\npublic’s view of the approach and performance of our customers and business partners with respect to ESG matters. Any such negative publicity could arise from adverse\nnews coverage in traditional media and could also spread through the use of social media platforms. The Corporation’s relationships and reputation with its existing and\nprospective customers and third parties with whom we do business could be damaged if we were to become the subject of any such negative publicity. This, in turn, could\nhave an adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain customers and employees and could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. In addition, we could be criticized by ESG detractors for the scope or nature of our ESG initiatives or policies or for any revisions to these policies. We could also\nbe subjected to negative responses by governmental actors (such as anti-ESG legislation or retaliatory legislative treatment) or consumers (such as boycotts or negative\npublicity campaigns) that could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other\ncatastrophic events.\nNatural disasters, whose nature and severity may be impacted by climate change, such as hurricanes, floods, extreme cold events, and other adverse weather conditions;\npublic health crises; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, labor unrest, other political instability, trade policies, and sanctions, including the repercussions of the\nongoing conflict in Ukraine, the conflict between Israel and Hamas, and the possible expansion of such conflicts to surrounding areas and potential geopolitical\nconsequences; negative global climate patterns, especially in water-stressed regions; or other catastrophic events, such as fires or other disasters occurring at our locations,\nwhether occurring in Puerto Rico, the U.S., or internationally, could cause a significant adverse effect on the economy and disrupt our operations. Certain areas in which our\nbusiness is concentrated, including Puerto Rico and the USVI, are particularly susceptible to earthquakes, hurricanes, and major storms. Further, climate change may increase\nboth the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, which may affect our business operations, either in a particular region or globally, as well\nas the activities of our customers. The Corporation is also not able to predict the positive or negative effects that future events or changes to the U.S. or global economy,\nfinancial markets, or regulatory and business environment could have on our operations.\n78\nFIRST BANCORP 2023 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT INTRODUCTION LEADERSHIP AND RESPONSIBLE SUSTAINABLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL OUR COLLEAGUES SUPPORTING APPENDIX\nGOVERNANCE BANKING ACCESSIBLE FINANCE STEWARDSHIP OUR COMMUNITIES\nReporting Recommendation Response\nStrategy\nDisclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the\ncompany’s businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.\na. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities Climate change, and efforts to mitigate its long-term effects, may materially adversely affect the Corporation’s business and results of operations.\nthe company has identified over the short, medium,\nand long term Concerns over the long-term effects of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and\nbusinesses also may voluntarily change their behaviors as a result of these concerns. The Corporation and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as\nwell as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. The Corporation and its customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions, and\noperating process changes. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on the type of business and other attributes, including reliance on our role in fossil fuel\nactivities. Among the impacts to the Corporation, we could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. The\nCorporation’s efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions, including increasing our business with climate-responsible companies, may not be\neffective in protecting the Corporation from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior.\nOPPORTUNITIES\nWe have identified opportunities within our business to act as a financing provider for companies engaged in clean and renewable energy sectors. We aim to continue driving\nlending and investments in areas that are aligned with responsible climate risk management and that are within our credit policies and parameters.\nb. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and The Corporation incorporates ESG and climate considerations into how we manage our business. The following aspects of our business and strategy have been influenced by\nopportunities on the company’s businesses, climate-related risks and opportunities:\nstrategy, and financial planning\n• Products and Services: Climate-related risks to our loan portfolio are managed via our credit governance processes. We have expanded the mandate for the Corporation’s\nCommercial Loan Credit Policy to further strengthen our ability to assess the downside risk of our credit investments while considering the transition and fiscal risks of our\ncredit investments. Further, loans to entities within the oil and gas industry now have stricter approval requirements since updating our policy in 2023. We have set a clear\npath toward focusing on companies that value environmental and community stewardship. For more information, see ESG in the Commercial Credit Process.\n• Operations – Adaptation and Mitigation Activities: The Corporation has invested in a robust Business Continuity Management Program that enables us to mitigate losses\nassociated with, among other aspects, physical climate events. This program, linked to our ERM structure, facilitates swift identification of potential impacts that may\nthreaten our operations and provides a framework for effective responses and adaptation measures that safeguard our business and other key stakeholders. The program is\ncomprehensive and incorporates business impact analyses, disaster recovery strategies, and emergency preparedness and response plans. For more information, see\nBusiness Continuity Management.\nc. Describe the resilience of the company’s strategy, The Corporation has not undergone a specific climate-related scenario analysis; however, we have worked to build climate resilience within our business strategy and\ntaking into consideration different climate-related operations by integrating climate considerations into the management of our credit and loan portfolios and taking adaptive measures within our facilities that are most likely to\nscenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario be impacted by acute and chronic physical climate risks.\n79\nFIRST BANCORP 2023 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT INTRODUCTION LEADERSHIP AND RESPONSIBLE SUSTAINABLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL OUR COLLEAGUES SUPPORTING APPENDIX\nGOVERNANCE BANKING ACCESSIBLE FINANCE STEWARDSHIP OUR COMMUNITIES\nReporting Recommendation Response\nRisk Management\nDisclose how the company identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.\na.

This taxonomy includes the following risk categories at its highest level: legal and regulatory, credit, liquidity,\nmarket and interest rate, model, reputational, strategic, capital, operational, and technological.\nRISK APPETITE\nThe Corporation’s risk management processes are completed within the context of our Risk Appetite Statement, which outlines the strategic, regulatory, operational, and\nfinancial parameters that reflect our corporate risk appetite and collective business judgment regarding risk-taking activities. The Risk Appetite Statement is driven by the\ncorporate strategic objectives delineated by the Board and management, reflecting a combination of short-term stakeholder expectations and longer-term corporate\nstrategies.\nRISK CULTURE AND REPORTING\nThe Corporation leverages various methods to build and maintain our strong risk culture and communicate our risk strategy to internal and external stakeholders. These\nmethods include internal trainings, regular enterprise risk profile reports to the Board and its Committees, and public disclosure of material risks to external stakeholders in the\nform of our SEC filings and voluntary sustainability reporting initiatives.\nBUSINESS LINE AND CORPORATE RISK ASSESSMENT\nAt an enterprise level, the Corporation completes a Business Line and Corporate Risk Assessment exercise at least once every two years. This exercise enables us to identify\nand assess material risks faced by the Corporation and develop action plans to manage top risks.\nIdentification\nWe deploy a top-down and bottom-up approach to identify potential risk factors within the parameters of our risk taxonomy. Each business line completes a self-assessment\nto identify risks in the context of its operating environment. At the corporate level, risks are identified through a collaborative process that leverages industry resources, such\nas the American Bankers Association Risk Library, to populate a comprehensive universe of possible risks and that engages risk managers and subject-matter experts\nthroughout the Corporation to identify risks most relevant to our business. Identification processes at both the business line and corporate levels come together to create a\nwell-informed view of identified enterprise risks.\nAssessment\nOur Business Line and Corporate Risk Assessment exercise involves a risk assessment process that enables us to anticipate the likelihood and severity of identified risks.\nThrough this process, we evaluate material enterprise risks, the likelihood of occurrence, and the adequacy of existing controls to determine appropriate countermeasures and\nmitigating activities. The assessment considers the inherent risk, controls, and residual risk exposure. Review and challenge processes are conducted throughout the\nexecution of this exercise.\nManagement and Mitigation\nThe final aggregated Corporate Risk Assessment, along with action plans and top risks, is reviewed by ERM and Operational Risk Director and is presented to the Executive\nRisk Management Committee and Board Risk Committee for final review.\n81\nFIRST BANCORP 2023 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT INTRODUCTION LEADERSHIP AND RESPONSIBLE SUSTAINABLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL OUR COLLEAGUES SUPPORTING APPENDIX\nGOVERNANCE BANKING ACCESSIBLE FINANCE STEWARDSHIP OUR COMMUNITIES\nReporting Recommendation Response\nRisk Management\nDisclose how the company identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.\nSTRESS TESTING\nThe Corporation periodically conducts enterprise-level stress-testing exercises to account for idiosyncratic and event-driven risks related to ongoing business operations\nbased on internally generated stress. We leverage scenarios tailored to our business and risks to assess potential impacts on our financial condition, including losses,\nearnings, cash flows, capital, and liquidity. The Corporation macroeconomic scenarios baseline forecast includes climate change assumptions that are consistent with a\nweighted average of the assumptions underpinning a range of scenarios, including those from the Network for Greening the Financial System. In the baseline forecast for the\nmacroeconomy, the following climate risk assumptions were adopted:\n• Global CO2 emissions will fall by 64% from their pre-pandemic level by 2100\n• The global mean temperature will rise 2.5°C above its pre-industrial level by 2100\n• Global carbon prices will rise from $3 to $325 per ton by 2100\n• The global percentage of non-carbon-emitting energy consumption will rise from 17% to 71% by 2100\n• Chronic physical risk will shave six basis points from global gross domestic product growth per annum, adding up to a cumulative 5.1% reduction by 2100\n• Economic loss due to acute physical risk will accelerate, rising from an estimated $129 billion in the U.S. to nearly $500 billion annually by 2050\nCORPORATE BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nOur Corporate Business Continuity Management Program is committed to:\n• Making the Corporation more resilient to potential threats\n• Enabling the Corporation to resume or continue operations under adverse or abnormal conditions\nThis is accomplished through the introduction of appropriate resilience strategies to reduce the likelihood and impact of a threat and the development of plans to respond to\nand recover from threats that cannot be controlled or mitigated.\nThe Corporation’s Business Continuity Plan is developed, tested, and kept current following the recommendations in the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council\nBusiness Continuity Management Booklet and the best practices in Disaster Recovery Institute (DRI) International’s Professional Practices and Business Continuity Institute.\nEach business unit is responsible for developing and implementing a training and communication program to establish and maintain awareness of the unit’s Business\nContinuity Plan (BCP) and to train the unit’s staff members so that they are prepared to respond during an event. Plans must include cross-training of staff members to permit\nflexibility of assignment during an emergency.
