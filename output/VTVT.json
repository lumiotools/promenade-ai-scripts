(Nasdaq: VTVT), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a portfolio of novel small molecules and a lead program in diabetes, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided an update on recent corporate developments.\n\n\"Our _cadisegliatin_ program continues to show promise as a new oral adjunct therapy being investigated for improvement in glycemic control and reduction of hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes. During the quarter, our team made progress addressing the basis for the clinical hold placed on our clinical program by the Food and Drug Administration in July,” said Paul Sekhri, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of vTv Therapeutics. \"We look forward to continuing our discussion with the FDA regarding the clinical hold and our clinical program for _cadisegliatin_._\"_\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Cash Position** : The Company’s cash position as of September 30, 2024, was $41.6 million compared to $9.4 million as of December 31, 2023. This increase is largely due to proceeds from the private placement financing on February 27, 2024, and additional funds from the ATM Offering during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n  * **Research & Development (R&D) Expenses**: R&D expenses were $3.2 million and $2.8 million in each of the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The increase reflects higher indirect costs and other project-related expenses. This was partially offset by lower spending on _cadisegliatin_ , primarily due to reduced costs in toxicity studies and drug manufacturing, countered by increased clinical trial start-up costs.\n  * **General & Administrative (G&A) Expenses:** G&A expenses were $3.3 million and $2.5 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to increases in share-based expense, legal expense and higher payroll costs.\n  * **Other Income (Expense), Net** : Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $0.2 million and was driven by gains related to the change in the fair value of the warrants to purchase shares of our own stock. Other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023, was $3.3 million and was driven by an impairment charge on a cost-method investment. This was partially offset by an unrealized gain from the Company’s investment in OnKure and gains from changes in the fair value of warrants to purchase shares of our own stock issued to related parties.\n  * **Net Loss** : Net loss attributable to vTv shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $4.8 million or $0.88 per basic share. Net loss attributable to vTv shareholders for the comparable period a year ago was $6.7 million or $3.19 per basic share.\n\n**vTv Therapeutics Inc.****Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets****(in thousands)**  \n---  \n**September 30 ,****2024** | **December 31 ,****2023**  \n**(Unaudited)**  \n**Assets**  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 41,571 | $ | 9,446  \nAccounts receivable | 242 | 102  \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets | 1,060 | 1,044  \nCurrent deposits | 85 | 65  \nTotal current assets | 42,958 | 10,657  \nProperty and equipment, net | 50 | 117  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets | 156 | 244  \nTotal assets | $ | 43,164 | $ | 11,018  \n**Liabilities, Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest and Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit)**  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nAccounts payable and accrued expenses | $ | 6,226 | $ | 10,242  \nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities | 181 | 169  \nCurrent portion of contract liabilities | 17 | 17  \nCurrent portion of notes payable | — | 191  \nTotal current liabilities | 6,424 | 10,619  \nContract liabilities, net of current portion | 18,669 | 18,669  \nOperating lease liabilities, net of current portion | 32 | 169  \nWarrant liability, related party | 82 | 110  \nWarrant liability | 44 | —  \nTotal liabilities | 25,251 | 29,567  \nCommitments and contingencies  \nRedeemable noncontrolling interest | — | 6,131  \nStockholders’ equity (deficit):  \nClass A Common Stock | 26 | 21  \nClass B Common Stock | 6 | 6  \nAdditional paid-in capital | 311,060 | 256,335  \nAccumulated deficit | (296,084 | ) | (281,042 | )  \nTotal stockholders’ equity (deficit) attributable to vTv Therapeutics Inc. | 15,008 | (24,680 | )  \nNoncontrolling interest | 2,905 | —  \nTotal stockholders’ equity (deficit) | 17,913 | (24,680 | )  \nTotal liabilities, redeemable noncontrolling interest and stockholders’ equity (deficit) | $ | 43,164 | $ | 11,018  \n**vTv Therapeutics Inc.****Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations****(in thousands, except per share data)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****September 30 ,** | **Nine Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n**2024** | **2023(*)** | **2024** | **2023(*)**  \n**(Unaudited)** | **(Unaudited)**  \nRevenue | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 1,000 | $ | —  \nOperating expenses:  \nResearch and development | 3,224 | 2,824 | 9,312 | 11,457  \nGeneral and administrative | 3,282 | 2,544 | 10,976 | 9,338  \nTotal operating expenses | 6,506 | 5,368 | 20,288 | 20,795  \nOperating loss | (6,506 | ) | (5,368 | ) | (19,288 | ) | (20,795 | )  \nInterest income | 504 | 131 | 1,136 | 384  \nInterest expense | — | (4 | ) | — | (6 | )  \nOther income (expense), net | 162 | (3,299 | ) | (16 | ) | (1,108 | )  \nLoss before income taxes and noncontrolling interest | (5,840 | ) | (8,540 | ) | (18,168 | ) | (21,525 | )  \nIncome tax provision | — | — | 100 | —  \nNet loss before noncontrolling interest | (5,840 | ) | (8,540 | ) | (18,268 | ) | (21,525 | )  \nLess: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest | (1,057 | ) | (1,886 | ) | (3,440 | ) | (4,753 | )  \nNet loss attributable to vTv Therapeutics Inc. | $ | (4,783 | ) | $ | (6,654 | ) | $ | (14,828 | ) | $ | (16,772 | )  \nNet loss attributable to vTv Therapeutics Inc. common shareholders | $ | (4,783 | ) | $ | (6,654 | ) | $ | (14,828 | ) | $ | (16,772 | )  \nNet loss per share of vTv Therapeutics Inc.

(Nasdaq: VTVT), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company with an innovative clinical portfolio of small molecules and lead program in diabetes, today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024, and provided an update on recent corporate developments.\n\n“Our small molecule portfolio continues to make significant progress across our partnered and Company driven programs. We were pleased to amend our license with Newsoara Biopharma for PDE4 inhibitor, _HPP737,_ to make it a global license contingent upon receipt of the required upfront fee. _Azeliragon,_ a Cantex-partnered program, recently received Orphan Drug Designation in pancreatic cancer and is advancing in several mid- to late-stage clinical trials with broad indication potential,” said Paul Sekhri, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of vTv Therapeutics. “We were pleased to initiate our pivotal trial in T1D for c _adisegliatin,_ our liver selective glucokinase activator with first-in-class potential in T1D. We are working to resolve our clinical hold and resume the study as quickly as possible._Cadisegliatin_ has shown a favorable safety profile and has been dosed in over 500 subjects to date, including 300 patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We are encouraged at the potential of _cadisegliatin_ as an oral therapy for improved glycemic control.”\n\n**Recent Company Highlights**\n\n  * **Screened First Patient in**** _Cadisegliatin_****Pivotal Trial for T1D.** In June, vTv Therapeutics screened the first patient in the Company’s CATT1 pivotal trial evaluating _cadisegliatin_ as an adjunct treatment of T1D. CATT1 is one of several trials that are planned to form the core of the future regulatory registrational submission for _cadisegliatin_ , a potential first-in-class, oral, liver selective, glucokinase activator for T1D. In July, vTv Therapeutics announced the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed a clinical hold on the _cadisegliatin_ clinical program following the discovery of a chromatographic signal in a recent human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study of _cadisegliatin_ that could not be resolved by standard mass spectroscopy. The FDA requires a single _in vitro_ study to characterize this signal before the _cadisegliatin_ program can resume. No patient was dosed in the CATT1 pivotal study at the time of the clinical hold, and past clinical studies did not reveal any clinically concerning safety issues. vTv Therapeutics is actively working with the FDA to resolve the clinical hold as quickly as possible._Cadisegliatin_ has previously been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA for T1D and has shown clinical potential to improve glycemic control and reduce hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes.\n  * **Expanded to a Global Licensing Agreement for**** _HPP737_****with Newsoara Biopharma.** In June, vTv Therapeutics amended our license with Newsoara Biopharma for PDE4 inhibitor, _HPP737,_ to make it a global license upon receipt of the required $20 million upfront fee. The terms of the amendment include up to $41 million in development milestones, up to $35 million in sales-related milestones, and royalties in the mid to upper single digits based on sales.\n  * **Orphan Drug Designation Granted for**** _Azeliragon_****.** In May, Cantex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced that the FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation to _azeliragon_ , a well-tolerated once-a-day oral RAGE antagonist, for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. _Azeliragon_ has also received Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of glioblastoma. Under our license agreement with Cantex, vTv Therapeutics has the potential to receive 20 – 40% of out licensing income or the fair value of the program in the event of a sale of Cantex, or 20% of Cantex’s net profit from commercial sales. Cantex is evaluating _azeliragon_ in several ongoing Phase 2 trials in cancer indications and one Phase 3 trial for acute kidney injury.\n\n\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Cash Position** : The Company’s cash position as of June 30, 2024, was $45.5 million compared to $9.4 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase is attributed to receipt of the proceeds from the private placement financing on February 27, 2024.\n  * **Research & Development (R&D) Expenses**: R&D expenses were $3.4 million and $4.7 million in each of the three months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The decrease of $1.3 million is primarily attributable to lower spending on _cadisegliatin,_ due to decreases in toxicity study costs and drug manufacturing related costs, partially offset by increases in clinical trial start-up costs and an increase in indirect costs and other projects.\n  * **General & Administrative (G&A) Expenses:** G&A expenses were $3.7 million and $3.3 million for each of the three months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The increase of $0.4 million was primarily due to increases in share-based expense, legal expense and higher payroll costs, partially offset by lower other G&A costs.\n  * **Other Income, Net** : Other income for the three months ended June 30, 2024, was $0.2 million and was driven by gains related to the change in the fair value of the outstanding warrants to purchase shares of our own stock. Other income for the three months ended June 30, 2023, was $0.6 million and was driven by an unrealized gain related to our investment in Reneo, as well as gains related to the change in the fair value of the outstanding warrants to purchase shares of our own stock issued to related parties.\n  * **Net Loss** : Net loss attributable to vTv shareholders for the three months ended June 30, 2024, was $5.2 million or $0.81 per basic share.

(Nasdaq: VTVT), a late stage biopharmaceutical company with an innovative clinical portfolio of small molecules and lead program in diabetes, today announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has placed a clinical hold on the c _adisegliatin_ clinical program which includes the ongoing CATT1 Phase 3 trial in type 1 diabetes. _Cadisegliatin_ is an oral, liver selective, glucokinase activator that has been well-tolerated in over 500 subjects to date with up to six months of treatment.\n\nThe clinical hold was based on the discovery of a chromatographic signal in a recent human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study of _cadisegliatin_ that could not be resolved by standard mass spectroscopy. The Agency requires a single in vitro study to characterize this signal before the c _adisegliatin_ program can resume. No patient had been dosed in CATT1 at the time of the clinical hold, and past clinical studies did not reveal any clinically concerning safety issues.\n\n“Patient safety is our top priority, and we appreciate the thoroughness of the FDA to better understand this signal. We are working diligently with the Agency to resolve the clinical hold and resume enrollment as quickly as possible,” said Paul Sekhri, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of vTv Therapeutics. “ _Cadisegliatin_ demonstrated compelling efficacy and a favorable safety profile in over 500 subjects dosed to date, and we are highly encouraged at the potential of _cadisegliatin_ to improve glycemic control and be a much-needed oral therapy for type 1 diabetes.”\n\n**About** **Cadisegliatin** _Cadisegliatin_ (TTP399) is a novel, oral small molecule, liver selective glucokinase activator with first-in- class potential as an adjunct treatment for type 1 diabetes (T1D). Selectively acting on the liver, _cadisegliatin_ increases the activity of glucokinase independently from insulin to improve glycemic control through hepatic glucose uptake and glycogen storage.\n\n**About** **vTv** **Therapeutics** vTv Therapeutics Inc. is a late stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel oral, small molecule drug candidates to help treat millions with chronic diseases. vTv’s clinical pipeline is led by _cadisegliatin_ , a potential first-in-class adjunctive therapy to insulin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.\n\n**Forward-Looking** **Statement** This release contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties.

CATT1 is designed to be a registrational study and is one of several trials that will form the core of the regulatory submission for _cadisegliatin,_ a potential first-in-class, oral, liver selective, glucokinase activator for T1D that has been dosed in over 500 subjects to date, including 300 patients with T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D).\n\n“Maintaining glycemic control remains a high and burdensome unmet need for the nearly 8 million people with T1D worldwide. _Cadisegliatin_ is a new approach to current standards of care that is designed to regulate blood glucose levels by selectively activating glucose pathways in the liver,” said Paul Sekhri, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of vTv Therapeutics. “Screening the first patient marks an important milestone for our late stage _cadisegliatin_ program and brings us closer to our mission of delivering novel treatments that help improve the lives of millions of patients living with diabetes.”\n\nDr. Thomas Strack, Chief Medical Officer of vTv Therapeutics added, “85% of patients with T1D experience one or two hypoglycemic episodes every week, representing an important barrier that limits optimal treatment. _Cadisegliatin_ is designed to reactivate the glucose-regulating capacity in the liver independent of insulin to safely improve episodes of hyper- and hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes.”\n\nCATT1 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal study evaluating the efficacy and safety of _cadisegliatin_ over 12 months in adults 18 years or older diagnosed with T1D. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 150 patients at up to 20 sites in the U.S. Two doses of orally administered _cadisegliatin_ versus placebo will be assessed in patients currently being treated with multiple daily insulin injections and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion who use a continuous glucose monitor. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study will compare the incidence of Level 2 or Level 3 hypoglycemic events between _cadisegliatin_ -treated subjects and those in the placebo group.\n\n_Cadisegliatin_ will also be evaluated as an adjunctive therapy to insulin in patients with T2D as part of a planned Phase 2 trial in Middle Eastern countries in collaboration with G42 Healthcare Research Technology Projects LLC and its clinical research organization IROS, a UAE-based health technology group which is expected to start in the second half of 2024.\n\n**About** **Cadisegliatin** _Cadisegliatin_ (TTP399) is a novel, oral small molecule, liver selective glucokinase activator with first-in-class potential as an adjunct treatment for type 1 diabetes (T1D). Selectively acting on the liver, _cadisegliatin_ increases the activity of glucokinase independently from insulin to improve glycemic control through hepatic glucose uptake and glycogen storage.\n\n**About** **vTv** **Therapeutics** vTv Therapeutics Inc. is a late stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing oral, small molecule drug candidates. vTv’s clinical pipeline is led by _cadisegliatin_ , a potential adjunctive therapy to insulin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. vTv and its development partners are pursuing additional indications including type 2 diabetes and other chronic conditions.\n\n**Forward-Looking** **Statement** This release contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties.
