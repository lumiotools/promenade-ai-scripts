(\"Aileron\") (NASDAQ: ALRN), a biopharmaceutical company advancing a novel pipeline of first-in-class medicines to address significant unmet medical needs in orphan pulmonary and fibrosis indications, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update.\n\n[ ![Aileron logo \\(PRNewsfoto/AILERON THERAPEUTICS\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2451051/aileron_logo_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2451051/aileron_logo_Logo.html)\n\n\"This past quarter has been one of significant progress for Aileron, as evidenced by our recent announcement of positive data from Cohort 2 of our Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating a higher dose of LTI-03 (5 mg BID) in patients with IPF, in which high dose LTI-03 demonstrated dose dependent effects in five biomarkers,\" said Brian Windsor, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aileron. \"We were highly encouraged that the combined data set from Cohort 1 and 2 achieved statistical significance in four out of eight biomarkers evaluated in the trial, which along with promising safety and tolerability data, reinforce the potential of LTI-03 to improve lung function and reverse the course of the disease.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights and Recent Updates**\n\n_Corporate Updates_\n\n  * In October 2024, the Company announced entry into an exclusive option agreement with Advancium Health Network for the acquisition of ALRN-6924, a clinical-stage oncology agent developed by the Company prior to its 2023 merger with Lung Therapeutics, Inc., for retinoblastoma. Under the terms of the agreement, Aileron received a non-refundable fee from Advancium for the exclusive option to acquire ALRN-6924 and related assets. If Advancium exercises its option, Aileron will receive an exercise payment with potential for additional development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and sales royalties.\n\n\n\n_Pipeline_\n\n  * In November 2024, Aileron announced [positive topline data](https://investors.aileronrx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aileron-therapeutics-announces-positive-topline-data-cohort-2) from Cohort 2 of the Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of high dose LTI-03 (5 mg BID) and a set of exploratory biomarkers in patients diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In May, the Company reported positive biomarker data from Cohort 1 which evaluated low dose LTI-03 (2.5 mg BID).\n  * In August 2024, Brian Windsor, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aileron, presented an oral presentation at the 8th Annual IPF Summit, entitled, \"Biomarker Strategies in the Clinical Development of LTI-03 in IPF\".\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Cash Position:** Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, were $17.7 million, compared to $21.9 million as of June 30, 2024. The Company expects its existing cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to fund operations into June 2025.\n  * **Research and Development (\"R &D\") Expenses: **R&D expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $3.7 million, compared to less than $0.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase of $3.7 million was primarily a result of the clinical programs acquired as part of the Company's acquisition of Lung Therapeutics, Inc. in October 2023 (the \"Lung Acquisition\"). During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Aileron incurred expenses of $2.1 million on clinical trials, $1.0 million on manufacturing including $0.8 million write-offs due to the temporary delay of clinical development of LTI-01, and $0.1 million on regulatory and development consulting as well as $0.5 million on employee and related expenses associated with clinical programs acquired in the Lung Acquisition.\n  * **General and Administrative (\"G &A\")** **Expenses:** G&A expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $2.3 million, compared to $2.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase of $0.4 million was primarily due to increased employee and related expenses of $0.5 million as a result of increased headcount associated with the Lung Acquisition and severance expense recognized due to departure of former employees, and increased facilities and other expenses of $0.2 million, offset by decreased professional fees of $0.3 million as a result of less external consulting expenses during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n  * **Net Loss:** Net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $5.8 million, compared to $1.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The basic and diluted net loss per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $0.27 compared to $0.40 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**About Aileron Therapeutics**\n\nAileron Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company advancing a novel pipeline of first-in-class medicines to address significant unmet medical needs in orphan pulmonary and fibrosis indications.

(\"Aileron\") (NASDAQ: ALRN), a biopharmaceutical company advancing a novel pipeline of first-in-class medicines to address significant unmet medical needs in orphan pulmonary and fibrosis indications, today announced positive topline data from Cohort 2 of its Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of inhaled LTI-03 in patients diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). LTI-03 is a novel, Caveolin-1-related peptide that modulates both pro-fibrotic activity and sustain critical alveolar epithelial cells.\n\n[ ![Aileron logo \\(PRNewsfoto/AILERON THERAPEUTICS\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2451051/aileron_logo_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2451051/aileron_logo_Logo.html)\n\nFollowing inhaled administration of high dose LTI-03 (5 mg BID), a positive trend was observed in seven out of eight biomarkers, with evidence of reduced expression among profibrotic proteins produced by basal-like cells and fibroblasts that contribute to the progression of IPF, including data from four biomarkers that were statistically significant in the combined data set of Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, and data from five biomarkers that showed dose dependence relative to the data from those biomarkers in Cohort 1. Overall, the collective findings from this Phase 1b clinical trial provide the Company with strong confidence that LTI-03 has the potential to improve lung function and reverse the course of IPF.\n\n\"We are extremely pleased with the results achieved by high dose LTI-03, including measuring statistical significance in three biomarkers in Cohort 2, with the combined data sets showing even stronger results, with four statistically significant biomarkers,\" said Brian Windsor, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aileron. \"Additionally, we saw dose dependent effects in five biomarkers which provides evidence of active LTI-03 pharmacodynamics. We believe that this data, including the 5% decrease in surfactant protein D, a biomarker for epithelial cell health, at 14 days of treatment, reinforces LTI-03's potential for disease stabilization or even reversal. We look forward to evaluating LTI-03 in a Phase 2 study.\"\n\n\"I am delighted with the Cohort 2 data as it confirms previous results obtained with LTI-03 in cell experiments, animal studies and ex-vivo studies employing human IPF high precision cut lung slices. In these studies, the evaluated biomarkers were found to be downregulated by LTI-03. These observations have now been reproduced in IPF patients upon inhalative application of LTI-03 vs placebo,\" said Prof. Andreas Gunther, M.D., Head of the Center for Interstitial and Rare Lung Diseases of the Justus Liebig University in Giessen, Germany. \"Moreover, the profile of the statistically significant changes in the biomarkers in response to LTI-03 treatment also suggests that LTI-03 may not only act on fibroblasts, but also on epithelial cells, which would represent a novel therapeutic principle in the IPF treatment landscape. IPF is a devastating disease with worsening quality of life over time, and LTI-03 has the potential to meaningfully impact the current treatment paradigm. I look forward to further evaluating LTI-03´s potential in a Phase 2 study.\"\n\n**Summary of Cohort 2 Analysis**\n\nTwelve patients were enrolled in Cohort 2 of the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial, three in the placebo arm and nine in the active arm. Patients had a bronchoscopy at baseline, received a high dose of LTI-03 (5mg BID) twice a day for 14 days, followed by a bronchoscopy on day 14 and seven days of post-treatment follow-up. Cohort 2 findings include: \n\n  * Reduced expression of multiple profibrotic proteins active in both pathologic basal-like cells and fibroblasts, with four biomarkers (IL-11, CXCL7, TSLP and GAL-7) showing statistically significant decreases in the combined data set supporting the potential of LTI-03 to reduce fibrosis, inflammation and associated functional changes in the lung.\n  * Dose dependent trends were observed in five biomarkers, including COL1A1, CXCL7, TSLP, GAL-7, and Surfactant protein D (SPD) which provide evidence of active LTI-03 pharmacodynamics.\n  * SPD, an indicator of epithelial cell health that is significantly linked to decline in lung function, decreased by 5% in Cohort 2 at 14 days of treatment, while current standard of care for IPF reduced SPD by 4% at 12-weeks in precedent trials1, 2.\n  * LTI-03 did not induce inflammation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in either Cohort, measured by pAKT, a safety marker for inflammation in this trial.\n  * LTI-03 was generally well-tolerated, and there were no drug-related adverse events that resulted in a discontinuation of the trial.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nAileron will host a conference call on Wednesday, November 13th at 8:30 am ET to discuss the topline results from Cohort 2 of the Phase 1b clinical trial of LTI-03 in IPF. To access the call, please dial +1 646-876-9923 (domestic) or +44 330-088-5830 (international) and reference meeting ID: 951-8768-4226 when prompted by the operator. A live webcast of the event can be accessed at <https://investors.aileronrx.com/events-presentations/investor-events>. A replay of the webcast will be available following the completion of the event.\n\n**About the Phase 1b Clinical Trial of LTI-03**\n\nThe Phase 1b clinical trial of LTI-03 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-center, dose escalation study in patients recently diagnosed with IPF that have not received prior treatment with anti-fibrotic agents for at least two months ([NCT05954988](https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05954988)). Eligible patients are randomly assigned (3:1) to receive one of two doses of LTI-03 or placebo. The primary objective of the study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of LTI-03 in patients with IPF after treatment for 14 consecutive days, with multiple biomarker concentration as exploratory endpoints.\n\n**About IPF**\n\nIPF is a chronic lung disease characterized by progressive tissue scarring that prevents proper lung function. It is a progressive, fatal, age-associated lung disease affecting approximately 100,000 people in the United States3. IPF typically presents in adults 65 or older and is usually fatal within two to five years after diagnosis4.\n\n**About LTI-03 and Caveolin-1 (Cav1)**\n\nLTI-03 is a seven amino acid peptide, the sequence of which is derived from the caveolin scaffolding domain (CSD), an important binding region of the Cav1 protein. Cav1 normally serves a critical function in the prevention of fibrosis by maintaining a balance between pathways that both initiate and arrest lung repair and cell movement. Through the CSD, caveolin interacts with a large number of signaling molecules, all of which possess a caveolin binding domain region. Cav1 expression is decreased in IPF lung tissues and has been demonstrated to decrease during the fibrotic phase of bleomycin, or BLM, lung injury in mice. Restoring the balance of important biological signals in the lung may not only slow lung function decline but could also restore healthy lung function through the protection of healthy epithelial cells.\n\n**About Aileron Therapeutics**\n\nAileron Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company advancing a novel pipeline of first-in-class medicines to address significant unmet medical needs in orphan pulmonary and fibrosis indications. Aileron's lead product candidate, LTI-03, is a novel, synthetic peptide with a dual mechanism targeting alveolar epithelial cell survival as well as inhibition of profibrotic signaling. LTI-03 completed a Phase 1b clinical trial for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

(\"Aileron\") (NASDAQ: ALRN), a biopharmaceutical company advancing a novel pipeline of first-in-class medicines to address significant unmet medical needs in orphan pulmonary and fibrosis indications, and Advancium Health Network (\"Advancium\"), a public charity founded by Deerfield Management and the Deerfield Foundation to meet the needs of underserved patient populations, today announced entry into an exclusive option agreement for the acquisition of ALRN-6924, a clinical-stage oncology agent developed by Aileron prior to its 2023 [merger ](https://investors.aileronrx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aileron-therapeutics-announces-acquisition-lung-therapeutics)with Lung Therapeutics, Inc.\n\n[ ![Aileron logo \\(PRNewsfoto/AILERON THERAPEUTICS\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2451051/aileron_logo_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2451051/aileron_logo_Logo.html)\n\nDuring the option period, Advancium intends to evaluate ALRN-6924 as a potential therapy for retinoblastoma (RB), a rare but devastating cancer of the eye, with around 300 cases diagnosed in the United States and 9,000 cases worldwide each year, nearly all in children [1]. With early intervention the disease is rarely fatal; however, non-selective chemotherapy with its attendant side effects remains the usual treatment strategy, and removal of the affected eye(s) is a frequent outcome. In contrast to chemotherapy, ALRN-6924 selectively targets MDM2 and MDMX, the endogenous inhibitors of the regulatory protein p53, to activate p53-mediated tumor suppression in cancer cells [2]. Previous studies have implicated the MDMX protein as a key driver of RB tumorigenesis [3], and ALRN-6924 is the first and only clinical-stage drug that acts on MDMX. ALRN-6924 has previously been studied in preclinical models of RB, where it showed potent, on-mechanism anti-proliferative activity in RB cell lines and was found to be highly soluble and compatible with intraocular injection [4].\n\nUnder the terms of the option agreement, Advancium paid Aileron a non-refundable fee for the exclusive option to acquire ALRN-6924 and related assets. If Advancium exercises its option, Aileron will receive an exercise payment with potential for additional development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and sales royalties.\n\n\"This agreement is a significant landmark for our work at Advancium, as it is the first drug opportunity we are pursuing in our mission as a public charity to develop much-needed therapies for children with cancer,\" said Mark Veich, Chief Executive Officer of Advancium and Vice President of Philanthropy and Executive Director of the Deerfield Foundation. \"We look forward to evaluating ALRN-6924 as a potential treatment for children with retinoblastoma who currently have limited care options.\"\n\n\"Aileron is a strong supporter of Advancium's cause,\" said Brian Windsor, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aileron. \"Although we remain focused on developing novel therapies for the treatment of orphan pulmonary and fibrosis indications, we are honored that they have chosen to partner with us in this important step towards their goal of delivering therapies to pediatric patients with high unmet need.\"\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Cobrinik, D. \"Retinoblastoma Origins and Destinations\" N Engl J Med. 2024 Apr 18;390(15):1408-1419\n\n[2] Guerlavais, V. et al, \"Discovery of Sulanemadlin (ALRN-6924), the First Cell-Permeating, Stabilized α-Helical Peptide in Clinical Development\" J Med Chem, 2023; 66:9401–9417\n\n[3] Laurie, N.
