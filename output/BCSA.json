While fraud is not unique to any industry—think Enron or Long-Term Capital Management—the blockchain sector faced an unprecedented backlash. The collapse was a lightning rod for criticism, and the ensuing crackdown was swift and severe.\n\nDespite the fact that many of us in the industry avoided exposure to FTX (none of our 40+ venture fund investments had direct equity ties to our knowledge), the entire sector bore the brunt of a regulatory assault. The Biden administration targeted dozens of companies, often without issuing clear guidance on compliance. It even went so far as to limit blockchain firms’ access to the banking system, raising serious concerns about overreach.\n\nYet, for those of you who were reading the _Letter from London_ or engaging with our team, one thing remained clear: while politics (over)reacted, innovation kept charging forward. Founders didn’t wait for a kinder regulatory environment—they kept building. And the results have been extraordinary, with advances in blockchain technology exceeding expectations.\n\nBetting against technological progress has always been a losing game.\n\nFast forward to now, November 2024, and we are witnessing a seismic shift. The U.S. now boasts its most pro-crypto Congress and President in history, with expectations high for legislation on stablecoins, market structure reform, and an end to frivolous lawsuits.\n\nBut make no mistake—this political about-face isn’t driving the innovation; it’s merely catching up to the reality of a digital revolution that was always inevitable.\n\nYou cannot un-invent Bitcoin. You cannot stop the open-source ethos driving blockchain development. And you certainly cannot hold back the tide of digital transformation that is already reshaping finance. Just as communication and content went digital in the 1990s, financial systems are now being rebuilt on digital rails. Blockchains are critical to this transition.\n\nWhile headlines today buzz with Bitcoin's surging price and a renewed optimism for blockchain, we’re not surprised. This shift was always coming. The US political apparatus is finally waking up to what we’ve known all along: innovation doesn’t wait for permission.\n\nFor those who’ve been on the sidelines, now is the time to take a closer look. As early believers and investors, we’ve doubled down during the downturn—and we’re not stopping.\n\n### Blockchain Infrastructure Is Rapidly Advancing—and It’s Transformational\n\n\"Blockchains are slow, costly, and difficult to use.\" Sound familiar? It’s what skeptics used to say about the internet—or even personal computers. History has shown that technological progress moves at staggering speeds, and blockchain is proving no different.\n\nOver the past few years, infrastructure improvements have supercharged blockchain networks, massively increasing capacity and slashing costs. Consider this: blockchains are now processing **50 times as many transactions per second** compared to just four years ago. This rapid scaling continues to accelerate.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/59710b69-84e7-408b-9307-92ad4013490e/Blockchains+now+process+50x+as+many+transactions+per+second+as+they+did+just+four+years+ago.jpg)\n\n_Source: a16z 2024 State of Crypto Report_\n\n### Scaling Breakthroughs: Ethereum’s “Dencun” Upgrade\n\nEthereum’s landmark upgrade in 2024, known as \"Dencun\" (or EIP-4844, protodanksharding), marked a another turning point for blockchain scalability. This upgrade slashed fees for Layer 2 (L2) networks—blockchains built atop Ethereum that optimize for speed and cost efficiency. Since its implementation, fees on L2 networks have dropped dramatically, even as the Ethereum-denominated value they process has soared. Put simply, blockchain networks are becoming more popular and efficient at the same time.\n\n### Sending Money: Better, Faster, Cheaper\n\nThe most remarkable transformation? Transaction costs. Blockchains are rapidly becoming the most cost-effective way to send money globally. Thanks to scaling advancements, transaction costs have plummeted. For example:\n\n  * Transactions involving USDC, a widely used U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, now average $1 on Ethereum—down from $12 in 2021.\n\n  * On Base, Coinbase's popular L2 network, sending USDC costs less than a cent on average.\n\n\n\n\nCompare this to traditional systems: the average international wire transfer costs $44. With blockchain technology, sending money globally is not only faster but dramatically more affordable.\n\nIn short, Blockchains are **_already_** the best way to send money around the world.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/53098a13-9473-4f4f-8868-00622148c3e8/Ethereum+Scaling+Efforts+have+Slashed+Onchain+Transaction+costs+by+Over+99%25.jpg)\n\n_Source: a16z 2024 State of Crypto Report_\n\n### Activity and Usage Have Grown Remarkably\n\nWhat about the users? What about the use cases? Blockchain technology’s evolution hasn’t happened in isolation—it’s been matched by a surge in usage and adoption. Today, blockchains are no longer niche innovations; they are networks processing trillions of dollars in value. And we’re just getting started.\n\nThe growth in active blockchain users mirrors the early days of the internet—both following strikingly similar adoption curves. Take a look at this comparison:\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/77892761-8eaf-4c06-8278-09b9adc82f52/Monthly+Active+Addresses+hit+an+All-Time+High+of+220+Million+with+Growth+Reminiscent+of+Early+Internet+Adoption.jpg)\n\n_Source: a16z 2024 State of Crypto Report_\n\n### Stablecoins: The Irresistible Utility\n\nA key driver of blockchain adoption is the rise of stablecoins, which are proving to be far more than just a trend. Unlike spot crypto trading volumes that ebb and flow with market cycles, stablecoin usage has shown remarkable resilience. The number of addresses sending stablecoins has continued to climb—even during downturns in the broader crypto market. Why? Because stablecoins offer unparalleled ease of transferring value.\n\nIn Q2 2024 alone, stablecoins facilitated $8.5 trillion in transaction volume across 1.1 billion transactions. To put this in perspective, that’s more than double Visa’s $3.9 trillion in transactions during the same period. Stablecoins are now on par with entrenched payment systems like Visa, PayPal, ACH, and Fedwire—a testament to their growing utility and adoption.\n\nWhether for remittances, business transactions, or seamless value transfer, stablecoins are rapidly becoming the backbone of digital money.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/17c87238-3ee3-4c31-84f5-536d19486f5c/Stablecoins+have+Found+Product+Market+Fit.jpg)\n\n### The View from London: Politics Catches Up to Innovation\n\nIf you’re reengaging with the blockchain space, one thing should be clear: blockchains are now faster, cheaper, and more efficient than ever before. Usage is at all-time highs, and durable use cases—like stablecoins—are proving their staying power.\n\nSo, what does this all mean?\n\nIt means this was always going to happen. The inevitability of digital finance is an unstoppable force—one that no regulatory missteps or market downturns can derail. Over time, nearly every aspect of the economy will undergo digital transformation, and finance is no exception. Suggesting that regulatory challenges could halt this shift is akin to believing that the U.S. Department of Justice’s lawsuit against Microsoft in the 1990s would have stopped the rise of software in business processes. History has shown how profoundly mistaken that notion would be.\n\nDespite the regulatory challenges of the past two years, innovation didn’t pause—not in the U.S., and certainly not globally. Blockchain technology continued its relentless march forward, and adoption followed, climbing steadily up and to the right.\n\nAt Blockchain Coinvestors, we’ve been investing through the downturn because we’ve always seen the writing on the wall. The digital transformation of finance is inevitable, and we remain committed to this sector.\n\nWe hope you’ll lean in with us as we continue to invest in the future.\n\nThank you for reading,\n\nMitch Mechigian\n\nPartner, London\n\n**About Blockchain Coinvestors**\n\nBlockchain Coinvestors invests in blockchain businesses.

The world's most important innovation economy went to the ballot box last week and voted on a new future which will include leadership in the global race for digital monies, commodities and assets.\n\nWe could not be happier. Our investment thesis just received the most powerful accelerator we could have hoped for.\n\nIn today's newsletter we outline the details and make some initial predictions on what the new US plan for our industry may include. However, we will return with our 2025 Blockchain Predictions later this month, so stay tuned.\n\n### Investment Thesis\n\nWe want to start by reminding you of the investment thesis we wrote down a decade or so ago. It is unchanged, and more inevitable than ever. It is quite straightforward as described in the following exhibit.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/ea3d3669-347d-44e9-ae54-7ba99c3c6eee/Blockchain+Coinvestors+Investment+Thesis.png)\n\nEvery bullet point is still as true today, or truer, than when we wrote it down back in the far away early teens of this century.\n\n### US Has Been The Global Laggard\n\nHowever, progress towards our vision of a world of digital monies, commodities and assets has been suffering from the reality that for four years, and for some unclear reasons, the leadership of the world's largest economy has been trying to slow it all down.\n\nEvery other leading financial center has been moving quickly to prepare for the future, and the global race to be a digital asset hub is well articulated in our bi-annual [DIGITAL ASSET REGULATION REPORT - YEAR-END 2024](https://www.blockchaincoinvestors.com/regulation) which was published last week.\n\nThe headlines on the following exhibit make a powerful case for how the majority of the world's governments are working hard to be pro innovation and pro digital finance.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/722b0bcb-4fbc-4fb8-a09b-2bdc09d5b263/Global+Race+to+be+a+Digital+Asset+Hub.png)\n\nOur report includes the details of where each of the top 25 global financial centers stands, and the map of their status highlights the US as the world's leading laggard.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/8c2fc212-c7b4-4317-800d-5e42463458cd/Financial+Centers+-+Blockchain+Regulatory+Readiness.png)\n\nIn practical terms this really matters. US based blockchain innovators have spent far too much time living with, and reacting to, US regulatory uncertainty and the leading US blockchain unicorns have had to spend more than $400 million battling the SEC's Gary Gensler-inspired war of 'regulation through enforcement' which applies legislation that in some cases was created a hundred years ago and is clearly unfit for purpose in a digital age.\n\nDespite the hostile four years of the outgoing Biden administration, all of the fundamentals which we track to measure progress of the global adoption of blockchain are moving along exceptionally well. However, we expect they will be turbocharged by a positive, pro innovation US mindset.\n\n### 2024 Election Results - A Clean Sweep\n\nGiven this context, we were watching the 2024 US Presidential Election very closely, and you can watch our earlier podcast with [Blockchain Association President, Kristin Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcrqDDOyx2A), to see where we were two weeks before the election.\n\nThe results are in, and the citizens of the US threw out the leadership of the last four years in no uncertain terms. It was a clean sweep at each of the Presidential, Senate, and Governor levels of US government. As of the date of publication, the House count is not yet finalized but the Republicans are currently in the majority.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/487a9713-09b2-4f53-9570-dc00da1dd7b7/270+Electoral+Votes+to+Win+US+2024+Election.png)\n\nWhile we don't want to suggest for a moment that blockchain was a defining issue of the election, it was a part, and the incoming US leadership had firmly stapled a pro blockchain narrative to their manifesto. From President elect Donald Trump, to the majority of Senate and House candidates, a pro crypto stance was evident, and the voters, including the 50% of Americans who are digital natives, were taking note.\n\n### Pro-Crypto Candidates In Significant Majority\n\nWe were early supporters of [Stand with Crypto](https://www.standwithcrypto.org/) which is an organization focused on helping voters learn about the stance of their elected and prospective government leaders with regard to our industry.\n\nStand with Crypto tracks the specifics of every government official's stance, and the results are dramatic. Roughly two thirds of House and Senate winners began the race as pro-crypto. Conversely, a good number of candidates hostile to the industry lost their races.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/a8a09b55-4387-4204-929b-bcf90539a8c0/Pro-Blockchain+Candidates+vs+Anti-Crypto+Candidates+US+Election.png)\n\nThere were a number of particularly important races in this election, which the industry really wanted to see won by the pro blockchain candidates. This is where the industry PACs focused their support, and the results are exceptionally powerful. As Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, puts it, _\"Crypto won 48 out of 48 races - not bad\"_\n\nTo name but one, Bernie Moreno won Ohio from Sherrod Brown, the former Chair of the Senate Committee on Banking, and one of the most hostile to crypto Biden administration members.\n\nOnce the dust settles, every US prospective government candidate will realize the obvious 'so whats' of this. \n\n  * **They gain NOTHING by being anti innovation and anti blockchain;**\n\n  * **Conversely, they receive the support of the digital natives, pro crypto voters and the industry if they get on board.**\n\n\n\n\nBy the 2026 mid-terms we expect that almost 100% of candidates will be pro blockchain, and Coinbase and A16Z just announced that they have already funded the leading industry PAC to the tune of $50m to get the mid-term campaign started.\n\n### Initial Thoughts on the US's 2025 Pro Blockchain Plan\n\nWhat are the implications of having so many members of the government at all levels arrive in January with an intent to accelerate our industry and the US' leadership of it?\n\nOur initial thoughts follow, and we must begin with President elect Donald Trump's recent words, _“I'm laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower of the world”._\n\nOur top six thoughts follow:\n\n**1. Abort Gensler ‘Regulation by Enforcement’ Cases**\n\nCentral to the challenges of the last four years has been the SEC Chairman of whom Vice President elect JD Vance says _\"If there's a candidate for the worst person in the Biden [admin]...[it's] Gary Gensler\"_. Gensler has led a war of regulation by enforcement including cases against industry leaders, and Blockchain Coinvestors' portfolio companies, including Coinbase, Kraken, Ripple and Uniswap.\n\nWe expect that Gensler will be fired before year end, and the legal cases he has wasted tens of millions of taxpayer money pursuing, and which the industry has spent more than $400m defending, will be aborted.\n\n**2. Bank custody approval (Repeal SAB 121)**\n\nSecond, we expect that US banks will get what they want now, which is permission to custody digital assets beginning with Bitcoin. This issue was essentially approved by both the Senate and House but was vetoed by Biden and Gensler in the most undemocratic of ways earlier this year.\n\nWe expect SAB 121, the SEC action that blocks the banks from participating in the future, to be overturned quickly now. Having banks act as custodians for digital assets, among others, will clearly improve the protections for US investors, which is one of the most important priorities for the SEC, although the SEC does not provide oversight for banks.\n\n**3. US Stablecoin regulation**\n\nThirdly, the US must have a view on stablecoins which are one of the fastest growing use cases for blockchain, and which are very supportive of the position of the US dollar as a global reserve currency, since almost all the stablecoin volume is in those backed by dollars.\n\nWe expect that the US will catch up with most of the rest of the world by passing stablecoin regulation.\n\n**4. Market structure bill (e.g. FIT 21)**\n\nNext, the election should break the log jam on market structure bills which are central to the development of legislation for the industry. Unlike in many countries around the world, the US fragments financial services oversight among many regulators including CFTC, SEC, Bank regulators and so on, at both Federal and sometimes State levels. The Biden administration had famously refused to clarify who should be on point for what, with Gensler sticking to his obviously flawed position that _'They are all Securities'_.\n\nWe expect a bill such as the bipartisan, already drafted FIT 21 will now pass quickly and certainly before the end of 2025. This will help enormously. Linked to this, we also expect pro blockchain appointments to Chairs of the CFTC and SEC, with a possible interim appointment of a very pro blockchain leader to a temporary US Committee on Digital Assets.\n\n**5. US Bitcoin mining plans & strategic reserve**\n\nIn the run up to the election, Trump had talked about making sure the US was the global leader in Bitcoin, and others in his inner circle had begun to talk about a US strategic Bitcoin reserve. Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, suggesting the latter should be a minimum of 1 million of the 21 million Bitcoin which at today's prices would cost about $79 billion (at the time of writing when Bitcoin is at an all time high of $79,000).\n\nWe expect the passing of laws that will make it easy for Bitcoin mining companies to operate in energy abundant states like Texas, and we expect the US government to hold onto its Bitcoin, and perhaps start buying more at a rapid rate.\n\n**6. Rapid Tradfi digitalization (e.g. BlackRock BUIDL)**\n\nOur [bi-annual report on Institutional Adoption](https://www.blockchaincoinvestors.com/adoption) has demonstrated the rapid deployment of blockchain among the world's leading asset managers. This progress has occurred in the face of fierce opposition from the US government over the last four years. Now that will change quickly.\n\nWe expect a rapid acceleration of institutional adoption of blockchain in the US. This will come in many flavors. As examples:\n\n  * We expect most pension funds, retirement systems, wealth advisors, and family offices in America to now seek out exposure;\n\n  * We expect most asset managers will move quickly to have products to offer them;\n\n  * And we expect most digital platforms to begin to offer the digitized versions of TradFi products such as BlackRock's digitized money market fund, BUIDL.\n\n\n\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/bb06424f-af0b-4d77-aab8-707a4c4c7707/Institutional+Adoption+Tracker+Mid+Year+2024.png)\n\nThese are our top six ideas in the week following the election. Later this month we will publish our 2025 Blockchain Predictions, so expect more shortly.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nOur conclusions are simple:\n\n  * US blockchain adoption will now ramp up fast.\n\n  * There is no looking back.\n\n  * **Digital monies, commodities and assets are inevitable, and all of the world's financial infrastructure will need to be upgraded.**\n\n\n\n\nSo a very important week, and a very bright future.\n\nThank you for reading\n\nThe Blockchain Coinvestors Partners\n\n**About Blockchain Coinvestors**\n\nBlockchain Coinvestors is the best way to invest in blockchain businesses.

In our previous communications, we emphasized the rapid advancement of blockchain technology, which has not only kept pace with the early development of the internet but has also achieved significant commercialization in a remarkably short period.\n\nJust over 15 years since the publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper, blockchain now underpins trillions of dollars in value, supported by a flourishing ecosystem of products that are gaining widespread market acceptance around the world.\n\nFintech Week Hong Kong, Asia's premier financial technology conference uniting FinTech founders, banking executives, VCs, regulators, and industry professionals, took place in Hong Kong from October 28 to November 1. The conference highlighted a notable shift as traditional finance investors increasingly focus on blockchain applications that address real-world challenges. Stablecoins exemplify this trend, emerging as a focal point of discussions due to their growing role in digital payments and cross-border transactions. Hong Kong's regulatory authorities announced more flexible stablecoin frameworks, including reduced capital requirements and streamlined licensing processes. The city also launched limited trials with three major industry players to test stablecoin implementations in controlled environments. Sitting in Hong Kong, the bridge between East and West while balancing regulatory oversight with technological advancement, our Head of Asia, Joy Cai, is available to share insights and provide regular updates on blockchain and crypto developments in the region.\n\n### The Macro Landscape of Crypto Adoption in 2024\n\nAs we enter 2024, the crypto landscape has reached new heights, with crypto activity and usage hitting all-time highs. According to a16z’s _State of Crypto Report 2024_ , the number of monthly active crypto addresses has surged to 220 million, more than tripling since the end of 2023.\n\n_Exhibit 1: Monthly active addresses reached a record high of 220 million, showing growth similar to the early days of internet adoption._\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/67201088-2ef6-46fc-b258-52a1629c5165/Internet+Users+vs+Monthly+Active+Crypto+Addresses.png)\n\n_Source: state of crypto report 2024 by A16Z_\n\nThis remarkable growth reflects the increasing global adoption of blockchain technology, driven by improvements in infrastructure, such as Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions and the rise of high-throughput blockchains like Solana and Base. Transaction costs drastically reduced due to these scalable solutions. For example, on Ethereum, sending USDC, a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, now costs $1 in gas fees on average, down from $12 in 2021. On Base, Coinbase’s Layer 2 network, it costs less than a cent. By comparison, an international wire transfer averages around $44.\n\n_Exhibit 2: Blockchain processes 50x as many transactions per second as they did four years ago._\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/9e0f536b-cb96-498c-a392-639dffa6f5a9/Number+of+Blockchain+Transactions+Processed+per+Second.png)\n\n_Source: state of crypto report 2024 by A16Z_\n\n### Future Digital Money Landscape in the Tokenisation Era\n\nCrypto is no longer just a speculative asset class — it’s becoming a core component of the global digital economy. At the same time, several products in blockchain have carved out clear product-market fit, especially those enabling fast, low-cost global payments, have emerged as crypto’s most successful applications to date.\n\n_Growing Role of Stablecoins: Key Pillar for Global Payments_\n\nStablecoins, particularly those pegged to the U.S. dollar, now account for a substantial portion of daily crypto usage, rivaling traditional payment networks like Visa. Their utility in fast, low-cost transactions has made them indispensable, especially in regions where local currencies are unstable, such as Nigeria, Argentina, or Turkey. In Turkey, for instance, chronic inflation and instability have pushed retail users toward stablecoins as a safeguard against volatility and a reliable store of value.\n\nOn the other hand, in the UAE, where the Emirati dirham is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the rise in stablecoin adoption likely reflects their role as a seamless entry point into the broader crypto ecosystem, facilitating access to various services and trading opportunities.\n\nHong Kong is positioning itself to play a greater role in the advancement of stablecoins and digital currencies. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is set to introduce new regulations for stablecoins by the end of 2024, indicating the government's intent to provide a supportive regulatory framework for these emerging digital assets.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/17c60520-b8db-4d49-a35a-bf5415f10d19/Innovation+to+Solve+Real-World+Problems+Enhancing+Cross-Border+Payments.jpg)\n\nAmid this policy development, Circle, the issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin, is eyeing expansion in Hong Kong. During a speech during Hong Kong Fintech Week, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire sees Hong Kong as an increasingly important market for trade settlements, as stablecoins can provide \"better, faster, cheaper\" transactions for importers and exporters in emerging and developing markets trading through the city. To capitalize on this trend, Circle has announced two new partnerships in Hong Kong: a memorandum of understanding with Hong Kong Telecom to explore blockchain-based loyalty solutions; and a collaboration with Thunes to help settle cross-border transactions in USDC.\n\n_The Rise of Crypto Credit Cards: A Game-Changer in the Financial Landscape_\n\nThe emergence of crypto credit cards has profoundly reshaped the financial landscape, redefining the user experience and streamlining cryptocurrency usage in real-world scenarios. By enabling users to spend their digital holdings at any location accepting traditional credit cards, crypto credit cards have addressed the limited usability of cryptocurrencies for day-to-day transactions, driving mainstream adoption and expanding the utility of digital assets. As crypto credit card adoption grows, providers must uphold regulatory compliance to establish trust and solidify the legitimacy of this transformative financial innovation.\n\nAt Fintech Week Hong Kong, I engaged with two standout companies: RedotPay and Reap, both specializing in crypto payment solutions.\n\nRedotPay is focused on making cryptocurrencies accessible for everyday transactions and has swiftly partnered with Visa to issue globally accepted crypto-enabled debit cards. These physical cards uniquely allow users to withdraw fiat currency from ATMs, bridging the gap between digital and traditional finance. RedotPay initially launched a virtual card and mobile app, integrating with popular payment platforms. This enables users to spend cryptocurrency directly without pre-funding in fiat. The company operates within Hong Kong's regulatory framework and collaborates with KYC/AML providers to ensure security and compliance.\n\nDespite being a newer entrant compared to industry leaders like Crypto.com, RedotPay has gained 300,000 users by prioritizing a simple, user-centric crypto payment experience with global reach. This positions RedotPay as a key driver in the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency in financial services.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/0d43ca06-2387-48dc-8be3-7734d7103983/Redot+Pay.png)\n\nOn the other hand, Reap offers a crypto corporate card solution that allows businesses to easily create and manage their own credit card programs. It’s designed to give companies a seamless, secure way to handle their financial operations. Paired with their expense management software, which integrates global payouts and the Reap Visa Corporate Credit Card, Reap empowers businesses to take full control of their finances—all while making things simpler and more efficient for their teams.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/78f2449f-7f8f-4535-b159-e81a3047a6a8/REAP+crypto+corporate+card+solution.jpg)\n\nMass adoption of Blockchain in Asia is also reflected by leading position in Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) initiatives in multiple countries such as Japan, China, and South Korea. For example in China, despite the strict crackdown on privately developed cryptocurrency, blockchain technology (or distributed ledger technology) is gaining rapid acceptance and adoption by the government, featured by China's digital yuan, or e-CNY. e-CNY has now processed transactions worth more than 1.8 trillion yuan, which puts China ahead in the global CBDC race.\n\nThe digital yuan is China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC), where the central bank directly issues accounts to individuals. As a retail CBDC, it is designed for public use, unlike wholesale CBDCs that interact with banks or other central institutions. It aims to replace cash, bears no interest, and is pegged 1:1 with the yuan.\n\nIn May this year, The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has expanded its involvement in the pilot for China's CBDC, the e-CNY. Hong Kong residents can now top up their e-CNY wallets via the Faster Payment System (FPS), with support from 17 local banks. This makes Hong Kong the first place outside mainland China where residents can set up e-CNY wallets locally. The HKMA plans to work with the People's Bank of China (PBoC) to further expand e-CNY's applications and promote its use among retailers. However, restrictions are in place to limit wallet balances and transactions, likely to prevent the widespread use of e-CNY for local payments, which could lead to concerns about RMB dollarization in Hong Kong. The HKMA is also involved in other digital currency initiatives, including its retail eHKD trials and a wholesale CBDC pilot, along with a stablecoin sandbox.\n\n_Exhibit 3: Staff members of Bank of Communications involved in the cross-boundary e-CNY pilot program display the e-CNY wallets in Hong Kong._\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/76ecd582-833f-47ef-8a59-738aa2ba341a/Hong+Kong+e-CNY+wallets+on+display.jpg)\n\n### The Duality of China’s Blockchain Strategy: Control, Innovation, and Global Influence\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/01789574-a221-4872-bec4-e931dd0c4b81/Mainland+China+Blockchain%2C+not+Crypto.jpg)\n\n_Mainland China: Blockchain, not Crypto_\n\nChina’s approach to blockchain technology and cryptocurrency presents a compelling blend of innovation and control. While the government has banned most cryptocurrencies on the mainland, citing concerns over financial stability and capital outflow, it has simultaneously embraced blockchain technology in its policies. In March 2021, the Chinese government officially integrated blockchain development into its national agenda with the approval of the \"14th Five-Year Plan\" (2021-2025). This plan outlines blockchain development initiatives across 29 provinces and cities, aiming to bolster China's global competitiveness in key economic sectors.\n\nNotably, this effort focuses on what officials describe as a \"Chinese-style blockchain\"—blockchain technology without the inclusion of cryptocurrencies, as highlighted in a research article published in the Big Data & Society journal. Through initiatives like the Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN) and the Digital Yuan (e-CNY), China is positioned as a global leader in blockchain innovation, but with a distinctly centralized twist.\n\nA prime example is the Digital Yuan, designed to replace physical cash and managed directly by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC). Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, which operate on public, open-source blockchains, the Digital Yuan runs on a centralized ledger. This gives the government full oversight and control, ensuring strict regulation of the currency’s use.\n\nThe Digital Yuan was rolled out to prevent monetary substitution from Libra and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The other key objectives behind the e-CNY is to provide a state-backed alternative to private payment platforms like Alipay and WeChat Pay. China has long been a global pioneer in digital payment solutions, especially with the rise of superapps like WeChat and Alipay, which have revolutionized the country’s financial ecosystem. These platforms have become indispensable for daily transactions, from peer-to-peer payments to utility bills and online shopping.\n\nHowever, the dominance of these private platforms has raised regulatory concerns, particularly around data control and financial transparency. The introduction of the Digital Yuan allows the government to regain control over the financial system, offering a secure, state-backed digital currency that integrates seamlessly with China’s existing payment infrastructure. In doing so, the e-CNY not only reinforces China’s leadership in payment innovation but also ensures that the government maintains oversight of the country’s financial landscape.\n\nWhile crypto frustrates key policy aims, blockchain and digital ledgers help regulators. Overall, China has said no to crypto but yes to blockchain.\n\n_Hong Kong: China’s Gateway to Global Crypto Markets_\n\nWhile the mainland enforces strict control over cryptocurrencies, Hong Kong plays a crucial role in China’s engagement with global crypto markets. As highlighted by South China Morning Post (SCMP), Hong Kong has seen a significant increase in cryptocurrency activity, rising to 30th place in the Global Cryptocurrency Adoption Index rankings in 2024 , with an 85.6% year-over-year increase. This surge is largely due to the city’s strategic push to become a hub for virtual assets, supported by a regulatory framework that encourages institutional participation.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/121080bc-83d0-4ae8-a6c3-409a28e67ca2/Highest+Growing+Countries+in+Eastern+Asia.png)\n\nBy May 31, 2024, Hong Kong’s transitional period for its new regulatory regime for virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs) ended. From this date, exchanges could only operate if they were licensed or deemed licensed. Several prominent exchanges, whose local affiliates withdrew their license applications before the deadline, had to stop serving Hong Kong residents. This shift could lead to a move towards licensed platforms or a decline in trading activity. The share of value received by these exchanges has already dropped, with recent activity stabilizing at around 10-15%.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/b87ad6bb-21a3-46d0-b443-0322a91be036/Share+of+Total+Value+Received+by+Exchanges+in+Hong+Kong+that+Withdrew+License+Applications.png)\n\nStablecoins made up over 40% of the total value received in Hong Kong each quarter, and this figure is expected to rise as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) regulatory framework allows stablecoins to be offered to retail investors.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/976553a6-2148-49c6-a928-bdd40f1b1b9c/Share+of+Asset+Types+of+Total+Value+Received+by+Hong+Kong.png)\n\nOn April 30, 2024, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) approved spot Bitcoin ETFs and Ether-based ETFs, signaling growing institutional interest. This approval was followed by a significant increase in institutional Bitcoin transfers, particularly on exchanges catering to institutional clients.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/b7c561ad-b5f4-400f-9ebb-05f92ca421ad/Bitcoin+Total+Value+Received+in+Hong+Kong+by+Size+of+Transfers.png)\n\nHong Kong’s role as a financial gateway allows China to maintain a presence in the global crypto ecosystem without compromising the CCP’s control over the mainland’s financial systems. Hong Kong’s regulatory clarity and proactive stance on fintech have made it an attractive destination for blockchain innovation. The city’s ability to act as a sandbox for financial experimentation, combined with its openness to global capital, allows it to serve as a testing ground for blockchain applications that may later be adopted more widely across China. This duality reflects China’s broader strategy of leveraging blockchain technology to benefit from global financial innovation while keeping its domestic economy tightly regulated. However, Hong Kong's regulatory flexibility and crypto-friendly stance may influence mainland China to reconsider its crypto policies.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nJoy Cai\n\nHong Kong\n\n**About Blockchain Coinvestors**\n\nBlockchain Coinvestors is the best way to invest in blockchain businesses.

We invite accredited investors to reach out to ir@blockchaincoinvestors.com for more information on how a single investment accesses global, diversified exposure to leading early stage blockchain venture investments. \n\nAmidst the daily grind and constant media storm, it’s easy to lose sight of the big picture. At Blockchain Coinvestors, as early-stage investors, we constantly remind ourselves to stay focused on the long term and anticipate where the next opportunity lies.\n\nWith this perspective, we encourage you to take a step back and consider the broader trends shaping the future. When we look at the landscape objectively, the accumulating evidence points toward one conclusion: now is the time to invest in the wave of blockchain innovation.\n\n****\n\nBack in the early 1990s, the internet faced a wave of skepticism and even ridicule. The idea that every business, even non-tech ones, would one day need a website seemed absurd. Dismissed by many as a fleeting trend, the internet was seen as a playground for scams, shady deals, and the tech-obsessed.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/5d75d86c-4ead-491a-ace3-d0119c222370/Internet+may+just+be+a+passing+fad+article.jpg)\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/ecec0170-bcd2-4f4f-a6cf-2595c229c176/List+of+Websites+founded+before+1995.png)\n\nYet fast forward to today, and the internet has transformed from a quirky experiment to an essential infrastructure for every business. With over a trillion active websites, it’s hard to imagine a company without one. This hindsight now feels obvious, but it highlights how innovations initially underestimated can become indispensable.\n\nThis brings us to a fascinating development that caught our attention this past quarter:\n\nSony, a $100 billion technology company behind PlayStation, has announced plans to launch its own blockchain, called _Soneium_.\n\nWhy would a company like Sony, with no immediate ties to cryptocurrency, venture into blockchain? Isn’t blockchain just for crypto companies?\n\nWe believe this move provides important clues to an ongoing technological transformation. While blockchain is still in its early stages, developments like Sony’s resonate with the early rise of websites in the 90s. Just as businesses once underestimated the need for an online presence, many now overlook the potential of blockchain infrastructure to reshape operations, generate revenue, and enhance customer experience.\n\nWhile not every company will build its own blockchain, Sony’s venture suggests the possibilities are vast. In this month’s _Letter from London_ , we explore how blockchain is not just a buzzword; it’s becoming a powerful tool with real utility across industries. And as more companies discover its benefits, we expect blockchain’s growth trajectory to follow the path of the internet revolution.\n\n### 'Base' Demonstrates Compelling Business Case\n\nFor those who haven’t been following closely, Coinbase—the $50 billion blockchain giant—has recently launched its own blockchain, Base, a Layer 2 solution built on Ethereum. Coinbase, a publicly traded U.S. company, has grown substantially as a platform for buying, selling, holding, and trading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), generating over $3 billion in revenue in 2023.\n\nWhen Coinbase announced Base, its new Layer 2 blockchain, the rationale wasn’t immediately clear. Layer 2 protocols like Base are designed to improve the efficiency of Layer 1 blockchains, such as Ethereum, by offloading transactions from the main chain. This reduces congestion, lowers fees, and increases transaction throughput. Although independent from Ethereum, Base remains connected to it, leveraging Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities and interoperability with Ethereum-based applications.\n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of Base is how quickly it has become a meaningful revenue source for Coinbase. In its Q2 earnings report, Coinbase revealed that transactions on Base grew 300% quarter-over-quarter, generating $52 million—nearly 8% of Coinbase’s total quarterly revenue. In a short time, Base has emerged as the number one Layer 2 blockchain by transaction volume and the second by total value locked.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/6dec524a-22a6-43de-a489-265de8cbb590/Transaction+Count+on+Optimistic+Rollups+%28Daily%2C+7DMA%29.png)\n\n### Why Are Companies Launching Their Own Blockchains?\n\nExamining the case of Coinbase, it’s clear that there is a compelling business rationale for launching proprietary blockchains. The key benefits include:\n\nInternalizing Revenue: With over 100 million users, why should Coinbase continue facilitating transactions on external networks or payment systems? By launching Base, Coinbase brings transaction revenue in-house, capturing a share of fees that would otherwise go to third parties.\n\nEnhancing Customer Experience and Loyalty: Running its own blockchain allows Coinbase to build a cohesive ecosystem where its products integrate seamlessly, delivering an improved customer experience. This interoperability also encourages customer loyalty through unique rewards and incentives.\n\nLeveraging Open-Source Innovation: By launching _Base_ within the Ethereum ecosystem and keeping it open to developers, Coinbase taps into the global developer community. If a developer creates a successful application on _Base_ , Coinbase benefits, allowing it to stay on the cutting edge and avoid the “innovator’s dilemma.”\n\nIn other words, Coinbase’s unique position as one of the primary on-and-off ramps to the blockchain ecosystem in the U.S., combined with its massive user base, empowers it to generate revenue that would otherwise flow to other networks, all while enhancing the user experience.\n\nThe success of _Base_ has inspired other major crypto players to take similar steps. Kraken, the sixth-largest crypto exchange globally, recently announced a Layer 2 network based on technology from Optimism—the same provider behind _Base_. Similarly, Uniswap, a leading decentralized exchange, launched _Unichain_ , its own Layer 2 solution on Ethereum.\n\nThis growing trend suggests that proprietary blockchains could become a vital strategy for major players in the crypto space, as they seek to consolidate revenue streams and foster innovation within their own ecosystems.\n\n### Sony’s Bold Move into Blockchain\n\nAgainst the backdrop of companies like Coinbase launching proprietary blockchains, Sony has announced the development of its own platform, _Soneium_. Led by Sony Block Solution Labs Pte. Ltd., a Singapore-based subsidiary, this ambitious initiative marks a strategic pivot for Sony, a company traditionally known for consumer electronics, entertainment, and gaming.\n\nSo, why is Sony diving into blockchain? The answer parallels Coinbase’s rationale for Base, aligned with Sony’s unique position as a diversified tech giant with valuable intellectual property spanning multiple industries. _Soneium_ is envisioned as a blockchain platform that will integrate and enhance Sony’s offerings in entertainment, gaming, and electronics.\n\nImagine a future where every PlayStation game’s infrastructure is built on a Soneium. By embedding in-game economies directly on its blockchain, Sony could fundamentally reshape the gaming landscape and transform _Soneium_ into a powerful revenue engine.\n\nThe strategic rationale behind Sony’s blockchain launch can be identified by 3 main points:\n\nRevenue Generation: By developing its own blockchain platform, Sony positions itself to capitalize on the expanding Web3 market. As blockchain adoption accelerates, Sony stands to unlock new revenue streams through transaction fees, partnerships with third-party developers, and the creation of blockchain-powered products and services.\n\nCustomer Engagement and Loyalty: Web3 technology presents Sony with opportunities to offer innovative customer rewards within the _Soneium_ ecosystem. By creating a seamless, blockchain-enabled environment, Sony can enhance customer engagement and foster loyalty through tokenized rewards and immersive experiences across its entertainment platforms.\n\nInnovation and Competitiveness: With an open-source approach, _Soneium_ invites global developers to build on Sony’s platform. If a developer creates a successful application, Sony directly benefits, enabling it to stay at the forefront of technological innovation and avoid stagnation.\n\nWith a global footprint of 900 million Sony devices, supported by a rich ecosystem of movies, music, and the PlayStation Network, Sony is positioned to bring blockchain technology into everyday life. Leveraging its assets and distribution channels, _Soneium_ will explore services that integrate seamlessly with Sony’s products, creating new opportunities across its business sectors.\n\nIn essence, by launching its own blockchain, Sony aims to drive revenue, improve customer experience, and foster innovation—compelling reasons to build products on blockchain infrastructure.\n\n### The View From London\n\nWhile it hasn’t made major headlines, Sony—one of the world’s most influential tech companies—has made a bold move into blockchain with the launch of _Soneium_. This step exemplifies a broader trend: leading companies across industries are increasingly recognizing the vast potential of hosting their own blockchains.\n\nWhen stepping back to look at these market developments, two key takeaways emerge:\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Dominance: The EVM continues to establish itself as the blockchain industry’s standard, with major institutions like BlackRock launching products on Ethereum. Coinbase, Kraken, and Uniswap are just the latest in a series of prominent players building on this platform, reinforcing Ethereum’s position as the leading hub for innovation. Now, with Sony launching an EVM-compatible blockchain, venture capitalists should take note of Ethereum’s expanding ecosystem as it solidifies its dominance in the sector.\n\nMassive Revenue Potential for Established Enterprises: Whether in crypto or beyond, companies that host their own blockchain effectively create their own transaction networks. This enables them to internalize transaction fees and streamline operations once outsourced to traditional financial intermediaries or other networks. The success of Coinbase’s Layer 2 blockchain, _Base_ , underscores just how profitable this strategy can be.\n\nWe see this as just the beginning. With publicly traded companies like Sony and Coinbase recognizing the value of having a blockchain, it’s easy to imagine others following suit. Why wouldn’t Apple, with billions of users, launch a blockchain to power Apple Pay and bypass traditional payment networks like Visa and Mastercard?\n\nWhile small businesses, like local bakeries, might not need a blockchain today (just as they didn’t need websites years ago), it’s increasingly clear that large corporations are leaving substantial revenue and growth opportunities on the table by relying on traditional infrastructure. As blockchain innovation accelerates, more companies will seize this opportunity to modernize their financial and operational infrastructure, fostering innovation and capturing value in the process.\n\nAlready in 2024, we’ve seen BlackRock make a strong entrance into the blockchain space, and now Sony—operating in a completely different industry—has followed.\n\nAdoption is well underway, for those paying attention.\n\nFor us as early-stage venture investors, the best practice is always to place capital ahead of powerful tailwinds that are strengthening and blowing in favor of the investments we make. It could not be a better time to be a Blockchain venture investor and we encourage you to reach out and ask for our Fund VII materials by contacting our team at ir@blockchaincoinvestors.com.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nMitch Mechigian\n\nPartner, London\n\n**About Blockchain Coinvestors**\n\nBlockchain Coinvestors is the best way to invest in blockchain businesses.

Headquartered in San Francisco with a presence in London, New York, Grand Cayman, Zug and Zurich, the alternative investment management firm was co-founded by Alison Davis and Matthew Le Merle.\n\n**“The best way to invest in blockchain businesses”**\n\n[Matthew Le Merle](/newsletter?author=50491c9984aeee94c3a56c1c)October 30, 2024\n\n[ Facebook0 ](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.blockchaincoinvestors.com%2Fnewsletter%2Ffrom-sony-to-coinbase-why-the-future-of-business-is-on-the-blockchain)[ Twitter ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.blockchaincoinvestors.com%2Fnewsletter%2Ffrom-sony-to-coinbase-why-the-future-of-business-is-on-the-blockchain&text=)[ LinkedIn0 ](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&source=Blockchain+Coinvestors&summary=&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.blockchaincoinvestors.com%2Fnewsletter%2Ffrom-sony-to-coinbase-why-the-future-of-business-is-on-the-blockchain)[ Reddit ](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.blockchaincoinvestors.com%2Fnewsletter%2Ffrom-sony-to-coinbase-why-the-future-of-business-is-on-the-blockchain)[ Tumblr ](https://www.tumblr.com/share/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.blockchaincoinvestors.com%2Fnewsletter%2Ffrom-sony-to-coinbase-why-the-future-of-business-is-on-the-blockchain)[ Pinterest0 ](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/link/?description=&media=https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/1730313756021-JOH4SJ3Z0HQZJUUETUTH/From+Sony+to+Coinbase+Why+the+Future+of+Business+is+on+the+Blockchain.jpg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.blockchaincoinvestors.com%2Fnewsletter%2Ffrom-sony-to-coinbase-why-the-future-of-business-is-on-the-blockchain)[ 0 Likes ](#)\n"

There will be a second closing before the end of 2024 for those of you who want to allocate capital this year, and as always just let us know at IR@BlockchainCoinvestors.com should you wish to learn more about our investment strategies including Fund VII.\n\nTurning to this week's newsletter, we are now well into the fourth quarter of 2024, and it is the time of year when we start to think about what just happened, and what may happen in the year to come. For those of us in the US, we first have to get through a Presidential election, Thanksgiving, and the Holiday season, but notwithstanding this, we are seeing our inboxes begin to fill up with thoughtful reports on the 'State of Crypto in 2024'.\n\nIn this week's newsletter, we want to highlight 5 stories that we just heard, each one of which seems of great significance in the context of our investment thesis:\n\n  1. Crypto Adoption has Reached an Inflection Point\n\n  2. Stablecoins Are Surging\n\n  3. BlackRock and Securitize Have a Tiger by the Tail\n\n  4. Institutional Adoption is Accelerating\n\n  5. November's US Election Result Will Be Good for Blockchain No Matter What\n\n\n\n\nEach is covered in turn.\n\n### Crypto Adoption has Reached an Inflection Point\n\nThe first story that got our attention reaffirms something we have shared with our investors for at least 6 years now. Blockchain and crypto are being adopted faster worldwide than the rollout of the Internet, driven by a combination of factors including over 65% of the world's population is already connected digitally; more than 60% of the world's population are digital natives who find it obvious that finance and commerce should be digital too; and the reality that digital offerings built on top of blockchain are cheaper, faster, more accessible and more secure than legacy solutions offered by the world's financial community today - they deliver more consumer value.\n\nThe _State of Crypto 2024_ report from A16Z doesn't go quite as far as to say we are at an inflection point (that's our view here at Blockchain Coinvestors) but it opens up with the simple facts demonstrated in the following exhibit from the report. In September 2024, 220 million monthly active addresses interacted with crypto products, and not only was this an all time high, but it compares through analogy very well with the curve of Internet Users.\n\nBy this analogy, it is about 1998 in Internet years\n\nWe all remember 1998. Most of the value creation in the Internet was still to come, and for investors, it was an ideal time to begin to allocate capital into the innovation.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/4cbd1ba0-15c2-4a5b-82de-346d61a12817/Internet+Users+vs.+Monthly+Active+Crypto+Addresses.png)\n\nSource: A16Z\n\nThe same report also illustrates that this growth is proliferating across more and more protocols and platforms (it is not all about Bitcoin anymore). But that is a different story.\n\nYou can read the rest of A16Z's report by [clicking on this link](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/state-of-crypto-report-2024/).\n\n### Stablecoins Are Surging\n\nThe second story we read in October that really got our attention, was a succinct, to the point, memorandum by Bitwise's research team on the topic of Stablecoins called _'Could Stablecoins Put an End to Money Market Accounts?'_ For full disclosure, we are investors in Bitwise.\n\nThis is the first powerful use case of blockchain technology that has reached critical mass, and is now surging fast on every continent. In a way, it is the simplest to understand. All Stablecoins do is wrap something we all know very well (A fiat currency, dollar in most cases) and make it natively digital through the process of tokenization. So dollars can be moved at blinding speed, and almost no cost, across the Internet. Enabling cheaper, quicker and easier payments than any legacy payments infrastructure can offer.\n\nBitwise highlights the growth in the chart below, and go on to recap in simple terms the benefits of the invention.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/3678789f-7dac-43df-b3d5-955244245704/Stablecoins+are+Surging.png)\n\nSource: Bitwise\n\nIn fact, Stablecoins as a concept are so simple that we find investors are ignoring them when they ask us to give examples of practical applications of blockchain. It's like in 1998, when people wanted to find complex uses of the Internet, and tended to overlook the impact it was having on content sharing from the outset.\n\nToday, most content is digital. Of course in the future, most payments will be natively digital too.\n\nYou can read the rest of Bitwise's report by [clicking on this link](https://experts.bitwiseinvestments.com/cio-memos/could-stablecoins-put-an-end-to-money-market-accounts).\n\n### BlackRock and Securitize Have a Tiger by the Tail\n\nOctober also brought us the good news that Securitize, a portfolio company, is now seeing tremendous growth in the tokenized money market fund that BlackRock has built on its technology.\n\nKnown as BUIDL, the fund essentially puts a digital wrapper around traditional financial products - in this case treasuries - and allows them to be offered in tokenized form for use in digital infrastructure including custodians, marketplaces, and exchanges. This is profound; Just as one use case, in conventional trading spaces, traders put up dollar based collateral and earn interest on it. To date, in the crypto world, trader collateral in dollars does not typically earn anything. Now if a trader puts up BUIDL, or a protocol treasury parks its excess capital into the same, they earn the going interest rate.\n\nBecause BlackRock and Securitize have chosen to develop BUIDL on Ethereum, it is very transparent. Unlike almost any other financial product in the world, you can get real time information about the fund's balances, trading volumes and so on. If you want to see that for yourself, [click on this link](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7712c34205737192402172409a8f7ccef8aa2aec) that will take you to Etherscan (one service that makes sense of the data for you). The following exhibit is a screenshot of the same as of the time of writing.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/aafd64f0-b21b-4047-a977-c3010382a376/BlackRock+USD+Institutional+Digital+Liquidity+Fund%28BUIDL%29.png)\n\nSource: Etherscan\n\nSimply put, this is a leveling up of real world financial assets. In the future, all financial assets will be digitalized to enable not only efficiency gains, but also to unlock new use cases and functionality.\n\nYou can read a little more about this story at Bloomberg by [clicking on this link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-18/blackrock-wants-crypto-exchanges-to-use-buidl-token-as-collateral).\n\n### Institutional Adoption is Accelerating\n\nTwice a year, we publish our _'Institutional Digital Finance Adoption Report'_ which you can read by [clicking on this link](https://www.blockchaincoinvestors.com/adoption?utm_source=email-newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=en1024-newsletterlink&utm_term=na&utm_content=text). The report has shown an accelerating adoption of blockchain based products and services by the world's top 50 financial institutions by assets under management since we first published it.\n\nNow Bitwise has included a similar analysis in its _'Crypto Market Review (Q3 2024)'_. While the report is full of many other compelling data and analysis reaffirming the inflection point in blockchain innovation, we single out this one which is on page 65 because it shows the reality of what the world's largest financial institutions believe. Whatever they say, their actions speak louder, and most of them are now applying blockchain technology to digitize and upgrade their businesses.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/4e5ceedd-eb43-4b4c-8fa9-a9323c279d6a/Crypto+Adoption+by+Institutions.png)\n\nThe second part of our investment thesis is that all of the world's financial infrastructure will need to be upgraded (in order to enable the digitalization of monies, commodities, and assets) and this is what Bitwise is showing. The world's largest financial institutions are now engaged in this digital transformation. More often than not, they end up using the infrastructure built by the blockchain companies and projects we invest in at Blockchain Coinvestors. Which is very exciting to see.\n\nYou can read the rest of Bitwise's report by [clicking on this link](https://bitwiseinvestments.com/crypto-market-insights/crypto-market-review-q3-2024).\n\n### November's US Election Result Will Be Good for Blockchain No Matter What\n\nThe fifth and final story for inclusion in this newsletter is about US politics and the upcoming US Presidential election - as well as the elections in the senate, house, and at other levels of US government that get decided at the same time.\n\nOn October 11th we held a webinar with Kristin Smith, the President of the Blockchain Association, which is perhaps the US's most important industry association representing blockchain and crypto participants. A lot of you joined, and if you did not, you can watch the webinar with Kristin Smith by [clicking on this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcrqDDOyx2A).\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d388244fb247f00017de2f7/48b77f76-58d4-4f6c-9bc6-d7b30945da90/Fireside+Chat+with+the+Blockchain+Association.png)\n\nKristin was very informative, transparent and thought provoking. At the end, we asked her this question:\n\n_\"Here at Blockchain Coinvestors we think all outcomes of November lead to greatly accelerated blockchain innovation relative to the last four years of Biden/Harris anti crypto army activities._\n\n_At one extreme:_\n\n  * _A republican clean sweep at every level of government would create a perfect storm of support for the industry._\n\n  * _Conversely a democrat clean sweep would still leave us with a majority of democratic party politicians supporting pro innovation, pro blockchain change especially as they analyze the voting patterns and realize in the next election in 2026 there will be even more pro crypto voters, money and momentum._\n\n\n\n\n_So whatever happens, blockchain support is growing and will grow even faster in Washington from here on._\n\n_Are we drinking too much kool aid?\"_\n\nKristin's response was _\"No you are not drinking too much Kool Aid, and yes we have reached a turning point.\"_\n\nShe went on to lay out in detail just why there is no political upside to being negative about blockchain and crypto. You can see the detail of this starting at about minute 36 of the webinar.\n\nYou can find the webinar with Kristin Smith by [clicking on this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcrqDDOyx2A).\n\n### Conclusions\n\nIn conclusion, the breadth and depth of data, analysis, and insight that is flowing now about global blockchain adoption is at an all time high. It is just an obvious observation that digital monies, commodities, and assets are inevitable and if you doubt that, just read and listen to some of the year end reports that we have highlighted, or the many that have yet to be published. By year end, the 'inflection point' that we have been talking about will be plain to all.\n\nIf 2025 is 1999 in Internet years, then as investors we all know with hindsight what we need to do. Allocate ahead of powerful tailwinds and alongside a global innovation that is only beginning to ramp up.\n\n### Fund VII News\n\nAs noted in the opening of this newsletter, we have successfully conducted a first closing for our new Fund of Funds, and are making our first commitments to leading blockchain VCs. There will be a second closing in 2024 before year end for those of you who want to allocate some capital. The Fund VII value proposition is:\n\n**A SINGLE INVESTMENT ACCESSES GLOBAL, DIVERSIFIED EXPOSURE TO LEADING EARLY STAGE BLOCKCHAIN VENTURE INVESTMENTS ON AN INSTITUTIONAL PLATFORM**\n\nContact our investor relations team at IR@BlockchainCoinvestors.com for details.\n\nThank for reading\n\nThe Blockchain Coinvestors Partners\n\n**About Blockchain Coinvestors**\n\nBlockchain Coinvestors is the best way to invest in blockchain businesses.
