(NASDAQ: FVCB) (the “Company”) today reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter Selected Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Enhanced Profitability.** Return on average assets for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 0.85%, an increase of 21%, from 0.70% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, and increased 10%, from 0.77%, for the linked quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n  * **Increased Net Income.** Net income increased compared to the year ago quarter and prior quarter. Net income totaled $4.7 million, or $0.25 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of $4.0 million, or $0.22 diluted earnings per share, for quarter ended September 30, 2023, and net income of $4.2 million, or $0.23 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n  * **Continued Improvement in Net Interest Margin.** Net interest margin increased 25 basis points, or 10%, to 2.64% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 2.39% for the third quarter of 2023. On a linked quarter basis, net interest margin increased 5 basis points from 2.59% for the three months ended June 30, 2024. \n  * **Solid Credit Quality.** Classified loans decreased $19.9 million, or 86%, to $3.2 million at September 30, 2024 compared to the prior quarter. Nonaccrual loans decreased $744 thousand, or 23%, from prior quarter end, and were 0.16% of total assets at September 30, 2024. The Company recorded net recoveries of $63 thousand during the third quarter of 2024. \n  * **Sound, Well Capitalized Balance Sheet.** All of FVCbank’s (the “Bank”) regulatory capital components and ratios were well in excess of thresholds required to be considered \"well capitalized\", with total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets of 14.52% at September 30, 2024, compared to 13.83% at December 31, 2023. The tangible common equity (\"TCE\") to tangible assets (\"TA\") ratio for the Bank increased to 10.21% at September 30, 2024, from 9.40% at September 30, 2023. The Bank’s investment securities are classified as available-for-sale, and therefore the unrealized losses on these securities are fully reflected in the TCE/TA ratio. \n\n\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded net income of $4.7 million, or $0.25 diluted earnings per share, an increase of $630 thousand, compared to $4.0 million, or $0.22 diluted earnings per shares, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Compared to the linked quarter, net income increased $514 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $4.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of $10.2 million, or $0.55 diluted earnings per share, an increase of $1.3 million, or 14%, compared to net income of $8.9 million, or $0.49 diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. \n\nCommercial bank operating earnings (non-GAAP), which exclude the nonrecurring taxes recorded for the surrender of the Company’s bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) policies during the first quarter of 2024 and the loss on the sale of available-for-sale investment securities during the first quarter of 2023, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $12.6 million and $12.5 million, respectively, an increase of $76 thousand. Diluted commercial bank operating earnings per share (non-GAAP) for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $0.68 and $0.69, respectively. \n\nThe Company considers commercial bank operating earnings a useful comparative financial measure of the Company’s operating performance over multiple periods. Commercial bank operating earnings are determined by methods other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP can be found in the tables below. \n\n**Management Comments**\n\nDavid W. Pijor, Esq., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, said: \n\n“Our disciplined approach to loan originations and deposit pricing continues to enhance our net interest income and margin for a third consecutive quarter. We continue to focus on attaining the full customer relationship which has allowed us to continue to originate loans to strong credit-worthy borrowers with compensating balances. During the third quarter of 2024, we originated over $59 million in loans, which were funded through loan maturities and deposit growth. Lastly, our partners at Atlantic Coast Mortgage (“ACM”) have continued profitability for the third quarter and year-to-date periods, which has enhanced our noninterest income for 2024.” \n\n**Statement of Condition**\n\nTotal assets were $2.29 billion at September 30, 2024 and $2.19 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $102.7 million, or 5%. At September 30, 2023, total assets were $2.31 billion. \n\nLoans receivable, net of deferred fees, were $1.87 billion at September 30, 2024, $1.83 billion at December 31, 2023, and $1.85 billion at September 30, 2023. Year-to-date, total loans, net of fees, increased $46.4 million, or 2.5%. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, loans receivable, net of fees, decreased $12.0 million, of which $13.6 million of this decrease is related to the warehouse line held by ACM. Excluding the warehouse line, loans increased $1.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, loan originations totaled $58.7 million with a weighted average rate of 9.27%, and were primarily comprised of commercial and industrial loans. Loan renewals totaled $60.4 million and had a weighted average rate of 8.94%. Loans that paid off during the third quarter of 2024 totaled $51.6 million and had a weighted average rate of 7.52%. \n\nInvestment securities were $165.3 million at September 30, 2024, $171.9 million at December 31, 2023, and $216.4 million at September 30, 2023. Investment securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $6.6 million, primarily due to principal repayments and maturities totaling $11.2 million, offset by a decrease in the portfolio’s unrealized losses totaling $4.6 million. \n\nTotal deposits were $1.96 billion at September 30, 2024 and $1.85 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $115.5 million, or 6%. Noninterest-bearing deposits were $357.0 million at September 30, 2024, or 18.2% of total deposits, and decreased $16.8 million during the third quarter of 2024, as customers continue to sweep to interest-bearing deposit products. New noninterest- bearing deposits totaled $7.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Cash inflows from new non-maturity deposits totaled $97.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and were largely from 1031 exchange and title company deposits. The Company continues to grow its core deposit base and consistently sees new deposit inflows each quarter. As a member of the IntraFi Network, the Bank offers products to its customers who seek to maximize FDIC insurance protection (“reciprocal deposits”). At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, reciprocal deposits totaled $238.1 million and $254.1 million, respectively, and are considered part of the Company’s core deposit base. Time deposits decreased $28.2 million to $246.5 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to $274.7 million for the linked quarter ended June 30, 2024, as time deposits that were originated during 2023 with a weighted average rate of 5.16% matured in September. \n\nAt September 30, 2024, wholesale funding totaled $306.9 million and had a weighted average rate of 3.47% (including $250 million in pay-fixed/receive-floating interest rate swaps at an average rate of 3.25%). Wholesale funding at September 30, 2024 includes wholesale deposits totaling $249.9 million and other borrowed funds totaling $57.0 million. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, wholesale funding had a weighted average rate of 3.50% compared to a weighted average rate of 3.72% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\nShareholders’ equity at September 30, 2024 was $230.8 million, an increase of $13.7 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2023. Year-to-date 2024 earnings contributed $10.2 million to the increase in shareholders’ equity. Common stock issued for stock options exercised contributed $2.1 million to shareholders’ equity for the 2024 year-to-date period. Accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased $1.4 million for the 2024 year-to-date period, which was primarily related to the change in the Company’s other comprehensive income associated with its available-for sale investment securities at September 30, 2024. \n\nBook value per share at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $12.68 and $12.19, respectively. Tangible book value per share (a non-GAAP financial measure which is defined in the tables below) at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $12.27 and $11.77, respectively. Tangible book value per share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss (a non-GAAP financial measure which is defined in the tables below), at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $13.52 and $13.12, respectively. \n\nThe Bank was well-capitalized at September 30, 2024, with total risk-based capital ratio of 14.52%, common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 13.48%, and tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.49%. \n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company released provisioning for credit losses totaling $200 thousand, and recorded provision expense totaling $6 thousand, respectively. This is compared to a release of provisioning for credit losses totaling $729 thousand and provision expense of $132 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) on loans to total loans, net of fees, was 1.02% at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.03% at December 31, 2023. \n\nNonaccrual loans and loans 90 days or more past due at September 30, 2024 totaled $3.6 million, or 0.16% of total assets, compared to $1.8 million, or 0.08% of total assets, at December 31, 2023. The increase in nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024 is primarily a result of one commercial & industrial loan relationship that was placed on nonaccrual during the first quarter of 2024. Classified loans decreased $19.9 million, or 86%, to $3.2 million at September 30, 2024 compared to the prior quarter. The Company had no other real estate owned at September 30, 2024. \n\nThe Company recorded net recoveries of $63 thousand and $68 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the ACL on loans was $19.1 million and $18.9 million, respectively. ACL coverage to nonperforming loans decreased to 536% at September 30, 2024, compared to 1032% at December 31, 2023, as a result of the $1.7 million increase in nonperforming loans during 2024. \n\nAt September 30, 2024, commercial real estate loans totaled $1.06 billion, or 57% of total loans, net of fees, and construction loans totaled $173.8 million, or 9% of total loans, net of fees. Included in commercial real estate and construction loans are loans secured by office buildings totaling $137.4 million, or 7% of total loans, which are primarily located in the Virginia and Maryland suburbs of the Company’s market area, with $2.4 million, or 0.13% of total loans, located in Washington, D.C. Loans secured by retail shopping centers totaled $260.7 million, or 14% of total loans, at September 30, 2024. Loans secured by multi-family housing totaled $164.6 million, or 9% of total loans, at September 30, 2024. The commercial real estate portfolio, including construction loans, is diversified by asset type and geographic concentration. The Company has comprehensive policies to monitor, measure, and mitigate its loan concentrations within this portfolio segment, including rigorous credit approval, monitoring and administrative practices. The following table provides further stratification of these and additional classes of real estate loans at September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands). \n\n**Owner Occupied Commercial Real Estate** |  **Non-Owner Occupied Commercial Real Estate** |  **Construction**  \n---|---|---  \n**Asset Class** |  **Average Loan-to-Value (1)** |  **Number of Total Loans** |  **Bank Owned Principal (2)** |  **Average Loan-to-Value (1)** |  **Number of Total Loans** |  **Bank Owned Principal (2)** |  **Top 3 Geographic Concentration** |  **Number of Total Loans** |  **Bank Owned Principal (2)** |  **Total Bank Owned Principal (2)** |  **% of Total Loans**  \nOffice, Class A  |  68%  |  6  |  $  |  7,426  |  46%  |  4  |  $  |  3,688  |  Counties of Fairfax and Loudoun, Virginia and Montgomery County, Maryland  |  —  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  11,114   \nOffice, Class B  |  49%  |  30  |  10,795  |  45%  |  28  |  56,782  |  —  |  —  |  67,577   \nOffice, Class C  |  53%  |  8  |  5,095  |  38%  |  8  |  1,871  |  1  |  865  |  7,831   \nOffice, Medical  |  38%  |  7  |  1,121  |  46%  |  7  |  41,312  |  1  |  8,426  |  50,859   \n**Subtotal** |  **51** |  **$** |  **24,437** |  **47** |  **$** |  **103,653** |  **2** |  **$** |  **9,291** |  **$** |  **137,381** |  **7%**  \nRetail- Neighborhood/Community Shop  |  —  |  $  |  —  |  43%  |  30  |  $  |  81,172  |  Prince George's County, Maryland, Baltimore County, MD, Fairfax County, VA  |  2  |  $  |  11,358  |  $  |  92,530   \nRetail- Restaurant  |  56%  |  8  |  7,113  |  44%  |  16  |  26,137  |  —  |  —  |  33,250   \nRetail- Single Tenant  |  58%  |  5  |  1,942  |  42%  |  20  |  36,155  |  —  |  —  |  38,097   \nRetail- Anchored,Other  |  —  |  —  |  51%  |  13  |  42,736  |  —  |  —  |  42,736   \nRetail- Grocery-anchored  |  —  |  —  |  46%  |  8  |  52,819  |  1  |  1,238  |  54,057   \n**Subtotal** |  **13** |  **$** |  **9,055** |  **87** |  **$** |  **239,019** |  **3** |  **$** |  **12,596** |  **$** |  **260,670** |  **14%**  \nMulti-family, Class A (Market)  |  —  |  $  |  —  |  1  |  $  |  —  |  Washington, D.C., Baltimore City, Maryland and Richmond City, Virginia  |  1  |  $  |  1,044  |  $  |  1,044   \nMulti-family, Class B (Market)  |  —  |  —  |  63%  |  20  |  69,252  |  —  |  —  |  69,252   \nMulti-family, Class C (Market)  |  —  |  —  |  55%  |  56  |  66,939  |  2  |  7,047  |  73,986   \nMulti-Family-Affordable Housing  |  —  |  —  |  52%  |  10  |  16,277  |  1  |  4,013  |  20,290   \n**Subtotal** |  **—** |  **$** |  **—** |  **87** |  **$** |  **152,468** |  **4** |  **$** |  **12,104** |  **$** |  **164,572** |  **9%**  \nIndustrial  |  50%  |  41  |  $  |  66,732  |  47%  |  38  |  $  |  124,694  |  Prince William County, Virginia, Fairfax County, Virginia and Howard County, Maryland  |  1  |  $  |  1,411  |  $  |  192,837   \nWarehouse  |  54%  |  13  |  17,704  |  27%  |  8  |  9,327  |  —  |  —  |  27,031   \nFlex  |  50%  |  14  |  15,499  |  54%  |  14  |  56,144  |  2  |  —  |  71,643   \n**Subtotal** |  **68** |  **$** |  **99,935** |  **60** |  **$** |  **190,165** |  **3** |  **$** |  **1,411** |  **$** |  **291,511** |  **16%**  \nHotels  |  —  |  $  |  —  |  42%  |  9  |  $  |  55,177  |  1  |  $  |  7,315  |  $  |  62,492  |  **3%**  \nMixed Use  |  45%  |  10  |  $  |  5,839  |  60%  |  36  |  $  |  65,773  |  —  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  71,612  |  **4%**  \nLand  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  —  |  26  |  $  |  55,588  |  $  |  55,588  |  **3%**  \n1-4 Family construction  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  —  |  17  |  $  |  50,274  |  $  |  50,274  |  **3%**  \nOther (including net deferred fees)  |  $  |  57,003  |  $  |  60,454  |  $  |  25,227  |  $  |  142,684  |  **8%**  \n**Total commercial real estate and construction loans, net of fees, at September 30, 2024** |  **$** |  **196,269** |  **$** |  **866,709** |  **$** |  **173,806** |  **$** |  **1,236,784** |  **66%**  \n**At December 31, 2023** |  **$** |  **212,889** |  **$** |  **878,744** |  **$** |  **147,998** |  **$** |  **1,239,631** |  **68%**  \n(1) Loan-to-value is determined at origination date against current bank owned principal.   \n(2) Bank-owned principal is not adjusted for deferred fees and costs.   \n(3) Minimum debt service coverage policy is 1.30x for owner occupied and 1.25x for Non-Owner Occupied at origination.   \n  \nThe loans shown in the above table exhibit strong credit quality, reflecting two classified loans at September 30, 2024 totaling $1.6 million. During its assessment of the allowance for credit losses, the Company addressed the credit risks associated with these portfolio segments and believes that as a result of its conservative underwriting discipline at loan origination and its ongoing loan monitoring procedures, the Company has appropriately reserved for possible credit concerns in the event of a downturn in economic activity. \n\n**Minority Investment in Mortgage Banking Operation**\n\nIn August 2021, the Company acquired a membership interest in ACM to diversify its loan portfolio while providing competitive residential mortgage products to its customers and to generate additional revenue. The Company’s investment in ACM is reflected as a nonconsolidated minority investment, and as such, the Company’s income generated from the investment is included in non-interest income. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company reported income of $278 thousand and a loss of $650 thousand, respectively, an increase of $928 thousand. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded income of $425 thousand compared to a loss of $1.4 million, respectively, related to its investment in ACM. \n\n**Income Statement**\n\nThe Company recorded net income of $4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $630 thousand, or 16%, compared to $4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Compared to the linked quarter, net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $514 thousand, or 12%, from $4.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\nNet interest income increased $879 thousand, or 7%, to $14.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $13.3 million for the third quarter of 2023, and increased $543 thousand, or 4%, compared to the linked quarter ended June 30, 2024. Compared to the year ago quarter ended September 30, 2023, the increase in net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 is primarily due to an increase in loan interest income as the loan portfolio reprices in this high interest rate environment. \n\nThe Company's net interest margin increased 25 basis points to 2.64% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.39% for the year ago quarter ended September 30, 2023, and increased 5 basis points from 2.59% for the linked quarter ended June 30, 2024. The increase in net interest margin is a result of continued improvement in the yields of the Company’s loan portfolio and its management to control funding costs. \n\nCompared to the year ago quarter ended September 30, 2023, interest income increased $1.8 million, or 7%, to $29.2 million, for the third quarter of 2024. Total interest income increased $1.3 million, or 5%, for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the linked quarter ended June 30, 2024. Loan interest income increased $2.1 million, or 8%, to $27.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $25.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as average total loans only increased $10.3 million during this same comparable period. Compared to the linked quarter ended June 30, 2024, loan interest income increased $924 thousand, or 3%, as average total loans decreased $3.2 million. \n\nThe Company has actively managed its maturing commercial real estate loan portfolio and further diversified its loan mix toward commercial & industrial loans, which earn higher yields. Loan yields increased 43 basis points to 5.83% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, and increased 21 basis points compared to the linked quarter ended June 30, 2024. The yield on earning assets increased 51 basis points to 5.46% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.95% for the same period of 2023, partially as a result of the balance sheet repositionings completed during 2023 along with the repricing of the Company’s variable rate loan portfolio and new loan originations. \n\nAt September 30, 2024, approximately $434.9 million, or 28%, of the Company’s commercial loan portfolio is expected to reprice in the next 12 months, which is comprised of the following: $112.8 million in fixed rate commercial loans, and $61.8 million in variable rate commercial loans, with an additional $260.3 million in floating rate loans priced currently at market rates. Within the following 24-36 months, $214.4 million in fixed rate commercial loans are scheduled to reprice and an additional $87.3 million in variable rate commercial loans are scheduled to reprice, representing 20% of the current loan portfolio. In the near term, the Company’s efforts to attain appropriate yields on new originations and the repricing of the commercial loan portfolio are expected to provide continued improvement in loan yields. \n\nOn a linked quarter basis, interest expense increased $718 thousand, or 5%, to $15.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and increased $926 thousand, or 7%, compared to the year ago quarter. Interest expense on other borrowed funds for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 decreased $587 thousand, or 51%, to $563 thousand from $1.2 million, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as the Company reduced its reliance on wholesale funding. Interest expense on deposits increased $1.3 million to $14.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, reflecting the increase in average balances of non-maturity deposits during the third quarter of 2024. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.80% compared to 3.74% for the second quarter of 2024, an increase of 6 basis points compared to an increase of 38 basis points from 3.42% for the year ago quarter, demonstrating the Company’s ability to slow the increase of funding costs during 2024. As a result of the Federal Open Market Committee decision to cut the federal funds rate by 0.50% on September 18, 2024, the Company has decreased interest rates on its various deposit products, the full impact of which will be reflected in the fourth quarter of 2024. \n\nNet interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $40.7 million and $41.7 million, respectively, a decrease of $1.1 million, or 3%, year-over-year. Interest income increased $4.1 million, or 5%, to $84.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $80.0 million for the comparable 2023 period. Interest expense totaled $43.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $5.1 million, compared to $38.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company’s net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 2.57% compared to 2.53% for the year-ago nine month period of 2023. \n\nNoninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $815 thousand compared $225 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and $871 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2024. \n\nFee income from loans was $54 thousand for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $107 thousand for the third quarter of 2023, which included income from back-to-back loan swap transactions entered into during the third quarter of 2023. Service charges on deposit accounts totaled $301 thousand for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $284 thousand for the year ago quarter, and $279 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Income from bank-owned life insurance decreased $303 thousand to $70 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $373 thousand for the same period of 2023, a direct result of the surrendered BOLI that occurred during the first quarter of 2024. As previously mentioned, income from the Company’s minority interest in ACM totaled $278 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a loss of $650 thousand for the same period of 2023, and compared to income of $351 thousand for the linked quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\nFor the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded noninterest income totaling $2.1 million, compared to a loss of $3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily associated with its securities sales transaction executed during the first quarter of 2023. \n\nNoninterest expense totaled $9.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $148 thousand, or 2%, compared to $9.0 million for the year ago quarter ended September 30, 2023. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense increased $200 thousand, or 2%, from $9.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in noninterest expense during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the linked quarter was primarily related to an increase in incentive accruals recorded during the third quarter of 2024. Compared to the year ago quarter, salaries and benefits expense decreased $414 thousand, or 8%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of reduced staffing and process improvement through the use of technology. Full-time equivalent employees have decreased from 126 at September 30, 2023, to 118 at December 31, 2023 to 111 at September 30, 2024, which includes vacancies that are in the process of being filled. \n\nOccupancy expense decreased $82 thousand to $465 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the year ago quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the office space reduction efforts completed during 2023. Internet banking and software expense increased $46 thousand to $706 thousand for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the implementation of enhanced customer software solutions. Other operating expenses totaled $1.6 million for third quarter of 2024 compared to $1.2 million for the year ago quarter ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $456 thousand, which was primarily a result of loan workout expenses that were collected by the Bank during the third quarter of 2023. The Company continues to identify and assess opportunities to reduce operating expenses. \n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, noninterest expense was $26.8 million and $27.3 million, respectively, a decrease of $444 thousand, or 2%, primarily as a result of the aforementioned decreases in salaries and benefits expenses and occupancy expense. \n\nThe efficiency ratio for core bank operating earnings (non-GAAP), which excludes the 2023 losses on the sale of available-for-sale investment securities, for the quarters ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, was 61.2%, 61.9%, and 66.7%, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the efficiency ratio for core bank operating earnings (non-GAAP), excluding 2023 losses on the sale of available-for-sale investment securities, was 62.7% and 63.7%, respectively. A reconciliation of the aforementioned efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, can be found in the tables below. \n\nThe Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $1.4 million and $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, provision for income taxes was $5.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively. The year-to-date 2024 period includes an additional $2.4 million which is associated with the Company surrendering its BOLI policies during the first quarter of 2024. \n\n**About FVCBankcorp, Inc.**\n\nFVCBankcorp, Inc. is the holding company for FVCbank, a wholly-owned subsidiary that commenced operations in November 2007.

Announces Second Quarter 2024 Earnings; Continued Improvement in Net Income, Net Interest Income, and Margin\n\nCompany Release - 07/25/2024\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nFAIRFAX, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  FVCBankcorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: FVCB) (the “Company”) today reported its financial results for the second quarter of 2024. \n\n**Second Quarter Selected Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Increase in Net Income**. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded net income of $4.2 million, or $0.23 diluted earnings per share. Compared to the linked quarter, net income increased $2.8 million, from $1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. \n  * **Increase in Net Interest Income and Margin**. Net interest margin increased 12 basis points, or 5%, to 2.59% for the second quarter of 2024, compared to 2.47% for the first quarter of 2024. Net interest income increased $877 thousand to $13.7 million, or 7%, compared to $12.8 million for the first quarter of 2024. Interest income increased $1.1 million, or 4%, quarter-over-quarter while interest expense only increased $266 thousand, or 2%, for the same period. \n  * **Strong Deposit Growth**. Core deposits, which exclude wholesale deposits, increased $121.5 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, or 8%. Total deposits increased $111.5 million, or 6%, during the second quarter of 2024, to end at $1.97 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $1.86 billion at March 31, 2024. \n  * **Solid Credit Quality**. Loans past due 30 days or more decreased to $2.5 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $3.9 million at March 31, 2024, a decrease of 35%. The Company recorded net recoveries of $5 thousand during the second quarter of 2024. \n  * **Sound, Well Capitalized Balance Sheet**. All of FVCbank’s (the “Bank”) regulatory capital components and ratios were well in excess of thresholds required to be considered \"well capitalized\", with total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets of 14.13% at June 30, 2024, compared to 13.83% at December 31, 2023. The tangible common equity (\"TCE\") to tangible assets (\"TA\") ratio for the Bank increased to 9.56% at June 30, 2024, from 8.70% at June 30, 2023. The Bank’s investment securities are classified as available-for-sale, and therefore the unrealized losses on these securities is fully reflected in the TCE/TA ratio. \n\n\n\nFor each of the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded net income of $4.2 million, or $0.23 diluted earnings per share. Compared to the linked quarter, net income increased $2.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, from $1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of $5.5 million, or $0.30 diluted earnings per share, compared to net income of $4.9 million, or $0.27 diluted earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2023. \n\nCommercial bank operating earnings (non-GAAP), which exclude the nonrecurring taxes on the surrender of the Company’s BOLI policies recorded during the first quarter of 2024, for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 were $4.2 million and $3.7 million, respectively, an increase of $429 thousand, or 12%. Diluted commercial bank operating earnings per share (non-GAAP) for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 were $0.23 and $0.20, respectively. \n\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, pre-tax pre-provision operating income (non-GAAP), which also excludes the nonrecurring taxes on the BOLI surrender was $5.5 million and $4.6 million, respectively, an increase of $984 thousand, or 22%. \n\nThe Company considers commercial bank operating earnings and pre-tax pre-provision operating income useful comparative financial measures of the Company’s operating performance over multiple periods. Both commercial bank operating earnings and pre-tax pre-provision operating income are determined by methods other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP can be found in the tables below. \n\n**Management Comments**\n\nDavid W. Pijor, Esq., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, said: \n\n“Two consecutive quarters of margin and net interest income improvement demonstrates that our disciplined approach to loan and deposit pricing is effective. We continue to acquire new customer relationships which supports our focus to further diversify both our loan and deposit portfolios. As a result of our efforts this quarter, we originated over $41 million in new loans and $176 million in new non-maturity deposit accounts. These achievements are a result of the dedication of our bankers who are committed to provide the best service to our clients each day. Lastly, we are pleased that our partners at Atlantic Coast Mortgage (“ACM”) have recorded net income for the second quarter and year-to-date in this challenging mortgage environment.” \n\n**Statement of Condition**\n\nTotal assets were $2.30 billion at June 30, 2024 and $2.19 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $108.6 million, or 5%. Compared to June 30, 2023, total assets decreased $45.2 million from $2.34 billion, year-over-year. \n\nLoans receivable, net of deferred fees, were $1.89 billion at June 30, 2024, $1.83 billion at December 31, 2023, and $1.90 billion at June 30, 2023. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, loans receivable, net of fees, increased $34.2 million, or 2%, of which $19.6 million of this increase is related to the warehouse line held by ACM. Excluding the warehouse line, loans increased $14.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. During the second quarter of 2024, loan originations totaled $41.1 million with a weighted average rate of 8.38% and loan renewals totaled $15.4 million with a weighted average rate of 8.95%. Loans that paid off during the second quarter of 2024 totaled $42.5 million and had a weighted average rate of 6.39%. \n\nInvestment securities were $162.4 million at June 30, 2024, $171.9 million at December 31, 2023, and $231.5 million at June 30, 2023. The decrease in investment securities during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was primarily a result of $4.6 million in principal repayments and maturities. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the investment securities portfolio decreased $9.4 million, primarily due to principal paydowns and an increase in the portfolio’s unrealized losses totaling $2.0 million. \n\nTotal deposits were $1.97 billion at June 30, 2024, $1.85 billion at December 31, 2023, and $2.09 billion at June 30, 2023. Compared to March 31, 2024, total deposits increased $111.5 million, or 6%. Noninterest-bearing deposits were $373.8 million at June 30, 2024, or 19.0% of total deposits, and decreased $20.3 million during the second quarter of 2024, as customers continue to shift to interest-bearing deposit products. At June 30, 2024, core deposits, which exclude wholesale deposits, increased $121.5 million, or 8%. As a member of the IntraFi Network, the Bank offers products to its customers who seek to maximize FDIC insurance protection (“reciprocal deposits”). At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, reciprocal deposits totaled $255.4 million and $254.1 million, respectively, and are considered part of the Company’s core deposit base. \n\nThe Company continues to have consistent core deposit inflows each quarter, including the second quarter of 2024, with new non-maturity deposit accounts totaling $176.0 million (which includes $18.4 million in new noninterest-bearing deposits) compared to $112.6 million (which includes $21.0 million in noninterest-bearing deposits) for the first quarter of 2024. Title and escrow-related deposits increased $51.8 million from March 31, 2024 to June 30, 2024, which was attributable to improved title and escrow related activity during the second quarter of 2024. The Company continues to see growth in its new and existing deposit relationships going into the third quarter of 2024. \n\nTotal wholesale funding decreased $10.0 million, or 3%, during the second quarter of 2024. Wholesale funding includes wholesale deposits totaling $249.8 million and other borrowed funds totaling $57.0 million at June 30, 2024. Average wholesale funding totaled $349.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and had a weighted average rate of 3.70%, compared to $413.2 million with a weighted average rate of 4.01% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The Bank used higher-cost short-term wholesale funding sources during the second quarter of 2024 to supplement intra-quarter deposit activity. At June 30, 2024, wholesale funding totaled $306.9 million and had a weighted average rate of 3.47% (including $250 million in pay-fixed/receive-floating interest rate swaps at an average rate of 3.25%). \n\nShareholders’ equity at June 30, 2024 was $226.5 million, an increase of $9.4 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2023. Year-to-date 2024 earnings contributed $5.5 million to the increase in shareholders’ equity. Common stock issued for stock options exercised contributed $1.9 million to shareholders’ equity for the 2024 year-to-date period. Accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased $2.0 million for the 2024 year-to-date period, which was primarily related to the change in the Company’s other comprehensive income associated with its interest rate swaps at June 30, 2024. \n\nBook value per share at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $12.45 and $12.19, respectively. Tangible book value per share (a non-GAAP financial measure which is defined in the tables below) at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $12.04 and $11.77, respectively. Tangible book value per share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss (a non-GAAP financial measure which is defined in the tables below), at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $13.26 and $13.12, respectively. \n\nThe Bank was well-capitalized at June 30, 2024, with total risk-based capital ratio of 14.13%, common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 13.09%, and tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.31%. \n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nFor each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses totaling $206 thousand, compared to provisions of $618 thousand and $860 thousand for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) to total loans, net of fees, was 1.02% at June 30, 2024, compared to 1.03% at December 31, 2023. \n\nThe Company has maintained disciplined credit guidelines during the rising interest rate environment. The Company proactively monitors the impact of rising interest rates on its adjustable loans as the industry navigates through this economic cycle of increased inflation and higher interest rates. Nonaccrual loans and loans 90 days or more past due at June 30, 2024 totaled $3.0 million, or 0.13% of total assets, compared to $1.8 million, or 0.08% of total assets, at December 31, 2023. The increase in nonperforming loans at June 30, 2024 is primarily a result of one commercial & industrial loan relationship that was placed on nonaccrual during the first quarter of 2024. The Company had no other real estate owned at June 30, 2024. \n\nThe Company recorded net recoveries of $5 thousand and $35 thousand for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the ACL was $19.2 million and $18.9 million, respectively. ACL coverage to nonperforming loans decreased to 603% at June 30, 2024, compared to 1032% at December 31, 2023 as a result of the $1.2 million increase in nonperforming loans during 2024. \n\nAt June 30, 2024, commercial real estate loans totaled $1.08 billion, or 57% of total loans, net of fees, and construction loans totaled $165 million, or 9% of total loans, net of fees. Included in commercial real estate loans are loans secured by office buildings totaling $136.4 million, or 7% of total loans, which are located in the Virginia and Maryland suburbs of the Company’s market area. Retail shopping centers totaled $260.8 million, or 14% of total loans, at June 30, 2024. Multi-family housing totaled $178.2 million, or 9% of total loans, at June 30, 2024. The commercial real estate portfolio, including construction loans, is diversified by asset type and geographic concentration. The Company manages this portion of the portfolio in a disciplined manner, and has comprehensive policies to monitor, measure, and mitigate its loan concentrations within this portfolio segment, including rigorous credit approval, monitoring and administrative practices. The following table provides further stratification of these and additional classes of real estate loans at June 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands). \n\n**Owner Occupied Commercial Real Estate** |  **Non-Owner Occupied Commercial Real Estate** |  **Construction**  \n---|---|---  \n**Asset Class** |  **Average Loan-to- Value (1)** |  **Number of Total Loans** |  **Bank Owned Principal (2)** |  **Average Loan-to- Value (1)** |  **Number of Total Loans** |  **Bank Owned Principal (2)** |  **Top 3 Geographic Concentration** |  **Number of Total Loans** |  **Bank Owned Principal (2)** |  **Total Bank Owned Principal (2)** |  **% of Total Loans**  \nOffice, Class A  |  69%  |  6  |  $  |  7,476  |  46%  |  4  |  $  |  3,717  |  Counties of Fairfax and Loudoun, Virginia and Montgomery County, Maryland  |  —  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  11,193   \nOffice, Class B  |  45%  |  34  |  12,143  |  45%  |  29  |  57,324  |  —  |  —  |  69,467   \nOffice, Class C  |  53%  |  8  |  5,138  |  39%  |  8  |  1,902  |  1  |  873  |  7,913   \nOffice, Medical  |  39%  |  7  |  1,155  |  47%  |  7  |  41,514  |  1  |  5,129  |  47,798   \n**Subtotal** |  **55** |  **$** |  **25,912** |  **48** |  **$** |  **104,457** |  **2** |  **$** |  **6,002** |  **$** |  **136,371** |  **7%**  \nRetail- Neighborhood/Community Shop  |  —  |  $  |  —  |  44%  |  30  |  $  |  81,612  |  Prince George's County, Maryland, Fairfax County, Virginia and Washington, D.C.  |  2  |  $  |  11,376  |  $  |  92,988   \nRetail- Restaurant  |  57%  |  9  |  8,088  |  44%  |  16  |  26,456  |  —  |  —  |  34,544   \nRetail- Single Tenant  |  58%  |  5  |  1,963  |  41%  |  20  |  35,691  |  —  |  —  |  37,654   \nRetail- Anchored,Other  |  —%  |  0  |  —  |  52%  |  13  |  42,957  |  —  |  —  |  42,957   \nRetail- Grocery-anchored  |  —  |  —  |  46%  |  8  |  51,455  |  1  |  1,247  |  52,702   \n**Subtotal** |  **14** |  **$** |  **10,051** |  **87** |  **$** |  **238,171** |  **3** |  **$** |  **12,623** |  **$** |  **260,845** |  **14%**  \nMulti-family, Class A (Market)  |  —  |  $  |  —  |  —%  |  1  |  $  |  —  |  Washington, D.C., Baltimore City, Maryland and Arlington County, Virginia  |  1  |  $  |  1,026  |  $  |  1,026   \nMulti-family, Class B (Market)  |  —  |  —  |  62%  |  21  |  78,360  |  —  |  —  |  78,360   \nMulti-family, Class C (Market)  |  —  |  —  |  55%  |  58  |  71,355  |  2  |  7,047  |  78,402   \nMulti-Family-Affordable Housing  |  —  |  —  |  52%  |  10  |  16,360  |  1  |  4,034  |  20,394   \n**Subtotal** |  **—** |  **$** |  **—** |  **90** |  **$** |  **166,075** |  **4** |  **$** |  **12,107** |  **$** |  **178,182** |  **9%**  \nIndustrial  |  51%  |  41  |  $  |  67,883  |  47%  |  38  |  $  |  125,223  |  Prince William County, Virginia, Fairfax County, Virginia and Howard County, Maryland  |  1  |  $  |  1,041  |  $  |  194,147   \nWarehouse  |  51%  |  14  |  18,451  |  27%  |  8  |  9,399  |  —  |  —  |  27,850   \nFlex  |  50%  |  15  |  18,436  |  54%  |  14  |  56,226  |  2  |  —  |  74,662   \n**Subtotal** |  **70** |  **$** |  **104,770** |  **60** |  **$** |  **190,848** |  **3** |  **$** |  **1,041** |  **$** |  **296,659** |  **16%**  \nHotels  |  —  |  $  |  —  |  43%  |  9  |  $  |  51,873  |  1  |  $  |  6,481  |  $  |  58,354  |  **3%**  \nMixed Use  |  45%  |  10  |  $  |  5,945  |  60%  |  36  |  $  |  66,146  |  —  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  72,091  |  **4%**  \nLand  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  —  |  26  |  $  |  53,660  |  $  |  53,660  |  **3%**  \n1-4 Family construction  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  —  |  22  |  $  |  49,265  |  $  |  49,265  |  **3%**  \nOther (including net deferred fees)  |  $  |  57,844  |  $  |  61,389  |  $  |  23,556  |  $  |  142,789  |  **8%**  \n**Total commercial real estate and construction loans, net of fees, at June 30, 2024** |  **$** |  **204,522** |  **$** |  **878,959** |  **$** |  **164,735** |  **$** |  **1,248,216** |  **65%**  \nat December 31, 2023  |  $  |  212,889  |  $  |  878,744  |  $  |  147,998  |  $  |  1,239,631  |  **68%**  \n(1) Loan-to-value is determined at origination date against current bank owned principal.   \n(2) Bank-owned principal is not adjusted for deferred fees and costs.   \n(3) Minimum debt service coverage policy is 1.30x for owner occupied and 1.25x for Non-Owner Occupied at origination.   \n  \nThe loans shown in the above table exhibit strong credit quality, reflecting only one classified delinquency at June 30, 2024 totaling $851 thousand. During its assessment of the allowance for credit losses, the Company addressed the credit risks associated with these portfolio segments and believes that as a result of its conservative underwriting discipline at loan origination and its ongoing loan monitoring procedures, the Company has appropriately reserved for possible credit concerns in the event of a downturn in economic activity. \n\n**Minority Investment in Mortgage Banking Operation**\n\nIn August 2021, the Company acquired a membership interest in ACM to diversify its loan portfolio while providing competitive residential mortgage products to its customers and to generate additional revenue. The Company’s investment in ACM is reflected as a nonconsolidated minority investment, and as such, the Company’s income generated from the investment is included in non-interest income. For the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company reported income of $351 thousand and $20 thousand, respectively, an increase of $331 thousand. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded income of $148 thousand compared to a loss of $781 thousand, respectively, related to its investment in ACM. ACM management is continuing to evaluate opportunities to further reduce expenses and increase revenues. \n\n**Income Statement**\n\nThe Company recorded net income of $4.2 million for both of the three months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023. \n\nNet interest income increased $879 thousand, or 7%, to $13.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to the first quarter of 2024, and decreased $717 thousand, or 5%, compared to the year ago quarter. Compared to the year ago quarter ended June 30, 2023, the decrease in net interest income for the second quarter of 2024 is primarily due to an increase in funding costs, which have increased precipitously as a result of Federal Reserve monetary policy coupled with the need to meet intense competition from market area banks, brokerages and the U.S. Treasury. \n\nThe Company's net interest margin increased 12 basis points to 2.59% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to 2.47% for the linked quarter ended March 31, 2024 and decreased only 1 basis point from 2.60% for the year ago quarter ended June 30, 2023. The increase in net interest margin is a result of continued improvement in the yields of the Company’s loan portfolio and its management to control funding costs. \n\nOn a linked quarter basis, interest income increased $1.1 million, or 4%, for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Total interest income increased $767 thousand, or 3%, for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter of 2023. The year ago quarter included recovered loan interest of $338 thousand from an impaired loan that was fully recovered. Interest income on loans increased $1.5 million, or 6%, for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023. Compared to the linked quarter, interest income on loans increased $1.1 million, or 5%, for the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily as a result of an increase in average loans and an increase in loan yields. Loan yields increased 12 basis points to 5.62% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, and increased 27 basis points compared to the year ago quarter. Yield on earning assets increased 38 basis points to 5.27% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, partially as a result of the balance sheet repositionings completed during 2023 along with the repricing of the Company’s variable rate loan portfolio and new loan originations. \n\nAt June 30, 2024, approximately $404 million, or 27%, of the Company’s commercial loan portfolio is expected to reprice in the next 12 months, which is comprised of the following: $94.6 million in fixed rate commercial loans, and $28.5 million in variable rate commercial loans, with an additional $281.1 million in floating rate loans priced currently at market rates. Within the following 24-36 months, $202.9 million in fixed rate commercial loans will reprice and an additional $85.6 million in variable rate commercial loans will reprice, representing 19% of the current loan portfolio. In the near term, the Company’s efforts to attain appropriate yields on new originations and the repricing of the commercial loan portfolio are expected to provide continued improvement in loan yields. \n\nOn a linked quarter basis, interest expense increased $266 thousand, or 2%, for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Total interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $14.3 million compared to $12.8 million for the year ago quarter ended June 30, 2023, an increase of $1.5 million, or 12%. Interest expense on deposits increased $353 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, reflecting the increase in volume of deposits during the second quarter of 2024 in addition to the Company’s continued focus on maintaining core deposit pricing. Compared to the year ago quarter ended June 30, 2023, interest expense on deposits increased $882 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The cost of deposits for the second quarter of 2024 was 2.88% compared to 2.82% for the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 6 basis points compared to an increase of 47 basis points from 2.41% for the year-ago second quarter. \n\nThe Company’s cumulative deposit beta (calculated comparing the change in deposit interest rates from March 31, 2022 to June 30, 2024 including noninterest-bearing deposits and excluding wholesale deposits) remained at approximately 42% for each of June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, since the Federal Reserve began increasing short-term interest rates. \n\nNet interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was $26.5 million and $28.4 million, respectively, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 7%, year-over-year. Interest income increased $2.3 million, or 4%, to $54.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to $52.5 million for the comparable 2023 period. Interest expense totaled $28.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $4.2 million, compared to $24.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The Company’s net interest margin for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was 2.59% compared to 2.60% for the year-ago six month period of 2023. \n\nNoninterest income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 totaled $871 thousand compared $891 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and $395 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024. \n\nFee income from loans was $38 thousand for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $169 thousand for the second quarter of 2023, which included income from back-to-back loan swap transactions entered into during the second quarter of 2023. Service charges on deposit accounts totaled $279 thousand for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $232 thousand for the year ago quarter, and $261 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Income from bank-owned life insurance decreased $296 thousand to $66 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $362 thousand for the same period of 2023, a direct result of the surrendered BOLI that occurred during the first quarter of 2024. As previously mentioned, income from the Company’s minority interest in ACM totaled $351 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to income of $20 thousand for the same period of 2023, and compared to a loss of $203 thousand for the linked quarter ended March 31, 2024. \n\nFor the year-to-date period ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded noninterest income totaling $1.3 million, compared to a loss of $3.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, which was primarily associated with its securities sales transaction executed during the first quarter of 2023. \n\nNoninterest expense totaled $9.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, a decrease of $207 thousand, or 2%, compared to $9.2 million for the year ago quarter ended June 30, 2023. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense increased $371 thousand, or 4%, from $8.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. \n\nThe decrease for the second quarter of 2024 was primarily related to salaries and benefits expense which decreased $402 thousand when compared to the year ago quarter. Salary expense was the main driver for these decreases, a result of reduced staffing and process improvement through the use of technology. On a linked quarter basis, salaries and benefits expense increased $159 thousand, or 4%, for the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily as a result of an increase to the incentive accruals for the quarter. Full-time equivalent employees have decreased from 129 at June 30, 2023, and from 118 at December 31, 2023 to 113 at June 30, 2024. \n\nOccupancy expense decreased $95 thousand to $515 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the year ago quarter ended June 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the office space reduction efforts completed during 2023. Internet banking and software expense increased $147 thousand to $730 thousand for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the implementation of enhanced customer software solutions. Other operating expenses totaled $1.6 million for second quarter of 2024 compared to $1.5 million for the year ago quarter ended June 30, 2023. The Company continues to identify and assess opportunities to reduce operating expenses. \n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, noninterest expense was $17.6 million and $18.2 million, respectively, a decrease of $592 thousand, or 3%, primarily as a result of the aforementioned decreases in salaries and benefits expenses and occupancy expense. \n\nThe efficiency ratio for core bank operating earnings, excluding 2023 losses on the sale of available-for-sale investment securities, for the quarters ended June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2023, was 61.9%, 65.4%, and 60.2%, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the efficiency ratio for core bank operating earnings was 63.6% and 62.3%, respectively. A reconciliation of the aforementioned efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, can be found in the tables below. \n\nThe Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $1.2 million for each of the three months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, provision for income taxes was $4.4 million and $739 thousand, respectively. The year-to-date 2024 period includes an additional $2.4 million which is associated with the Company’s surrendering of its BOLI policies that occurred during the first quarter of 2024. \n\n**About FVCBankcorp, Inc.**\n\nFVCBankcorp, Inc. is the holding company for FVCbank, a wholly-owned subsidiary that commenced operations in November 2007.

Forward-looking statements include without limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and are typically identified with words such as “may,” “could,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “aim,” “intend,” “plan,” or words or phases of similar meaning. We caution that the forward-looking statements are based largely on our expectations and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties that are subject to change based on factors which are, in many instances, beyond our control. Actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those contemplated, expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause our financial performance to differ materially from that expressed in such forward-looking statements: general business and economic conditions, including higher inflation and its impacts, nationally or in the markets that the Company serves could adversely affect, among other things, real estate valuations, unemployment levels, the ability of businesses to remain viable, consumer and business confidence, and consumer or business spending, which could lead to decreases in demand for loans, deposits, and other financial services that the Company provides and increases in loan delinquencies and defaults; the impact of the interest rate environment on our business, financial condition and results of operation, and its impact on the composition and costs of deposits, loan demand, and the values and liquidity of loan collateral, securities, and interest sensitive assets and liabilities; changes in the Company’s liquidity requirements could be adversely affected by changes in its assets and liabilities; changes in the assumptions underlying the establishment of reserves for possible credit losses and the possibility that future credit losses may be higher than currently expected; changes in market conditions, specifically declines in the commercial and residential real estate market, volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, and soundness of other financial institutions the Company does business with; the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, inflation, interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations; the Company’s investment securities portfolio is subject to credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk as well as changes in the estimates used to value the securities in the portfolio; declines in the Company’s common stock price or the occurrence of what management would deem to be a triggering event that could, under certain circumstances, cause us to record a noncash impairment charge to earnings in future periods; geopolitical conditions, including acts or threats of terrorism, or actions taken by the United States or other governments in response to acts or threats of terrorism and/or military conflicts, which could impact business and economic conditions in the United States and abroad; the occurrence of significant natural disasters, including severe weather conditions, floods, health related issues or emergencies, and other catastrophic events; the management of risks inherent in the Company’s real estate loan portfolio, and the risk of a prolonged downturn in the real estate market, which could impair the value of loan collateral and the ability to sell collateral upon any foreclosure; the impact of changes in bank regulatory conditions, including laws, regulations and policies concerning capital requirements, deposit insurance premiums, taxes, securities, and the application thereof by regulatory bodies; the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted from time to time by bank regulatory agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other accounting standards setting bodies; competitive pressures among financial services companies, including the timely development of competitive new products and services and the acceptance of these products and services by new and existing customers; the effect of acquisitions and partnerships the Company may make, including, without limitation, the failure to achieve the expected revenue growth and/or expense savings from such acquisitions; the Company’s involvement, from time to time, in legal proceedings and examination and remedial actions by regulators; and potential exposure to fraud, negligence, computer theft and cyber-crime, and the Company’s ability to maintain the security of its data processing and information technology systems. The foregoing factors should not be considered exhaustive and should be read together with other cautionary statements that are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, including those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors,” and in the Company’s other periodic and current reports filed with the SEC. If one or more of the factors affecting our forward-looking information and statements proves incorrect, then our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, forward-looking information and statements contained in this press release. Therefore, the Company cautions you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking information and statements. We will not update the forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in the factors affecting the forward-looking statements. New risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict their occurrence or how they will affect the Company’s operations, financial condition or results of operations._\n\n**FVCBankcorp, Inc.** **Selected Financial Data** **(Dollars in thousands, except share data and per share data)** **(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**At or For the Three months ended,** |

Announces First Quarter 2024 Earnings; Net Interest Income and Margin Improvement\n\nCompany Release - 04/23/2024\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nFAIRFAX, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  FVCBankcorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: FVCB) (the “Company”) today reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2024. \n\n**First Quarter Selected Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Increase in Net Interest Income and Margin**. Net interest margin increased 10 basis points, or 4%, to 2.47% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 2.37% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Net interest income increased $133 thousand to $12.8 million, or 1%, compared to $12.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Interest income increased $176 thousand quarter-over-quarter while interest expense only increased $43 thousand for the same period. \n  * **Strong Credit Quality.** Nonperforming loans totaled $3.0 million at March 31, 2024, or 0.14% of total assets, a decrease of $1.5 million, or 33%, from the year ago quarter ended March 31, 2023. Compared to December 31, 2023, nonperforming loans increased $1.2 million at March 31, 2024. The Company recorded net recoveries of $30 thousand during the first quarter of 2024, or 0.01% of average total loans. \n  * **Prudent Balance Sheet Repositioning**. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company surrendered $48.0 million of its bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”). These policies yielded 2.74% (3.34% on a tax-equivalent basis). This transaction resulted in a nonrecurring increase of $2.4 million to the Company’s tax provisioning related to the gain associated with the cash payout, which is included in the Company’s first quarter earnings. The projected earn-back period is approximately one year. The Company used the proceeds to pay down high cost funding and fund new loan growth. The full impact of the surrender to net interest income will be realized during the second quarter of 2024. \n  * **Strong, Well Capitalized Balance Sheet**. All of FVCbank’s (the “Bank”) regulatory capital components and ratios were well in excess of thresholds required to be considered \"well capitalized\", with total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets of 14.23% at March 31, 2024, compared to 13.83% at December 31, 2023. The tangible common equity (\"TCE\") to total assets (\"TA\") ratio for the Bank increased to 10.30% at March 31, 2024, from 8.92% at March 31, 2023. The Bank’s investment securities are classified as available-for-sale, and therefore the decrease in market value of these securities is fully reflected in the TCE/TA ratio. \n\n\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded net income of $1.3 million, or $0.07 diluted earnings per share, compared to net income of $621 thousand, or $0.03 diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. As a result of the above mentioned repositioning, the quarter ended March 31, 2024 results include additional provision for income taxes totaling $2.4 million related to the cumulative increases in BOLI policy cash values that were taxable upon the policies’ surrender. The results for the three months ended March 31, 2023 included losses from the sale of available-for-sale investment securities totaling $4.6 million ($3.6 million after-tax). \n\nCommercial bank operating earnings (non-GAAP), which exclude the nonrecurring taxes on the surrender of the Company’s BOLI policies, the after-tax losses on the sale of investment securities, office space reduction costs, severance costs and the nonrecurring valuation adjustment of a minority investment, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $3.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively, an increase of $948 thousand. Diluted commercial bank operating earnings per share (non-GAAP) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $0.20 and $0.15, respectively. \n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, pre-tax pre-provision operating income (non-GAAP), which also excludes the nonrecurring taxes on the BOLI surrender, losses on securities sales, office space reduction costs, severance costs and a nonrecurring valuation adjustment for a minority investment was $4.6 million and $3.5 million, respectively, an increase of $1.1 million. \n\nThe Company considers commercial bank operating earnings and pre-tax pre-provision operating income useful comparative financial measures of the Company’s operating performance over multiple periods. Both commercial bank operating earnings and pre-tax pre-provision operating income are determined by methods other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP can be found in the tables below. \n\n**Management Comments**\n\nDavid W. Pijor, Esq., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, said: \n\n“We are pleased that our continued efforts to improve our net interest margin and to decrease noninterest expense are demonstrated in our results for the first quarter of 2024. The surrender of $48.0 million in BOLI, which was only paying the Bank 3.34% on a tax-equivalent basis, will further improve our net interest income and margin going forward. We continue to increase core relationships in our market area, through both the origination of over $42 million in new loans this quarter and $113 million in new non-time deposit accounts. We remain committed to providing personalized client service coupled, with innovative technology which continues to drive new customer relationships through the efforts of our dedicated team of bankers who exemplify our Bank’s core values each day. \n\n**Statement of Condition**\n\nTotal assets were $2.18 billion at March 31, 2024 and $2.19 billion at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $7.9 million. \n\nLoans receivable, net of deferred fees, were $1.85 billion at March 31, 2024 and $1.83 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $24.2 million, or 1%. During the first quarter of 2024, loan originations totaled $41.5 million with a weighted average rate of 8.76% and loan renewals totaled $19.3 million with a weighted average rate of 8.25%. Loans that paid off during the first quarter of 2024 totaled $18.6 million and had a weighted average rate of 7.97%. The Company’s warehouse line with Atlantic Coast Mortgage, LLC (“ACM”) increased $1.3 million during the first quarter of 2024. \n\nInvestment securities were $167.1 million at March 31, 2024 and $171.9 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $4.8 million, or 3%. The decrease in investment securities during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was primarily a result of $2.8 million in principal repayments and a decrease in the market value of the investment securities portfolio totaling $2.0 million. \n\nTotal deposits were $1.86 billion at March 31, 2024 and $1.85 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $12.0 million, or 1%. Noninterest-bearing deposits were $394.1 million at March 31, 2024, or 21.2% of total deposits. At March 31, 2024, core deposits, which exclude wholesale deposits, decreased $2.6 million from December 31, 2023, or less than 1%. As a member of the IntraFi Network, the Bank offers products to its customers who seek to maximize FDIC insurance protection (“reciprocal deposits”). At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, reciprocal deposits totaled $234.8 million and $254.1 million, respectively, and are considered part of the Company’s core deposit base. Time deposits (which exclude wholesale deposits) increased $38.0 million, or 12%, to $344.4 million at March 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023, and were 22% of core deposits at March 31, 2024, representing new and existing customer deposits as customers were looking to fix higher interest rates on their deposit balances. \n\nThe Company continues to have consistent core deposit inflows each quarter, including the first quarter of 2024, with new non-time deposit accounts totaling $112.6 million (which includes $21.0 million in new noninterest-bearing deposits) compared to $116.5 million (which includes $8.3 million in noninterest-bearing deposits) for the fourth quarter of 2023. Title and escrow-related deposits decreased $24.8 million from December 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024, which was primarily attributable to lower title and escrow related activity during the first quarter of 2024. The Company continues to see growth in its new and existing deposit relationships going into the second quarter of 2024. \n\nTotal wholesale funding decreased $13.4 million, or 4%, during the first quarter of 2024. Wholesale funding includes wholesale deposits totaling $259.8 million and other borrowed funds totaling $57.0 million at March 31, 2024. Average wholesale funding totaled $413.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and had a weighted average rate of 4.01%, compared to $331.1 million with a weighted average rate of 3.75% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The Bank used higher-cost short-term wholesale funding sources during the first quarter of 2024 to supplement deposit activity. At March 31, 2024, wholesale funding totaled $316.8 million and had a weighted average rate of 3.54% (including $250 million in pay-fixed/receive-floating interest rate swaps at an average rate of 3.25%). \n\nShareholders’ equity at March 31, 2024 was $220.7 million, an increase of $3.5 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2023. Earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 contributed $1.3 million to the increase in shareholders’ equity. Accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased $1.7 million, which was primarily related to the change in the Company’s other comprehensive income associated with its interest rate swaps at March 31, 2024. \n\nBook value per share at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $12.32 and $12.19, respectively. Tangible book value per share (a non-GAAP financial measure which is defined in the tables below) at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $11.90 and $11.77, respectively. Tangible book value per share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss (a non-GAAP financial measure which is defined in the tables below), at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $13.16 and $13.12, respectively. \n\nThe Bank is well-capitalized at March 31, 2024, with total risk-based capital of 14.23%, common equity tier 1 risk-based capital of 13.18%, and tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.18%. \n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nFor each of the first quarter of 2024 and fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recorded no provision for credit losses, compared to a provision of $242 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) to total loans, net of fees, was 1.02% at March 31, 2024, compared to 1.03% at December 31, 2023. \n\nThe Company has maintained disciplined credit guidelines during the rising interest rate environment. The Company proactively monitors the impact of rising interest rates on its adjustable loans as the industry navigates through this economic cycle of increased inflation and higher interest rates. Nonaccrual loans and loans 90 days or more past due at March 31, 2024 totaled $3.0 million, or 0.14% of total assets, compared to $1.8 million, or 0.08% of total assets, at December 31, 2023. The increase is nonperforming loans for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 is primarily a result of one commercial & industrial loan relationship that was placed on nonaccrual. Watchlist credits decreased to $28.0 million at March 31, 2024, a decrease of $800 thousand from December 31, 2023, as the Company proactivity manages the credit quality of its loan portfolio, including reducing its commercial real estate concentrations, which has resulted in limited credit losses over its history. The Company had no other real estate owned at March 31, 2024. \n\nThe Company recorded net recoveries of $30 thousand during the first quarter of 2024. For each of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the ACL was $18.9 million. ACL coverage to nonperforming loans decreased to 651% at March 31, 2024, compared to 1065% at December 31, 2023 as a result of the $1.2 million increase in nonperforming loans during the first quarter of 2024. \n\nAt March 31, 2024, commercial real estate totaled $1.09 billion, or 59% of total loans, net of fees, and construction loans totaled $155 million, or 8% of total loans, net of fees. Included in commercial real estate are loans secured by office buildings totaling $121.3 million, or 7% of total loans, and retail shopping centers totaling $266.1 million, or 14% of total loans, at March 31, 2024. Multi-family housing totaled $178.2 million, or 10% of total loans, at March 31, 2024.

During its assessment of the allowance for credit losses, the Company addressed the credit risks associated with these portfolio segments and believes that as a result of its conservative underwriting discipline at loan origination and its ongoing loan monitoring procedures, the Company has appropriately reserved for possible credit concerns in the event of a downturn in economic activity. \n\n**Minority Investment in Mortgage Banking Operation**\n\nIn August 2021, the Company acquired a membership interest in ACM to diversify its loan portfolio while providing competitive residential mortgage products to its customers and to generate additional revenue. The Company’s investment in ACM is reflected as a nonconsolidated minority investment, and as such, the Company’s income generated from the investment is included in non-interest income. For the first quarter of 2024, the Company reported a pre-tax loss of $226 thousand compared to a pre-tax loss of $1.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 related to its investment in ACM. ACM management is continuing to evaluate opportunities to further reduce expenses and increase revenues. \n\n**Income Statement**\n\nThe Company recorded net income of $1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to net income of $621 thousand for the same period of 2023. Both first quarter periods were impacted by balance sheet repositioning transactions. Net income for the first quarter of 2024 was impacted by the additional taxes recorded for the surrender of the Company’s BOLI. Excluding this nonrecurring tax assessment, Bank operating earnings (non-GAAP) totaled $3.7 million for the first quarter of 2024. For the first quarter of 2023, net income was impacted by pre-tax losses recorded on the sale of investment securities available-for-sale totaling $4.6 million. Excluding these losses, Bank operating earnings (non-GAAP) totaled $4.2 million for the first quarter of 2023. \n\nNet interest income increased $133 thousand to $12.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, and decreased of $1.2 million, or 9%, compared to the year ago quarter. Compared to the year ago quarter ended March 31, 2023, the decrease in net interest income for the first quarter of 2024 is primarily due to an increase in funding costs, which have increased precipitously as a result of Federal Reserve monetary policy coupled with the need to meet intense competition from market area banks, brokerages and the U.S. Treasury. \n\nThe Company's net interest margin increased 10 basis points to 2.47% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 compared to 2.37% for the linked quarter ended December 31, 2023 and decreased 13 basis points from 2.60% for the year ago quarter ended March 31, 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company surrendered $48.0 million in BOLI, the net proceeds of which was used to replace high cost fundings and fund new loan growth. The full impact of the net proceeds of the BOLI surrender will be realized during the second quarter of 2024 as the Company will have use of the net proceeds for a complete quarter. \n\nTotal interest income increased $1.5 million, or 6%, for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter of 2023. On a linked quarter basis, interest income increased $176 thousand for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Interest income on loans increased $1.9 million, or 8%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023. Compared to the linked quarter, interest income on loans increased $566 thousand, or 2%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily as a result of an increase in average loans and an increase in loan yields. Loan yields increased 8 basis points to 5.50% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2023, and increased 39 basis points compared to the year ago quarter. Yield on earning assets increased 51 basis points to 5.15% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, partially as a result of the balance sheet repositionings completed during 2023 along with the repricing of the Company’s variable rate loan portfolio and new loan originations. \n\nAt March 31, 2024, approximately $353 million, or 24%, of the Company’s commercial loan portfolio is expected to reprice in the next 12 months, an additional 20% will reprice within the following 24-36 months, and 31% will reprice within the next three to five years. In the near term, the Company’s efforts to attain appropriate yields on new originations and the repricing of the commercial loan portfolio are expected to provide improvement in loan yields. \n\nTotal interest expense for each of the three months ended March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $14.0 million, compared to $11.3 million for the year ago quarter ended March 31, 2023. Interest expense on deposits decreased $212 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2023, reflecting the Company’s continued focus on maintaining core deposit pricing. Compared to the year ago quarter ended March 31, 2023, interest expense on deposits increased $3.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The cost of deposits for the first quarter of 2024 was 2.81% compared to 2.78% for the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 3 basis points compared to an increase of 84 basis points from 1.97% for the year-ago fourth quarter. \n\nThe Company’s cumulative deposit beta (calculated comparing the change in deposit interest rates from March 31, 2022 to March 31, 2024 including noninterest-bearing deposits and excluding wholesale deposits) remained at approximately 42% for both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, since the Federal Reserve began increasing short-term interest rates. \n\nNoninterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 totaled $395 thousand compared to a loss of $4.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and a loss of $9.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The losses recorded during the first quarter of 2023 and fourth quarter of 2023 were a result of two balance sheet repositionings whereby the Company sold investment securities available-for-sale for pretax losses of $4.6 million and $11.0 million, respectively. In addition, included in noninterest income for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was a fair value adjustment to a minority investment which increased noninterest income by $1.6 million. The three months ended March 31, 2024 does not have a similar fair value adjustment. \n\nFee income from loans was $49 thousand for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to $77 thousand for the first quarter of 2023. Service charges on deposit accounts totaled $261 thousand for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $215 thousand for the year ago quarter. Income from bank-owned life insurance decreased $142 thousand to $190 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $332 thousand for the same period of 2023, a direct result of the surrendered BOLI that occurred during the first quarter of 2024. \n\nNoninterest expense totaled $8.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $777 thousand, or 8%, compared to $9.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and decreased $385 thousand, or 4%, compared to the year ago quarter. Included in noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2023 is $336 thousand related to office space reductions and severance costs. Excluding the office space reductions and severance costs, noninterest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $8.6 million and $9.1 million, respectively, a decrease of $441 thousand, or 5%. \n\nThe decrease for the first quarter of 2024 was primarily related to salaries and benefits expense which decreased $738 thousand when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, and decreased $484 thousand when compared to the year ago quarter. Salary expense was the main driver for these decreases, a result of reduced staffing and process improvement through the use of technology. Full-time equivalent employees have decreased from 134 at March 31, 2023, and from 118 at December 31, 2023 to 111 at March 31, 2024. \n\nOccupancy expense decreased $105 thousand to $522 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the year ago quarter ended March 31, 2023, primarily as a result of the office space reduction efforts completed during 2023. Internet banking and software expense increased $133 thousand to $694 thousand for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2023, primarily as a result of the implementation of enhanced customer software solutions. Other operating expenses totaled $1.4 million for each of the first quarters of 2024 and 2023 compared to $1.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company continues to identify and assess opportunities to reduce operating expenses. \n\nThe Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $3.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to an income tax benefit of $486 thousand for the same period in 2023. The provision for income taxes for the first quarter of 2024 includes an additional $2.4 million which is associated with the Company’s surrendering of its BOLI policies. \n\n**About FVCBankcorp, Inc.**\n\nFVCBankcorp, Inc. is the holding company for FVCbank, a wholly-owned subsidiary that commenced operations in November 2007.

(Nasdaq: FVCB) (the “Company”) announced today that its Board of Directors has extended its share repurchase program that was initiated in 2020. Under the repurchase program, the Company may repurchase up to 1,300,000 shares of its common stock, or approximately 7% of its outstanding shares of common stock at December 31, 2023. The repurchase program will expire on March 31, 2025, subject to earlier termination of the program by the Board of Directors. \n\nDuring 2023, the Company repurchased 115,750 shares of its common stock during open trading window periods. \n\nRepurchases may be made in open market purchases, block trades or in privately negotiated transactions. Repurchases, if any, under the program will be made at the discretion of management, and will depend upon market pricing and conditions, business, legal, accounting and other considerations. Open market purchases will be conducted in accordance with the limitation of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Repurchases may be made pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with SEC Rule 10b5-1, which would permit common stock to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. Under applicable law, repurchased shares will be cancelled and revert to the status of authorized but unissued shares. \n\nThe repurchase program may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time without notice, in the Company’s discretion, based upon a number of factors, including market conditions, the cost of repurchasing shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, liquidity, the need for capital in the Company’s operations and other factors deemed appropriate. These factors may also affect the timing and amount of share repurchases. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any shares. \n\n**About FVCBankcorp Inc.**\n\nFVCBankcorp, Inc. is the holding company for FVCbank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of FVCB which commenced operations in November 2007.

Announces 2023 Earnings\n\nCompany Release - 01/23/2024\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nFAIRFAX, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  FVCBankcorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: FVCB) (the “Company”) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. \n\n**Fourth Quarter Selected Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Strong Credit Quality.** Nonperforming loans totaled $1.8 million at December 31, 2023, or 0.08% of total assets, a decrease of $2.7 million, or 59%, from the prior year ended December 31, 2022. Net charge-offs of $49 thousand were recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023, or 0.01% of average total loans. \n  * **Prudent Balance Sheet Repositioning.** During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company sold a portion of its investment portfolio totaling $61.4 million of book value available-for-sale securities with a weighted average book yield of 1.54% and a projected earn-back of less than three years. This repositioning resulted in an after-tax loss of $8.5 million. \n  * **Low Uninsured Deposit Metrics Compared to Total Deposits.** As of December 31, 2023, estimated uninsured deposits improved to 31.1% of total deposits from 39.7% at December 31, 2022, when excluding collateralized deposits. The Company has sufficient capital and liquidity resources to satisfy these obligations. \n  * **Diverse Sources of Available Liquidity.** At December 31, 2023, the Company’s liquidity position, which includes cash totaling $60.5 million, unencumbered investment securities of $162.1 million, and available unsecured and secured borrowing capacity totaling $705.1 million, was significantly in excess of its estimated uninsured deposits (excluding collateralized deposits) totaling $574.6 million, or 31.1% of total deposits. \n  * **Strong, Well Capitalized Balance Sheet.** All of FVCbank’s (the “Bank”) regulatory capital components and ratios are well in excess of thresholds required to be considered \"well capitalized\", with total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets of 13.83% at December 31, 2023. The tangible common equity (\"TCE\") to total assets (\"TA\") ratio for the Bank increased to 10.12% at December 31, 2023, from 8.86% at December 31, 2022. The Bank’s investment securities are classified as available-for-sale, and therefore the decrease in market value of these securities is fully reflected in the TCE/TA ratio. \n\n\n\nAs a result of the above mentioned repositioning, the Company recorded a net loss of $5.1 million, or $0.28 diluted loss per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to net income of $4.9 million, or $0.27 diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported net income of $3.8 million, or $0.21 diluted earnings per share, compared to net income of $25.0 million, or $1.35 diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2022. The year ended December 31, 2023 results include after-tax losses of $12.2 million for first quarter 2023 and fourth quarter 2023 securities sale. In addition, the Company reduced its future occupancy expense through a reduction in office space. The Company wrote-off two leases totaling $273,000 during the fourth quarter of 2023 to reduce excess office space and to consolidate two branch locations in Montgomery County, Maryland. Lastly, the Company reduced staffing which resulted in severance costs of $63,000 during the fourth quarter of 2023 and $184,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023. These initiatives reduce operating expenses in 2024 by over $1.0 million. \n\nCommercial bank operating earnings, which exclude losses on the above-noted securities sales, office space reduction costs, severance costs, and 2022 merger-related expenses, all net of tax, for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 were $3.8 million and $4.0 million, respectively, a decrease of $280 thousand. Diluted commercial bank operating earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 were $0.21 and $0.22, respectively. For the linked quarter ended September 30, 2023, commercial bank operating earnings included after-tax reversal of provision for credit losses totaling $569 thousand. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, commercial bank operating earnings were $16.3 million and $25.1 million, respectively. Diluted commercial bank operating earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $0.90 and $1.36, respectively. \n\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, pre-tax pre-provision operating income (which also excludes losses on securities sales, office space reduction costs and severance costs) was $4.7 million and $4.5 million, respectively, an increase of $206 thousand. \n\nThe Company considers commercial bank operating earnings and pre-tax pre-provision operating income useful comparative financial measures of the Company’s operating performance over multiple periods. Both commercial bank operating earnings and pre-tax pre-provision operating income are determined by methods other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP can be found in the tables below. \n\n**Management Comments**\n\nDavid W. Pijor, Esq., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, said: \n\n“2023 was a challenging year for financial institutions, including FVCbank. Our commitment to sound strategic banking and serving our clients are and will always be our top priorities. We successfully implemented a new digital banking platform in early 2023, enhancing our client offerings and improving operating efficiencies. We continue to lend to businesses in our market area through our disciplined credit culture as evidenced by our historically low credit losses. The balance sheet repositionings and our focus on our operating structure will improve profitability and efficiencies going into 2024. We are well positioned to create shareholder value and will remain focused on client service, quality core growth, expense discipline, and strategic balance sheet management.” \n\n**Statement of Condition**\n\nTotal assets were $2.19 billion at December 31, 2023 and $2.34 billion at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $153.7 million, or 7%. This decrease was a result of the Company’s strategic balance sheet management which was focused on repositioning the balance sheet through two investment securities restructurings and reducing its reliance on wholesale funding to limit funding costs. \n\nLoans receivable, net of deferred fees, were $1.83 billion at December 31, 2023 and $1.84 billion at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $11.9 million, or 0.6%. Compared to September 30, 2023, loans receivable, net of deferred fees, decreased $20.9 million, or 1%, from $1.85 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2023, new commercial loan originations totaled $15.4 million with a weighted average rate of 8.32% and repayments of loans totaled $52.2 million with a weighted average rate of 7.29%. Commercial line activity, which has a weighted average rate 8.69%, increased $26.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. Commercial construction loans paid down $6.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company’s warehouse line with Atlantic Coast Mortgage, LLC (“ACM”) decreased $4.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. During the first three weeks of January 2024, the Company originated and funded $29.4 million in new commercial loans that were expected to close prior to year-end. \n\nInvestment securities were $171.9 million at December 31, 2023 and $278.3 million at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $106.5 million, or 38%. Investment securities decreased $44.6 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of a second balance sheet restructuring whereby the Company sold $61.4 million in book value available-for-sale securities with a weighted average book yield of 1.54%. Offsetting this quarterly decrease was an improvement in the market value of the investment securities portfolio totaling $21.8 million. The Company previously sold $40.3 million in book value available-for-sale securities during February 2023 to de-leverage its balance sheet and invest funds in higher yielding assets. \n\nTotal deposits were $1.85 billion at December 31, 2023 and $1.83 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $15.1 million, or 1%. Noninterest-bearing deposits were $396.7 million at December 31, 2023, or 21.5% of total deposits. At December 31, 2023, core deposits, which exclude wholesale deposits, increased $17.9 million from December 31, 2022, or 1%. As a member of the IntraFi Network, the Bank offers products to its customers who seek to maximize FDIC insurance protection (“reciprocal deposits”). At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, reciprocal deposits totaled $254.1 million and $117.6 million, respectively, and are considered part of the Company’s core deposit base. Time deposits (which exclude wholesale deposits) increased $45.9 million, or 18%, to $306.3 million at December 31, 2023 from December 31, 2022, and were 19% of core deposits at December 31, 2023, representing new and existing customer deposits as customers were looking to fix interest rates on their deposit balances. \n\nThe Company has had consistent core deposit inflows over the last several quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2023, with new non-time deposit accounts totaling $116.5 million (which includes $8.3 million in new noninterest-bearing deposits) compared to $200 million (which includes $7.6 million in noninterest-bearing deposits) for the third quarter of 2023. Title and escrow-related deposits decreased $69.1 million from September 30, 2023 to December 31, 2023 which was primarily attributable to a few large commercial transactions that settled prior to year-end. Deposits from municipalities decreased $20.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2023 due to time deposit maturities and the repricing of these collateralized deposits were at premium interest rates. The Company maintains a growing deposit pipeline headed into the first quarter of 2024. \n\nTotal wholesale funding (which includes wholesale deposits and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (“FHLB”) decreased $182.7 million, or 36%, during 2023. Wholesale funding, which totaled $330.3 million at December 31, 2023, carried a weighted average rate of 3.62% including $250 million in pay-fixed/receive-floating interest rate swaps at an average rate of 3.25%. Wholesale deposits decreased $2.7 million to $245.3 million during 2023 and FHLB advances decreased $180.0 million during 2023. \n\nShareholders’ equity at December 31, 2023 was $217.1 million, an increase of $14.7 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2022. Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2023 contributed $3.8 million to the increase in shareholders’ equity. As a result of the Company’s adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-13 (“CECL”) on January 1, 2023, retained earnings decreased $2.8 million. In addition, during the first six months of 2023, the Company repurchased 115,750 of its common shares at an average price of $12.51 (including commissions) in accordance with its approved share repurchase program, reducing shareholders’ equity $1.4 million during 2023. Accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased $12.4 million, which was related to the improvement in other comprehensive income associated with the Company’s investment portfolio and losses recorded from the sale of investment securities during 2023. \n\nBook value per share at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $12.19 and $11.58, respectively. Tangible book value per share (a non-GAAP financial measure which is defined in the tables below) at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $11.77 and $11.14, respectively. Tangible book value per share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss (a non-GAAP financial measure which is defined in the tables below), at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $13.12 and $13.23, respectively. \n\nThe Bank is well-capitalized at December 31, 2023, with total risk-based capital of 13.83%, common equity tier 1 risk-based capital of 12.80%, and tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.77%. \n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nThe Company adopted CECL on January 1, 2023 in accordance with the required implementation date, and recorded the impact of the adoption to retained earnings, net of deferred income taxes, as required by the accounting standard. Note that prior to the adoption of CECL, the Company utilized an incurred loss model to derive its best estimate of the allowance for credit losses. Reserves for credit losses increased $3.7 million and consisted of increases to the allowance for credit losses on loans as well as the Company's reserve for unfunded commitments (referred to in combination herein as “ACL”). For the fourth quarter of 2023 and year ended December 31, 2023, subsequent to the aforementioned adoption, the Company recorded no provision for credit losses and $132 thousand, respectively, compared to a provision of $729 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and a provision of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The ACL to total loans, net of fees, was 1.06% at December 31, 2023, compared to 0.87% at December 31, 2022. \n\nThe Company has maintained disciplined credit guidelines during the rising interest rate environment. The Company proactively monitors the impact of rising interest rates on its adjustable loans as the industry navigates through this economic cycle of increased inflation and higher interest rates. Certain credit quality metrics improved during 2023 as nonperforming loans and loans 90 days or more past due at December 31, 2023 totaled $1.8 million, or 0.08% of total assets, compared to $4.5 million, or 0.19%, of total assets at December 31, 2022. Watchlist credits increased to $28.8 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of $14.3 million from December 31, 2022, as the Company proactivity manages the credit quality of its loan portfolio, including reducing its commercial real estate concentrations, which has resulted in limited credit losses over its history. The Company had no other real estate owned. \n\nThe Company recorded net charge-offs of $49 thousand during the fourth quarter of 2023 and $375 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2023. The ACL (which includes the reserve for unfunded commitments) at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, was $19.5 million and $16.0 million, respectively. ACL coverage to nonperforming loans increased to 1065% at December 31, 2023, compared to 357% at December 31, 2022 as a result of the Company’s improved credit quality and adoption of CECL. \n\nCommercial real estate and construction loans totaled $1.24 billion, or 68% of total loans, net of fees, at December 31, 2023. The commercial real estate portfolio, including construction loans, is diversified by asset type and geographic concentration. The Company manages this portion of the portfolio in a disciplined manner, and has comprehensive policies to monitor, measure and mitigate its loan concentrations within this portfolio segment, including rigorous credit approval, monitoring and administrative practices. Included in commercial real estate are loans secured by office buildings totaling $92.9 million, or 5% of total loans, and retail shopping centers totaling $264.0 million, or 14% of total loans, at December 31, 2023. Multi-family commercial properties totaled $178.6 million, or 10% of total loans, at December 31, 2023. The following table provides further stratification of these and additional asset classes at December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands). \n\n**Owner Occupied Commercial Real Estate** |  **Non-Owner Occupied Commercial Real Estate** |  **Construction**  \n---|---|---  \n**Asset Class** |  **Average** **Loan-to-** **Value (1)** |  **Number** **of Total** **Loans** |  **Bank Owned** **Principal (2)** |  **Average** **Loan-to-** **Value (1)** |  **Number** **of Total** **Loans** |  **Bank Owned** **Principal (2)** |  **Top 3 Geographic Concentration** |  **Number of** **Total Loans** |  **Bank Owned** **Principal (2)** |  **Total Bank** **Owned** **Principal (2)** |  **% of Total** **Loans**  \nOffice, Class A |  70%  |  6  |  $  |  7,558  |  47%  |  4  |  $  |  3,776  |  Counties of Fairfax and Loudoun, Virginia and Montgomery County, Maryland  |  0  |  $  |  -  |  $  |  11,334   \nOffice, Class B |  46%  |  35  |  13,751  |  47%  |  31  |  61,323  |  -  |  -  |  75,074   \nOffice, Class C |  52%  |  7  |  3,793  |  41%  |  8  |  1,953  |  1  |  780  |  6,526   \n**Subtotal** |  **48** |  **$** |  **25,102** |  **43** |  **$** |  **67,052** |  **1** |  **$** |  **780** |  **$** |  **92,934** |  **5%**  \nRetail- Neighborhood/Community Shop |  -  |  $  |  -  |  44%  |  31  |  $  |  84,627  |  Prince George's County, Maryland, Fairfax County, Virginia and Washington, D.C.  |  2  |  $  |  10,944  |  $  |  95,571   \nRetail- Restaurant |  57%  |  9  |  8,183  |  45%  |  16  |  26,931  |  -  |  -  |  35,114   \nRetail- Single Tenant |  59%  |  5  |  2,001  |  42%  |  20  |  36,255  |  -  |  -  |  38,256   \nRetail- Anchored, Other |  71%  |  1  |  2,046  |  53%  |  12  |  41,572  |  -  |  -  |  43,618   \nRetail- Grocery-anchored |  0  |  -  |  46%  |  8  |  50,154  |  1  |  1,264  |  51,418   \n**Subtotal** |  **15** |  **$** |  **12,230** |  **87** |  **$** |  **239,539** |  **4** |  **$** |  **12,208** |  **$** |  **263,977** |  **14%**  \nMulti-family, Class A (Market) |  -  |  $  |  -  |  27%  |  1  |  $  |  -  |  Washington, D.C., Baltimore City, Maryland and Arlington County, Virginia  |  1  |  $  |  729  |  $  |  729   \nMulti-family, Class B (Market) |  -  |  -  |  63%  |  21  |  78,559  |  -  |  -  |  78,559   \nMulti-family, Class C (Market) |  -  |  -  |  57%  |  57  |  71,902  |  2  |  6,816  |  78,718   \nMulti-Family-Affordable Housing |  -  |  -  |  53%  |  10  |  16,524  |  1  |  4,075  |  20,599   \n**Subtotal** |  **-** |  **$** |  **-** |  **89** |  **$** |  **166,985** |  **4** |  **$** |  **11,620** |  **$** |  **178,605** |  **10%**  \nIndustrial |  52%  |  43  |  $  |  70,267  |  50%  |  38  |  $  |  128,238  |  Prince William County, Virginia, Fairfax County, Virginia and Howard County, Maryland  |  **1** |  $  |  269  |  $  |  198,774   \nWarehouse |  52%  |  14  |  18,761  |  33%  |  10  |  11,557  |  -  |  -  |  30,318   \nFlex |  51%  |  15  |  18,727  |  54%  |  14  |  56,531  |  2  |  -  |  75,258   \n**Subtotal** |  **72** |  **$** |  **107,755** |  **62** |  **$** |  **196,326** |  **3** |  **$** |  **269** |  304,350  |  **17%**  \nHotels |  **-** |  $  |  -  |  43%  |  9  |  $  |  52,588  |  1  |  $  |  6,410  |  58,998  |  3%   \nMixed Use |  47%  |  10  |  $  |  6,174  |  61%  |  37  |  $  |  68,489  |  0  |  $  |  -  |  74,663  |  4%   \nOther (including net deferred costs) |  $  |  61,628  |  $  |  87,765  |  $  |  116,711  |  $  |  266,104  |  **15%**  \n**Total commercial real estate and construction loans, net of fees, at December 31, 2023** |  **$** |  **212,889** |  **$** |  **878,744** |  **$** |  **147,998** |  **$** |  **1,239,631** |  **68%**  \n(1) Loan-to-value is determined at origination date against current bank-owned principal.  \n(2) Bank-owned principal is not adjusted for deferred fees and costs.  \n(3) Minimum debt service coverage policy is 1.30x for Owner Occupied and 1.25x for Non-Owner Occupied at origination.  \n  \nThe loans shown in the above table exhibit strong credit quality, reflecting only one classified delinquency at December 31, 2023 which totaled $851 thousand with a specific reserve of $187 thousand. During its assessment of the allowance for credit losses, the Company addressed the credit risks associated with these portfolio segments and believes that as a result of its conservative underwriting discipline at loan origination and its ongoing loan monitoring procedures, the Company has appropriately reserved for possible credit concerns in the event of a downturn in economic activity. \n\n**Minority Investment in Mortgage Banking Operation**\n\nIn August 2021, the Company acquired a membership interest in ACM to diversify its loan portfolio while providing competitive residential mortgage products to its customers and to generate additional revenue. The Company’s investment in ACM is reflected as a nonconsolidated minority investment, and as such, the Company’s income generated from the investment is included in non-interest income. For the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company reported a pre-tax loss of $1.3 million compared to a pre-tax loss of $1.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 related to its investment in ACM. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, pre-tax losses attributable to its investment in ACM totaled $2.8 million and $659 thousand, respectively. ACM management is continuing to evaluate and look for opportunities to further reduce spend and increase revenue where possible. \n\n**Income Statement**\n\nThe Company recorded a net loss of $5.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to net income of $4.9 million for the same period of 2022. The net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 includes the Company’s portion of losses from its membership interest in ACM, which was $1.3 million pre-tax, compared to a pre-tax loss of $1.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, in addition to losses from securities sales during the fourth quarter of 2023 totaling $11.0 million. Excluding securities sales, office reduction costs and severance costs, bank operating earnings (non-GAAP) totaled $3.8 million net of taxes for the fourth quarter of 2023. \n\nInterest income on loans increased $3.3 million, or 15%, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period of 2022. Compared to the linked quarter, interest income on loans decreased $494 thousand, or 2%, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of a decrease in average loans. The increase in interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ago quarter was primarily related to an increase in loan yields, which increased 51 basis points, and the volume of average loans, which increased $80.2 million. On a linked quarter basis, the yield on average loans receivable increased by 2 basis points to 5.42%. \n\nAt December 31, 2023, approximately $308 million, or 21%, of the Company’s commercial loan portfolio is expected to reprice during 2024, an additional 19% will reprice within 24-36 months, and 29% will reprice within the next three to five years. The repricing of the commercial loan portfolio will improve loan yields in future periods. \n\nInterest expense on deposits increased $6.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period of 2022, and decreased $1.0 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting the impact of the Company’s decreased reliance on wholesale deposits compared to the previous quarter. The cost of deposits for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 2.78% compared to 2.71% for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 7 basis points, and an increase of 149 basis points from 1.29% for the year-ago fourth quarter. \n\nNet interest income totaled $12.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $676 thousand, or 5%, compared to the third quarter of 2023, and a decrease of $3.2 million, or 20%, compared to the year ago quarter. Compared to the year ago quarter ended December 31, 2022, the decrease in net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2023 is primarily due to an increase in funding costs, which have increased precipitously as a result of Federal Reserve monetary policy coupled with the need to meet intense competition from market area banks, brokerages and the U.S. Treasury. \n\nThe Company's net interest margin decreased less than 1% to 2.37% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2.39% for the linked quarter ended September 30, 2023 and decreased from 2.96% for the year ago quarter ended December 31, 2022. The Company continues to consider possible balance sheet strategies to improve net interest margin in future periods. The Company’s net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was 2.49% and 3.19%, respectively. \n\nThe Company’s cycle-to-date deposit beta (calculated comparing the change in deposit interest rates from March 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 including noninterest-bearing deposits and excluding wholesale deposits) is approximately 42% over the past cycle since the Federal Reserve began increasing short-term interest rates. \n\nBelow is a table illustrating the Company’s quarterly loan and deposit betas from the second quarter of 2022 through the fourth quarter of 2023. \n\n** Loan & Deposit Betas (vs. Fed Funds Effective) **  \n---  \n** 3Q22 ** |  ** 4Q22 ** |  ** 1Q23 ** |  ** 2Q23 ** |  ** 3Q23 ** |  ** 4Q23 ** |  ** Cycle-to-Date (1) **  \n**Fed Funds Effective (average)** |  **2.19** |  **%** |  **3.65** |  **%** |  **4.52** |  **%** |  **4.99** |  **%** |  **5.26** |  **%** |  **5.33** |  **%**  \n** Deposit Costs **  \nInterest Bearing Deposits - excluding wholesale |  0.88  |  %  |  1.65  |  %  |  2.39  |  %  |  2.88  |  %  |  3.32  |  %  |  3.46  |  %   \nWholesale Deposits |  0.88  |  %  |  2.38  |  %  |  3.56  |  %  |  3.89  |  %  |  3.86  |  %  |  3.91  |  %   \nTotal Deposits |  0.64  |  %  |  1.29  |  %  |  1.97  |  %  |  2.40  |  %  |  2.74  |  %  |  2.78  |  %   \nTotal Deposits - excluding wholesale |  0.63  |  %  |  1.20  |  %  |  1.71  |  %  |  2.07  |  %  |  2.48  |  %  |  2.62  |  %   \n** Quarterly Beta **  \nInterest Bearing Deposits |  20  |  %  |  53  |  %  |  86  |  %  |  104  |  %  |  163  |  %  |  200  |  %  |  55  |  %   \nWholesale Deposits |  64  |  %  |  103  |  %  |  137  |  %  |  70  |  %  |  -11  |  %  |  71  |  %  |  65  |  %   \nTotal Deposits |  16  |  %  |  44  |  %  |  79  |  %  |  91  |  %  |  126  |  %  |  57  |  %  |  45  |  %   \nTotal Deposits - excluding wholesale |  15  |  %  |  39  |  %  |  59  |  %  |  76  |  %  |  152  |  %  |  200  |  %  |  42  |  %   \n** Loan Yields **  \nLoans (excluding net accretion) |  4.41  |  %  |  4.75  |  %  |  4.91  |  %  |  5.15  |  %  |  5.27  |  %  |  5.31  |  %   \nAs reported |  4.64  |  %  |  4.91  |  %  |  5.11  |  %  |  5.35  |  %  |  5.40  |  %  |  5.42  |  %   \n** Quarterly Beta **  \nLoans (excluding net accretion) |  18  |  %  |  23  |  %  |  18  |  %  |  51  |  %  |  46  |  %  |  47  |  %  |  25  |  %   \n(1) Cycle-to-date reflects changes since first quarter of 2022 and incorporates the increases in the average Fed Funds effective rate.  \n  \nThe Company recorded noninterest income as a loss of $9.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 compared to income of $225 thousand for the linked quarter ended September 30, 2023 and a loss of $10 thousand for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The loss associated with the Company’s investment in ACM was $1.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to a loss of $650 thousand for the linked quarter ended September 30, 2023 and a loss of $1.4 million for the year ago quarter ended December 31, 2022. The losses recorded for ACM for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023 were offset by income recorded from other holding company investments totaling $1.6 million. \n\nFee income from loans was $35 thousand for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $74 thousand for the fourth quarter of 2022. Service charges on deposit accounts and other fee income totaled $385 thousand for the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $38 thousand from the year ago quarter. Income from bank-owned life insurance increased $29 thousand to $385 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $356 thousand for the same period of 2022. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded noninterest income as a loss of $13.4 million, which was primarily associated with its securities sales transactions executed during the first and fourth quarters of 2023, compared to noninterest income of $2.8 million for the comparable period of 2022. During 2023, the Company recorded a loss of $15.6 million related to its sales of available-for-sale investment securities as part of the Company's balance sheet repositioning strategy. The loss associated with the Company’s investment in ACM was $2.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to a loss of $659 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. \n\nNoninterest expense totaled $9.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 compared to $9.2 million for the same three-month period of 2022, an increase of $200 thousand, or 2%. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense increased $354 thousand, or 4%, from $9.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase for the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily related to office space reduction costs of $273 thousand and severance costs of $63 thousand as the Company continues to evaluate its overhead expenses. Salaries and benefits expense remained at $5.3 million for each of the quarters ended December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, and was $5.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The maintenance of salaries and benefits expense at this level is a result of the Company’s continued expense management including process improvement through the use of technology. \n\nInternet banking and software expense increased $226 thousand to $701 thousand for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of the implementation of enhanced customer software solutions. Other operating expenses totaled $1.2 million for each of the third and fourth quarters of 2023 compared to $1.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company continues to identify and assess opportunities to reduce operating expenses including analysis of its branch and office locations. \n\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, noninterest expense was $36.7 million and $34.5 million, respectively, an increase of $2.2 million, or 6%, primarily as a result of the aforementioned increases in internet banking and software expense and state franchise taxes. \n\nThe Company recorded a benefit for income taxes of $1.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to a provision for income taxes of $1.0 million for the same period in 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, provision for income tax expense was $410 thousand and $6.0 million, respectively. \n\n**About FVCBankcorp, Inc.**\n\nFVCBankcorp, Inc. is the holding company for FVCbank, a wholly-owned subsidiary that commenced operations in November 2007.

Actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those contemplated, expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause our financial performance to differ materially from that expressed in such forward-looking statements: general business and economic conditions, including higher inflation and its impacts, nationally or in the markets that the Company serves could adversely affect, among other things, real estate valuations, unemployment levels, the ability of businesses to remain viable, consumer and business confidence and consumer and business spending, which could lead to decreases in demand for loans, deposits, and other financial services that the Company provides and increases in loan delinquencies and defaults; the risk of changes in interest rates on levels, composition and costs of deposits, loan demand, and the values and liquidity of loan collateral, securities, and interest sensitive assets and liabilities; changes in the Company’s liquidity requirements could be adversely affected by changes in its assets and liabilities; changes in the assumptions underlying the establishment of reserves for possible credit losses; changes in market conditions, specifically declines in the commercial and residential real estate market, volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, and soundness of other financial institutions we do business with; risks inherent in making loans such as repayment risks and fluctuating collateral values; the Company’s investment securities portfolio is subject to credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk as well as changes in the estimates used to value the securities in the portfolio; the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, inflation, interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations; declines in the Company's common stock price or the occurrence of what management would deem to be a triggering event that could, under certain circumstances, cause us to record a noncash impairment charge to earnings in future periods; the strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which we conduct operations; geopolitical conditions, including acts or threats of terrorism, or actions taken by the United States or other governments in response to acts or threats of terrorism and/or military conflicts, which could impact business and economic conditions in the United States and abroad; the occurrence of significant natural disasters, including severe weather conditions, floods, health related issues, and other catastrophic events; our management of risks inherent in our real estate loan portfolio, and the risk of a prolonged downturn in the real estate market, which could impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell collateral upon any foreclosure; changes in consumer spending and savings habits; technological and social media changes; changing bank regulatory conditions, policies or programs, whether arising as new legislation or regulatory initiatives, that could lead to restrictions on activities of banks generally, or our subsidiary bank in particular, more restrictive regulatory capital requirements, increased costs, including deposit insurance premiums, regulation or prohibition of certain income producing activities or changes in the secondary market for loans and other products; the impact of changes in financial services policies, laws and regulations, including laws, regulations and policies concerning taxes, banking, securities and insurance, and the application thereof by regulatory bodies; the impact of changes in laws, regulations and policies affecting the real estate industry; the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted from time to time by bank regulatory agencies, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other accounting standards setting bodies; the timely development of competitive new products and services and the acceptance of these products and services by new and existing customers; the willingness of users to substitute competitors’ products and services for our products and services; the effect of acquisitions we may make, including, without limitation, the failure to achieve the expected revenue growth and/or expense savings from such acquisitions; changes in the level of our nonperforming assets and charge-offs; our involvement, from time to time, in legal proceedings and examination and remedial actions by regulators; and potential exposure to fraud, negligence, computer theft and cyber-crime. The foregoing factors should not be considered exhaustive and should be read together with other cautionary statements that are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, including those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors,” and in the Company’s other periodic and current reports filed with the SEC. If one or more of the factors affecting our forward-looking information and statements proves incorrect, then our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, forward-looking information and statements contained in this press release. Therefore, we caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking information and statements. We will not update the forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in the factors affecting the forward-looking statements. New risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict their occurrence or how they will affect us._\n\n**FVCBankcorp, Inc.**  \n---  \n**Selected Financial
