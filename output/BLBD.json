Market demand for Blue Bird buses remains very strong with a 16 percent increase in orders over last year and more than 4,800 units in our order backlog. Unit sales were up 6% from last year, revenue grew by 19% to $1.35 billion, and Adjusted EBITDA hit a record $183 million with a 13.6% margin. That’s an outstanding 6 percentage point growth in margin from just a year ago. \n\n“In our push to expand our leadership in alternative-powered school buses, we delivered over 700 electric-powered buses this year, nearly 30% more than last year. We also saw strong growth in EV orders from the EPA’s Clean School Bus Program, ending the year with over 630 EV orders in our backlog, representing an impressive 13% mix of our total backlog. Following the nearly $1 billion funding from Round 1 of the $5 billion Clean School Bus Program, we’re excited for new EV orders over the next few quarters from Rounds 2 and 3, which provide almost $2 billion in new funding. These buses need to be delivered by mid-2026 calendar year, and we’re working aggressively with our dealers, school districts and fleets to support deliveries. \n\n“With an all-time record performance in fiscal 2024, substantially above last year, we have significant momentum and look forward to sustained profitable growth in the coming years.” \n\n** FY2025 Guidance Increased and Long-Term Outlook Raised **\n\n“We are very pleased with the fiscal 2024 results, with the highest ever Revenue, Adj. EBITDA and Net Income,” said Razvan Radulescu, CFO of Blue Bird Corporation. “Our business transformation continues to yield great results, and ahead of the plan we have been messaging. We are updating our fiscal 2025 full-year guidance for Net Revenue to $1.4 -1.5 Billion, Adj. EBITDA to $190-210 million (13.6% - 14.0% margin) and Adj. Free Cash Flow to $40-60 million, which includes ~$50 million of extraordinary CAPEX related to expansion of our manufacturing footprint. Additionally, we are raising our long-term profit outlook towards an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 15%+ on ~$2 billion in Revenue.” \n\n** Fiscal 2024 ** ** Fourth Quarter Results **\n\n_Net Sales_\n\nNet sales were $350.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, an increase of $47.2 million, or 15.6%, from the fourth quarter of last year. Bus sales increased $45.8 million, primarily due to a 16.5% increase in units booked. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, 2,466 units were booked compared with 2,116 units booked for the same period in fiscal 2023. The increase in units sold was primarily due to customer and product mix changes, as well as slight improvements in supply chain constraints impacting the Company's ability to produce and deliver buses due to shortages of critical components during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the same period in fiscal 2023. Additionally, Parts sales increased $1.4 million, or 5.6%, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. This increase is primarily attributed to price increases, driven by ongoing inflationary pressures, as well as higher fulfillment volumes and slight variations due to product and channel mix. \n\n_Gross Profit_\n\nFourth quarter gross profit of $59.6 million represented an increase of $9.6 million from the fourth quarter of last year. The increase was primarily driven by the $47.2 million increase in net sales, discussed above, and partially offset by an increase of $37.6 million in cost of goods sold. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by increase in units booked, discussed above. \n\n_Net Income_\n\nNet income was $24.7 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, which was a $6.0 million increase from the fourth quarter of last year. The increase was primarily driven by the $9.6 million increase in gross profit, discussed above. \n\n_Adjusted Net Income_\n\nAdjusted net income was $25.8 million, representing an increase of $4.5 million compared with the same period last year, primarily due to the $6.0 million increase in net income, discussed above. \n\n_Adjusted EBITDA_\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $41.3 million, which was an increase of $0.6 million compared with the fourth quarter last year. \n\n** Fiscal 2024 Full Year Results **\n\n_Net Sales_\n\nNet sales were $1,347.2 million for the twelve months ended September 28, 2024 (\"fiscal 2024\"), an increase of $214.4 million, or 18.9%, compared with the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 (\"fiscal 2023\"). Bus sales increased $208.3 million, or 20.1%, reflecting a 13.6% increase in average sales price per unit, primarily driven by pricing actions taken by management in response to increased inventory purchase costs, and a 5.7% increase in units booked. There were 9,000 units booked in fiscal 2024 compared with 8,514 units booked during fiscal 2023. The increase in units sold was primarily due to product and customer mix changes as well as slight improvements in supply chain constraints impacting the Company's ability to produce and deliver buses due to shortages of critical components during fiscal 2024 relative to fiscal 2023. Parts sales increased $6.1 million, or 6.2%, for the twelve months ended September 28, 2024 compared with the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is primarily attributed to price increases, driven by ongoing inflationary pressures, as well as higher fulfillment volumes and slight variations due to product and channel mix. \n\n_Gross Profit_\n\nGross profit for fiscal 2024 was $256.2 million, an increase of $117.3 million compared to fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the $214.4 million increase in net sales, discussed above. This was partially offset by an increase of $97.1 million in cost of goods sold, primarily driven by the 5.7% increase in units booked and increased inventory costs, as the average cost of goods sold per unit for fiscal 2024 was 4.2% higher compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to product and mix changes as well as increases in manufacturing costs attributable to a) increased raw materials costs resulting from ongoing inflationary pressures and b) ongoing supply chain disruptions that resulted in higher purchase costs for components. \n\n_Net Income_\n\nNet income was $105.5 million for fiscal 2024, which was an $81.7 million increase from fiscal 2023. The increase in net income was primarily driven by the $117.3 million increase in gross profit, discussed above. This was partially offset by a corresponding $24.3 million increase in income tax expense. \n\n_Adjusted Net Income_\n\nAdjusted net income for fiscal 2024 was $115.3 million, an increase of $80.8 million compared with fiscal 2023, primarily due to the $81.7 million increase in net income, discussed above. \n\n_Adjusted EBITDA_\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $182.9 million for fiscal 2024, an increase of $95.0 million compared with fiscal 2023. This is primarily due to the $81.7 million increase in net income, discussed above, and the corresponding $24.3 million increase in income tax expense. Among other smaller offsetting items, these increases were partially offset by the $10.5 million decrease in net interest expense, primarily due to a decrease in the stated term loan interest rate from 10.0% at September 30, 2023 to 6.9% at September 28, 2024, as well as lower outstanding borrowings during fiscal 2024 when compared with fiscal 2023. \n\n** Conference Call Details **\n\nBlue Bird will discuss its fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 results in a conference call at 4:30 PM ET today.

Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are financial metrics that are utilized by management and the board of directors, as and when applicable, to determine (a) the annual cash bonus payouts, if any, to be made to certain employees based upon the terms of the Company’s Management Incentive Plan, and (b) whether the performance criteria have been met for the vesting of certain equity awards granted annually to certain members of management based upon the terms of the Company’s Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan. Additionally, consolidated EBITDA, which is an adjusted EBITDA metric defined by our Amended Credit Agreement that could differ from Adjusted EBITDA discussed above as the adjustments to the calculations are not uniform, is used to determine the Company's ongoing compliance with several financial covenant requirements, including being utilized in the denominator of the calculation of the Total Net Leverage Ratio. Accordingly, management views these non-GAAP financial metrics as key for the above purposes and as a useful way to evaluate the performance of our operations as discussed further below. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or loss prior to interest income; interest expense including the component of operating lease expense (which is presented as a single operating expense in selling, general and administrative expenses in our U.S. GAAP financial statements) that represents interest expense on lease liabilities; income taxes; and depreciation and amortization including the component of operating lease expense (which is presented as a single operating expense in selling, general and administrative expenses in our U.S. GAAP financial statements) that represents amortization charges on right-of-use lease assets; as adjusted for certain non-cash charges or credits that we may record on a recurring basis such as share-based compensation expense and unrealized gains or losses on certain derivative financial instruments; net gains or losses on the disposal of assets as well as certain charges such as (i) significant product design changes; (ii) transaction related costs; or (iii) discrete expenses related to major cost cutting and/or operational transformation initiatives. While certain of the charges that are added back in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation, such as transaction related costs and operational transformation and major product redesign initiatives, represent operating expenses that may be recorded in more than one annual period, the significant project or transaction giving rise to such expenses is not considered to be indicative of the Company’s normal operations. Accordingly, we believe that these, as well as the other credits and charges that comprise the amounts utilized in the determination of Adjusted EBITDA described above, should not be used in evaluating the Company’s ongoing annual operating performance. \n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measures of performance defined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The measures are used as a supplement to U.S. GAAP results in evaluating certain aspects of our business, as described below. \n\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share are useful to investors in evaluating our performance because the measures consider the performance of our ongoing operations, excluding decisions made with respect to capital investment, financing, and certain other significant initiatives or transactions as outlined in the preceding paragraph. We believe the non-GAAP measures offer additional financial metrics that, when coupled with the GAAP results and the reconciliation to GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of our results of operations and the factors and trends affecting our business. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share should not be considered as alternatives to net income or GAAP earnings per share as an indicator of our performance or as alternatives to any other measure prescribed by GAAP as there are limitations to using such non-GAAP measures. Although we believe the non-GAAP measures may enhance an evaluation of our operating performance based on recent revenue generation and product/overhead cost control because they exclude the impact of prior decisions made about capital investment, financing, and other expenses, (i) other companies in Blue Bird’s industry may define Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share differently than we do and, as a result, they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in Blue Bird’s industry, and (ii) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share exclude certain financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. \n\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing disclosure of the differences between Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share and GAAP results, including providing a reconciliation to GAAP results, to enable investors to perform their own analysis of our operating results. \n\nOur measures of “Free Cash Flow” and \"Adjusted Free Cash Flow\" are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow reflect an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. \n\nWe define Free Cash Flow as total cash provided by/used in operating activities as adjusted for net cash paid for the acquisition of fixed assets and intangible assets. We use Free Cash Flow, and ratios based on Free Cash Flow, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since purchases of fixed assets and intangible assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. \n\n** Forward Looking Statements **\n\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements relate to expectations for future financial performance, business strategies or expectations for our business.

Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. The factors described above, as well as risk factors described in reports filed with the SEC by us (available at

These\nforward-looking statements relate to expectations for future financial performance, business strategies or expectations for our business. Specifically, forward-looking\nstatements include statements regarding guidance, seasonality, product mix and gross profits and may include statements relatingto:\nIntroductions & Forward-Looking Statements\n• Inherent limitations of internal controls impacting financial statements • Volatility in the tax base and other funding sources that support the purchase of buses by\nour end customers\n• Growth opportunities\n• Lower or higher than anticipated market acceptance for our products\n• Future profitability\n• Other statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words “estimate,” “plan,”\n• Ability to expand market share\n“project,” “forecast,” “intend,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “target” or similar\n• Customer demand for certain products expressions\nFinancial Results\n• Economic conditions (including tariffs) that could affect fuel costs, commodity costs, • Future impacts from the novel coronavirus pandemic known as \"COVID-19,\" and any other\nindustry size and financial conditions of our dealers and suppliers pandemics, public health crises, or epidemics, on capital markets, manufacturing and\nsupply chain abilities, consumer and customer demand, school system operations,\n• Labor or other constraints on the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure\nworkplace conditions, and any other unexpected impacts\nThese forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this presentation, and current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of\nOutlook and Guidance\njudgments, risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and we do not undertake any\nobligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except\nas may be required under applicable securities laws. The factors described above, as well as risk factors described in reports filed with the SEC by Blue Bird Corporation (available at\nwww.sec.gov), could cause our actual results to differ materially from estimates or expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements.\nQ&A\n2\nImportant Disclaimers\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis presentation may include the following non-GAAP financial measures: “Adjusted EBITDA,” \"Adjusted EBITDA Margin,\" “Adjusted Net Income,” “Adjusted Diluted\nEarnings per Share,” “Free Cash Flow” and “Adjusted Free Cash Flow.”\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or loss prior to discontinued operations income or loss, interest income, interest expense including the component of lease\nIntroductions & Forward-Looking Statements\nexpense (which is presented as a single operating expense in selling, general and administrative expenses in our GAAP financial statements) that represents interest expense\non lease liabilities, income taxes, depreciation and amortization including the component of lease expense (which is presented as a single operating expense in selling, general\nand administrative expenses in our GAAP financial statements) that represents amortization charges on right-to-use lease assets, and disposals, as adjusted to add back\ncertain charges that we may record each year, such as stock-compensation expense, as well as non-recurring charges such as (i) significant product design changes; (ii)\ntransaction related costs; (iii) discrete expenses related to major cost cutting initiatives; or (iv) costs directly attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic (3). We believe these\nexpenses are not considered an indicator of ongoing company performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales.\nAdjusted NFet iInncaomnec isia nle tR inecosmue lotrs loss as adjusted to add back certain costs as mentioned above. Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share represents Adjusted Net Income or\nloss available to common stockholders divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding (as if we had GAAP net income during the respective period).\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share are calculated net of taxes.\nFree cash flow represents net cash provided by/used in operating activities minus cash paid for fixed assets, Adjusted Free Cash Flow represents Free Cash Flow minus cash\npaid for (i) significant product design changes; (ii) transaction related costs; or (iii) discrete expenses related to major cost cutting initiatives.\nThere are limitations to using non-GAAP measures. Although Blue Bird believes that such measures may enhance an evaluation of Blue Bird’s operating performance and\ncash flows,O (i)u otthleor ocokm paannieds iGn Buluied Bairnd’cs eindustry may define such measures differently than Blue Bird does and, as a result, they may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies in Blue Bird’s industry and (ii) such measures may exclude certain financial information that some may consider important in evaluating\nBlue Bird’s performance and cash flows.\nQ&A\n3\nAgenda\nInvestment Highlights\nSchool Bus Industry Overview\nCompany & Product Highlights\nFY2024 Objectives\nGrowth Runway\n4\nInvestment Highlights\nCountercyclical Strong industry growth ahead with a backdrop of healthy funding and an aging school bus fleet\nNational Commitment Beneficiary of $5B US Government’s commitment to the electrification of school buses\nThe Leader Leading market position in alternative power and electric school buses\nExpanding our TAM Product portfolio further diversified through introduction of EV commercial chassis offering\nReducing Costs Reducing structural costs through Lean Transformation\nProfitable Growth Pricing aligned to market economics and volatility\nEBITDA margins of ~13% in 2024 and 15% the longer-term\n5\nSchool Bus Industry Overview\n6\nIndustry Highlights\nOEMs School Bus Customers\nLion\n~3,400\nContractors\n500k+\nThomas\nBlue Bird\n~10,000\nSchool\nDistricts\nIC\nHigh barriers to entry\nHighly specialized product -- Complex state and customer requirements -- Dealer and service network -- Customer relationship driven business\nDemand Drivers\nPopulation of school age children increasing -- Increasing average age of existing fleet – Federal funding for clean school buses\nRelatively Clear Funding Sources\nProperty taxes are primary source of funding;

Those risks\ninclude, among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Blue Bird disclaims anyobligation to update information in this presentation. Additional information regarding the use of\nnon-GAAP financial measures is presented in the Appendix to this presentation.\n2\nImportant Disclaimers\nForward Looking Statements\nThis presentation includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These\nforward-looking statements relate to expectations for future financial performance, business strategies or expectations for our business. Specifically, forward-looking\nstatements include statements regarding guidance, seasonality, product mix and gross profits and may include statements relatingto:\nIntroductions & Forward-Looking Statements\n• Inherent limitations of internal controls impacting financial statements • Volatility in the tax base and other funding sources that support the purchase of buses by\nour end customers\n• Growth opportunities\n• Lower or higher than anticipated market acceptance for our products\n• Future profitability\n• Other statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words “estimate,” “plan,”\n• Ability to expand market share\n“project,” “forecast,” “intend,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “target” or similar\n• Customer demand for certain products expressions\nFinancial Results\n• Economic conditions (including tariffs) that could affect fuel costs, commodity costs, • Future impacts from the novel coronavirus pandemic known as \"COVID-19,\" and any other\nindustry size and financial conditions of our dealers and suppliers pandemics, public health crises, or epidemics, on capital markets, manufacturing and\nsupply chain abilities, consumer and customer demand, school system operations,\n• Labor or other constraints on the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure\nworkplace conditions, and any other unexpected impacts\nThese forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this presentation, and current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of\nOutlook and Guidance\njudgments, risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and we do not undertake any\nobligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except\nas may be required under applicable securities laws. The factors described above, as well as risk factors described in reports filed with the SEC by Blue Bird Corporation (available at\nwww.sec.gov), could cause our actual results to differ materially from estimates or expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements.\nQ&A\n3\nImportant Disclaimers\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis presentation may include the following non-GAAP financial measures: “Adjusted EBITDA,” \"Adjusted EBITDA Margin,\" “Adjusted Net Income,” “Adjusted Diluted\nEarnings per Share,” “Free Cash Flow” and “Adjusted Free Cash Flow.” Additional information on the calculation of some of these terms is included in the Appendix.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or loss prior to discontinued operations income or loss, interest income, interest expense including the component of lease\nIntroductions & Forward-Looking Statements\nexpense (which is presented as a single operating expense in selling, general and administrative expenses in our GAAP financial statements) that represents interest expense\non lease liabilities, income taxes, depreciation and amortization including the component of lease expense (which is presented as a single operating expense in selling, general\nand administrative expenses in our GAAP financial statements) that represents amortization charges on right-to-use lease assets,and disposals, as adjusted to add back\ncertain charges that we may record each year, such as stock-compensation expense, as well as non-recurring charges such as (i) significant product design changes; (ii)\ntransaction related costs; (iii) discrete expenses related to major cost cutting initiatives; or (iv) costs directly attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic (3). We believe these\nexpenses are not considered an indicator of ongoing company performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales.\nAdjusted NFet iInncaomnec iisa nle tR inecosmue lotrs loss as adjusted to add back certain costs as mentioned above. Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share represents Adjusted Net Income or\nloss available to common stockholders divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding (as if we had GAAP net income during the respective period).\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share are calculated net of taxes.\nFree cash flow represents net cash provided by/used in operating activities minus cash paid for fixed assets, Adjusted Free Cash Flow represents Free Cash Flow minus cash\npaid for (i) significant product design changes; (ii) transaction related costs; or (iii) discrete expenses related to major cost cutting initiatives.\nThere are limitations to using non-GAAP measures. Although Blue Bird believes that such measures may enhance an evaluation of Blue Bird’s operating performance and\ncash flows,O (i)u otthleor ocokm paannides iGn Buluied Bairnd’cs eindustry may define such measures differently than Blue Bird does and, as a result, they may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies in Blue Bird’s industry and (ii) such measures may exclude certain financial information that some may consider important in evaluating\nBlue Bird’s performance and cash flows.\nQ&A\n4\nKEY RESULTS & HIGHLIGHTS\nPhil Horlock\nPresident &CEO\n5\nKey FY2024 Takeaways: All-Time Record Year\nRecord Profit; Beat Full Year Guidance and Raised Long-Term Outlook\nRobust Market Demand, Increasing Order Share and Continuing Strong Backlog\nSupply Chain Largely Stable; Highly Engaged with Two Key Constrained Suppliers\nSubstantially Higher Bus Price Compared with Last Year and Competitive with Market\nEV Production and Backlog Increasing; Undisputed Leader in Alternative Power\nInvesting in the Business – People, Processes, Product and Facilities\nSignificantly Improved Plant Operational Performance with More Stability\nStrong market demand, alternative-power leadership and profit margins at record levels\n6\nFY2024 Financial Results and Key Business Highlights\nFY2024 Results\nSigned first collective\nS S\nbargaining agreement with\nT UNITS NET T USW\nAlt.

CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n1. Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation\nNature of Business\nBlue Bird Body Company (\"BBBC\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Blue Bird Corporation, was incorporated in 1958 and has manufactured, assembled and\nsold school buses to a variety of municipal, federal and commercial customers since 1927. The majority of BBBC’s sales are made to an independent dealer\nnetwork, which in turn sells buses to ultimate end users. References in these notes to condensed consolidated financial statements to “Blue Bird,” the\n“Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” relate to Blue Bird Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless the context specifically indicates otherwise. We are\nheadquartered in Macon, Georgia.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All\nsignificant inter-company transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial reporting and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday\nclosest to September 30 with its quarters consisting of thirteen weeks in most years. The fiscal years ending September 28, 2024 (\"fiscal 2024\") and ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 (\"fiscal 2023\") consist or consisted of 52 weeks. The third quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 both included 13 weeks. The nine month\nperiods in fiscal 2024 and 2023 both included 39 weeks.\nIn the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of financial results have been made. Such adjustments consist of\nonly those of a normal recurring nature. Operating results for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire\nyear. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.\nThe Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet data as of September 30, 2023 was derived from the Company’s audited financial statements but does not include\nall disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. For additional information, including the Company’s significant accounting policies, refer to the consolidated financial\nstatements and related footnotes as of and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 as set forth in the Company's fiscal 2023 Form 10-K filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on December 11, 2023.\nImpacts of COVID-19 and Subsequent Supply Chain Constraints on our Business\nAs discussed in detail in the fiscal 2023 Form 10-K filed with the SEC on December 11, 2023, the novel coronavirus known as \"COVID-19\" materially\naffected demand for new buses and replacement/maintenance parts during the second half of our fiscal year that ended October 3, 2020 (\"fiscal 2020\") and first\nhalf of our fiscal year that ended October 2, 2021 (\"fiscal 2021\"), significantly impacting our business and operations. Although demand for school buses\nstrengthened substantially during the second half of fiscal 2021, the Company, and automotive industry as a whole, began experiencing significant supply chain\nconstraints around this same period of time. These supply chain disruptions had a significant adverse impact on our operations and results during the second\nhalf of fiscal 2021 and all of fiscal 2022 due to higher purchasing costs, including freight costs incurred to expedite receipt of critical components, increased\nmanufacturing inefficiencies and our inability to complete the production of buses to fulfill sales orders.\nAdditionally, Russian military forces launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, which further exacerbated global supply chain\ndisruptions. While the Company has no assets or customers in either of these countries, this military conflict has significantly impacted our financial results,\nprimarily in an indirect manner since the Company does not sell to customers located in, or source goods directly from, either country. Specifically, it\ncontributed to increased a) costs charged by suppliers for the purchase of inventory that is at least partially dependent on resources originating from either of\nthe countries and b) freight costs, both of which negatively impacted the gross profit recognized on sales during fiscal 2022, fiscal 2023 and continuing into\nfiscal 2024.\nTowards the end of fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2023, there were slight improvements in the supply chain's ability to deliver the parts and components\nnecessary to support our production operations, resulting in increased (i) manufacturing efficiencies and (ii) production of buses to fulfill sales orders during\nfiscal 2023. However, the higher costs charged by suppliers to procure inventory that continued into fiscal 2023 had a significant adverse impact on our\noperations and results. Specifically, such cost increases outpaced\n9\nthe increases in sales prices that we charged for the buses that were sold during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, many of which were included in the backlog of\nfixed price sales orders originating in fiscal 2021 and the early months of fiscal 2022 that carried forward into fiscal 2023. During the remainder of fiscal 2023,\nthe buses that were sold were generally included in the backlog of fixed price sales orders originating more recently (i.e., the latter months of fiscal 2022 and in\nfiscal 2023), with the cumulative increases in sales prices we charged for those buses generally outpacing the higher costs we paid to procure inventory,\nresulting in gross profit during the quarters. While the gross margin on bus sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 lagged the historical gross margin\nreported prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it returned to more normal historical levels during the latter half of fiscal 2023.\nSupply chain disruptions continued during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as there were still occasional shortages of certain critical components as well as\nongoing increases in raw materials costs, both of which impacted our business and operations by limiting the number of school buses that we could produce\nand sell as well as increasing the costs to manufacture buses. Nonetheless, the lessons learned, and resulting actions taken, by management over the past three\nfiscal years allowed the Company to better navigate these supply chain challenges and consistently produce buses to fulfill sales orders. Ongoing improvements\nin manufacturing operations, when coupled with periodic pricing actions taken by the Company to ensure that the increased sales prices charged for buses kept\npace with increased costs to procure inventory to produce the buses, allowed the Company to report gross profit and gross margin during the first nine months\nof fiscal 2024 that were consistent with, or better than, historic levels experienced prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. At the date of the financial\nstatements, these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, and during\nthe reporting period, these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. For example, significant management judgments\nare required in determining excess, obsolete, or unsalable inventory; the allowance for doubtful accounts; potential impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill\nand intangible assets; and the accounting for self-insurance reserves, warranty reserves, pension obligations, income taxes, environmental liabilities and\ncontingencies. Future events, including the extent and duration of continued supply chain constraints and their related economic impacts, and their effects\ncannot be predicted with certainty, and, accordingly, the Company’s accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. The accounting estimates used in\nthe preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional\ninformation is obtained and as the Company’s operating environment changes. The Company evaluates and updates its assumptions and estimates on an\nongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in the Company’s evaluations. Actual results could differ from the estimates that the Company has\nused.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are described in the Company’s fiscal 2023 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on December 11, 2023. Our senior\nmanagement has reviewed these significant accounting policies and related disclosures and determined that there were no significant changes in our critical\naccounting policies in the nine months ended June 29, 2024.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nASU 2023-07 On November 27, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2023-07, Segment\nReporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires public entities to disclose information about their reportable\nsegments’ significant expenses on an interim and annual basis. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.\nASU 2023-09 On December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires\nentities to disclose more detailed information in their reconciliation of their statutory tax rate to their effective tax rate. Public business entities (\"PBEs\") are\nrequired to provide this incremental detail in a numerical, tabular format. The ASU also requires entities to disclose more detailed information about income\ntaxes paid, including by jurisdiction; pretax income (or loss) from continuing operations; and income tax expense (or benefit). The ASU is effective for PBEs in\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2025, with early adoption permitted.\nThe new ASUs will not impact amounts recorded in the financial statements but instead, will require more detailed disclosures in the footnotes to the financial\nstatement. The Company plans to provide the updated disclosures required by the ASUs in the periods in which they are effective.\n10\n3.

Debt\nOn November 17, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), BBBC, as Borrower, executed a $250.0 million five-year credit agreement with Bank of Montreal, acting as\nadministrative agent and an issuing bank; several joint lead arranger partners and issuing banks, including Bank of America; and a syndicate of other lenders\n(the \"Credit Agreement\").\nThe credit facilities provided for under the Credit Agreement consist of a term loan facility in an aggregate initial principal amount of $100.0 million (the\n“Term Loan Facility”) and a revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of $150.0 million. The revolving credit facility includes a $25.0 million\nletter of credit sub-facility and $5.0 million swingline sub-facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility,” and together with the Term Loan Facility, each a “Credit\nFacility” and collectively, the “Credit Facilities”).\nA minimum of $100.0 million of additional term loans and/or revolving credit commitments may be incurred under the Credit Agreement, subject to certain\nlimitations as set forth in the Credit Agreement, and which additional loans and/or commitments would require further commitments from existing lenders or\nfrom new lenders.\nBorrower has the right to prepay the loans outstanding under the Credit Facilities without premium or penalty (subject to customary breakage costs, if\napplicable). Additionally, proceeds from asset sales, condemnation, casualty insurance and/or debt issuances (in certain circumstances) are required to be used\nto prepay borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facilities. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, which were made on the Closing Date, may not be\nreborrowed once they are repaid while borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be repaid and reborrowed from time to time at our election.\nThe Term Loan Facility is subject to amortization of principal, payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each fiscal quarter, which commenced\non March 30, 2024, with 5.0% of the $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of all initial term loans outstanding at the Closing Date payable each year prior\nto the maturity date of the Term Loan Facility. The remaining initial\n12\naggregate principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, as well as any outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be\npayable on the November 17, 2028 maturity date of the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Facilities are guaranteed by all of the Company’s wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries (subject to customary exceptions) and are secured\nby a security agreement which pledges a lien on virtually all of the assets of Borrower, the Company and the Company’s other wholly-owned domestic\nrestricted subsidiaries, other than any owned or leased real property and subject to customary exceptions.\nThe $100.0 million of Term Loan Facility proceeds and $36.2 million of Revolving Credit Facility proceeds that were borrowed on the Closing Date were used\nto pay (i) the $131.8 million of term loan indebtedness outstanding under the previous credit agreement (\"Amended Credit Agreement\"), (ii) interest and\ncommitment fees accrued under the Amended Credit Agreement through the Closing Date and (iii) transaction costs associated with the consummation of the\nCredit Agreement.\nUnder the terms of the Credit Agreement, Borrower, the Company and the Company’s other wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries are subject to\ncustomary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable, and lender\nremedies).\nBorrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest, at our option, at (i) base rate (\"ABR\") or (ii) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as administered by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York (\"SOFR\") plus 0.10%, plus an applicable margin depending on the Total Net Leverage Ratio (\"TNLR,\" which is defined in\nthe Credit Agreement as the ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA on a trailing four quarter basis) of the Company as follows:\nLevel TNLR ABR Loans SOFR Loans\nI Less than 1.00x 0.75% 1.75%\nII Greater than or equal to 1.00x and less than 1.50x 1.50% 2.50%\nIII Greater than or equal to 1.50x and less than 2.25x 2.00% 3.00%\nIV Greater than or equal to 2.25x 2.25% 3.25%\nPricing on the Closing Date was set at Level III until receipt of the financial information and related compliance certificate for the first fiscal quarter that ended\nafter the Closing Date, with pricing as of June 29, 2024 set at Level I.\nBorrower is also required to pay lenders an unused commitment fee of between 0.25% and 0.45% per annum on the undrawn commitments under the\nRevolving Credit Facility, depending on the TNLR, quarterly in arrears.\nThe Credit Agreement also includes a requirement that the Company comply with the following financial covenants on the last day of each fiscal quarter\nthrough maturity: (i) a pro forma TNLR of not greater than 3.00:1.00 and (ii) a pro forma fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of\nnot less than 1.20:1.00. The Company was in compliance with such covenants as of June 29, 2024.\nThe Company incurred approximately $3.1 million in lender fees and other issuance costs relating to the Credit Agreement. Of such total, approximately\n$1.9 million and $0.8 million was capitalized within other assets and long-term debt (as a contra-balance), respectively, on the Condensed Consolidated\nBalance Sheets and will be amortized as an adjustment to interest expense on a straight-line basis and utilizing the effective interest method, respectively, until\nmaturity of the Credit Agreement. The remaining approximate $0.4 million was recorded to loss on debt refinancing or modification on the Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Operations.\nIn conjunction with executing the Credit Agreement, previously capitalized lender fees and other issuance costs relating to the Amended Credit Agreement and\nincurred in prior periods totaling $1.1 million were also expensed to loss on debt refinancing or modification on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nOperations.\nTerm loan borrowings consisted of the following at the dates indicated:\n(in thousands of dollars) June 29, 2024 September 30, 2023\nTerm loan borrowings, net of deferred financing costs of $1,342 and $1,456, respectively $ 96,158 $ 130,344\nLess: current portion of long-term debt 5,000 19,800\nLong-term debt, net of current portion $ 91,158 $ 110,544\nTerm loan borrowings are recognized on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at the unpaid principal balance, and are not subject to fair value\nmeasurement; however, given the variable rates on the loans, the Company estimates that the unpaid principal balance approximates fair value. If measured at\nfair value in the financial statements, the term loans would be classified as Level 2 in\n13\nthe fair value hierarchy. At June 29, 2024 and September 30, 2023, $97.5 million and $131.8 million, respectively, were outstanding on the term loans.\nAt June 29, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the stated interest rates on the term loans were 7.2% and 10.0%, respectively. At June 29, 2024 and September 30,\n2023, the weighted-average annual effective interest rates for the term loans were 8.5% and 10.9%, respectively, which include amortization of the deferred\nfinancing costs.\nAt June 29, 2024, $6.7 million of letters of credit were outstanding, which reduces the availability on the revolving line of credit. There were no borrowings\noutstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility; therefore, the Company would have been able to borrow $143.3 million on the revolving line of credit.\nInterest expense on all indebtedness was $2.1 million and $4.5 million for the three months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, respectively, and $8.6\nmillion and $13.9 million for the nine months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, respectively.\nThe schedule of remaining principal payments through maturity for the term loans is as follows:\n(in thousands of dollars)\nFiscal Year Principal Payments\n2024 $ 1,250\n2025 5,000\n2026 5,000\n2027 5,000\n2028 5,000\nThereafter 76,250\nTotal remaining principal payments $ 97,500\n5. Income Taxes\nIncome tax provisions for interim periods are based on estimated annual income tax rates, adjusted to reflect the effects of any significant infrequent or unusual\nitems that are required to be discretely recognized within the current interim period. The effective tax rates in the periods presented are largely based upon the\nannual forecasted pre-tax earnings mix and allocation of certain expenses in various taxing jurisdictions where the Company conducts its business, primarily in\nthe United States of America (\"U.S.\"). In periods where our pre-tax income approximates or is equal to break-even, the effective tax rates for quarter-to-date\nand full-year periods may not be meaningful due to discrete period items.\nThree Months\nThe effective tax rate for the three months ended June 29, 2024 was 27.7% and differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%. The increase was\nprimarily due to the impacts from state taxes and certain permanent items on the federal rate, which were partially offset by the impacts from federal and state\ntax credits (net of valuation allowances) and discrete period items during the quarter.\nThe effective tax rate for the three months ended July 1, 2023 was 21.6%, which aligned with the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% and is comprised of\nnormal tax rate items, including impacts from state taxes, federal and state tax credits (net of valuation allowances) and permanent differences, which were\npartially offset by the impact of discrete period items during the quarter.\nNine Months\nThe effective tax rate for the nine months ended June 29, 2024 was 26.4% and differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%. The increase was\nprimarily due to the impacts from state taxes and certain permanent items on the federal rate, which were partially offset by the impacts from federal and state\ntax credits (net of valuation allowances) and discrete period items during the period.\nThe effective tax rate for the nine months ended July 1, 2023 was 22.2%, which aligned with the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% and is comprised of\nnormal tax rate items, including impacts from state taxes, federal and state tax credits (net of valuation allowances) and permanent differences, which were\npartially offset by the impact of discrete period items during the period.\n14\n6. Guarantees, Commitments and Contingencies\nLitigation\nAt June 29, 2024, the Company had a number of product liability and other cases pending. Management believes that, considering the Company’s insurance\ncoverage and its intention to vigorously defend its positions, the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nfinancial statements.\nEnvironmental\nThe Company is subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials used in its\nmanufacturing processes. Failure by the Company to comply with present and future regulations could subject it to future liabilities. In addition, such\nregulations could require the Company to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations. The\nCompany is currently not involved in any material environmental proceedings and therefore, management believes that the resolution of pending\nenvironmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements.\n7. Segment Information\nWe manage our business in two operating segments: (i) the Bus segment, which includes the manufacturing and assembly of buses to be sold to a variety of\ncustomers across the U.S., Canada and in certain limited international markets; and (ii) the Parts segment, which consists primarily of the purchase of parts\nfrom third parties to be sold to dealers within the Company’s network and certain large fleet customers. Management evaluates the segments based primarily\nupon revenues and gross profit, which are reflected in the tables below for the periods presented:\nNet sales\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(in thousands of dollars) June 29, 2024 July 1, 2023 June 29, 2024 July 1, 2023\nBus (1) $ 308,037 $ 270,282 $ 919,433 $ 757,003\nParts (1) 25,330 24,002 77,509 72,827\nSegment net sales $ 333,367 $ 294,284 $ 996,942 $ 829,830\n(1) Parts segment revenue includes $2.6 million and $1.7 million for the three months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, respectively, and $6.9 million and\n$4.1 million for the nine months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, respectively, related to inter-segment sales of parts that was eliminated by the Bus\nsegment upon consolidation.\nGross profit (loss)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(in thousands of dollars) June 29, 2024 July 1, 2023 June 29, 2024 July 1, 2023\nBus $ 56,545 $ 34,176 $ 157,428 $ 53,544\nParts 12,808 11,574 39,122 35,312\nSegment gross profit $ 69,353 $ 45,750 $ 196,550 $ 88,856\n15\nThe following table is a reconciliation of segment gross profit to consolidated income before income taxes for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(in thousands of dollars) June 29, 2024 July 1, 2023 June 29, 2024 July 1, 2023\nSegment gross profit $ 69,353 $ 45,750 $ 196,550 $ 88,856\nAdjustments:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (29,625) (26,328) (82,798) (66,365)\nInterest expense (2,107) (4,507) (8,550) (13,895)\nInterest income 990 246 3,132 258\nOther expense, net (2,729) (6,421) (5,918) (6,999)\nLoss on debt refinancing or modification — — (1,558) (537)\nIncome before income taxes $ 35,882 $ 8,740 $ 100,858 $ 1,318\nSales are attributable to geographic areas based on customer location and were as follows for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(in thousands of dollars) June 29, 2024 July 1, 2023 June 29, 2024 July 1, 2023\nU.S. $ 291,374 $ 282,908 $ 910,489 $ 751,730\nCanada 41,804 9,801 85,981 72,556\nRest of world 189 1,575 472 5,544\nTotal net sales $ 333,367 $ 294,284 $ 996,942 $ 829,830\n8.

Stockholder Transaction Costs\nOn December 14, 2023, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with BofA Securities, Inc. and Barclays Capital Inc., as representatives of the\nseveral underwriters and American Securities LLC (\"Selling Stockholder\"), pursuant to which the Selling Stockholder agreed to sell 2,500,000 shares of\ncommon stock at a purchase price of $25.10 per share (“December Offering”).\nOn February 15, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Barclays Capital Inc., as representative of the several underwriters and the\nSelling Stockholder, pursuant to which the Selling Shareholder agreed to sell 4,042,650 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $32.90 per share\n(\"February Offering,\" and collectively with the December Offering, “Offerings”).\nThe December Offering was conducted pursuant to a prospectus supplement, dated December 14, 2023, and the February Offering was conducted pursuant to a\nprospectus supplement, dated February 15, 2024, both to the prospectus dated December 22, 2021 included in the Company’s registration statement on Form S-\n3 (File No. 333-261858) that was initially filed with the SEC on December 23, 2021.\nThe December Offering closed on December 19, 2023 and the February Offering closed on February 21, 2024. Although the Company did not sell any shares\nor receive any proceeds from the Offerings, it was required to pay certain expenses in connection with the Offerings that totaled approximately $3.2 million for\nthe nine months ended June 29, 2024, with $5.5 million and $6.3 million of similar expense recorded for the three and nine months ended July 1, 2023,\nrespectively. The $3.2 million of expense is included within other expense, net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months\nended June 29, 2024. The $6.3 million of expense is included within other expense, net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for both the\nthree and nine months ended July 1, 2023, although approximately $0.7 million of such expense was initially recorded within selling, general and\nadministrative expenses during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and reclassified to other expense, net during the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\n12. Joint Ventures\nMicro Bird Holdings, Inc.\nIn December 2023, Micro Bird Holdings, Inc., our unconsolidated Canadian joint venture, paid dividends to all common stockholders, with the Company's\nproportionate share totaling $3.0 million, gross of required withholding taxes. The dividend was recorded as a reduction in the balance of equity investment in\naffiliate on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and is presented as a cash inflow in the operating section of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nCash Flows.\nClean Bus Solutions, LLC\nOn December 7, 2023, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, BBBC, and GC Mobility Investments I, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of\nGenerate Capital, PBC (“Generate Capital”), a sustainable investment company focusing on clean energy, transportation, water, waste, agriculture, smart cities\nand industrial decarbonization, executed a definitive agreement (“Joint Venture Agreement”) establishing a joint venture, Clean Bus Solutions, LLC, to provide\na fleet-as-a-service (\"FaaS\") offering using electric school buses manufactured and sold by the Company (“Joint Venture”). The service will be offered to\nqualified customers of the Company. Through the Joint Venture, the Company will provide its end customers with turnkey electrification solutions, including a\nwide product range consisting of, among others, electric school buses, financing of electric buses and supporting charging infrastructure, project planning and\nmanagement, and fleet optimization.\nThe Company and Generate Capital will initially have an equal common ownership interest in the Joint Venture, and will initially jointly share management\nresponsibility and control, with each party having certain customary consent and approval rights and control triggers. The parties have each agreed to\ncontribute up to $10.0 million to the Joint Venture, as agreed from time to time, for common interests to fund administrative expenses, and up to an additional\n$100.0 million of capital in the form of preferred interests to fund the purchase, delivery, installation, operation and maintenance of FaaS projects, inclusive of\nBlue Bird electric school buses and associated charging infrastructure. Of this amount, the Company has committed to provide up to $20.0 million and\nGenerate Capital has committed to provide up to $80.0 million, with the Company’s aggregate commitment in any one year not to exceed $10.0 million\nwithout its consent.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement, the Company will promote the Joint Venture as the Company’s preferred FaaS offering for\nelectric school buses and has agreed to not participate as a joint venture partner in any other similar FaaS offering for electric school buses, except as an\noriginal equipment manufacturer of buses. The Company’s obligations do not prevent or limit any activities of its dealers.\n18\nThe Joint Venture has a perpetual duration subject to the right of either party to terminate early upon the occurrence of certain events of default or the failure to\nachieve certain milestones set forth in the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement.\nIn connection with the execution of the Joint Venture Agreement, the Company granted Generate Capital warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares\nof Company common stock at an exercise price of $25.00 per share during a five-year exercise period (“Warrants”). Two-thirds of the Warrants were\nimmediately exercisable while the remaining Warrants will become exercisable upon Generate Capital satisfying certain funding conditions. The exercise price\nand the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants are subject to adjustment in the event of a recapitalization, stock dividend or similar event.\nThe Company recorded the $7.4 million fair value of the Warrants upon issuance as permanent equity within additional paid-in capital on the Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheets and is not required to subsequently record changes in fair value as long as the Warrants continue to be classified within\nstockholders' equity. Additionally, since the Warrants were provided in exchange for an investment in the Joint Venture, the Company recorded the cost of its\ninvestment based on the fair value of the Warrants upon issuance, which increased the balance of equity investment in affiliate on the Condensed Consolidated\nBalance Sheets by a corresponding $7.4 million. No other activity was recorded relating to the Joint Venture during the three and nine months ended June 29,\n2024.\nItem 2.

The following information should be read in\nconjunction with the financial statements included in the Company’s fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on December 11, 2023.\nAvailable Information\nWe are subject to the reporting and information requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and as a result are\nobligated to file or furnish, as applicable, annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other information with the SEC. We make these\ndocuments available free of charge on our website (http://www.blue-bird.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with, or\nfurnish them to, the SEC. Information on our website does not constitute part of this Report. In addition, the SEC maintains a website (http://www.sec.gov) that\ncontains our annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy and information statements, and other information we electronically file with, or furnish to, the SEC.\nExecutive Overview\nBlue Bird is the leading independent designer and manufacturer of school buses. Our longevity and reputation in the school bus industry have made Blue Bird\nan iconic American brand. We distinguish ourselves from our principal competitors by dedicating our focus to the design, engineering, manufacture and sale of\nschool buses, and related parts. As the only principal manufacturer of chassis and body production specifically designed for school bus applications in the\nUnited States of America (\"U.S.\"), Blue Bird is recognized as an industry leader for school bus innovation, safety, product quality/reliability/durability,\nefficiency, and lower operating costs. In addition, Blue Bird is the market leader in alternative powered product offerings with its propane-powered, gasoline-\npowered and all-electric-powered school buses.\nBlue Bird sells its buses and parts through an extensive network of U.S. and Canadian dealers that, in their territories, are exclusive to Blue Bird on Type C and\nType D school buses. Blue Bird also sells directly to major fleet operators, the U.S. Government, state governments, and authorized dealers in certain limited\nforeign countries.\nThroughout this Report, we refer to the fiscal year ending September 28, 2024 as \"fiscal 2024,\" the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 as \"fiscal 2023,\" the\nfiscal year ended October 1, 2022 as \"fiscal 2022,\" the fiscal year ended October 2, 2021 as “fiscal 2021” and the fiscal year ended October 3, 2020 as \"fiscal\n2020.\" There will be or were 52 weeks in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. The third quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 both included 13 weeks. The\nnine month periods in fiscal 2024 and 2023 both included 39 weeks.\nImpacts of COVID-19 and Subsequent Supply Chain Constraints on Our Business\nAs discussed in detail in the fiscal 2023 Form 10-K filed with the SEC on December 11, 2023, the novel coronavirus known as \"COVID-19\" materially\naffected demand for new buses and replacement/maintenance parts during the second half of fiscal 2020 and\n20\nfirst half of fiscal 2021, significantly impacting our business and operations. Although demand for school buses strengthened substantially during the second\nhalf of fiscal 2021, the Company, and automotive industry as a whole, began experiencing significant supply chain constraints around this same period of time.\nAdditionally, the already challenged global supply chain for automotive parts that began in fiscal 2021 was further impacted, including continuing escalating\ninventory purchase costs, by additional stress resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 (see further discussion below). These supply chain\ndisruptions had a significant adverse impact on our operations and results during the second half of fiscal 2021 and all of fiscal 2022 due to higher purchasing\ncosts, including freight costs incurred to expedite receipt of critical components, increased manufacturing inefficiencies and our inability to complete the\nproduction of buses to fulfill sales orders.\nTowards the end of fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2023, there were slight improvements in the supply chain's ability to deliver the parts and components\nnecessary to support our production operations, resulting in increased (i) manufacturing efficiencies and (ii) production of buses to fulfill sales orders during\nfiscal 2023. However, the higher costs charged by suppliers to procure inventory that continued into fiscal 2023 had a significant adverse impact on our\noperations and results. Specifically, such cost increases outpaced the increases in sales prices that we charged for the buses that were sold during the first\nquarter of fiscal 2023, many of which were included in the backlog of fixed price sales orders originating in fiscal 2021 and the early months of fiscal 2022 that\ncarried forward into fiscal 2023. During the remainder of fiscal 2023, the buses that were sold were generally included in the backlog of fixed price sales orders\noriginating more recently (i.e., the latter months of fiscal 2022 and in fiscal 2023), with the cumulative increases in sales prices we charged for those buses\ngenerally outpacing the higher costs we paid to procure inventory, resulting in gross profit during the quarters. While the gross margin on bus sales during the\nsecond quarter of fiscal 2023 lagged the historical gross margin reported prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it returned to more normal historical levels during\nthe latter half of fiscal 2023.\nSupply chain disruptions continued into the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as there were still occasional shortages of certain critical components as well as\nongoing increases in raw materials costs, both of which impacted our business and operations by limiting the number of school buses that we could produce\nand sell as well as increasing the costs to manufacture buses. Nonetheless, the lessons learned, and resulting actions taken, by management over the past three\nfiscal years allowed the Company to better navigate these supply chain challenges and consistently produce buses to fulfill sales orders. Ongoing improvements\nin manufacturing operations, when coupled with periodic pricing actions taken by the Company to ensure that the increased sales prices charged for buses kept\npace with increased costs to procure inventory to produce the buses, allowed the Company to report gross profit and gross margin during the first nine months\nof fiscal 2024 that were consistent with, or better than, historic levels experienced prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNew bus orders during fiscal 2023 and continuing into fiscal 2024 remained robust, primarily due to a combination of (i) pent-up demand resulting from the\ncumulative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic when many school systems conducted virtual learning and (ii) the challenged global supply chain for automotive\nparts that hindered the school bus industry's ability to produce and sell buses that began during the latter half of fiscal 2021 and continued through the third\nquarter of fiscal 2024. Accordingly, the Company's backlog remained strong at approximately 4,600 units and 5,200 units as of September 30, 2023 and\nJune 29, 2024, respectively, despite it selling over 8,500 units during fiscal 2023, the majority of which were included in the backlog that existed as of October\n1, 2022, and over 6,500 units in the first nine months of fiscal 2024.\nIn general, management believes that supply chain disruptions could continue in future periods and could materially impact our results if we are unable to i)\nobtain parts and supplies in sufficient quantities to meet our production needs and/or ii) pass along rising costs to our customers. They have resulted, and could\ncontinue to result, in significant economic disruption and have adversely affected our business. They could adversely impact our business for the remainder of\nfiscal 2024 and perhaps beyond. Significant uncertainty exists concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of ongoing supply chain constraints and\ntheir potential impact on the overall economy, both within the U.S and globally. Accordingly, the magnitude and duration of any production and supply chain\ndisruptions and their related financial impacts on our business cannot be estimated at this time.\nThe impacts from supply chain constraints on the Company's business and operations beginning during the second half of fiscal 2021 and continuing into fiscal\n2024 negatively affected our inventory procurement costs, gross profit, income and cash flows. We continue to monitor and assess the ability of suppliers to\nmaintain operations and to provide parts and supplies in sufficient quantities to meet our production needs and our ability to maintain continuous production\nduring the remainder of fiscal 2024 and beyond. See PART I, Item 1.A. \"Risk Factors,\" of our fiscal 2023 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on December 11,\n2023, for a discussion of the material risks we believe we face particularly related to supply chain disruptions and related constraints.\nImpact of Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine on Our Business\nOn February 24, 2022, Russian military forces launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine. While the Company has no assets or customers in either of these\ncountries, this military conflict has had a significant negative impact on the Company’s operations, cash\n21\nflows and results beginning in fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2024, primarily in an indirect manner since the Company does not sell to customers\nlocated in, or source goods directly from, either country.\nSpecifically, Ukraine has historically been a large exporter of ferroalloy materials used in the manufacture of steel and the disruption in the supply of these\nminerals has resulted in significant volatility in the price of steel. While the Company has generally mitigated its direct exposure to steel prices by executing\nfixed price purchase contracts (generally purchased up to four quarters in advance) for the majority of the significant amount of steel used in the manufacture\nof school bus bodies, many suppliers from which the Company purchases components containing steel increased the price that they charge the Company to\nacquire such inventory, primarily on a lagged basis, starting from the latter half of fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2024, as applicable. These inventory\ncosts impact gross profit when school buses are sold and cash flows when the related invoices are paid.\nAdditionally, Russia has historically been a large global exporter of oil and many countries have ceased buying Russian oil in protest of the invasion and to\ncomply with sanctions imposed by the U.S. and many European countries. Accordingly, the disruption in the supply of oil has significantly impacted the price\nof goods refined from oil, such as diesel fuel, the price of which has been volatile and has remained high since the latter half of fiscal 2022. These higher costs\nsignificantly impacted the Company both as a result of the price that suppliers charge the Company to acquire inventory (since diesel fuel impacts their cost of\nacquiring the inventory used in producing their goods) and the price that the Company pays for freight to deliver the inventory that it acquires. Additionally,\nsuch increases are generally implemented with very little lag so that they impact the purchase cost of inventory and cash flows on an almost real-time basis.\nFinally, both countries have large quantities of other minerals that impact commodity costs, such as rubber and resin, among others, and the disruption caused\nby the ongoing military conflict increased the cost and/or decreased the supply of components containing these materials, further impacting an already\nchallenged global supply chain for automotive parts.\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has resulted, and is likely to continue to result, in significant economic disruption and has adversely affected our business.\nSpecifically, it has contributed to higher inventory purchase costs, including freight costs, that negatively impacted the gross profit recognized on sales\nbeginning during the latter part of fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2024. Because peace negotiations do not appear to be productive and because Russia\nhas continued to intensify its military operations in Ukraine, we currently believe that this matter will continue to adversely impact our business for the\nremainder of fiscal 2024 and perhaps beyond. Significant uncertainty exists concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of the ongoing military\nconflict and its impact on the overall economy, both within the U.S. and globally. Accordingly, the duration of any production and supply chain disruptions, and\nrelated financial impacts, cannot be estimated at this time.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at\nthe date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Blue Bird evaluates its estimates on an\nongoing basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Application of these\naccounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these\nestimates.\nThe Company’s accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are described\nin the Company’s fiscal 2023 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on December 11, 2023, under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” which description is incorporated herein by reference. Our senior\nmanagement has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures and determined that there were no significant changes in our critical\naccounting policies during the nine months ended June 29, 2024.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for a discussion of new and/or\nrecently adopted accounting pronouncements, as applicable.\n22\nFactors Affecting Our Revenues\nOur revenues are driven primarily by the following factors:\n• Property tax revenues. Property tax revenues are one of the major sources of funding for school districts, and therefore new school buses. Property tax\nrevenues are a function of land and building prices, relying on assessments of property value by state or county assessors and millage rates voted by\nthe local electorate.\n• Student enrollment and delivery mechanisms for learning. Increases or decreases in the number of school bus riders have a direct impact on school\ndistrict demand. Evolving protocols for public health concerns and/or continued technological advancements could shift the future form of educational\ndelivery away from in-person learning on a more permanent basis, with increased remote learning reasonably expected to decrease the number of\nschool bus riders.\n• Revenue mix. We are able to charge more for certain of our products (e.g., Type C propane-powered school buses, electric-powered buses, Type D\nbuses, and buses with higher option content) than other products. The mix of products sold in any fiscal period can directly impact our revenues for\nthe period.\n• Strength of the dealer network. We rely on our dealers, as well as a small number of major fleet operators, to be the direct point of contact with school\ndistricts and their purchasing agents. An effective dealer is capable of expanding revenues within a given school district by matching that district’s\nneeds to our capabilities, offering options that would not otherwise be provided to the district.\n• Pricing. Our products are sold to school districts throughout the U.S. and Canada. Each state and each Canadian province has its own set of\nregulations that governs the purchase of products, including school buses, by their school districts. We and our dealers must navigate these regulations,\npurchasing procedures, and the districts’ specifications in order to reach mutually acceptable price terms. Pricing may or may not be favorable to us,\ndepending upon a number of factors impacting purchasing decisions. Additionally, in certain cases, prices originally quoted with dealers and school\ndistricts may have become less favorable, or more unfavorable, to us given increasing inventory costs between the time the sales order was\ncontractually agreed upon and the bus is built and delivered as a result of ongoing supply chain disruptions and general inflationary pressures.\n• Buying patterns of major fleets. Major fleets regularly compete against one another for existing accounts. Fleets are also continuously trying to win the\nbusiness of school districts that operate their own transportation services. These activities can have either a positive or negative impact on our sales,\ndepending on the brand preference of the fleet that wins the business. Major fleets also periodically review their fleet sizes and replacement patterns\ndue to funding availability as well as the profitability of existing routes. These actions can impact total purchases by fleets in a given year.\n• Seasonality. Historically, our sales have been subject to seasonal variation based on the school calendar with the peak season during our third and\nfourth fiscal quarters. Sales during the third and fourth fiscal quarters are typically greater than the first and second fiscal quarters due to the desire of\nmunicipalities to have any new buses that they order available to them at the beginning of the new school year. With the COVID-19 pandemic\nimpacting the demand for Company products and the impact of the subsequent supply chain constraints hindering the Company's ability to produce\nand sell buses, seasonality has become unpredictable. Seasonality and variations from historical seasonality have impacted the comparison of results\nbetween fiscal periods.\n• Inflation. As discussed previously above, supply chain disruptions developing subsequent to the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of\nUkraine have significantly increased our inventory purchase costs, including freight costs incurred to expedite receipt of critical components, reflected\nin cost of goods sold during the latter half of fiscal 2021, all of fiscal 2022 and continuing, to a lesser extent, into fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024. In\nresponse, beginning in July 2021, the Company announced several sales price increases that applied to new sales orders and partially applied to\nbacklog orders that were both intended to mitigate the impact of rising purchase costs on our operations and results. Most of these price increases only\nbegan to marginally impact sales and gross profit in the latter half of fiscal 2022. Specifically, they did not offset the significant continued increase in\nthe Company's production costs, resulting in further deterioration of the Company's gross profit during the second half of fiscal 2022 and continuing\ninto the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as it produced and sold the oldest units included in the backlog as of the end of fiscal 2022. However, they began to\nhave a more significant, positive impact on sales and gross profit during the remainder of fiscal 2023, as the Company fulfilled sales orders (i) from\nthe backlog existing as of the end of fiscal 2022 that originated more recently (i.e., during the latter months of fiscal 2022) and (ii) that were taken\nduring fiscal 2023, both of which contained most or all of the cumulative sales prices increases that have been announced. These cumulative price\nincreases also continued to have a significant, positive impact on sales and gross profit during the first nine months of fiscal 2024.\n23\nFactors Affecting Our Expenses and Other Items\nOur expenses and other line items on our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations are principally driven by the following factors:\n• Cost of goods sold. The components of our cost of goods sold consist of material costs (principally powertrain components, steel and rubber, as well\nas aluminum and copper) including freight costs, labor expense, and overhead. Our cost of goods sold may vary from period to period due to changes\nin sales volume, efforts by certain suppliers to pass through the economics associated with key commodities, fluctuations in freight costs, design\nchanges with respect to specific components, design changes with respect to specific bus models, wage increases for plant labor, productivity of plant\nlabor, delays in receiving materials and other logistical problems, and the impact of overhead items such as utilities.\n• Selling, general and administrative expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses include costs associated with our selling and marketing\nefforts, engineering, centralized finance, human resources, purchasing, information technology services, along with other administrative matters and\nfunctions. In most instances, other than direct costs associated with sales and marketing programs, the principal component of these costs is salary\nexpense. Changes from period to period are typically driven by the number of our employees, as well as by merit increases provided to experienced\npersonnel.\n• Interest expense. Our interest expense relates to costs associated with our debt instruments and reflects both the amount of indebtedness and the\ninterest rate that we are required to pay on our debt. Interest expense also includes unrealized gains or losses from interest rate hedges, if any, and\nchanges in the fair value of interest rate derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships, if any, as well as expenses related to debt\nguarantees, if any.\n• Income taxes. We make estimates of the amounts to recognize for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. In addition, provisions\nare established for withholding taxes related to the transfer of cash between jurisdictions and for uncertain tax positions taken.\n• Other expense/income, net. This balance includes periodic pension expense or income as well as gains or losses on foreign currency, if any. Other\namounts not associated with operating expenses may also be included in this balance.\n• Equity in net income or loss of non-consolidated affiliate. We include in this line item our 50% share of net income or loss from our investment in\nMicro Bird Holdings, Inc., our unconsolidated Canadian joint venture.\nKey Non-GAAP Financial Measures We Use to Evaluate Our Performance\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report in Item 1. \"Financial Statements (Unaudited)\" are prepared in conformity with U.S.\nGAAP. This Report also includes the following financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP (\"non-GAAP\"): “Adjusted EBITDA;”\n“Adjusted EBITDA Margin;” and “Free Cash Flow.” Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are financial metrics that are utilized by management and the\nboard of directors, as and when applicable, to determine (a) the annual cash bonus payouts, if any, to be made to certain employees based upon the terms of the\nCompany’s Management Incentive Plan, and (b) whether the performance criteria have been met for the vesting of certain equity awards granted annually to\ncertain members of management based upon the terms of the Company’s Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan. Additionally, consolidated EBITDA, which is an\nadjusted EBITDA metric defined by our Credit Agreement (defined below) that could differ from Adjusted EBITDA discussed above as the adjustments to the\ncalculations are not uniform, is used to determine the Company's ongoing compliance with several financial covenant requirements, including being utilized in\nthe denominator of the calculation of the Total Net Leverage Ratio (\"TNLR\"), which is also utilized in determining the interest rate we pay on borrowings\nunder our Credit Agreement (defined below). Accordingly, management views these non-GAAP financial metrics as key for the above purposes and as a useful\nway to evaluate the performance of our operations as discussed further below.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or loss prior to interest income; interest expense including the component of operating lease expense (which is\npresented as a single operating expense in selling, general and administrative expenses in our U.S. GAAP financial statements) that represents interest expense\non lease liabilities; income taxes; and depreciation and amortization including the component of operating lease expense (which is presented as a single\noperating expense in selling, general and administrative expenses in our U.S. GAAP financial statements) that represents amortization charges on right-of-use\nlease assets; as adjusted for certain non-cash charges or credits that we may record on a recurring basis such as share-based compensation expense and\nunrealized gains or losses on certain derivative financial instruments; net gains or losses on the disposal of assets as well as certain charges such as (i)\nsignificant product design changes; (ii) transaction related costs; or (iii) discrete expenses related to major cost cutting and/or operational transformation\ninitiatives. While certain of the charges that are added back in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation, such as transaction related costs and operational\ntransformation and major product redesign initiatives, represent operating expenses that may be recorded in more than one annual period, the significant project\nor transaction giving rise to such expenses is not considered to be indicative of the Company’s normal operations. Accordingly, we believe that these, as well as\nthe other credits and charges that\n24\ncomprise the amounts utilized in the determination of Adjusted EBITDA described above, should not be used in evaluating the Company’s ongoing annual\noperating performance.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measures of\nperformance defined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The measures are used as a supplement to U.S. GAAP results in evaluating certain aspects of our\nbusiness, as described below.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are useful to investors in evaluating our performance because the measures consider the\nperformance of our ongoing operations, excluding decisions made with respect to capital investment, financing, and certain other significant initiatives or\ntransactions as outlined in the preceding paragraphs. We believe the non-GAAP measures offer additional financial metrics that, when coupled with the U.S.\nGAAP results and the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of our results of operations and the factors and trends\naffecting our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss as an indicator of our performance or as\nalternatives to any other measure prescribed by U.S. GAAP as there are limitations to using such non-GAAP measures. Although we believe that Adjusted\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may enhance an evaluation of our operating performance based on recent revenue generation and product/overhead\ncost control because they exclude the impact of prior decisions made about capital investment, financing, and certain other significant initiatives or\ntransactions, (i) other companies in Blue Bird’s industry may define Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin differently than we do and, as a result,\nthey may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in Blue Bird’s industry, and (ii) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nMargin exclude certain financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing disclosure of the differences between Adjusted EBITDA and U.S. GAAP results, including providing a\nreconciliation to U.S. GAAP results, to enable investors to perform their own analysis of our ongoing operating results.\nOur measure of Free Cash Flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and it should not be relied upon\nto the exclusion of U.S. GAAP financial measures. Free Cash Flow reflects an additional way of evaluating our liquidity that, when viewed with our U.S.\nGAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial\nstatements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nWe define Free Cash Flow as total cash provided by/used in operating activities as adjusted for cash paid for the acquisition of fixed assets and intangible\nassets. We use Free Cash Flow, and ratios based on Free Cash Flow, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from\noperations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since purchases of fixed assets and intangible assets are a necessary component of\nongoing manufacturing operations. Accordingly, Free Cash Flow will be less than operating cash flows.\nOur Segments\nWe manage our business in two operating segments, which are also our reportable segments: (i) the Bus segment, which involves the design, engineering,\nmanufacture and sales of school buses and extended warranties; and (ii) the Parts segment, which includes the sale of replacement bus parts. Financial\ninformation is reported on the basis that it is used internally by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in evaluating segment performance and deciding\nhow to allocate resources to segments. The Chief Executive Officer of the Company has been identified as the CODM. Management evaluates the segments\nbased primarily upon revenues and gross profit.\n25\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023:\nThree Months Ended\n(in thousands of dollars) June 29, 2024 July 1, 2023\nNet sales $ 333,367 $ 294,284\nCost of goods sold 264,014 248,534\nGross profit $ 69,353 $ 45,750\nOperating expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 29,625 26,328\nOperating profit $ 39,728 $ 19,422\nInterest expense (2,107) (4,507)\nInterest income 990 246\nOther expense, net (2,729) (6,421)\nIncome before income taxes $ 35,882 $ 8,740\nIncome tax expense (9,938) (1,884)\nEquity in net income of non-consolidated affiliate 2,767 2,502\nNet income $ 28,711 $ 9,358\nOther financial data:\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 48,246 $ 29,665\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 14.5 % 10.1 %\nThe following provides the results of operations of Blue Bird’s two reportable segments:\n(in thousands of dollars) Three Months Ended\nNet Sales by Segment June 29, 2024 July 1, 2023\nBus $ 308,037 $ 270,282\nParts 25,330 24,002\nTotal $ 333,367 $ 294,284\nGross Profit (Loss) by Segment\nBus $ 56,545 $ 34,176\nParts 12,808 11,574\nTotal $ 69,353 $ 45,750\nNet sales. Net sales were $333.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, an increase of $39.1 million, or 13.3%, compared to $294.3 million for the third\nquarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in net sales is primarily due to product and mix changes, pricing actions taken by management in response to increased\ninventory purchase costs and a small increase in unit bookings.\nBus sales increased $37.8 million, or 14.0%, reflecting an 13.2% increase in average sales price per unit and a 0.7% increase in units booked. In the third\nquarter of fiscal 2024, 2,151 units were booked compared to 2,137 units booked for the same period in fiscal 2023. The small increase in units sold was\nprimarily due to customer and product mix changes, although both quarters were negatively impacted by supply chain constraints that limited the Company's\nability to produce and deliver buses due to shortages of critical components. The increase in unit price for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the same\nperiod in fiscal 2023 reflects pricing actions taken by management as well as product and customer mix changes.\nParts sales increased $1.3 million, or 5.5%, for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. This increase is primarily attributed\nto price increases, driven by ongoing inflationary pressures, as well as higher fulfillment volumes and slight variations due to product and channel mix.\nCost of goods sold. Total cost of goods sold was $264.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, an increase of $15.5 million, or 6.2%, compared to $248.5\nmillion for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. As a percentage of net sales, total cost of goods sold improved from 84.5% to 79.2%, primarily due to the pricing\nactions discussed above.\n26\nBus segment cost of goods sold increased $15.4 million, or 6.5%, for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the same period in fiscal 2023. The increase\nwas primarily driven by increased inventory costs, as the average cost of goods sold per unit for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 5.8% higher compared to\nthe third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to product and mix changes as well as increases in manufacturing costs attributable to a) increased raw materials\ncosts resulting from ongoing inflationary pressures and b) ongoing supply chain disruptions that resulted in higher purchase costs for components. The increase\nalso partially resulted from the 0.7% increase in units booked in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the same period in fiscal 2023.\nThe $0.1 million, or 0.8%, increase in parts segment cost of goods sold for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was\nprimarily due to increased purchased parts costs, driven by ongoing inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, as well as slight variations due to\nproduct and channel mix.\nOperating profit. Operating profit was $39.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, an increase of $20.3 million, compared to operating profit of $19.4\nmillion for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Profitability was primarily impacted by an increase of $23.6 million in gross profit as outlined in the revenue and\ncost of goods sold discussions above. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase of $3.3 million in selling, general and administrative\nexpenses, primarily due to an increase in labor costs.\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $2.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, a decrease of $2.4 million, or 53.3%, compared to $4.5 million for the\nthird quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the stated term loan interest rate from 11.1% at July 1, 2023 to 7.2% at\nJune 29, 2024, as well as lower outstanding borrowings in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\nOther expense, net. Other expense, net was $2.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, a decrease of $3.7 million, or 57.5%, compared to $6.4 million of\nother expense, net for the same period in fiscal 2023.\nOn May 23, 2024, eligible members of the United Steelworkers Union (“USW”) voted to ratify a three-year collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) with\nBlue Bird Body Company (\"BBBC\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Blue Bird Corporation.\nAmong other items, the CBA required the payment of a $750 signing bonus to the approximate 1,500 covered production workers in our Fort Valley and Perry,\nGeorgia facilities as well as a lump-sum payment to certain employees who were not eligible for the approximate 12%, on average, year one wage increase\nbecause their current hourly wage rate exceeded the rate required by the terms of the CBA. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company paid the above\namounts to those employees covered by the CBA as well as similar amounts to a small number of hourly employees not covered by the CBA so that their total\ncompensation is competitive with that of unionized employees performing comparable job functions. These payments totaled $2.7 million for the three months\nended June 29, 2024 and were recorded in other expense, net because such compensation is not reflective of wages paid for services provided by the direct and\nindirect employees who support our operating activities and is expensed within cost of goods sold. There was no similar expense recorded during the three\nmonths ended July 1, 2023.\nAdditionally, on June 7, 2023, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with BofA Securities, Inc. and Barclays Capital Inc., as representatives of\nthe several underwriters and American Securities LLC, Coliseum Capital Partners, L.P., and Blackwell Partners LLC – Series A (\"2023 Selling Stockholders\"),\npursuant to which the 2023 Selling Stockholders agreed to sell 5,175,000 shares of common stock, including the sale of 675,000 shares pursuant to the\nunderwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option, at a purchase price of $20.00 per share (“2023 Offering”).\nThe 2023 Offering was conducted pursuant to a prospectus supplement, dated June 7, 2023, to the prospectus, dated December 22, 2021, included in the\nCompany’s registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-261858) that was initially filed with the SEC on December 23, 2021.\nThe 2023 Offering closed on June 12, 2023. Although the Company did not sell any shares or receive any proceeds from the 2023 Offering. it was required to\npay certain expenses in connection with the 2023 Offering that totaled $6.3 million (approximately $0.7 million of which were expensed in the second quarter\nof fiscal 2023 within selling, general and administrative expenses and reclassified to other expense, net during the third quarter of fiscal 2023), with no similar\nexpense recorded during the same period of fiscal 2024.\nIncome taxes. Income tax expense was $9.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to $1.9 million for the same period in fiscal 2023.\nThe effective tax rate for the three months ended June 29, 2024 was 27.7% and differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%. The increase was\nprimarily due to the impacts from state taxes and certain permanent items on the federal rate, which were partially offset by the impacts from federal and state\ntax credits (net of valuation allowances) and discrete period items during the quarter.\n27\nThe effective tax rate for the three months ended July 1, 2023 was 21.6%, which aligned with the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% and was comprised\nof normal tax rate items, including impacts from state taxes, federal and state tax credits (net of valuation allowances) and permanent differences, which were\npartially offset by the impact of discrete period items during the quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA was $48.2 million, or 14.5% of net sales, for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, an increase of $18.6 million, or 62.6%,\ncompared to $29.7 million, or 10.1% of net sales, for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase is primarily the result of the $19.4 million increase in net\nincome as a result of the factors discussed above.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended\n(in thousands of dollars) June 29, 2024 July 1, 2023\nNet income $ 28,711 $ 9,358\nAdjustments:\nInterest expense, net (1) 1,214 4,353\nIncome tax expense 9,938 1,884\nDepreciation, amortization, and disposals (2) 4,055 5,481\nOperational transformation initiatives — 196\nShare-based compensation expense 2,474 941\nStockholder transaction costs — 5,509\nOther 2 293\nSubtotal (Adjusted EBITDA as previously presented) $ 46,394 $ 28,015\nMicro Bird Holdings, Inc. total interest expense, net; income tax expense or benefit; depreciation\nexpense and amortization expense 1,852 1,650\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 48,246 $ 29,665\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (percentage of net sales) 14.5 % 10.1 %\n(1) Includes $0.1 million for both fiscal periods, representing interest expense on operating lease liabilities, which are a component of lease expense and\npresented as a single operating expense in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(2) Includes $0.3 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, respectively, representing amortization charges on right-\nof-use lease assets, which are a component of lease expense and presented as a single operating expense in selling, general and administrative expenses on our\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n28\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023:\nNine Months Ended\n(in thousands of dollars) June 29, 2024 July 1, 2023\nNet sales $ 996,942 $ 829,830\nCost of goods sold 800,392 740,974\nGross profit $ 196,550 $ 88,856\nOperating expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 82,798 66,365\nOperating profit $ 113,752 $ 22,491\nInterest expense (8,550) (13,895)\nInterest income 3,132 258\nOther expense, net (5,918) (6,999)\nLoss on debt refinancing or modification (1,558) (537)\nIncome before income taxes $ 100,858 $ 1,318\nIncome tax expense (26,645) (292)\nEquity in net income of non-consolidated affiliate 6,671 4,168\nNet income $ 80,884 $ 5,194\nOther financial data:\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 141,601 $ 47,217\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 14.2 % 5.7 %\nThe following provides the results of operations of Blue Bird’s two reportable segments:\n(in thousands of dollars) Nine Months Ended\nNet Sales by Segment June 29, 2024 July 1, 2023\nBus $ 919,433 $ 757,003\nParts 77,509 72,827\nTotal $ 996,942 $ 829,830\nGross Profit by Segment\nBus $ 157,428 $ 53,544\nParts 39,122 35,312\nTotal $ 196,550 $ 88,856\nNet sales. Net sales were $996.9 million for the nine months ended June 29, 2024, an increase of $167.1 million, or 20.1%, compared to $829.8 million for the\nnine months ended July 1, 2023. The increase in net sales is primarily due to increased unit bookings, product and mix changes, as well as pricing actions taken\nby management in response to increased inventory purchase costs.\nBus sales increased $162.4 million, or 21.5%, reflecting a 2.1% increase in units booked and a 18.9% increase in average sales price per unit. 6,534 units\nbooked in the nine months ended June 29, 2024 compared with 6,398 units booked during the same period in fiscal 2023. The increase in units sold was\nprimarily due to slight improvements in supply chain constraints impacting the Company's ability to produce and deliver buses due to shortages of critical\ncomponents during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 relative to the same period in fiscal 2023. The increase in unit price for the first nine months of fiscal\n2024 compared to the same period in fiscal 2023 reflects pricing actions taken by management as well as product and customer mix changes.\nParts sales increased $4.7 million, or 6.4%, for the nine months ended June 29, 2024 compared to the nine months ended July 1, 2023. This increase is\nprimarily attributed to price increases, driven by ongoing inflationary pressures, as well as higher fulfillment volumes and slight variations due to product and\nchannel mix.\n29\nCost of goods sold. Total cost of goods sold was $800.4 million for the nine months ended June 29, 2024, an increase of $59.4 million, or 8.0%, compared to\n$741.0 million for the nine months ended July 1, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, total cost of goods sold improved from 89.3% to 80.3%.\nBus segment cost of goods sold increased $58.5 million, or 8.3%, for the nine months ended June 29, 2024 compared to the nine months ended July 1, 2023.\nThe increase was partially attributable to the 2.1% increase in units booked in the nine months ended June 29, 2024 compared to the same period in fiscal 2023.\nAlso contributing was increased inventory costs, as the average cost of goods sold per unit for the nine months ended June 29, 2024 was 6.1% higher compared\nto the nine months ended July 1, 2023, primarily due to product and mix changes as well as increases in manufacturing costs attributable to a) increased raw\nmaterials costs resulting from ongoing inflationary pressures and b) ongoing supply chain disruptions that resulted in higher purchase costs for components.\nThe $0.9 million, or 2.3%, increase in parts segment cost of goods sold for the nine months ended June 29, 2024 compared to the nine months ended July 1,\n2023 was primarily due to increased purchased parts costs, driven by ongoing inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, as well as slight variations\ndue to product and channel mix.\nOperating profit. Operating profit was $113.8 million for the nine months ended June 29, 2024, an increase of $91.3 million compared to operating profit of\n$22.5 million for the nine months ended July 1, 2023. Profitability was primarily impacted by an increase of $107.7 million in gross profit as outlined in the\nrevenue and cost of goods sold discussions. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase of $16.4 million in selling, general and\nadministrative expenses, primarily due to an increase in labor costs. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses during the first quarter of fiscal\n2023 benefited from actions taken by management to reduce labor costs and certain discretionary spending to mitigate the significant adverse impact of\nongoing supply chain constraints on the Company's operations and results.\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $8.6 million for the nine months ended June 29, 2024, a decrease of $5.3 million, or 38.5%, compared to $13.9 million\nfor the nine months ended July 1, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the stated term loan interest rate from 11.1% at July 1, 2023 to\n7.2% at June 29, 2024, as well as lower outstanding borrowings in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023.\nOther expense, net. Other expense, net was $5.9 million for the nine months ended June 29, 2024, a decrease of $1.1 million, or 15.4%, compared to $7.0\nmillion for the nine months ended July 1, 2023. We recorded $0.1 million of net periodic pension expense during the nine months ended June 29, 2024 when\ncompared with $0.5 million recorded during the nine months ended July 1, 2023.\nOn May 23, 2024, eligible members of the USW voted to ratify a three-year CBA with BBBC. Among other items, the CBA required the payment of a $750\nsigning bonus to the approximate 1,500 covered production workers in our Fort Valley and Perry, Georgia facilities as well as a lump-sum payment to certain\nemployees who were not eligible for the approximate 12%, on average, year one wage increase because their current hourly wage rate exceeded the rate\nrequired by the terms of the CBA. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company paid the above amounts to those employees covered by the CBA as\nwell as similar amounts to a small number of hourly employees not covered by the CBA so that their total compensation is competitive with that of unionized\nemployees performing comparable job functions. These payments totaled $2.7 million for the nine months ended June 29, 2024 and were recorded in other\nexpense, net because such compensation is not reflective of wages paid for services provided by the direct and indirect employees who support our operating\nactivities and is expensed within cost of goods sold. There was no similar expense recorded during the nine months ended July 1, 2023.\nAdditionally, on December 14, 2023, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with BofA Securities, Inc. and Barclays Capital Inc., as\nrepresentatives of the several underwriters and American Securities LLC (\"Selling Stockholder\"), pursuant to which the Selling Stockholder agreed to sell\n2,500,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $25.10 per share (\"December Offering\").\nOn February 15, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Barclays Capital Inc., as representative of the several underwriters and the\nSelling Stockholder, pursuant to which the Selling Shareholder agreed to sell 4,042,650 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $32.90 per share\n(\"February Offering,\" and collectively with the December Offering, \"Offerings\").\nThe December Offering was conducted pursuant to a prospectus supplement, dated December 14, 2023, and the February Offering was conducted pursuant to a\nprospectus supplement, dated February 15, 2024, both to the prospectus dated December 22, 2021 included in the Company’s registration statement on Form S-\n3 (File No. 333-261858) that was initially filed with the SEC on December 23, 2021.\n30\nThe December Offering closed on December 19, 2023 and the February Offering closed on February 21, 2024. Although the Company did not sell any shares\nor receive any proceeds from the Offerings, it was required to pay certain expenses in connection with the Offerings that totaled approximately $3.2 million for\nthe nine months ended June 29, 2024, with $6.3 million of similar expense recorded for the nine months ended July 1, 2023. However, approximately $0.7\nmillion of the $6.3 million of expense recorded for the nine months ended July 1, 2023 was initially recorded within selling, general and administrative\nexpenses during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and reclassified to other expense, net during the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\nIncome taxes. Income tax expense was $26.6 million for the nine months ended June 29, 2024 compared to $0.3 million for the nine months ended July 1,\n2023.\nThe effective tax rate for the nine months ended June 29, 2024 was 26.4% and differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%. The increase was\nprimarily due to the impacts from state taxes and certain permanent items on the federal rate, which were partially offset by the impacts from federal and state\ntax credits (net of valuation allowances) and discrete period items during the period.\nThe effective tax rate for the nine months ended July 1, 2023 was 22.2%, which aligned with the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% and is comprised of\nnormal tax rate items, including impacts from state taxes, federal and state tax credits (net of valuation allowances) and permanent differences, which were\npartially offset by the impact of discrete period items during the period.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA was $141.6 million, or 14.2% of net sales, for the nine months ended June 29, 2024, an increase of $94.4 million, or\n199.9%, compared to $47.2 million, or 5.7% of net sales, for the nine months ended July 1, 2023. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA is primarily the result of\nthe $75.7 million increase in net income as a result of the factors discussed above as well as the $26.4 million corresponding increase in income tax expense.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\nNine Months Ended\n(in thousands of dollars) June 29, 2024 July 1, 2023\nNet income $ 80,884 $ 5,194\nAdjustments:\nInterest expense, net (1) 5,729 13,923\nIncome tax expense 26,645 292\nDepreciation, amortization, and disposals (2) 12,253 13,477\nOperational transformation initiatives — 1,133\nLoss on debt refinancing or modification 1,558 537\nShare-based compensation expense 7,017 2,229\nStockholder transaction costs 3,154 6,252\nOther (81) 574\nSubtotal (Adjusted EBITDA as previously presented) $ 137,159 $ 43,611\nMicro Bird Holdings, Inc. total interest expense, net; income tax expense or benefit; depreciation\nexpense and amortization expense 4,442 3,606\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 141,601 $ 47,217\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (percentage of net sales) 14.2 % 5.7 %\n(1) Includes $0.3 million for both nine month periods, representing interest expense on operating lease liabilities, which are a component of lease expense and\npresented as a single operating expense in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(2) Includes $1.3 million for both nine month periods, representing amortization charges on right-of-use lease assets, which are a component of lease expense\nand presented as a single operating expense in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from its operations, available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under its revolving\ncredit facility. At June 29, 2024, the Company had $88.4 million of available cash (net of outstanding checks) and $143.3 million of additional borrowings\navailable under the revolving line of credit portion of its credit facility. The\n31\nCompany’s revolving line of credit is available for working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.\nCredit Agreement\nOn November 17, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), BBBC (\"Borrower\") executed a $250.0 million five-year credit agreement with Bank of Montreal, acting as\nadministrative agent and an issuing bank; several joint lead arranger partners and issuing banks, including Bank of America; and a syndicate of other lenders\n(the \"Credit Agreement\").\nThe credit facilities provided for under the Credit Agreement consist of a term loan facility in an aggregate initial principal amount of $100.0 million (the\n“Term Loan Facility”) and a revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of $150.0 million. The revolving credit facility includes a $25.0 million\nletter of credit sub-facility and $5.0 million swingline sub-facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility,” and together with the Term Loan Facility, each a “Credit\nFacility” and collectively, the “Credit Facilities”).\nA minimum of $100.0 million of additional term loans and/or revolving credit commitments may be incurred under the Credit Agreement, subject to certain\nlimitations as set forth in the Credit Agreement, and which additional loans and/or commitments would require further commitments from existing lenders or\nfrom new lenders.\nBorrower has the right to prepay the loans outstanding under the Credit Facilities without premium or penalty (subject to customary breakage costs, if\napplicable). Additionally, proceeds from asset sales, condemnation, casualty insurance and/or debt issuances (in certain circumstances) are required to be used\nto prepay borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facilities. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, which were made at the Closing Date, may not be\nreborrowed once they are repaid while borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be repaid and reborrowed from time to time at our election.\nThe Term Loan Facility is subject to amortization of principal, payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each fiscal quarter, which commenced\non March 30, 2024, with 5.0% of the $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of all initial term loans outstanding at the Closing Date payable each year prior\nto the maturity date of the Term Loan Facility. The remaining initial aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, as well as any\noutstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be payable on the November 17, 2028 maturity date of the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Facilities are guaranteed by all of the Company’s wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries (subject to customary exceptions) and are secured\nby a security agreement which pledges a lien on virtually all of the assets of Borrower, the Company and the Company’s other wholly-owned domestic\nrestricted subsidiaries, other than any owned or leased real property and subject to customary exceptions.\nThe $100.0 million of Term Loan Facility proceeds and $36.2 million of Revolving Credit Facility proceeds that were borrowed on the Closing Date were used\nto pay (i) the $131.8 million of term loan indebtedness outstanding under the previous credit agreement (\"Amended Credit Agreement\"), (ii) interest and\ncommitment fees accrued under the Amended Credit Agreement through the Closing Date and (iii) transaction costs associated with the consummation of the\nCredit Agreement.\nUnder the terms of the Credit Agreement, Borrower, the Company and the Company’s other wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries are subject to\ncustomary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable, and lender\nremedies).\nBorrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest, at our option, at (i) base rate (\"ABR\") or (ii) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as administered by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York (\"SOFR\") plus 0.10%, plus an applicable margin depending on the TNLR (which is defined in the Credit Agreement as the\nratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA on a trailing four quarter basis) of the Company as follows:\nLevel TNLR ABR Loans SOFR Loans\nI Less than 1.00x 0.75% 1.75%\nII Greater than or equal to 1.00x and less than 1.50x 1.50% 2.50%\nIII Greater than or equal to 1.50x and less than 2.25x 2.00% 3.00%\nIV Greater than or equal to 2.25x 2.25% 3.25%\nPricing on the Closing Date was set at Level III until receipt of the financial information and related compliance certificate for the first fiscal quarter ending\nafter the Closing Date, with pricing as of June 29, 2024 set at Level I.\nBorrower is also required to pay lenders an unused commitment fee of between 0.25% and 0.45% per annum on the undrawn commitments under the\nRevolving Credit Facility, depending on the TNLR, quarterly in arrears.\n32\nThe Credit Agreement also includes a requirement that the Company comply with the following financial covenants on the last day of each fiscal quarter\nthrough maturity: (i) a pro forma TNLR of not greater than 3.00:1.00 and (ii) a pro forma fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of\nnot less than 1.20:1.00.\nDetailed descriptions of the Amended Credit Agreement are set forth under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, filed\nwith the SEC on December 11, 2023.\nAt June 29, 2024, Borrower and the guarantors under the Credit Agreement were in compliance with all covenants.\nShort-Term and Long-Term Liquidity Requirements\nOur ability to make principal and interest payments on borrowings under our Credit Facilities, as applicable, and our ability to fund planned capital\nexpenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive,\nregulatory and other conditions. The adverse impacts from ongoing supply chain disruptions materially impacted our operations and results during the second\nhalf of fiscal 2021 and all of fiscal 2022 due to higher purchasing costs, including freight costs incurred to expedite receipt of critical components, increased\nmanufacturing inefficiencies and our inability to complete the production of buses to fulfill sales orders.\nTowards the end of fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2023, there were slight improvements in the supply chain's ability to deliver the parts and components\nnecessary to support our production operations, resulting in increased (i) manufacturing efficiencies and (ii) production of buses to fulfill sales orders during\nfiscal 2023. However, the higher costs charged by suppliers to procure inventory that continued into fiscal 2023 had a significant adverse impact on our\noperations and results. Specifically, such cost increases outpaced the increases in sales prices that we charged for the buses that were sold during the first\nquarter of fiscal 2023, many of which were included in the backlog of fixed price sales orders originating in fiscal 2021 and the early months of fiscal 2022 that\ncarried forward into fiscal 2023. During the remainder of fiscal 2023, the buses that were sold were generally included in the backlog of fixed price sales orders\noriginating more recently (i.e., the latter months of fiscal 2022 and in fiscal 2023), with the cumulative increases in sales prices we charged for those buses\ngenerally outpacing the higher costs we paid to procure inventory, resulting in gross profit during the quarters. While the gross margin on bus sales during the\nsecond quarter of fiscal 2023 lagged the historical gross margin reported prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it returned to more normal historical levels during\nthe latter half of fiscal 2023.\nSupply chain disruptions continued into the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as there were still occasional shortages of certain critical components as well as\nongoing increases in raw materials costs, both of which impacted our business and operations by limiting the number of school buses that we could produce\nand sell as well as increasing the costs to manufacture buses. Nonetheless, ongoing improvements in manufacturing operations, when coupled with periodic\npricing actions taken by the Company to ensure that the increased sales prices charged for buses kept pace with increased costs to procure inventory to produce\nthe buses, allowed the Company to report gross profit and gross margin during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 that were consistent with, or better than,\nhistoric levels experienced prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe development and fluidity of ongoing or future supply chain constraints preclude any prediction as to the ultimate severity of the adverse impacts on our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. See PART I, Item 1.A. \"Risk Factors,\" of our fiscal 2023 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on\nDecember 11, 2023, for a discussion of the material risks we believe we face particularly related to health epidemics and supply chain constraints.\nFuture health epidemics and/or continuing supply chain constraints could cause a contraction in our profits and/or liquidity, which could lead to issues\ncomplying with our Credit Agreement covenants. If we are not able to comply with covenants, we may need to seek amendment for covenant relief or even\nrefinance the debt to a \"covenant lite\" or \"no covenant\" structure. We can offer no assurance that we would be successful in amending or refinancing the\nexisting debt. An amendment or refinancing of our existing debt could lead to higher interest rates and possible up-front expenses not included in our historical\nfinancial statements.\nTo increase our liquidity in future periods, we could pursue raising additional capital via an equity or debt offering utilizing a currently effective \"shelf\"\nregistration statement. However, we can offer no assurance that we would be successful in raising this additional capital, which could also lead to increased\nexpense and larger up-front fees when compared with our historical financial statements.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, our business has been highly seasonal with school districts buying their new school buses so that they will be available for use on the first day of\nthe school year, typically in mid-August to early September. This has, in fiscal years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in our third and fourth fiscal\nquarters representing our two busiest quarters from a sales and production perspective, the latter ending on the Saturday closest to September 30. Our quarterly\nresults of operations, cash flows, and liquidity have\n33\nhistorically been, and are likely to be in future periods, impacted by seasonal patterns. Working capital has historically been a significant use of cash during the\nfirst fiscal quarter due to planned shutdowns and a significant source of cash generation in the fourth fiscal quarter. With the COVID-19 pandemic and\nsubsequent supply chain constraints, seasonality and working capital trends have become unpredictable. Seasonality and variations from historical seasonality\nhave impacted the comparison of working capital and liquidity results between fiscal periods.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth general information derived from our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nNine Months Ended\n(in thousands of dollars) June 29, 2024 July 1, 2023\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period $ 78,988 $ 10,479\nTotal cash provided by operating activities 55,760 84,131\nTotal cash used in investing activities (10,137) (6,390)\nTotal cash used in financing activities (36,195) (37,485)\nChange in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 9,428 $ 40,256\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $ 88,416 $ 50,735\nTotal cash provided by operating activities\nCash flows provided by operating activities totaled $55.8 million for the nine months ended June 29, 2024, a decrease of $28.4 million from the $84.1 million\nof cash flows provided by operating activities during the nine months ended July 1, 2023.\nThe net decrease primarily resulted from the effect of net changes in operating assets and liabilities that negatively impacted operating cash flows by $111.7\nmillion during the nine months ended June 29, 2024 when compared with the nine months ended July 1, 2023. The primary drivers in this category were\nunfavorable changes in accounts receivable; inventory; accounts payable and accrued expenses, pension and other liabilities of $22.5 million, $23.1 million,\n$37.9 million and $29.1 million, respectively, as follows:\n• A shift in our customer mix resulted in increases in the accounts receivable and inventory balances (a net use of cash) at the end of the third quarter of\nfiscal 2024 when compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2023. Specifically, we had a significant increase in fleet orders during fiscal 2024\nwhen compared with fiscal 2023, with the delivery of many of the buses scheduled to occur in the months leading up to the beginning of the school year.\nWe built many of these units during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, a portion of which were booked in the latter part of the quarter that resulted in an\nincrease in accounts receivable, with the remainder to be booked in the early part of the fourth quarter that resulted in an increase in finished goods\ninventory, at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024 when compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2023. In comparison, we became more\nefficient at managing supply chain disruptions, and thus building and selling buses, during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 when compared with the\ncorresponding period in fiscal 2022. These efficiencies resulted in us consuming more inventory in production, which resulted in a significant decrease\nin the inventory balance at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023 (a net source of cash).\n• At the end of fiscal 2022 and during the first nine months of fiscal 2023, inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions significantly increased our\npurchase costs for components and freight, which, when coupled with increased production and sales volumes during the first nine months of fiscal\n2023, resulted in a significant increase in the accounts payable balance (a net source of cash). Although inflationary pressures continued during the first\nnine months of fiscal 2024, they were smaller when compared with the corresponding period of fiscal 2023. This factor, when coupled with our\nproduction and sales volumes largely stabilizing during the first nine months of fiscal 2024, resulted in a decrease in the accounts payable balance during\nthe first nine months of fiscal 2024 (a net use of cash).\n• Our profitability increased significantly during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 when compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2023.\nBecause we were able to utilize net operating loss carryforwards generated in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022 to offset federal and state income tax\nobligations relating to the income we generated in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, we made no estimated tax payments during this period. Because\nof our significant profitability and due to the fact that we primarily utilized available net operating loss carryforwards during fiscal 2023, we made $18.9\nmillion of estimated federal and state income tax payments during the first nine months of fiscal 2024, resulting in a significant use of cash impacting\nother current liabilities (which is included within accrued expenses, pension and other liabilities) during this period.\nAdditionally, as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we had received approximately $13.2 million of advanced funds awarded by the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency in administering the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\n34\n(\"IIJA\") that were recorded as unearned revenue within other current liabilities (which is included within accrued expenses, pension and other\nliabilities). As we built and sold the underlying buses in subsequent quarters, we recognized this amount in revenue and had no corresponding balance as\nof the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024, representing a net use of cash when comparing the two periods.\nThe above decreases were partially offset by a $75.7 million increase in net income and a $3.0 million increase in the dividend received from our\nunconsolidated Canadian joint venture during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 when compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2023.\nTotal cash used in investing activities\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled $10.1 million for the nine months ended June 29, 2024 as compared to $6.4 million for the nine months ended\nJuly 1, 2023. The $3.7 million increase was primarily due to an increase in spending on fixed assets, as increased profitability in the first nine months of fiscal\n2024 when compared with the same period in fiscal 2023 allowed for more capital spending. During the first half of fiscal 2023, capital spending was reduced\nto lower than normal amounts in an effort to mitigate the impact of supply chain constraints on our operations, financial results and cash flows.\nTotal cash used in financing activities\nCash flows used in financing activities totaled $36.2 million for the nine months ended June 29, 2024 as compared to $37.5 million for the nine months ended\nJuly 1, 2023. The $1.3 million decrease between fiscal periods was primarily attributable to $100.0 million of proceeds received from term loan borrowings\nunder the Credit Agreement, a $20.0 million net increase in revolving line of credit borrowings and a $0.9 million increase in cash received from stock option\nexercises, which were partially offset by a $119.5 million increase in term loan principal repayments.\nFree cash flow\nManagement believes the non-GAAP measurement of Free Cash Flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less cash paid for fixed assets and\nacquired intangible assets, fairly represents the Company’s ability to generate surplus cash that could fund activities not in the ordinary course of business. See\n“Key Non-GAAP Financial Measures We Use to Evaluate Our Performance” for further discussion. The following table sets forth the calculation of Free Cash\nFlow for the periods presented:\nNine Months Ended\n(in thousands of dollars) June 29, 2024 July 1, 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 55,760 $ 84,131\nCash paid for fixed assets (10,137) (6,390)\nFree Cash Flow $ 45,623 $ 77,741\nFree Cash Flow for the nine months ended June 29, 2024 was $32.1 million lower than for the nine months ended July 1, 2023 due to a $28.4 million decrease\nin net cash provided by operating activities and a $3.7 million increase in cash paid for fixed assets, both as discussed above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had outstanding letters of credit totaling $6.7 million at June 29, 2024, the majority of which secure our self-insured workers compensation program, the\ncollateral for which is regulated by the State of Georgia.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThere have not been any material changes to our interest rate, commodity or currency risks previously disclosed in Part II, Item 7A of the Company’s fiscal\n2023 Form 10-K.\n35\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are designed to\nprovide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to\nmanagement, including, as appropriate, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In\ndesigning and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and\noperated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.\nBased on their evaluations, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective\nas of June 29, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2024 that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n36\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItems required under Part II not specifically shown below are not applicable.\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nBlue Bird is engaged in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business. Although no assurances can be given about the final outcome of pending legal\nproceedings, at the present time management does not believe that the resolution or outcome of any of Blue Bird’s pending legal proceedings will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's fiscal\n2023 Form 10-K. Such risk factors are expressly incorporated herein by reference, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash\nflows or operating results. The risks described in the fiscal 2023 Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not\ncurrently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and/or\noperating results.\nItem 5.

Business\nThe Company (formerly Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp.) was incorporated in Delaware on September 24, 2013 as a special purpose acquisition company,\nor SPAC. On February 24, 2015, the Company consummated a business combination (the “Business Combination”), pursuant to which the Company acquired\nall of the outstanding capital stock of School Bus Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (“School Bus Holdings” or “SBH”) from The Traxis Group, B.V. (the\n“Seller”). The total purchase price was paid in a combination of cash in the amount of $100.0 million and 12,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock,\n$0.0001 par value (the “Common Stock”), valued at $120.0 million.\nIn connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company changed its name from Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. to Blue Bird\nCorporation. Unless expressly stated otherwise in this Report, Blue Bird Corporation is referred to as \"Blue Bird,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us,\" and\nincludes its consolidated subsidiaries.\nIn May 2016, the Seller, ASP BB Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“ASP”), and the Company entered into an agreement pursuant to which\nthe Seller agreed to sell the 12,000,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company owned by Seller (the “Transaction Shares”) to ASP. ASP acquired 7,000,000\nTransaction Shares at an initial closing on June 3, 2016 for an amount in cash equal to $10.10 per share and 5,000,000 Transaction Shares at a second closing\non June 8, 2016 for an amount in cash equal to $11.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $125.7 million. There were no proceeds to the Company\nfrom this transaction.\nThe following discussion of our business describes the business historically operated by School Bus Holdings and its subsidiaries under the “Blue Bird” name\nas an independent enterprise prior to the Business Combination and as subsidiaries of Blue Bird Corporation after the Business Combination.\nThe periodic reports we file with, or furnish to, the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available\nfree of charge on our website: https://investors.blue-bird.com.

Any amendments to our Code of Ethics or waivers granted to our directors and executive officers will be posted on\nour corporate website.\nIn addition to the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024 (“Report”), information about our\nCompany can be found at https://investors.blue-bird.com, including extensive information about our management team, our products and our corporate\ngovernance.\nThe foregoing information regarding content on our website is for convenience only and is not deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Report or filed\nwith the SEC.\nOverview\nWe are the leading independent designer and manufacturer of school buses, with more than 610,000 buses sold since our formation in 1927.\nWe review and present our business in two operating segments, which are also our reportable segments: (i) the Bus segment, which involves the design,\nengineering, manufacture and sale of school buses and extended warranties; and (ii) the Parts segment, which includes the sale of replacement bus parts.\nFinancial information is reported on the basis that it is used internally by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in evaluating segment performance and\ndeciding how to allocate resources to segments. The President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company has been identified as the CODM. Management\nevaluates the segments based primarily upon revenues and gross profit. Refer to Note 11, Segment Information, to the accompanying consolidated financial\nstatements for additional financial information regarding our reportable segments including the primary geographic areas in which we earn revenues.\nThroughout this Report, we refer to the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024 as “fiscal 2024,” the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 as “fiscal 2023” and\nthe fiscal year ended October 1, 2022 as “fiscal 2022.” There were 52 weeks in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022.\n3\nOur performance in recent years has been driven by the implementation of repeatable processes focused on product initiatives, continuous improvement of both\ncompetitiveness and manufacturing flexibility, and lowering our cost of capital, as described below:\n1. Alternative Power Initiatives — We believe Blue Bird is the clear leader in alternative powered school buses (defined as buses that do not operate on\ndiesel fuel) and we continue to introduce new or enhanced products to support growing consumer demand for these products.\n• Propane and Gasoline — In fiscal 2024, we extended our exclusive clean school bus collaboration with Ford Component Sales and Roush\nCleanTech to 2030, further strengthening Blue Bird’s industry leadership in low- and zero-emission student transportation.\nAs part of this collaboration that began in 2012, Ford Component Sales supplies its 7.3L V8 engine exclusively to us, while Roush CleanTech\nintegrates this compact, durable and easy-to-maintain engine into low-emission powertrain options for propane and gasoline powered school\nbuses. Since 2012, Blue Bird has deployed more than 40,000 alternative fuel powered school buses.\nThe demand for Blue Bird’s propane powered school buses has steadily increased over the past decade. Our propane engine is 90 percent\ncleaner than the most stringent current federal emission standards set by the United States of America (\"U.S.\") Environmental Protection\nAgency (\"EPA\"). New and even stricter emission standards will take effect in 2027, with our near zero-emission, propane powered school\nbuses already exceeding those emission standards currently.\n• Electric — Blue Bird is the first major school bus manufacturer to market, and presently the clear leader in, electric bus sales among all\nmajor original equipment manufacturers (\"OEM\"). We have partnered with Cummins, one of our long-standing engine suppliers, to design\nand develop our electric vehicle offering. We offer electric solutions in both our Type C and Type D buses and commenced delivery to\ncustomers in the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018 (\"fiscal 2018\"). In fiscal 2024, we delivered our 2,000th electric school bus. With\ndemand and interest continuing to grow, we have taken, and will continue to take, actions to expand our electric vehicle production capacity.\n2. Diesel — Blue Bird works closely with Cummins on diesel engines, which continue to be the power source for the majority of buses sold in the school\nbus industry.\n3. Product Initiatives — We continue to update and improve our products.\n• During fiscal 2024, we announced, and began taking actions to implement, the most comprehensive safety upgrades to our school buses in\nthe Company’s history.\nStarting in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending September 27, 2025 (\"fiscal 2025\"), Blue Bird will begin equipping new school buses\nwith a series of industry-first safety features, enhancing the safety of school children and school bus drivers. For the first time in student\ntransportation history, new Blue Bird buses will be equipped with three-point seat belts as standard protection for all student passengers.\nOther seat options will still be available to meet specific customer needs. As an additional industry first, Blue Bird will safeguard school bus\ndrivers with the introduction of 4Front, a steering wheel deployed air bag. Blue Bird collaborated with IMMI, an employee-owned, leading\nglobal supplier of advanced safety systems and restraints based in Indiana, to develop these industry-leading safety enhancements in student\ntransportation.\nBlue Bird will also begin implementing a series of improvements to increase the performance of the school bus and its safety on the road. To\nimprove visibility for the bus driver and other motorists, Blue Bird will adopt high-intensity LED lighting on the outside and inside of the\nbus, high-resolution front and rear cameras, as well as lighted stop arms, lighted school bus signs, and strobe lights. Blue Bird will also begin\nimplementing high-tech systems to improve vehicle safety, including collision mitigation systems being added to the currently-standard\nelectronic stability control (\"ESC\").\n4. Manufacturing and Process Initiatives — We commenced and have continued a number of initiatives to continue to build customer loyalty, reduce\ncosts, and enhance competitiveness.\n• We launched our state-of-the-art 60,000 square foot paint facility in July 2019. Using robotic technology, the paint facility is designed to\npaint a bus three times faster than can be done manually, with a higher paint transfer rate and\n4\nconsistent, outstanding coverage. In keeping with Blue Bird's environmental awareness focus, the facility features a zero-to-landfill design.\nAll paint over spray is captured, dried and sent to a power generation plant to be used as fuel.\n• During fiscal 2023, we opened the new Electric Vehicle Build-up Center, a transformed 40,000 square foot facility at the Fort Valley, Georgia\nmanufacturing plant, designed to meet increasing demand for electric school buses.\n• During fiscal 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy (\"DOE\") selected Blue Bird to receive an approximate $80 million grant to convert a\nformer manufacturing site for diesel powered motorhomes into an approximately 600,000 square foot, electric and low-emissions vehicle\nmanufacturing facility. The grant represents 50 percent of the total approximate $160 million investment required to complete the conversion\nproject. The award selection is subject to final contract and funding negotiations between the DOE and Blue Bird, which are expected to\nconclude at the end of calendar year 2024 or the beginning of calendar year 2025.\n5. Access to Capital — We refinanced our term debt with substantially better terms in November 2023 via execution of a new Credit Agreement (as\ndefined below), which also provides total revolving commitments of $150.0 million. Additional details and discussion of this debt facility can be\nfound in the \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" section of Item 7. \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations\" of this Report.\nOur management believes that Blue Bird is in a leading position in the industry due to our range of alternative power offerings and our strong diesel offering.\nWe believe that our alternative power options will continue to capture market share in the industry as customers realize benefits on the total cost of ownership\nand as the adoption of green technology gains traction. Furthermore, we believe that our product, process, and manufacturing initiatives are appropriately\naligned with our long-term objectives.\nAs a result of the concentration of Blue Bird’s sales in the school bus industry in the U.S. and Canada, our operations are affected by national, state, and local\neconomic and political factors that impact spending for public and, to a lesser extent, private education. Unlike the discretionary portion of school budgets, the\noffering of school bus services is typically viewed as a mandatory part of the public infrastructure across the U.S. and Canada, ensuring that funding for new\nschool buses receives some level of priority in all economic climates. All 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the 13 Canadian Provinces and Territories\nhave fleets of school buses in operation.\nBus Segment\nOur buses are sold through an extensive network of 45 U.S. and Canadian dealer locations that, in their territories, are exclusive to our Company on Type C and\nType D school buses. We also sell directly to major fleet operators, the U.S. government, state governments and authorized dealers in certain limited foreign\ncountries.\nIn fiscal 2024, we sold 9,000 buses throughout the world. Refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” for discussion of our unit volumes.\nApproximately 91% of our buses sold in fiscal 2024 were sold through distributors and dealers. The Company holds no equity or control position in any of the\ndistributors or dealers.\nWe design, engineer, manufacture, and sell three types of buses: (i) Type C school buses, (ii) Type D school buses, and (iii) specialty buses. Each of our Type C\nand Type D buses is manufactured and assembled on its own dedicated purpose-built chassis in Fort Valley, Georgia. Regardless of specifications, all school\nbus bodies that we manufacture include our signature 14-gauge one-piece steel bows roof system, complemented by a rugged and sturdy floor structure.\nSpecialty buses include school buses that are converted to suit applications required by the U.S. government, state and local governments, and various\ncustomers for commercial and export markets.\nThe Blue Bird Micro Bird by Girardin Type A bus is produced through Micro Bird Holdings, Inc., an unconsolidated Canadian joint venture with Girardin\nMinibus JV Inc. (“Micro Bird”), and is sold through our dealer network. This is a smaller bus than the Type C or Type D bus and is produced on a traditional\nchassis provided by either Ford or GM or on an electric chassis produced by a Micro Bird subsidiary.\nParts Segment\nParts are key for routine maintenance, replacement of parts that are damaged in service, and replacement of parts that suffer from wear and tear throughout the\nuseful life of the vehicle.\n5\nIn fiscal 2024, parts sales represented 7.7% of Company net sales.\nWe maintain a parts distribution center in Delaware, Ohio that fills demand for our Company specific and all-makes parts. Additional demand for parts is\nfulfilled by drop ship and direct sales. To fulfill demand for parts that are not maintained at the distribution center, we are linked to approximately 40 suppliers\nthat ship directly to dealers and independent service centers.\nOur network of dealers and authorized repair centers operate over 200 locations to support the fleet across the U.S. and Canada, the majority of which are\nowned by independent operators, to complement their primary locations. Field service engineers provide technical support to our dealer network. Service\nengineers are strategically placed throughout the U.S. and Canada to better serve both dealers and end-customers. The network leverages our parts inventory,\ntechnical training, and online warranty network to address customer service needs.\nOur Industry\nThe school bus serves a critical role in the U.S. and Canadian education systems. In normal years (i.e., those not impacted by public health crises),\napproximately half of the U.S. student population rides a school bus. School buses are distinguished from other types of buses by design characteristics\nassociated with increased safety as mandated by federal, state, and municipal regulations.\nOur management has developed a forecasting model using R.L. Polk vehicle registration data, population of school age children forecasts from the National\nCenter for Education Statistics and bus ridership data collected and published by School Transportation News. Our management utilizes this and other models\nto assess historical experience and to predict demand for school buses in future periods. The ability to purchase new buses to fulfill predicted demand, however,\nis based on the assumption that funds will be available through property taxes and other state and federal sources.\nThe U.S. and Canadian school bus industry for Type C and Type D buses has averaged approximately 30,400 unit sales annually (for the period from October\nthrough September of the subsequent year) between 1985 and 2024. Unit sales for 2024 are projected to be about 23,700, a decrease of 18.3% when compared\nwith 2023. For the first half of the annual period from October 2023 through September 2024, monthly units sales were comparable to those reported in the\nsame period in the previous year but decreased significantly during the second half of the period. Management understands that this decrease primarily resulted\nfrom one of the Company's primary competitors experiencing significant challenges associated with a new product launch that impacted the units that it could\nmanufacture and deliver as it sold approximately 4,700 fewer units during the period from April 2024 through September 2024 when compared with the\ncomparable period in the previous year. Accordingly, management believes that the overall decrease in the annual industry sales experienced during 2024\nprimarily resulted from an event that is expected to be isolated in nature and is not indicative of decreased demand, or other issues, within the overall school\nbus industry.\n6\nSource: Historical registration data are based on R.L. Polk vehicle registration data.\nExcluding the isolated incident that impacted industry sales during 2024 that management does not believe is indicative of decreased demand in the school bus\nindustry, the low point in the industry occurred in 2011, at approximately 23,800 units, and was the result of the decline in the U.S. economy and, in particular,\nthe collapse of the housing market in 2008 and 2009. Property taxes are the primary source of funds for school bus purchases and were impacted in the 2010-\n2011 period as a result of the substantial recession in the U.S. economy in general, and housing market in particular, preceding and during that period.\nThe school bus industry fully recovered from the downturn in 2010-2011 and from 2016 to 2019 operated at levels approximately 10% higher than the long-\nterm average, supported by positive demographic trends, pent-up demand from several years of below-trend bus sales, and a growing tax base for education-\nrelated spending. In 2020, countermeasures taken to battle the the novel coronavirus known as \"COVID-19\" included virtual and hybrid schooling in many\njurisdictions throughout the U.S. and Canada. The uncertainty of when and how schools would open materially affected demand within the Type C and Type D\nschool bus industry in the second half of the Company's fiscal year ended October 3, 2020 (\"fiscal 2020\") that continued into the first half of the Company's\nfiscal year ended October 2, 2021 (\"fiscal 2021'). However, demand for Type C and Type D school buses strengthened substantially throughout the remainder\nof 2021 as COVID-19 vaccines were administered and many school jurisdictions returned to in-person learning environments. Nonetheless, subsequent supply\nchain shortages for certain components, such as microchips and products containing resins, that are critical to the manufacture of school buses, depressed sales\nduring the latter half of fiscal 2021 and throughout fiscal 2022. Although management began to see improvements in the challenges caused by supply chain\ndisruptions during fiscal 2023 and continuing into fiscal 2024, there were still occasional shortages of certain components, as well as ongoing volatility in raw\nmaterials costs.\nOur management believes, based on our models, that Type C and Type D school bus registrations will return to a similar level as has been experienced over\nrecent pre-pandemic years (2016-2019) once the supply chain constraints are fully addressed. We believe that (i) since the start of the pandemic and continuing\nthrough the subsequent period that has been significantly impacted by supply chain disruptions (i.e., the cumulative period beginning in the last half of fiscal\n2020 and continuing through fiscal 2024), the industry has been operating below its historical long-term average of approximately 30,400 unit sales per year,\nand (ii) there are over 148,000 buses in the U.S. and Canadian fleets that have been in service for 15 or more years.\n7\nLocal property and municipal tax receipts are key drivers of school district transportation budgets. Budgets for school bus purchases are directly related to\nproperty tax receipts. Home prices have risen in recent years as home inventories have not met demand, inflation of building materials cost has increased cost\nof construction, and as home-buyers have taken advantage of historically low mortgage rates prior to 2023. However, the forecast for continued appreciation in\nhousing prices is uncertain due to, among others, recent rises in mortgage rates and significant inflationary pressures that have reduced consumer purchasing\npower. Nonetheless, such challenges are not expected to have a significant effect on property tax receipts in the near-term due to the lag that occurs in tax\nauthorities reflecting declining home prices in property tax invoices, and school transportation budgets are expected to directly benefit from larger municipal\nspending budgets.\nIn addition to strong property tax collections, additional funding for school buses is being made available through federal funding programs, including the\nDOE’s Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (\"DERA\") and the EPA’s Clean School Bus Program (\"CSBP\"). The DERA funding program provides approximately\n$100 million annually to fund projects that upgrade, retrofit, or replace diesel engines and equipment with cleaner technologies including gasoline, propane,\nand electric school buses. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CSBP provides $5 billion in funding over five years to school districts and fleet\noperators to replace existing school buses with zero-emission and low-emission models. Specifically, $2.5 billion of the funds are allocated solely for the\npurchase of electric powered buses, while the remaining $2.5 billion of funds are allocated for the purchase of low and zero-emission school buses, including\nbuses that are propane or electric powered.\nIn October 2022, the EPA announced the awarding of approximately $965 million as part of its first round of funding for the CSBP. Over 2,300 zero- and low-\nemission school buses were ordered by award recipients during the first round, of which the Company received orders for over 500 school buses.\nIn January 2024, the EPA announced the recipients of the second round of funding for the CSBP, which awarded nearly $1 billion in the form of competitive\ngrants to 280 school districts and will help award recipients purchase over 2,700 clean school buses, 95% of which will be electric. The Company and its dealer\nnetwork submitted grant applications on behalf of certain school district customers and also assisted certain other school district customers with completing and\nsubmitting their own grant applications. To date, the Company has received over 230 orders for school buses with many of the award recipients yet to spend\ntheir funding.\nIn May 2024, the EPA announced the recipients of the third round of funding for the CSBP, which awarded nearly $900 million in rebates to 530 school\ndistricts and will fund over 3,400 zero- and low-emission school buses, 92% of which will be electric. To date, the Company has received over 220 orders for\nschool buses with many of the award recipients yet to spend their funding.\nIn September 2024, the EPA announced it will provide an additional $965 million for its fourth round of funding for the CSBP, with award recipients for this\nfunding to be announced in May 2025.\nFinally, the Clean Heavy Duty Vehicle Program funded through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs ACT (\"IIJA\") announced over $650 million in funding\nfor electric school buses in April 2024. Recipients for this funding will be announced in January 2025.\nIn addition to federal funding, many states have also announced significant levels of funding for electric school buses. For example, in California, the Zero\nEmission School Bus and Infrastructure program allocated $375 million for qualifying zero-emission school buses and $125 million for infrastructure and\nassociated costs. In New York, the New York School Bus Incentive Program provided $300 million to fund the acquisition of new electric school buses and\ncharging infrastructure.\nAlso, in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (\"IRA\") was signed into law. The IRA authorizes a $369 billion investment in energy security and combating\nclimate change. This funding includes $1 billion in grants for clean Class 6 and 7 heavy-duty vehicles, up to $40,000 in tax credits for zero-emission\ncommercial vehicles, up to $100,000 in tax credits for heavy-duty charging infrastructure, and $2 billion for grants to support electric and fuel cell\nmanufacturing. As discussed previously, in July 2024 the Company was selected to receive an approximate $80 million grant from the DOE to expand the\nCompany’s electric vehicle manufacturing capabilities and related workforce development efforts by converting a former manufacturing site for diesel powered\nmotorhomes into an approximately 600,000 square foot, state-of-the-art electric and low-emissions vehicle manufacturing facility. The grant represents\napproximately 50 percent of the total approximate $160 million investment required to complete the conversion project. The award selection is subject to final\ncontract and funding negotiations between the DOE and Blue Bird, which are expected to conclude at the end of calendar year 2024 or the beginning of\ncalendar year 2025.\nWe believe our leadership in alternative power options, coupled with this external funding, provides a strong foundation to continue to increase sales of our\npropane, gasoline and electric powered bus platforms.\n8\nOur Competitive Strengths\nWe believe that our competitive strengths are derived from the following factors:\nReputation for safety, product quality/reliability/durability, and drivability. Our longevity and reputation in the school bus industry have made us an iconic\nAmerican brand. We are the only principal manufacturer with chassis and body production specifically designed for school bus applications in the U.S. and the\nonly school bus company to offer as a standard feature compliance with industry recognized safety tests - Altoona Testing, Colorado Rack Test and the\nKentucky Pole Test - as a standard specification across our entire product line.\nAlternative powered bus leadership. We believe we are the market leader in propane, gasoline and electric powered buses, having sold approximately 64% of\nall alternative powered school buses from fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2024, we sold 5,213 propane, gasoline, compressed natural gas (\"CNG\")\nand electric powered buses, as market demand for alternative powered buses remained robust. To maintain our leadership position, we continue to expand the\navailable features requested by our customers and during fiscal 2022, added a hydraulic braking system with electronic stability control and a fuel-fired heater\nfor cold-weather markets to our Type C electric powered bus offering. Additionally, during fiscal 2023, we opened the new Electric Vehicle Build-up Center, a\ntransformed 40,000 square foot facility at the Fort Valley, Georgia manufacturing plant, designed to meet increasing demand for electric school buses.\nInnovative product leadership. We believe we have consistently led the school bus industry with innovative product leadership through several industry firsts,\nincluding the first unique school bus chassis and the first OEM-manufactured propane powered bus. In fiscal 2016, years ahead of our competition, we\nlaunched the industry's first gasoline powered Type C bus (utilizing an exclusive Ford engine and transmission and Roush CleanTech fuel usage evaporative\nemissions certification) and we were first-to-market with electronic stability control. In fiscal 2018, we sold our first Type D electric vehicles and in the fiscal\nyear ended September 28, 2019 (\"fiscal 2019\"), we introduced our Type C electric vehicle. In fiscal 2024, we sold 704 Type C and Type D electric vehicles, an\nincrease of 28.9% when compared with prior year.\nStrong distribution model. We have built an extensive, experienced network of 45 dealer locations to distribute our buses across the U.S. and Canada, and\nduring recent years have significantly enhanced our relationships with large fleet operators. Our dealers have an average tenure of more than 30 years with us\nand do not sell competing Type C or Type D school bus products in the areas assigned to them by us.\nHighly-skilled and committed workforce. We benefit from a highly-skilled, committed hourly workforce of approximately 1,613 employees who support our\ncustomized assembly operations at our 900,000 square foot integrated chassis manufacturing and body assembly facility and 340,000 square foot component\nfabrication facility. Our employees are trained to maximize production efficiency by following customized processes developed by us.\nStrong management team. We are led by a highly experienced and committed management team with an established track record in the U.S. and Canadian\nschool bus and heavy-duty vehicle industries.\nSales Volume\nIn fiscal 2024, we sold 9,000 Type C and Type D buses, including 8,844 school buses, 1 export bus and 155 Government Services Administration (\"GSA\")\nbuses. Our Type C school bus accounted for 79% of unit sales and our Type D school bus accounted for 19% of unit sales. GSA and export buses, which can be\nordered with either the Type C or Type D chassis, accounted for the remaining 2% of unit sales.\nOur Dealer Network\nIn fiscal 2024, we sold approximately 91% of our vehicles through our U.S. and Canadian dealer network, currently consisting of 45 dealer locations that, in\ntheir territories, are exclusive to us with Type C and D school buses. School buses sold in the U.S. and Canada through our dealer network are purchased by\nschool districts and private schools, as well as small and medium size contractors that provide services to school districts on a fee basis. Bus purchases and\ncontractor fees are funded through local school district budgets. Purchases of school buses are typically made through a bid process at the district or state level,\nwith dealers coordinating this process. Dealers develop collaborative relationships with school districts, district transportation directors, and key officials in\ntheir states.\nOur dealers have access to financing through a financing product maintained by an independent third party, Huntington Distribution Finance, Inc.\n(\"Huntington\"). We do not assume any balance sheet risk with respect to this type of financing and do not receive any direct economic benefit from\nHuntington.\n9\nOther Distribution Channels\nFleet Operators. We also sell school buses directly to large national fleets that span multiple states and such sales are managed internally by our National\nAccount Sales Team.\nExport Dealers. We regularly monitor opportunities to sell our Type C and Type D buses in either school bus or other configurations in certain limited\ninternational markets and typically sell these products through dealers assigned to those territories.\nU.S. Government; Other Specialty Sales. We also sell buses through our U.S. GSA contract, an expedited procurement procedure designed to meet the needs of\nbus customers authorized to purchase through the GSA contracting offices, including the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, Homeland Security and the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture. This full line of bus models is configured for adult or school bus use. In addition to the base GSA specifications, we offer several\nadditional configurations to provide a wide range of passenger capacities and optional features. We also offer a full line of activity bus and Multi-Function\nSchool Activity Bus (“MFSAB”) products. With varying vehicle sizes, capacities, power choices, and engine types, our bus options enable our customers to\ntailor their transportation solutions to their specific needs, be it transporting a church congregation or shuttling workers to job sites.\nGovernment Contracts\nAs a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to specific regulations and requirements as mandated by our contracts. These regulations include Federal\nAcquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, and the Code of Federal Regulations. We are also subject to routine audits and\ninvestigations by U.S. government agencies such as the Defense Contract Management Agency and Defense Contract Audit Agency. These agencies review\nand assess compliance with contractual requirements, cost structure, cost accounting, and applicable laws, regulations, and standards.\nA portion of our existing U.S. government contracts extend over multiple years and are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional\nappropriations. In addition, our U.S. government contracts generally permit the contracting government agency to terminate the contract, in whole or in part,\neither for the convenience of the government or for default based on our failure to perform under the terms of the contract.\nSuppliers\nWe purchase our engine and transmission components on a single-source basis from major OEMs with sophisticated engineering, production and logistics\ncapabilities, as reflected in the table below:\nComponent OEM Supplier\nDiesel engines Cummins Inc.\nDiesel emissions kits Cummins Inc.\nElectric powertrains and battery systems Accelera (a business segment of Cummins Inc.)\nPropane and gasoline engines and transmissions Ford Motor Company\nTransmissions Allison Transmission\nPropane fueling kits Roush CleanTech\nOur purchasing department continually works to improve our purchasing processes by rationalizing the supplier base and by implementing improved control\nprocesses. We regularly perform supplier audits and, when necessary, will meet with under-performing suppliers in order to enhance performance. At\nSeptember 28, 2024, we had in place long-term supply contracts (addressing both component price and supply) covering approximately 85% of the value of\nour purchases from suppliers, including long-term agreements with our major single-source suppliers.\nAs a result of ongoing supply chain disruptions that began in the latter half of fiscal 2021 and continued through fiscal 2024, we have experienced supplier\nshortages, which were significant at times, of critical components, which prevented the Company from initiating or completing, as applicable, the production\nprocess for certain units that were otherwise scheduled to be delivered to customers during fiscal 2021, fiscal 2022 and, to a lesser extent, fiscal 2023 and fiscal\n2024. For further details and discussion about the impact of these supply chain disruptions, refer to the \"Impact of Supply Chain Constraints on Our Business\"\nsection of Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\n10\nCompetition\nThe U.S. and Canadian school bus industry is highly competitive. Our two principal competitors are Thomas Built Bus and IC Bus. Thomas Built Bus is a\nsubsidiary of Daimler Trucks North America and IC Bus is a subsidiary of International Motors, LLC (formerly known as Navistar, Inc.).\nWe compete primarily on the basis of product diversification, school bus innovation, safety, quality, durability and drivability of our products, the scope and\nstrength of our dealer network and price. As our principal competitors are parts of larger corporations, they may have greater access to financial capital, human\nresources, and business opportunities. Such access, in turn, may be used by such companies to compete with us and others in the industry.\nFacilities\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Macon, Georgia and we have an additional small satellite office in Troy, Michigan. Our Bus segment operates a\nfabrication plant and an integrated chassis manufacturing and body assembly plant in Fort Valley, Georgia, where components for Type C, Type D, and\nspecialty buses are manufactured and assembled, and an inventory warehouse that supplies these plants in Perry, Georgia. Our Parts segment operates a parts\ndistribution center located in Delaware, Ohio. We own our facilities in Fort Valley, Georgia (approximately 1.5 million square feet). We lease facilities in\nMacon, Georgia (approximately 0.1 million square feet), Perry, Georgia (approximately 0.1 million square feet), Troy, Michigan (approximately 5 thousand\nsquare feet) and Delaware, Ohio (approximately 0.1 million square feet). Our Micro Bird joint venture leases its facility (0.2 million square feet) in\nDrummondville, Quebec, Canada.\nIntellectual Property and Technology\nWe seek trademark protection in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. where available and when appropriate. Among other trademarks, we have registered\ntrademark rights in the principal names and designs used by us and Micro Bird in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere. We use these registered marks in connection\nwith all aspects of our branding. However, we also rely on a number of significant unregistered trademarks and other unregistered intellectual property in the\nday-to-day operation of our business. Without the protections afforded by registration, our ability to protect and use our trademarks and other unregistered\nintellectual property may be limited and could negatively affect our business.\nIn addition to trademarks, we rely heavily on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of\nour product designs, manufacturing processes and cost containment steps are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Trade secrets and know-how\ncan be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, suppliers\nand other commercial partners. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, designs and trade secrets by maintaining physical security\nof our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and\nsystems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may\notherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our suppliers or contractors use intellectual property owned by\nothers in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur products must satisfy various legal, environmental, health and safety requirements at federal, state and municipal levels. Compliance with such\nrequirements adds to the costs that must be incurred in order to manufacture a school bus. Failure to comply with such requirements could lead to substantial\nadditional regulatory costs.\nAt the federal level, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) govern the safety of all motor vehicles sold for use in the U.S. More than half of the\nFMVSS regulations apply to school buses. For example, federal regulations require school buses to be painted “school bus yellow” and to be equipped with\nspecific warning and safety devices. School buses are also built with the body on top of chassis frame rails. This so-called “high floor” construction moves the\npassenger compartment above the typical automotive “crash zone” and therefore provides an added measure of safety should a collision occur. Steel rollover\ncages and heavy-duty bumpers are designed to provide incremental protection, in contrast with standard transit buses with “low floor” construction that offer\nlower curb height access with limited or no steel reinforcement.\n11\nAfter a school bus is sold, regulation of the operation of the school bus becomes the responsibility of the state in which it operates. Today, each state has its\nown rules and regulations pertaining to the manufacture, design, operation and safety of the school buses operated in its jurisdiction. As a result, we cannot\nmanufacture to a single set of specifications, but rather must assure that each manufactured bus conforms to the specifications of the particular jurisdiction in\nwhich it will be operated.\nWe must also consider the rules and regulations of foreign jurisdictions. In Canada, where our Micro Bird joint venture operates, school buses are governed by\nthe Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations. These regulations are patterned after the FMVSS regulations, although differences do exist between the two\nregulatory systems.\nSeasonality\nIn the years preceding the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, our business was highly seasonal with school districts buying their new school buses so that they would\nbe available for use on the first day of the school year, typically in mid-August to early September. This resulted in our third and fourth fiscal quarters being our\ntwo busiest quarters, the latter ending on the Saturday closest to September 30. Our quarterly results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity have historically\nbeen, and are likely to be in future periods, impacted by seasonal patterns. Working capital has historically been a significant use of cash during the first fiscal\nquarter due to planned shutdowns and a significant source of cash generation in the fourth fiscal quarter.\nAs a result of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent supply chain constraints, seasonality and working capital trends have become\nunpredictable. Accordingly, seasonality and variations from historical seasonality have impacted the comparison of working capital and liquidity results\nbetween fiscal periods.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and health and safety, including those\nregulating the following: soil, surface water and groundwater contamination; the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and transportation of hazardous\nmaterials; the emission and discharge of materials, including greenhouse gases (“GHG”) into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees. We\nare also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain operations. We have taken various steps to comply with these\nnumerous and sometimes complex laws, regulations and permits. Compliance with environmental requirements historically has not had a material impact on\nour capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures pursuant to such\nrequirements. If we violate or fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to fines, penalties, enforcement actions or lawsuits.\nFor additional information regarding potential environmental issues at Blue Bird’s Fort Valley, Georgia facility, refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Risk Factors\nRelating to Our Business and Industry - Environmental obligations and liabilities could have a negative impact on our financial condition, cash flows and\nprofitability.\"\nEnvironmental laws, regulations, and permits and the enforcement thereof, change frequently and have become more stringent over time. Among other things,\nmore rigorous GHG emission requirements are in various stages of development. For example, the U.S. EPA has promulgated the GHG Reporting Rule, which\nrequires reporting of GHG data and other relevant information from large sources and suppliers in the U.S., and the GHG Tailoring Rule, which requires certain\nfacilities with significant GHG emissions to obtain emissions permits under the authority of the Clean Air Act (typically limited to only the largest stationary\nsources of GHG). The U.S. Congress has also considered imposing additional restrictions on GHG emissions. Any additional regulation of GHG emissions by\neither the U.S. Congress and/or the U.S. EPA could include a cap-and-trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement, or other\nprogram and could subject us to significant costs, including those relating to emission credits, pollution control equipment, monitoring, and reporting, as well\nas increased energy and raw material prices.\nOur facilities and operations could in the future be subject to regulations related to climate change and climate change itself may also have some impact on the\nCompany’s operations. However, these impacts are currently uncertain and the Company cannot presently predict the nature and scope of those impacts.\nResearch and Development\nRefer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards, to the accompanying consolidated financial\nstatements for information on research and development.\n12\nWarranty\nWe provide warranties on virtually all of the buses and parts we sell. Warranties are offered for specific periods of time and mileage, and vary depending upon\nthe type of product and the geographic location of its sale. Pursuant to these warranties, we will repair, replace, or adjust certain parts on a bus that are\ndefective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship during the specified warranty period. In addition to the costs associated with this warranty coverage\nprovided on our vehicles, we also incur costs as a result of field service actions (i.e., safety recalls and service bulletins) and customer satisfaction actions.\nComponent suppliers, in particular major component suppliers such as engines and transmissions, provide warranties on their products.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are engaged in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. Although no assurances can be given about the final outcome of pending legal\nproceedings, at the present time our management does not believe that the resolution or outcome of any of our pending legal proceedings will have a material\nadverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nHuman Capital Management\nBlue Bird delivers market value to stockholders through a people centered human capital strategy, critical to our ability to deliver on our strategic plans. Our\nsuccess in delivering high quality products and solutions for our customers is only achievable through the talent, expertise, and dedication of our workforce.\nAttraction, Development, and Retention\nWe recognize that attracting, developing and retaining skilled talent and promoting a diverse and inclusive culture are essential to maintaining our leadership\nposition in the markets we serve. We offer employees resources to continuously improve their skills and performance with the goal of further cultivating the\ndiverse, entrepreneurial talent to fill key positions. We seek people who are proactive and dedicated, demonstrate an ownership mindset and share our\ncommitment to the pursuit of operational excellence. We continue to make significant investments in talent development and recognize that the growth and\ndevelopment of our employees is essential for our continued success. Employee training and development programs are extensive and comprehensive,\nincluding professional and technical skills training, compliance training, leadership development and management training.\nWe view the diversity of our employees as a strength to better serve our customers and communities. We also believe the diversity of our workforce enables us\nto attract new talent, keeps our employees engaged and productive, and advances ideas reflecting the diversity of our employees' backgrounds, experiences, and\nperspectives. To that end, we have taken various actions to enhance diversity, including partnering with organizations that can support our efforts to identify\nand recruit talented and diverse candidates.\nWe aim to cultivate an inclusive culture that enables employees to feel connected to Blue Bird's three foundational objectives (Care, Delight, Deliver) while\nbeing valued for their contributions. One of the ways in which we seek to promote an inclusive work environment is by supporting the establishment of\nemployee resource groups. These groups allow for collaboration and serve as an open forum for networking, professional development, and mentoring. We are\ncommitted to our efforts to maintain a work environment that is professional, inclusive, and free from discrimination and harassment.\nThe Company’s benefit packages support employee physical, emotional and financial well-being. Employee satisfaction and engagement are measured through\nperiodic surveys.\nHealth and Safety\nSafety is a key priority at all of our facilities and as such, we have invested in a safety and health department staffed with trained medical personnel. The\nCompany’s leaders and managers continuously address safety enhancements, provide regular and ongoing safety training, and use displays located near our\nemployee work areas to provide all employees with safety-related information.\n13\nEmployees\nAt September 28, 2024, we employed 1,948 employees, of which 1,945 were full-time.\nOn May 22, 2023, the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) certified the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied &\nIndustrial Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO, CLC (“USW”) as the exclusive bargaining representative for a bargaining unit of the Company’s\nfull-time and regular part-time production, maintenance, quality control, and warehouse employees at the Company’s Fort Valley and Macon, Georgia\nlocations, with certain exceptions. In May 2024, a three year collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") was executed with the USW, which covers more than\n1,500 employees as of September 28, 2024.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Report, including matters addressed in the section\nentitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” We may face additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or that\nwe currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and\nnotes to the financial statements included in this Report.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business and Industry\nPandemics, epidemics or similar widespread disease or illness outbreaks (collectively, “public health crises”) and their disruptive impact on the supply\nchain have had, and could have in future periods, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows,\nparticularly resulting from reductions in demand for our products, shortages of critical components that hinder the production of units to fulfill sales\norders, disruptions or other developments negatively impacting our workforce or workplace conditions, and/or reduced access to capital markets and\nreductions in liquidity.\nThe degree to which public health crises have impacted our prior, and could impact our future, business, results of operations and financial condition depends\non a number of developments, which are uncertain, including but not limited to the duration, spread and severity of outbreaks, government responses and other\nactions to mitigate the spread of and to treat such outbreaks and when and to what extent business, economic and social activity and conditions are disrupted.\nThese uncertain developments and their resulting impacts have applied, and could apply in future periods, equally to our customers, suppliers and other\npartners and their financial conditions, but adverse effects on these parties would likely also adversely affect us. Such impacts include, among others:\n• reducing demand for school buses due to schools operating totally or partially virtually;\n• triggering significant volatility in capital markets;\n• causing significant disruptions in global supply chains resulting from, among others, labor shortages; the lack of maintenance on, and acquisition of,\ncapital assets during extended global lockdowns; and significant increased demand for consumer products containing certain materials required for the\nproduction of school buses;\n• significantly altering global consumer demand;\n• halting a material number of global manufacturing operations resulting from permanent and temporary plant shut-downs; and\n• changing global workplace conditions resulting from \"shelter-in-place\" orders and \"work from home\" employer policies.\nHowever, we consider the following areas to be the most significant material risks to our business resulting from global health crises and subsequent supply\nchain constraints:\nSupply Chain Disruptions\nWe rely on specialist suppliers, some of which are single-source suppliers, for critical components (including but not limited to engines, transmissions and\naxles) and replacement of any of these components with like parts from another supplier normally requires engineering and testing resources, which entail costs\nand take time. We also currently rely on a limited number of single-source suppliers and/or have limited alternatives for important bus parts such as diesel\nengines and emission components, propane and gasoline engines including powertrains, control modules, steering systems, seats, specialty resins, and other\nkey components. Future\n14\ndelays or interruptions in the supply chain expose us to the following risks which would likely significantly increase our costs and/or impact our ability to meet\ncustomer demand:\n• we or our third-party suppliers may lose access to critical services and components, resulting in an interruption in the manufacture, assembly, and\ndelivery or shipment of our products;\n• we or our third-party suppliers may not be able to respond to unanticipated changes in customer orders;\n• we or our suppliers may have excess or inadequate inventory of materials and components;\n• we or our third-party suppliers may be subject to price fluctuations, including for inbound freight costs that are incurred to transport goods and supplies\nto production facilities, and a lack of long-term supply arrangements for key components;\n• we may experience delays in delivery by our third-party suppliers due to changes in demand from us or their other customers;\n• fluctuations in demand for products that our third-party suppliers manufacture for others may affect their ability or willingness to deliver components to\nus in a timely manner;\n• we may not be able to find new or alternative components or reconfigure our products and manufacturing processes in a timely manner, or at all, if the\nnecessary components become unavailable; and\n• our third-party suppliers may encounter financial hardships unrelated to our demand, which could inhibit their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our\nrequirements.\nDisruptions or other developments negatively impacting our workforce or workplace conditions\nDuring public health crises, federal, state and/or local governments may issue “shelter-in-place” orders, quarantines, executive orders and similar government\norders, restrictions and recommendations for their residents to control the spread of the outbreak. Such orders, restrictions and recommendations could result in\nwidespread closures of businesses, work stoppages, interruptions, slowdowns and delays, work-from-home policies and travel restrictions. While remote work\npolicies may be implemented in response to the health risks that could impact our employees, we do not have the ability to manufacture school buses without\nour on-site manufacturing personnel given the nature of our business. If we were to experience some form of outbreak within our facilities, we would take all\nappropriate measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, which could include a temporary halt in production. Any extended production halt or\ndiminution in production capacity would have a negative impact on our ability to fulfill orders and thus negatively impact our revenues, profitability and cash\nflows.\nReduced profitability and liquidity, resulting in the restructuring of our credit facilities, and/or inadequate access to credit and capital markets\nPublic health crises and the related disruption in the supply chain could materially adversely impact global commercial activity and contribute to significant\nvolatility in financial markets. Supply chain constraints, including any resulting inflationary environment that may develop, could have a material adverse\nimpact on economic and market conditions, potentially reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity.\nSpecifically, future outbreaks could cause a severe contraction in our profits and/or liquidity, which could lead to issues complying with the financial covenants\nin our credit facility. If we were unable to comply with such covenants, we may need to seek amendment for covenant relief or even refinance the debt to a\n\"covenant lite\" or \"no covenant\" structure. We can offer no assurances that we would be successful in amending or refinancing the debt. An amendment or\nrefinancing of our debt could lead to higher interest rates and possible up-front expenses not included in our historical financial statements.\nCurrent and future military conflicts could cause additional supply chain disruptions that could have a material adverse impact on our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nBeginning in fiscal 2022 and continuing through fiscal 2024, the ongoing pressure on the global supply chain was further exacerbated as a result of Russia’s\ninvasion of Ukraine towards the end of February 2022. Both countries have large quantities of minerals and other natural resources that impact commodity\ncosts, such as diesel fuel, steel, rubber and resin, among others, and the conflict has further restricted access to inventory that is at least partially dependent\nupon such commodities, primarily for the Company’s\n15\nsuppliers. Such restricted access has, in certain cases, limited our ability to obtain critical component parts and/or resulted in us paying premium prices for\nfreight and to access the limited supply of inventory.\nThe degree to which this and similar conflicts, including future military conflicts, impact our future business, results of operations, financial condition and cash\nflows will depend on future developments, which are uncertain, including but not limited to the duration of, potential spread and severity of, and additional\ngovernmental actions in response to, such conflicts and when and to what extent normal business and economic activity and conditions resume and continue\nwithout further disruption.\nGeneral economic conditions in the markets we serve have a significant impact on demand for our buses.\nThe school bus market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in the level of spending by municipalities. The principal factors underlying spending by\nmunicipalities are housing prices, property tax levels, municipal budgeting issues and voter initiatives. Demand for school buses is further influenced by overall\nacquisition priorities of municipalities, availability of school bus financing, student population changes, school district busing policies, price and other\ncompetitive factors, fuel prices and environmental regulations. Significant deterioration in the economic environment, housing prices, property tax levels or\nmunicipal budgets could result in fewer new orders for school buses or could cause customers to seek to postpone or reduce orders, which could result in lower\nrevenues, profitability and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to obtain critical components from suppliers, which could disrupt or delay our ability to deliver products to customers.\nWe rely on specialist suppliers for critical components (including engines, transmissions and axles) and replacement of any of these components with like parts\nfrom another supplier normally requires engineering and testing resources, which entail costs and take time. The lack of ready-to-implement alternatives could\ngive such suppliers, some of which have substantial market power, significant leverage over us if these suppliers elected to exert their market power over us,\nwhich leverage could adversely impact the terms and conditions of purchase, including pricing, warranty claims and delivery schedules. We seek to mitigate\nsupply chain risks with our key suppliers by entering into long-term agreements, by commencing contract negotiations with suppliers of critical components\nsignificantly before contract expiration dates, and by diversifying our suppliers of key components with contingency programs when possible.\nIf any of our critical component suppliers limit or reduce the supply of components due to commercial reasons, financial difficulties or other problems, we\ncould experience a loss of revenues due to our inability to fulfill orders. These single-source and other suppliers are each subject to quality and operational\nissues, materials shortages, unplanned demand, reduction in capacity and other factors that may disrupt the flow of goods to us or to our customers, which\nwould adversely affect our business and customer relationships.\nWe have no assurance that our suppliers will continue to meet our requirements. If supply arrangements are interrupted, we may not be able to find another\nsupplier on a timely or satisfactory basis. We may incur significant set-up costs, delays and lag time in manufacturing should it become necessary to replace\nany key suppliers. Our business interruption insurance coverage may not be adequate for any interruptions that we could encounter and may not continue to be\navailable in amounts and on terms acceptable to us. Production delays could, under certain circumstances, result in penalties or liquidated damages in certain of\nour GSA contracts.\nWe rely substantially on single-source suppliers which could materially and adversely impact us if they were to interrupt the supply of component\nparts to us.\nWe currently rely on a limited number of single-source suppliers and/or have limited alternatives for important bus parts such as diesel engines and emission\ncomponents, propane and gasoline engines including powertrains, control modules, air brakes, steering systems, seats, specialty resins, and other key\ncomponents. Shortages and allocations by such manufacturers may result in inefficient operations and a build-up of inventory, which could negatively affect\nour working capital position.\nOur products may not achieve or maintain market acceptance or competing products could gain market share, which could adversely affect our\ncompetitive position.\nWe operate in a highly competitive domestic market. Our principal competitors are Thomas Built Bus (owned by Daimler Trucks North America) and IC Bus\n(owned by International Motors, LLC and former known as Navistar, Inc.), which, at the consolidated level, have potential access to more technical, financial\nand marketing resources than the Company. Our competitors may develop or gain access to products that are superior to our products, develop methods of\nmore efficiently and effectively providing products and services, or adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. IC\nBus and Thomas Built Bus both sell electric powered school buses. This brings both competitors into direct competition with our electric powered product\nofferings. Our competitors may achieve cost savings or be able to withstand a substantial downturn in the market because their businesses are consolidated with\nother vehicle lines. In addition, our competitors could be, and have been in the past, vertically\n16\nintegrated by designing and manufacturing their own components (including engines) to reduce their costs. The school bus market does not have “Buy\nAmerica” regulations, so competitors or new entrants to the market could manufacture school buses in more cost-effective jurisdictions and import them to the\nU.S. to compete with us. Any increase in competition may cause us to lose market share or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could\nresult in reduced sales, profitability and cash flows.\nOur business is cyclical, which has had, and could have future, adverse effects on our sales and results of operations and lead to significant shifts in\nour results of operations from quarter to quarter that make it difficult to project long-term performance.\nThe school bus market historically has been and is expected to resume being, at some point in the relatively near future, cyclical. This cyclicality has an impact\nboth on the school bus industry and also on the comparative analysis of quarterly results of our Company.\nCustomers historically have replaced school buses in lengthy cycles. Moreover, weak macroeconomic conditions can adversely affect demand for new school\nbuses and lead to an overall aging of school bus fleets beyond a typical replacement cycle. To the extent the increase in school bus demand is attributable to\npent-up demand rather than overall economic growth, future school bus sales may lag behind improvements in general economic conditions or property tax\nlevels. During downturns, we may find it necessary to reduce line rates and employee levels due to lower overall demand. An economic downturn may reduce,\nand in the past has reduced, demand for school buses, resulting in lower sales volumes, lower prices and decreased profits.\nPrimarily as a result of the historically seasonal nature of our business, we may operate with negative working capital for significant portions of our fiscal year.\nDuring economic downturns, this tends to result in our utilizing a substantial portion of our cash reserves.\nOur ability to sell our products may be negatively affected by trade policies and tariffs.\nWe import some of our components from China and other foreign countries. Our purchases may be subject to the effects of the U.S. trade policy, including the\nimposition of tariffs and anti-dumping/countervailing duties on these components. We can provide no assurance that our ability to sell our products at\nreasonable margins will not be impaired by the imposition of tariffs or other changes in trade policy which may make it more difficult or more expensive to\npurchase our products.\nAt times we enter into firm fixed-price school bus sales contracts without price escalation clauses that could subject us to reduced gross profits or\nlosses if we have cost overruns or if our costs increase.\nWe sometimes provide fixed-price bids on potential school bus orders months before the expected delivery date. Also, a substantial amount of time may lapse\nbetween the bid date and the date that a school bus sales contract containing a fixed price is executed. The sales bids historically have not included price\nescalation provisions to account for economic fluctuations between the bid date and delivery date. As a result, we have historically been unable to pass along to\nour customers increased costs due to economic fluctuations between these dates as was the case during fiscal 2022 and the first quarter of fiscal 2023, which is\ngenerally not expected to continue as the Company now includes price escalation provisions when bidding on contracts. However, once a sales contract\ncontaining a fixed bus price is executed with a customer, we are generally unable to pass along increased costs resulting from economic fluctuations between\nthe contract date and delivery date. We generally purchase steel at fixed prices up to four quarters in advance, with larger quantities subject to fixed price\npurchase contracts in the more immediate upcoming quarters with quantities decreasing in later quarters, but because we usually do not hedge our other\nprimary raw materials (rubber, aluminum and copper), changes in prices of raw materials can significantly impact operating margins. Our actual costs and any\ngross profit realized on fixed-price sales contracts could vary from the estimated costs on which these contracts were originally based.\nNew laws, regulations or governmental policies regarding environmental, health and safety standards, or changes in existing ones, may have a\nsignificant negative impact on how we do business.\nOur products must satisfy various legal, environmental, health and safety requirements, including applicable emissions and fuel economy requirements.\nMeeting or exceeding government-mandated safety standards can be difficult and costly. Such regulations are extensive and may, in certain circumstances,\noperate at cross purposes. While we are managing our product development and production operations to reduce costs, unique local, state, federal and\ninternational standards can result in additional costs for product development, testing and manufacturing. We depend on third party single-source suppliers to\ncomply with applicable emissions and fuel economy standards in the manufacture of engines supplied to us for our buses. Increased environmental, safety,\nemissions, fuel economy or other regulations may result in additional costs and lag time to introduce new products to market.\n17\nSafety or durability incidents associated with a school bus malfunction may result in loss of school bus sales that could have material adverse effects\non our business.\nThe school bus industry has few participants due to the importance of brand and reputation for safety and durability, compliance with stringent safety and\nregulatory requirements, an understanding of the specialized product specifications in each region and specialized technological and manufacturing know-how.\nIf incidents associated with school bus malfunction transpired that called into question our reputation for safety or durability, it could harm our brand and\nreputation and cause consumers to question the safety, reliability and durability of our products. Lost school bus sales resulting from safety or durability\nincidents could materially adversely affect our business.\nDisruption of our manufacturing and distribution operations would have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash\nflows.\nWe manufacture school buses at facilities in Fort Valley, Georgia and distribute parts from a distribution center located in Delaware, Ohio. If operations at our\nmanufacturing or distribution facilities were to be disrupted for a significant length of time as a result of significant equipment failures, critical component\nshortages, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, adverse weather conditions, labor disputes, cybersecurity attacks or other reasons, we\nmay be unable to fulfill dealer or customer orders and otherwise meet demand for our products, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows. Any interruption in production or distribution capability could require us to make substantial capital\nexpenditures to fulfill customer orders, which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition. We maintain property damage insurance that we\nbelieve to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any\nproduction interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss. However, any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased\ncosts that may be experienced during the disruption of operations. Also, our property damage and business interruption insurance coverage may not be\napplicable or adequate for any such disruption and may not continue to be available in amounts and on terms acceptable to us.\nDisputes with the labor union may adversely affect our ability to operate, as well as impact our financial results.\nMost of our operations employees are represented by the USW with the current CBA set to expire in 2027. Work stoppages, strikes, or other disputes with the\nUSW, arising under the existing CBA or in connection with negotiations of a new collective bargaining agreement, could disrupt production and adversely\naffect our business, results of operations, and cash flows. Any amendments to the existing CBA, or the implementation of new collective bargaining\nagreements, could result in increased labor costs.\nRationalization or restructuring of manufacturing facilities, including plant expansions and system upgrades at our manufacturing facilities, may\ncause production capacity constraints and inventory fluctuations.\nThe rationalization of our manufacturing facilities has at times resulted in, and similar rationalizations or restructurings in the future may result in, temporary\nconstraints upon our ability to produce the quantity of products necessary to fulfill orders and thereby complete sales in a timely manner. In addition, system\nupgrades at our manufacturing facilities that impact ordering, production scheduling and other related manufacturing processes are complex, and could impact\nor delay production targets. A prolonged delay in our ability to fulfill orders on a timely basis could affect customer demand for our products and increase the\nsize of our raw material inventories, causing future reductions in our manufacturing schedules and adversely affecting our results of operations. Moreover, our\ncontinuous development and production of new products will often involve the retooling of existing manufacturing equipment. This retooling may limit our\nproduction capacity at certain times in the future, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the\nexpansion, reconfiguration, maintenance and modernization of existing manufacturing facilities and the start-up of new manufacturing operations, could\nincrease the risk of production delays and require significant investments of capital.\nWe may incur material losses and costs related to product warranty claims.\nWe are subject to product warranty claims in the ordinary course of our business. Our standard warranty covers the bus for one year and certain components for\nup to five years. We attempt to adequately price ongoing warranty costs into our bus purchase contracts; however, our warranty reserves are estimates and if we\nproduce poor quality products, develop new products with deficiencies or receive defective materials or components, we may incur material unforeseen costs in\nexcess of what we have provided for in our contracts or reserved in our financial statements.\nIn addition, we may not be able to enforce warranties and extended warranties received or purchased from our suppliers if such suppliers refuse to honor such\nwarranties or go out of business. Also, a customer may choose to pursue remedies directly under its contract with us over enforcing such supplier warranties. In\nsuch a case, we may not be able to recover our losses from the supplier.\n18\nWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability claims and recalls.\nWe face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in personal injury and/or property\ndamage. If we manufacture a defective product or if component failures result in damages that are not covered by warranty provisions, we may experience\nmaterial product liability losses in the future. In addition, we may incur significant costs to defend product liability claims. We could also incur damages and\nsignificant costs in correcting any defects, lose sales and suffer damage to our reputation. Our product liability insurance coverage may not be adequate for all\nliabilities we could incur and may not continue to be available in amounts and on terms acceptable to us. Significant product liability claims could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, the adverse publicity that may result from a product liability\nclaim or perceived or actual defect with our products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully.\nWe are subject to potential recalls of our products from customers to cure manufacturing defects or in the event of a failure to comply with customers’ order\nspecifications or applicable regulatory standards, as well as potential recalls of components or parts manufactured by suppliers that we purchase and\nincorporate into our school buses. We may also be required to remedy or retrofit buses in the event that an order is not built to a customer’s specifications or\nwhere a design error has been made. Significant retrofit and remediation costs or product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,\nresults of operations and cash flows.\nA failure to renew dealer agreements or cancellation of, or significant delay in, new bus orders may result in unexpected declines in revenue and\nprofitability.\nWe rely to a significant extent on our dealers to sell our products to the end consumer. A loss of one or more significant dealers or a reduction in the market\nshare of existing dealers would lead to a loss of revenues that could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur dealer agreements are typically for a five-year term; however, the dealer can usually cancel the agreement for convenience without penalty upon 90 days’\nnotice. While most of our dealers have been purchasing from us for more than three decades, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to renew our\ndealer agreements on favorable terms, or at all, at their scheduled expiration dates. If we are unable to renew a contract with one or more of our significant\ndealers, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected until an alternative solution is implemented (e.g., a new dealer or combining the\nterritory with another, existing Blue Bird dealer). If dealer agreements are terminated with one or more of our top 10 dealers, significant orders are canceled or\ndelayed or we incur a significant decrease in the level of purchases from any of our top 10 dealers, our sales and operating results would be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, our new bus orders are subject to potential reduction, cancellation and/or significant delay. Although dealers generally only order buses from us\nafter they have a firm order from a school district, orders for buses are also generally cancellable until 14 weeks prior to delivery.\nChanges in laws or regulations related to the manufacture of school buses, or a failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely\naffect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments, including non-U.S. governments, related to the manufacture of our\nschool buses. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly, which could negatively impact\nour business and results of operations. Our products must satisfy a complex compliance scheme due to variability in and potentially conflicting local, state,\nfederal and international laws and regulations. The cost of compliance may be substantial in a period due to the potential for modification or customization of\nour school buses in any of the 50 plus jurisdictions in which our buses are sold. In addition, if we expand into more international jurisdictions, we could\npotentially incur additional costs in order to tailor our products to the applicable local law requirements of such jurisdictions. Further, we must comply with\nadditional regulatory requirements applicable to us as a federal contractor for our GSA contracts, which increase our costs. GSA contracts are also subject to\naudit and increased inspections and costs of compliance. Any potential penalties for non-compliance with laws and regulations may not be covered by\ninsurance that we carry.\nEnvironmental obligations and liabilities could have a negative impact on our financial condition, cash flows and profitability.\nPotential environmental issues have been identified at our facility in Fort Valley, Georgia, including the solid waste management units at the facility’s old\nlandfill. Potential remediation costs and obligations could require the expenditure of capital and, if greater than expected, or in excess of applicable insurance\ncoverage, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. We are cooperating with the Georgia Environmental\nProtection Division and have conducted a site-wide investigation under the current hazardous waste management law. All investigations of suspect areas have\nbeen completed. Implementation of a corrective action plan has commenced, which will consist of re-surfacing the landfill cap, re-grading a portion of\n19\nthe lot in close proximity to the landfill, ongoing monitoring, and ground water use restrictions for the old landfill. There are currently no proposed remediation\nactions to be included in the corrective action plan. Based on the data generated from the latest site investigation, we believe our environmental risks have been\nreduced substantially, but not eliminated.\nOur future competitiveness and ability to achieve long-term profitability depend on our ability to control costs, which requires us to improve our\norganization continuously and to increase operating efficiencies and reduce costs.\nIn order to operate profitably in our market, we are continually transforming our organization and rationalizing our operating processes. Our future\ncompetitiveness depends upon our continued success in implementing these initiatives throughout our operations. While some of the elements of cost reduction\nare within our control, others, such as commodity costs, regulatory costs and labor costs, depend more on external factors, and there can be no assurance that\nsuch external factors will not materially adversely affect our ability to reduce our costs.\nOur operating results may vary widely from period to period due to the sales cycle, seasonal fluctuations and other factors.\nOur orders with our dealers and customers generally require time-consuming customization and specification. We incur significant operating expenses when we\nare building a bus prior to sale or designing and testing a new bus. If there are delays in the sale of buses to dealers or customers, such delays may lead to\nsignificant fluctuations in results of operations from quarter to quarter, making it difficult to predict our financial performance on a quarterly basis. Further, if\nwe were to experience a significant amount of cancellations of or reductions in purchase orders, it would reduce our future sales and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to seasonal and other fluctuations. In particular, we have historically experienced higher revenues during the third and fourth quarters\nwhen compared with the first and second quarters during each fiscal year. This seasonality is caused primarily by school districts ordering more school buses\nprior to the beginning of a school year. Our ability to meet customer delivery schedules is dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, access\nto components and raw materials, an adequate and capable workforce, assembling/engineering expertise for certain projects and sufficient manufacturing\ncapacity. The availability of these factors may in some cases be subject to conditions outside of our control. A failure to deliver in accordance with our\nperformance obligations may result in financial penalties under certain of our GSA contracts and damage to existing customer relationships, damage to our\nreputation and a loss of future bidding opportunities, which could cause the loss of future business and could negatively impact our financial performance.\nOur defined benefit pension plan may become underfunded in future periods and pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a\nreduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors, including weak performance of financial markets, decreasing interest rates and\ninvestments that do not achieve adequate returns.\nOur defined benefit pension plan currently holds a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities. Our future funding requirement for our frozen\ndefined benefit pension plan (“Pension Plan”) qualified with the Internal Revenue Service depends upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for\nthis plan, the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels, the level of benefits provided for by the Pension Plan and any changes in government laws\nand regulations. Future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns, as\nother factors are held constant. If future funding requirements increase, we would be required to contribute more funds, which would negatively impact our\ncash flows.\nOur current or future indebtedness could impair our financial condition and reduce the funds available to us for growth or other purposes. Our debt\nagreements impose certain operating and financial restrictions, with which failure to comply could result in an event of default that could adversely\naffect our business.\nWe have substantial indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund the interest payments on our outstanding borrowings under\nour credit facility and other debt service obligations and keep us in compliance with the covenants under our debt agreements or to fund our other liquidity\nneeds, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.\nWe can provide no assurance that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service\nobligations or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, which may impose significant operating and\nfinancial restrictions on us and could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs; obtain standby letters of credit, bank\nguarantees or performance bonds required to bid on or secure certain customer contracts; make strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into alliances;\nwithstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general; engage in business activities, including future opportunities for growth, that may be in\nour interest; and plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.\n20\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, or if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements, we will be in default and, as a result, our\nlenders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, could terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against\nthe assets securing our borrowings, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nIn addition, we and certain of our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness, including additional secured and/or unsecured indebtedness.\nAlthough the terms of our debt agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of\nqualifications and exceptions, and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be significant. Incurring additional indebtedness\ncould increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness, including our ability to service our indebtedness.\nOur profitability depends on achieving certain minimum school bus sales volumes and margins. If school bus sales deteriorate, our results of\noperations, financial condition, and cash flows will suffer.\nOur profitability requires us to maintain certain minimum school bus sales volumes and margins. As is typical for a vehicle manufacturer, we have significant\nfixed costs and, therefore, changes in our school bus sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on profitability. If our school bus sales decline to\nlevels significantly below our assumptions, due to a financial downturn, recessionary conditions, changes in consumer confidence, geopolitical events, inability\nto secure an adequate supply of critical components, limited access to financing or any other reason or factors that would limit our ability to produce sufficient\nquantities of school buses, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be materially adversely affected.\nIf Huntington Distribution Finance, Inc. cannot provide financial services to our dealers and customers to acquire our products, our sales and results\nof operations could deteriorate.\nOur dealers and customers benefit from their relationships with Huntington, which provides (i) floorplan financing for certain of our network dealers and (ii) a\nmodest amount of vehicle lease financing to school districts. Although we neither assume any balance sheet risk nor receive any direct economic benefit from\nHuntington, we could be materially adversely affected if Huntington was unable to provide this financing and our dealers were unable to obtain alternate\nfinancing, at least until a replacement for Huntington was identified. Huntington faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its\naccess to capital and negatively affect its business and operations and its ability to provide financing and leasing to our dealers and customers. Because\nHuntington serves as an additional source of leasing and financing options for dealers and customers, an impairment of Huntington’s ability to provide such\nfinancial services could negatively affect our efforts to expand our market penetration among customers that rely on these financial services to acquire new\nschool buses and dealers that seek financing.\nWe rely heavily on trade secrets to gain a competitive advantage in the market and the unenforceability of our nondisclosure agreements may\nadversely affect our operations.\nHistorically, we have not relied upon patents to protect our design or manufacturing processes or products. Instead, we rely significantly on maintaining the\nconfidentiality of our trade secrets and other information related to our operations. Accordingly, we require all executives, engineering employees and suppliers\nto sign a nondisclosure agreement to protect our trade secrets, business strategy and other proprietary information. If the provisions of these agreements are\nfound unenforceable in any jurisdiction in which we operate, the disclosure of our proprietary information may place us at a competitive disadvantage. Even\nwhere the provisions are enforceable, the confidentiality clauses may not provide adequate protection of our trade secrets and proprietary information in every\nsuch jurisdiction.\nWe require training sessions for our employees regarding the protection of our trade secrets, business strategy and other proprietary information. Our employee\ntraining may not provide adequate protection of our trade secrets and proprietary information.\nWe may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property rights, including trade secrets and know-how, without our authorization or from\nindependently developing intellectual property that is the same as or similar to our intellectual property, particularly in those countries where the laws do not\nprotect our intellectual property rights as fully as in the U.S. The unauthorized use of our trade secrets or know-how by third parties could reduce or eliminate\nany competitive advantage we have developed, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business or increase our expenses as we attempt to enforce our\nrights.\nOur intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged.\nWe rely on a number of significant unregistered trademarks and other unregistered intellectual property in the day-to-day operation of our business. Without the\nprotections afforded by registration, our ability to protect and use our trademarks and other unregistered intellectual property may be limited, which could\nnegatively affect our business in the future. In addition, while we have not faced\n21\nintellectual property infringement claims from others in recent years, in the event successful infringement claims are brought against us, particularly claims\n(under patents or otherwise) against our product design or manufacturing processes, such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition or results of operation.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe sell the majority of our buses and parts in U.S. Dollars. Our foreign customers have exposures to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates\non our sales in that region. Foreign currency exchange rates can have material adverse effects on our foreign customers' ability to purchase our products.\nFurther, we have certain sales contracts that are transacted in Canadian Dollars. While we generally aim to hedge any such transactions, that may not always be\nthe case. As a result, foreign currency fluctuations and the associated remeasurements and translations could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe manufacture of our Type A buses is conducted by the Micro Bird joint venture that we do not control and cannot operate solely for our benefit.\nThe manufacture of Type A buses is carried out by a 50/50 Canadian joint venture, Micro Bird, which we do not control or consolidate. In joint ventures, we\nshare ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do and may\ncompete with us outside the joint venture. Joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit.\nOperating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and\nmaking decisions. In joint ventures, we are required to foster our relationships with co-owners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture, and if\na co-owner changes or relationships deteriorate, our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected. The benefits from a successful joint\nventure are shared among the co-owners, so that we do not receive all the benefits from our joint venture.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to operate our business and implement our strategies depends, in part, on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. Our future\nsuccess depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including manufacturing personnel, sales professionals and engineers. The\nunexpected loss of services of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the\noperation of our business.\nWhile we have enjoyed good relations and a collaborative approach with our work force, employment relationships can deteriorate over time. Given the extent\nto which we rely on our employees, any significant deterioration in our relationships with our key employees or overall workforce could materially harm us.\nWork stoppages or instability in our relationships with our employees could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain\nrelationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues that would adversely affect our operations. In addition, local economic conditions in the Central\nGeorgia area (where our principal manufacturing facilities are located) may impact our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nOur worker’s compensation insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities.\nAlthough we maintain a workers’ compensation insurance stop loss policy to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur resulting from work-related injuries\nto our employees over our self-insured limit, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities as we incur the costs and expenses\nup to our self-insured limit. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future health and safety laws and regulations. These\ncurrent or future laws and regulations may negatively impact our manufacturing operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result\nin substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\n22\nWe may need additional financing to execute our business plan and fund operations, which additional financing may not be available on reasonable\nterms or at all.\nOur ability to execute current and future business plans, including the potential for future market and/or product expansion and opportunities for future\ninternational growth, may require substantial additional capital. We will consider raising additional funds through various financing sources, including the sale\nof our equity securities or the procurement of additional commercial debt financing. However, there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on\ncommercially reasonable terms, if at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to execute our growth strategy, and\noperating results may be adversely affected. Any additional debt financing will increase expenses and must be repaid regardless of operating results and may\ninvolve restrictions limiting our operating flexibility. If we issue equity securities to raise additional funds, the percentage ownership of our existing\nstockholders will be reduced, and our stockholders may experience additional dilution in net book value per share. If the amount of capital we are able to raise\nfrom financing activities, together with our revenues from operations, are not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, we may be required to decrease the pace of,\nor eliminate, our future product offerings and market expansion opportunities and potentially curtail operations.\nInterest rates could change substantially, materially impacting our profitability.\nOur borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at variable market rates and expose us to interest rate risk. We monitor and manage this exposure as part\nof our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of interest rates and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our business.\nHowever, changes in interest rates cannot always be predicted, hedged, or offset with price increases to eliminate earnings volatility.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our operating results.\nWe have a substantial amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet, concentrated in our bus segment and specifically related to the\ndealer network and our trade name. These long-lived assets are required to be reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if potential interim\nindicators exist that could result in impairment. If any business conditions or other factors cause profitability or cash flows to significantly decline, we may be\nrequired to record a non-cash impairment charge, which could adversely affect our operating results. Events and conditions that could result in impairment\ninclude a prolonged period of global economic weakness, a further decline in economic conditions or a slow, weak economic recovery, sustained declines in the\nprice of our common stock, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, adverse changes in the market share of our products, adverse changes in interest\nrates or other factors leading to reductions in the long-term sales or profitability that we expect.\nThe failure of our information technology networks and systems could result in the inoperability of our critical business processes and substantially\ndisrupt our operations.\nWe utilize and rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic\ninformation, and to manage or support a wide variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain management, manufacturing, invoicing and\ncollection of payments from our dealer network and customers, among others. The operation of these information technology systems and networks, and the\nprocessing and maintenance of this electronic information, is critical to our business operations and strategy. These systems and networks may be vulnerable to\ndamage, disruptions, shutdowns or outages while upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware or as a result of hardware failures; software errors or\nmalfunctions; third-party service provider outages; power outages; computer viruses; telecommunication or utility failures; errors or malfeasance by\nemployees, contractors and others who have access to our networks and systems; or natural disasters or other catastrophic events, among others.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could compromise our systems and contribute to the loss or corruption of our electronic information, which may reduce\nthe competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in information technology. Any extended systems downtime and/or data loss or corruption\ncould significantly disrupt our ability to meet operational and financial targets and/or requirements, which may adversely affect our business, operating results,\nfinancial condition, cash flows and stock price. While we maintain business continuity and disaster recovery plans and conduct training and tests to respond to\nthese types of events, we can provide no assurance that these measures would be sufficient to prevent or mitigate the impact of a prolonged information\ntechnology failure or that we would not experience material losses if such an event was to occur.\nA cybersecurity incident could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of our proprietary electronic information.\nWe are highly dependent on information technology systems and networks to conduct our business and manage critical operations. We collect, store and\nprocess sensitive data, including intellectual property, material non-public financial information, proprietary\n23\nbusiness information, the proprietary business information of our dealers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our employees, in data\ncenters and in our information technology systems. Despite implementing robust security measures, there is always a risk of a cybersecurity incident, including\na data breach, hack, ransomware attack, social engineering scheme and/or other malicious activity aimed at compromising the confidentiality, integrity and/or\navailability of our networks, systems and/or electronic information.\nA cybersecurity incident could result in significant business interruptions, operational delays, or shutdowns, negatively affecting our ability to serve our\ncustomers and meet operational and financial targets and/or requirements. Additionally, unauthorized access to our networks and systems could lead to the\ntheft, destruction, disclosure, alteration or loss of sensitive electronic information, potentially causing reputational harm, loss of customer and/or supplier trust,\nand financial loss. It could also result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information.\nWe may be required to expend substantial resources on investigation, remediation, and mitigation efforts, including enhancements to our security measures,\nwhich could impact our financial performance.\nA cybersecurity program, leveraging industry best-practice frameworks for guidance, has been developed and maintained to help prevent and defend against\nthese cybersecurity threats. To help cover potential damage and financial loss due to a cybersecurity incident, we maintain cybersecurity and other insurance\npolicies that align with our disaster recovery and incident response plans. However, we can provide no assurance that our cybersecurity program is sufficient to\nprevent or mitigate every cybersecurity threat that exists. We can also provide no assurance that our insurance policies will cover every cybersecurity incident\nand/or will be adequate to cover all the costs related to significant security attacks or disruptions resulting from such attacks. Finally, such insurance policies\nmay not continue to be available in amounts and/or on terms acceptable to us.\nOther Risk Factors Relating to an Investment in Our Common Stock\nOur only significant asset is ownership of 100% of the capital stock of School Bus Holdings and we do not currently intend to pay cash dividends on\nour common stock. Consequently, stockholders' ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common\nstock.\nWe have no direct operations and no significant assets other than the ownership of 100% of the capital stock of School Bus Holdings. We depend on School\nBus Holdings and its subsidiaries for distributions, loans and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations, including our\nexpenses as a publicly traded company, and to pay any dividends with respect to our common stock, if any. Legal and contractual restrictions in agreements\ngoverning our current indebtedness, as well as our financial condition and operating requirements, may limit our ability to obtain cash from School Bus\nHoldings and its subsidiaries. While we are permitted to pay dividends in certain circumstances under our credit facility, as long as we are in compliance with\nour obligations under the credit facility, we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock. Any future dividend payments are within the absolute\ndiscretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditure\nrequirements, financial condition, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions with respect to payment of dividends, business opportunities, anticipated cash\nneeds, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock.\nShare repurchases are subject to limitations under applicable laws and the terms of our Credit Agreement (defined below). They are also subject to the\ndiscretion of our Board of Directors and are determined after considering then-existing conditions, including earnings, other operating results and capital\nrequirements and cash deployment alternatives. Our share repurchase activity could vary from historical practices or our stated expectations. In addition, the\ntiming and amount of share repurchases under Board of Directors approved share repurchase plans may differ from stated expectations and is within the\ndiscretion of management and will depend on many factors, including our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future or to borrow\nmoney from available financing sources, our results of operations, capital requirements and applicable law.\n24\nShares of our common stock are reserved for current and future issuance, which would have the effect of diluting the existing shareholders.\nOn May 28, 2015 and March 12, 2020, we registered 3,700,000 and 1,500,000 common stock shares, respectively, representing the shares of common stock\nissuable under the Blue Bird Corporation 2015 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”) and, pursuant to Rule 416(c) under the Securities Act of\n1933, as amended, an indeterminable number of additional shares of common stock issuable under the Incentive Plan, as such amount may be adjusted as a\nresult of stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations, anti-dilution provisions and similar transactions. At September 28, 2024, there were 594,232 common\nstock shares remaining to be issued under the Incentive Plan.\nAdditionally, on November 16, 2021, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 that allows the Company to sell up to $200.0 million in the aggregate of\nany combination of several different types of securities, including shares of common stock, from time to time in one or more offerings. The number of shares is\nindeterminable and is dependent on whether or not common stock is a security being sold in a future offering and, if so, the amount of capital we are attempting\nto raise and the price at which the shares of common stock can be sold. Any such sale of shares may also be adjusted as a result of stock splits, stock dividends,\nrecapitalizations, anti-dilution provisions and similar transactions.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover\nattempt.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our\nmanagement without the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions include:\n• no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n• the exclusive right of our Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation,\ndeath, or removal of a director with or without cause by stockholders, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of\nDirectors;\n• subject to any rights of holders of existing preferred shares, if any, the ability of our Board of Directors to determine whether to issue shares of our\npreferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval,\nwhich could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n• a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our\nstockholders;\n• the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the Board of Directors, the chief executive officer, or the\nBoard of Directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of\ndirectors;\n• limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n• controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of stockholder meetings;\n• providing for a staggered board, in which the members of the Board of Directors are divided into three classes to serve for a period of three years from\nthe date of their respective appointment or election;\n• permitting the removal of directors with or without cause by stockholders voting a majority of the votes cast if, at any time and for so long as,\nAmerican Securities LLC beneficially owns, in the aggregate, capital stock representing at least 40% of the outstanding shares of our common stock;\n• advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors or to propose matters to be\nacted upon at a stockholders’ meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the\nacquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our Company;\n• requiring an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of our entire Board of Directors and by the holders of at least 66.67% of the voting power of\nour outstanding voting stock in order to adopt an amendment to our certificate of incorporation if, at any time and for so long as, American Securities\nLLC beneficially owns, in the aggregate, capital stock representing at least 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock; and\n25\n• requiring an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of our entire Board of Directors or by the holders of at least 66.67% of the voting power of our\noutstanding voting stock to amend our bylaws if, at any time and for so long as, American Securities LLC beneficially owns, in the aggregate, capital\nstock representing at least 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of our Company or changes in our Board of Directors and\nmanagement.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which\nprevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the\nholders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of\ndelaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could\nalso affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nDefinitions\nThe SEC defines several key terms included in the below cybersecurity discussion as follows:\nInformation systems are electronic information resources, owned or used by a registrant, including physical or virtual infrastructure controlled by such\ninformation resources, or components thereof, organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of the\nregistrant's information to maintain or support the registrant's operations.\nA cybersecurity threat is any potential unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrant's information systems that may result in adverse effects on\nthe confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrant's information systems or any information residing therein.\nA cybersecurity incident is an unauthorized occurrence, or a series of related unauthorized occurrences, on or conducted through a registrant's information\nsystems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrant's information systems or any information residing therein.\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program that is designed to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of\nCompany electronic information. The Company’s cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into the overarching enterprise risk management\nprogram to ensure that cybersecurity risk is properly mitigated. Crucial parts of the Company’s cybersecurity risk management program include the following:\n• Regular vulnerability scans, penetration tests and risk assessments designed to identify weaknesses in the Company’s systems and processes.\n• A Business Impact Analysis and Business Continuity Plan to identify potential threats, their potential impact on the business, and plans to respond,\ncommunicate and continue operations.\n• An Incident Response Plan that includes detailed procedures for detecting, reporting and addressing security incidents in an organized and effective\nmanner.\n• A Disaster Recovery Plan that details the steps we must take to respond and recover from a disaster event.\n• A Third-Party Risk Management Program that identifies and reduces risks presented by vendors and suppliers.\n• The development and maintenance of a Cybersecurity Risk Register to identify and monitor security risks and treatment plans.\n26\nWe utilize a third-party cybersecurity consulting firm that provides strategic and tactical security support, including, but not limited to, a Virtual Chief\nInformation Security Officer (\"vCISO\"). The vCISO works with and provides strategic guidance to the Vice President of Information Technology, including\npreparing and/or presenting key information to the Company's Audit Committee or Board or Directors, as necessary.\nTo date, there have been no risks identified from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, the Company, including its business strategy, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nGovernance\nThe Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for cybersecurity risks to the Company. It is informed of the status of the cybersecurity risk management\nprogram at least quarterly and is briefed on strategic objectives and high priority risks and incidents as they arise.\nThe Audit Committee oversees management’s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program. The Audit Committee also receives quarterly\nreports from various members of management, including information technology and security specialists, on the state of the cybersecurity risk management\nprogram. The periodic updates include, but are not limited to, strategic objectives, key initiatives, key metrics, and noteworthy cybersecurity risks. In addition,\nmanagement will update the Audit Committee regarding any significant cybersecurity incidents in a timely manner.\nA Cybersecurity Materiality Assessment Committee has been formed to review material cybersecurity risks and threats and determine materiality criteria and\nthresholds for incidents. This committee is comprised of senior management from multiple departments including legal, information technology, security,\nhuman resources, finance and more. The Vice President of Information Technology, responsible for the development of the cybersecurity risk management\nprogram, has extensive experience across information technology within the automotive manufacturing industry. The security team provided by the\ncybersecurity consulting firm contracted by the Company has a wide breadth of expertise across core cybersecurity disciplines including governance, risk,\ncompliance, and security architecture and engineering. This security team has combined experience exceeding 30 years and numerous industry recognized\nsecurity certifications. The vCISO, who is responsible for the oversight of, and strategic guidance for, the security team, has over 20 years of related experience\nand is a Certified Information Security Manager and a Certified Information Systems Security Professional.\nTo support these efforts, we follow the guidance of numerous security agencies, industry resources and frameworks, including, but not limited to, the Center for\nInternet Security Critical Security Controls v8 and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. A comprehensive library of policies and procedures has been developed\nleveraging security best practices and industry standards to define the security program. In addition, a cybersecurity roadmap has been developed and is\nmaintained to execute on the strategic plan and expand and mature the overall program.\nItem 2. Properties\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Macon, Georgia and we have an additional small satellite office in Troy, Michigan. Our Bus segment operates a\nfabrication plant and an integrated chassis manufacturing and body assembly plant in Fort Valley, Georgia, where components for Type C, Type D, and\nspecialty buses are manufactured and assembled, and an inventory warehouse that supplies these plants in Perry, Georgia. Our Parts segment operates a parts\ndistribution center located in Delaware, Ohio. We own our facilities in Fort Valley, Georgia (approximately 1.5 million square feet). We lease facilities in\nMacon, Georgia (approximately 0.1 million square feet), Perry, Georgia (approximately 0.1 million square feet), Troy, Michigan (approximately 5 thousand\nsquare feet) and Delaware, Ohio (approximately 0.1 million square feet). Our Micro Bird joint venture leases its facility (0.2 million square feet) in\nDrummondville, Quebec, Canada.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be a party to various legal proceedings from time to time. We do not believe that there is any pending or threatened\nproceeding against us, which, if determined adversely, would have a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot Applicable.\n27\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOur common stock is currently quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “BLBD.” At November 20, 2024, there were 66 holders of record of\nthe Company’s common stock. Management of the Company believes that there are in excess of 34,000 beneficial holders of our common stock.\nDividends\nWe have not paid any dividends on our common stock to date. It is our present intention to retain any earnings for use in our business operations and,\naccordingly we do not anticipate that the Board of Directors will declare any dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock. In addition, certain of\nour loan agreements restrict the payment of dividends.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\nThe following table provides information for all equity compensation plans at September 28, 2024, under which the equity securities of the Company were\nauthorized for issuance:\n(c) Number of Securities\nRemaining Available for Future\nIssuance Under Equity\n(a) Number of Securities to be Compensation Plans (excluding\nIssued Upon Exercise of (b) Weighted Average Exercise securities\nOutstanding Options, Price of Outstanding Options, reflected in\nPlan Category (1) Warrants, and Rights Warrants and Rights column (a)) (2)\nEquity compensation plans\napproved by security holders 278,678 $ 17.58 594,232\n(1) There are no equity compensation plans not approved by stockholders.\n(2) Securities available for future issuance may take the form of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted\nstock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, incentive bonus awards, other cash-based awards, and/or other stock-based awards.\nPerformance Graph\nThe following performance graph and related information is not deemed to be “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A\nor 14C under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will\nnot be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to\nthe extent the Company specifically incorporates it by reference into such a filing: the SEC requires the Company to include a line graph presentation\ncomparing cumulative five year common stock returns with a broad-based stock index and either a nationally recognized industry index or an index of peer\ncompanies selected by the Company. The Company has chosen to use the Russell 3000 Index as the broad-based index. The following stock performance graph\ncompares the total stockholder return of an investment of $100 in cash from September 28, 2019 through September 28, 2024.\n28\nCumulative Total Return\nSeptember 28, October 3, October 2, October 1, September 30, September 28,\n2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\nBlue Bird Corporation 100 63 112 44 112 254\nRussell 3000 100 113 149 120 142 189\nPeer Group 100 113 162 102 135 153\n(1) Peer Group\nAstec Industries Inc. Commercial Vehicle Group Inc. Douglas Dynamics, Inc.\nFederal Signal Corp. NFI Group Inc. Rev Group Inc.\nThe Shyft Group, Inc. Thor Industries Inc. Wabash National Corp\nOther than Lion Electric Company, Blue Bird is the only publicly traded school bus company. As such, our peer group is not constructed on a line-of-business\nbasis. Given our business model and brand recognition, we believe that the specialty vehicle OEMs and branded industrial companies that we have selected\nrepresent the most comparable publicly traded companies to Blue Bird. While Lion Electric Company is within Blue Bird's peer group, it is not included in the\nchart above as it has only been publicly traded since May 2021. Additionally, NFI Group Inc. is traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange in Canadian Dollars.\nThe hypothetical investment in NFI Group Inc. assumes investing $100 U.S. Dollars to acquire shares on September 28, 2019. The value of such shares at each\nof the above dates is then translated from Canadian Dollars to U.S. Dollars for inclusion in the peer group index.\nIssuer Repurchase of Equity Securities\nOn January 31, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized and approved a share repurchase program for up to $60 million of outstanding shares\nof the Company’s common stock over a period of 24 months, expiring January 31, 2026. Under the share repurchase program, the Company may repurchase\nshares through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance\nwith applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n29\nThe Board of Directors also authorized the Company to enter into written trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended. Adopting a trading plan that satisfies the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it might otherwise be\nprevented from doing so due to self-imposed trading blackout periods or pursuant to insider trading laws. The Company may from time to time enter into Rule\n10b5-1 trading plans to facilitate the repurchase of its common stock pursuant to its share repurchase program.\nThe timing, manner, price, and number of shares to be repurchased will be at the discretion of Company management. The repurchase program does not\nobligate Blue Bird to acquire any specific amount of securities and can be modified or terminated at any time without notice. Repurchases under this program\nare expected to be funded from one or a combination of existing cash balances, future free cash flow, or indebtedness.\nShare repurchase activity under the share repurchase program, on a trade date basis, for each month in the quarter ended September 28, 2024, was as follows:\nApproximate dollar\nTotal number of shares value of shares that may\nrepurchased as part of yet be purchased under\nTotal number of shares Average price paid per publicly announced the plans or programs (in\nPeriod by fiscal month repurchased share (in dollars) (1) plans or programs (2) millions)\nJune 30 - July 27, 2024 — $ — — $ 60.0\nJuly 28 - August 24, 2024 20,000 48.86 20,000 59.0\nAugust 25 - September 28, 2024 181,818 49.29 181,818 50.1\nTotal 201,818 201,818\n(1) Average price paid per share includes costs associated with the repurchases, except for the cost of any associated excise tax.\n(2) All share repurchases were made under the $60.0 million repurchase program approved on January 31, 2024 and announced on February 1, 2024 that expires on January 31,\n2026\nItem 6. [Reserved]\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company should be read in conjunction with the Company’s\naudited financial statements for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2024, September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 and related notes appearing elsewhere in\nthis Report. Our actual results may not be indicative of future performance. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements and involves\nnumerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed or incorporated by reference in the sections of this Report titled “Special Note\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.” Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nCertain monetary amounts, percentages and other figures included in this Report have been subjected to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown as\ntotals in certain tables may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them, and figures expressed as percentages in the text may not total\n100% or, as applicable, when aggregated, may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the percentages that precede them.\nExecutive Overview\nBlue Bird is the leading independent designer and manufacturer of school buses. Our longevity and reputation in the school bus industry have made Blue Bird\nan iconic American brand. We distinguish ourselves from our principal competitors by dedicating our focus to the design, engineering, manufacture and sale of\nschool buses, and related parts. As the principal manufacturer of chassis and body production specifically designed for school bus applications in the U.S., Blue\nBird is recognized as an industry leader for school bus innovation, safety, product quality/reliability/durability, efficiency, and lower operating costs. In\naddition, Blue Bird is the market leader in alternative powered product offerings with its propane powered, gasoline powered, and all-electric powered school\nbuses.\nBlue Bird sells its buses and parts through an extensive network of U.S. and Canadian dealers that, in their territories, are exclusive to Blue Bird on Type C and\nType D school buses. Blue Bird also sells directly to major fleet operators, the U.S. government, state governments, and authorized dealers in certain limited\nforeign countries.\n30\nImpact of Supply Chain Constraints on Our Business\nDuring the second half of our fiscal year that ended October 3, 2020 (\"fiscal 2020\") and first half of our fiscal year that ended on October 2, 2021 (\"fiscal\n2021\"), COVID-19 materially affected demand for new buses and replacement/maintenance parts, significantly impacting our business and operations.\nAlthough demand for school buses strengthened substantially during the second half of fiscal 2021, the Company, and automotive industry as a whole, began\nexperiencing significant supply chain constraints resulting from, among others, labor shortages due to the ‘great resignation;’ the lack of maintenance on, and\nacquisition of, capital assets during the extended COVID-19 global lockdowns; significant increased demand for consumer products containing certain\nmaterials required for the production of vehicles, such as microchips, as consumers spent stimulus and other funds on items for their homes; etc. Additionally,\nthe already challenged global supply chain for automotive parts that began in fiscal 2021 was further impacted, including continuing escalating inventory\npurchase costs, by additional stress resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 (see further discussion below). These supply chain\ndisruptions had a significant adverse impact our operations and results due to higher purchasing costs, including freight costs incurred to expedite receipt of\ncritical components, increased manufacturing inefficiencies and our inability to complete the production of buses to fulfill sales orders during most of fiscal\n2022.\nTowards the end of fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2023, there were slight improvements in the supply chain's ability to deliver the parts and components\nnecessary to support our production operations, resulting in increased (i) manufacturing efficiencies and (ii) production of buses to fulfill sales orders during\nfiscal 2023. However, the higher costs charged by suppliers to procure inventory that continued into fiscal 2023 had a significant adverse impact on our\noperations and results. Specifically, such cost increases outpaced the increases in sales prices that we charged for the buses that were sold during the first\nquarter of fiscal 2023, many of which were included in the backlog of fixed price sales orders originating in fiscal 2021 and the early months of fiscal 2022 that\ncarried forward into fiscal 2023. During the remainder of fiscal 2023, the buses that were sold were generally included in the backlog of fixed price sales orders\noriginating more recently (i.e., the latter months of fiscal 2022 and in fiscal 2023), with the cumulative increases in sales prices we charged for those buses\ngenerally outpacing the higher costs we paid to procure inventory, resulting in gross profit during the quarters. While the gross margin on bus sales during the\nsecond quarter of fiscal 2023 lagged the historical gross margin reported prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it returned to more normal historical levels during\nthe latter half of fiscal 2023.\nSupply chain disruptions continued into fiscal 2024 as there were still occasional shortages of certain critical components as well as ongoing increases in raw\nmaterials costs, both of which impacted our business and operations by limiting the number of school buses that we could produce and sell as well as\nincreasing the costs to manufacture buses. Nonetheless, the lessons learned, and resulting actions taken, by management over the past three fiscal years allowed\nthe Company to better navigate these supply chain challenges and consistently produce buses to fulfill sales orders. Ongoing improvements in manufacturing\noperations, when coupled with periodic pricing actions taken by the Company to ensure that the increased sales prices charged for buses kept pace with\nincreased costs to procure inventory to produce the buses, allowed the Company to report gross profits and gross margins throughout fiscal 2024 that were\nconsistent with, or better than, historic levels experienced prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNew bus orders during fiscal 2023 and continuing into fiscal 2024 remained robust, primarily due to a combination of (i) pent-up demand resulting from the\ncumulative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic when many school systems conducted virtual learning and (ii) the challenged global supply chain for automotive\nparts that hindered the school bus industry's ability to produce and sell buses during the latter half of fiscal 2021 and continuing through fiscal 2024.\nAccordingly, the Company's backlog remained strong at approximately 4,600 units and 4,800 units as of September 30, 2023 and September 28, 2024,\nrespectively, despite it selling over 8,500 units during fiscal 2023, the majority of which were included in the backlog that existed as of October 1, 2022, and\n9,000 units in fiscal 2024.\nIn general, management believes that supply chain disruptions could continue in future periods and could materially impact our results if we are unable to i)\nobtain parts and supplies in sufficient quantities to meet our production needs and/or ii) pass along rising costs to our customers. They have resulted, and could\ncontinue to result, in significant economic disruption and have adversely affected our business. Significant uncertainty exists concerning the magnitude of the\nimpact and duration of ongoing supply chain constraints and their potential impact on the overall economy, both within the U.S and globally. Accordingly, the\nmagnitude and duration of any production and supply chain disruptions and their related financial impacts on our business cannot be estimated at this time.\nThe impacts from supply chain constraints on the Company's business and operations beginning during the second half of fiscal 2021 and continuing into fiscal\n2024 negatively affected our inventory procurement costs, gross profit, income and cash flows. We continue to monitor and assess the ability of suppliers to\nmaintain operations and to provide parts and supplies in sufficient quantities to meet our production needs and our ability to maintain continuous production in\nfuture periods. See PART I, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors,\" of this Report for a discussion of the material risks we believe we face particularly related to supply chain\ndisruptions and related constraints.\n31\nImpact of Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine on Our Business\nOn February 24, 2022, Russian military forces launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine. While the Company has no assets or customers in either of these\ncountries, this military conflict has had a significant negative impact on the Company’s operations, cash flows and results beginning in the second half fiscal\n2022 and continuing into fiscal 2024, primarily in an indirect manner since the Company does not sell to customers located in, or source goods directly from,\neither country.\nSpecifically, Ukraine has historically been a large exporter of ferroalloy materials used in the manufacture of steel and the disruption in the supply of these\nminerals resulted in a significant volatility in the price of steel. While the Company has generally mitigated its direct exposure to steel prices by executing fixed\nprice purchase contracts (generally purchased up to four quarters in advance) for the majority of the significant amount of steel used in the manufacture of\nschool bus bodies, many suppliers from which the Company purchases components containing steel increased the price that they charge the Company to\nacquire such inventory, primarily on a lagged basis, starting from the latter half of fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2024, as applicable. These inventory\ncosts impact gross profit when school buses are sold and cash flows when the related invoices are paid.\nAdditionally, Russia has historically been a large global exporter of oil and many countries have ceased buying Russian oil in protest of the invasion and to\ncomply with sanctions imposed by the U.S. and many European countries. Accordingly, the disruption in the supply of oil has significantly impacted the price\nof goods refined from oil, such as diesel fuel, the price of which has been volatile and has remained high since the latter half of fiscal 2022. These higher costs\nsignificantly impacted the Company both as a result of the price that suppliers charge the Company to acquire inventory (since diesel fuel impacts their cost of\nacquiring the inventory used in producing their goods) and the price that the Company pays for freight to deliver the inventory that it acquires. Additionally,\nsuch increases are generally implemented with very little lag so that they impact the purchase cost of inventory and cash flows on an almost real-time basis.\nFinally, both countries have large quantities of other minerals that impact commodity costs, such as rubber and resin, among others, and the disruption caused\nby the ongoing military conflict increased the cost and/or decreased the supply of components containing these materials, further impacting an already\nchallenged global supply chain for automotive parts.\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has resulted, and is likely to continue to result, in significant economic disruption and has adversely affected our business.\nSpecifically, it has contributed to higher inventory purchase costs, including freight costs, that negatively impacted the gross profit recognized on sales\nbeginning during the latter part of fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2024. Because peace negotiations do not appear to be productive and because Russia\nhas continued to intensify its military operations in Ukraine, we currently believe that this matter will continue to adversely impact our business in future\nperiods. Significant uncertainty exists concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of the ongoing military conflict and its impact on the overall\neconomy, both within the U.S. and globally. Accordingly, the duration of any production and supply chain disruptions, and related financial impacts, cannot be\nestimated at this time.\nFactors Affecting Our Revenues\nOur revenues are driven primarily by the following factors:\n• Property tax revenues. Property tax revenues are one of the major sources of funding for school districts, and therefore new school buses. Property tax\nrevenues are a function of land and building prices, based on assessments of property value by state or county assessors and millage rates voted by the\nlocal electorate.\n• Student enrollment and delivery mechanisms for learning. Increases or decreases in the number of school bus riders have a direct impact on school\ndistrict demand. Evolving protocols for public health concerns and/or continued technological advancements could shift the future form of educational\ndelivery away from in-person learning on a more permanent basis, with increased remote learning reasonably expected to decrease the number of\nschool bus riders.\n• Revenue mix. We are able to charge more for certain of our products (e.g., Type C propane powered school buses, electric powered buses, Type D\nbuses, and buses with higher option content) than other products. The mix of products sold in any fiscal period can directly impact our revenues for\nthe period.\n• Strength of the dealer network. We rely on our dealers, as well as a small number of major fleet operators, to be the direct point of contact with school\ndistricts and their purchasing agents. An effective dealer is capable of expanding revenues within a given school district by matching that district’s\nneeds to our capabilities, offering options that would not otherwise be provided to the district.\n32\n• Pricing. Our products are sold to school districts throughout the U.S. and Canada. Each state and each Canadian province has its own set of\nregulations that govern the purchase of products, including school buses, by their school districts. We and our dealers must navigate these regulations,\npurchasing procedures, and the districts’ specifications in order to reach mutually acceptable price terms. Pricing may or may not be favorable to us,\ndepending upon a number of factors impacting purchasing decisions. Additionally, in certain cases, prices originally quoted with dealers and school\ndistricts may have become less favorable, or more unfavorable, to us given increasing inventory costs between the time the sales order was\ncontractually agreed upon and the bus is built and delivered as a result of ongoing supply chain disruptions and general inflationary pressures.\n• Buying patterns of major fleets. Major fleets regularly compete against one another for existing accounts. Fleets are also continuously trying to win the\nbusiness of school districts that operate their own transportation services. These activities can have either a positive or negative impact on our sales,\ndepending on the brand preference of the fleet that wins the business. Major fleets also periodically review their fleet sizes and replacement patterns\ndue to funding availability as well as the profitability of existing routes. These actions can impact total purchases by fleets in a given year.\n• Seasonality. In the years preceding the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, our sales were subject to seasonal variation based on the school calendar with the\npeak season during our third and fourth fiscal quarters. Sales during the third and fourth fiscal quarters were typically greater than the first and second\nfiscal quarters due to the desire of municipalities to have any new buses that they ordered available to them at the beginning of the new school year.\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic impacting the demand for Company products and the impact of the subsequent supply chain constraints hindering the\nCompany's ability to produce and sell buses, seasonality has become unpredictable. Seasonality and variations from historical seasonality have\nimpacted the comparison of results between fiscal periods.\n• Inflation. As discussed previously above, supply chain disruptions developing subsequent to the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of\nUkraine have significantly increased our inventory purchase costs, including freight costs incurred to expedite receipt of critical components, reflected\nin cost of goods sold during all of fiscal 2022, and continuing, to a lesser extent, into fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024. In response, beginning in July 2021,\nthe Company announced a number of sales price increases that applied to new sales orders and partially applied to backlog orders that were both\nintended to mitigate the impact of rising purchase costs on our operations and results. Most of these price increases only began to marginally impact\nsales and gross profit in the latter half of fiscal 2022. Specifically, they did not offset the significant continued increase in the Company's production\ncosts, resulting in further deterioration of the Company's gross profit during the second half of fiscal 2022 and continuing into the first quarter of fiscal\n2023 as it produced and sold the oldest units included in the backlog as of the end of fiscal 2022. However, they began to have a more significant,\npositive impact on sales and gross profit during the remainder of fiscal 2023, as the Company fulfilled sales orders (i) from the backlog existing as of\nthe end of fiscal 2022 that originated more recently (i.e., during the latter months of fiscal 2022) and (ii) that were taken during fiscal 2023, both of\nwhich contained most or all of the cumulative sales prices increases that have been announced. These cumulative price increases also continued to\nhave a significant, positive impact on sales and gross profit during fiscal 2024.\nFactors Affecting Our Expenses and Other Items\nOur expenses and other line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations are principally driven by the following factors:\n• Cost of goods sold. The components of our cost of goods sold consist of material costs (principally powertrain components, steel and rubber, as well\nas aluminum and copper) including freight costs, labor expense, and overhead. Our cost of goods sold may vary from period to period due to changes\nin sales volume, efforts by certain suppliers to pass through the economics associated with key commodities, fluctuations in freight costs, design\nchanges with respect to specific components, design changes with respect to specific bus models, wage increases for plant labor, productivity of plant\nlabor, delays in receiving materials and other logistical challenges, and the impact of overhead items such as utilities.\n• Selling, general and administrative expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses include costs associated with our selling and marketing\nefforts, engineering, centralized finance, human resources, purchasing, and information technology services, along with other administrative matters\nand functions. In most instances, other than direct costs associated with sales and marketing programs, the principal component of these costs is salary\nexpense. Changes from period to period are typically driven by the number of our employees, as well as by merit increases provided to experienced\npersonnel.\n• Interest expense. Our interest expense relates to costs associated with our debt instruments and reflects both the amount of indebtedness and the\ninterest rate that we are required to pay on our debt. Interest expense also includes unrealized gains or losses from interest rate hedges, if any, and\nchanges in the fair value of interest rate derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships, if any, as well as expenses related to debt\nguarantees, if any.\n• Income taxes. We make estimates of the amounts to recognize for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. In addition, provisions\nare established for withholding taxes related to the transfer of cash between jurisdictions and for uncertain tax positions taken.\n33\n• Other income/expense, net. This balance includes periodic pension expense or income as well as gains or losses on foreign currency, if any. Other\namounts not associated with operating expenses may also be included in this balance.\n• Equity in net income or loss of non-consolidated affiliate(s). We include in this line item our 50% share of net income or loss from our investments in\nMicro Bird and Clean Bus Solutions, our unconsolidated joint ventures.\nKey Non-GAAP Financial Measures We Use to Evaluate Our Performance\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Report in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" are prepared in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). This Report also includes the following financial measures that are not prepared in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP (\"non-GAAP\"): “Adjusted EBITDA,” “Adjusted EBITDA Margin,” and “Free Cash Flow.” Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash\nFlow are financial metrics that are utilized by management and the Board of Directors, as and when applicable, to determine (a) the annual cash bonus payouts,\nif any, to be made to certain employees based upon the terms of the Company’s Management Incentive Plan, and (b) whether the performance criteria have\nbeen met for the vesting of certain equity awards granted annually to certain members of management based upon the terms of the Company’s Omnibus Equity\nIncentive Plan. Additionally, consolidated EBITDA, which is an adjusted EBITDA metric defined by our Credit Agreement (defined below) that could differ\nfrom Adjusted EBITDA discussed above as the adjustments to the calculations are not uniform, is used to determine the Company's ongoing compliance with\nseveral financial covenant requirements, including being utilized in the denominator of the calculation of the Total Net Leverage Ratio (\"TNLR\"), which is also\nutilized in determining the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our Credit Agreement (defined below). Accordingly, management views these non-GAAP\nfinancial metrics as key for the above purposes and as a useful way to evaluate the performance of our operations as discussed further below.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or loss prior to interest income; interest expense including the component of operating lease expense (which is\npresented as a single operating expense in selling, general and administrative expenses in our U.S. GAAP financial statements) that represents interest expense\non lease liabilities; income taxes; and depreciation and amortization including the component of operating lease expense (which is presented as a single\noperating expense in selling, general and administrative expenses in our U.S. GAAP financial statements) that represents amortization charges on right-of-use\nlease assets; as adjusted for certain non-cash charges or credits that we may record on a recurring basis such as share-based compensation expense and\nunrealized gains or losses on certain derivative financial instruments; net gains or losses on the disposal of assets as well as certain charges such as (i)\nsignificant product design changes; (ii) transaction related costs; (iii) discrete expenses related to major cost cutting and/or operational transformation\ninitiatives. While certain of the charges that are added back in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation, such as transaction related costs and operational\ntransformation and major product redesign initiatives, represent operating expenses that may be recorded in more than one annual period, the significant project\nor transaction giving rise to such expenses is not considered to be indicative of the Company’s normal operations. Accordingly, we believe that these, as well as\nthe other credits and charges that comprise the amounts utilized in the determination of Adjusted EBITDA described above, should not be used in evaluating\nthe Company’s ongoing annual operating performance.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measures of\nperformance defined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The measures are used as a supplement to U.S. GAAP results in evaluating certain aspects of our\nbusiness, as described below.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are useful to investors in evaluating our performance because the measures consider the\nperformance of our ongoing operations, excluding decisions made with respect to capital investment, financing, and certain other significant initiatives or\ntransactions as outlined in the preceding paragraph. We believe the non-GAAP measures offer additional financial metrics that, when coupled with the U.S.\nGAAP results and the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of our results of operations and the factors and trends\naffecting our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss as an indicator of our performance or as\nalternatives to any other measure prescribed by U.S. GAAP as there are limitations to using such non-GAAP measures. Although we believe that Adjusted\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may enhance an evaluation of our operating performance based on recent revenue generation and product/overhead\ncost control because they exclude the impact of prior decisions made about capital investment, financing, and certain other significant initiatives or\ntransactions, (i) other companies in Blue Bird’s industry may define Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin differently than we do and, as a result,\nthey may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in Blue Bird’s industry, and (ii) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nMargin exclude certain financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing disclosure of the differences between Adjusted EBITDA and U.S. GAAP results, including providing a\nreconciliation to U.S. GAAP results, to enable investors to perform their own analysis of our ongoing operating results.\n34\nOur measure of Free Cash Flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and it should not be relied upon\nto the exclusion of U.S. GAAP financial measures. Free Cash Flow reflects an additional way of evaluating our liquidity that, when viewed with our U.S.\nGAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial\nstatements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nWe define Free Cash Flow as total cash provided by/used in operating activities as adjusted for net cash paid for the acquisition of fixed assets and intangible\nassets. We use Free Cash Flow, and ratios based on Free Cash Flow, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from\noperations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since purchases of fixed assets and intangible assets are a necessary component of\nongoing operations. Accordingly, we expect Free Cash Flow to be less than operating cash flows.\nOur Segments\nWe manage our business in two operating segments, which are also our reportable segments: (i) the Bus segment, which involves the design, engineering,\nmanufacture and sale of school buses and extended warranties; and (ii) the Parts segment, which includes the sale of replacement bus parts. Financial\ninformation is reported on the basis that it is used internally by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in evaluating segment performance and deciding\nhow to allocate resources to segments. The President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company has been identified as the CODM. Management evaluates\nthe segments based primarily upon revenues and gross profit.\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023:\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nNet sales $ 1,347,154 $ 1,132,793\nCost of goods sold 1,090,998 993,943\nGross profit $ 256,156 $ 138,850\nOperating expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 116,825 87,193\nOperating profit $ 139,331 $ 51,657\nInterest expense (10,579) (18,012)\nInterest income 4,136 1,004\nOther expense, net (4,394) (8,307)\nLoss on debt refinancing or modification (1,558) (537)\nIncome before income taxes $ 126,936 $ 25,805\nIncome tax expense (33,228) (8,953)\nEquity in net income of non-consolidated affiliate(s) 11,839 6,960\nNet income $ 105,547 $ 23,812\nOther financial data:\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 182,909 $ 87,927\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin 13.6 % 7.8 %\n35\nThe following provides the results of operations of Blue Bird's two reportable segments:\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nNet Sales by Segment\nBus $ 1,242,885 $ 1,034,625\nParts 104,269 98,168\nTotal $ 1,347,154 $ 1,132,793\nGross Profit by Segment\nBus $ 203,791 $ 91,003\nParts 52,365 47,847\nTotal $ 256,156 $ 138,850\nNet sales. Net sales were $1,347.2 million for fiscal 2024, an increase of $214.4 million, or 18.9%, compared to $1,132.8 million for fiscal 2023. The increase\nin net sales is primarily due to increased unit bookings, product and mix changes, as well as pricing actions taken by management in response to increased\ninventory purchase costs.\nBus sales increased $208.3 million, or 20.1%, reflecting a 5.7% increase in units booked and a 13.6% increase in average sales price per unit. In fiscal 2024,\n9,000 units were booked compared to 8,514 units booked for fiscal 2023. The increase in units sold was primarily due to product and customer mix changes as\nwell as slight improvements in supply chain constraints impacting the Company's ability to produce and deliver buses due to shortages of critical components\nduring fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. The increase in average unit sales price reflects pricing actions taken by management as well as product and\ncustomer mix changes.\nParts sales increased $6.1 million, or 6.2%, for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. This increase is primarily attributed to price increases, driven by ongoing\ninflationary pressures, as well as higher fulfillment volumes and slight variations due to product and channel mix.\nCost of goods sold. Total cost of goods sold was $1,091.0 million for fiscal 2024, an increase of $97.1 million, or 9.8%, compared to $993.9 million for fiscal\n2023. As a percentage of net sales, total cost of goods sold decreased from 87.7% to 81.0%, primarily due to the pricing actions discussed above.\nBus segment cost of goods sold increased $95.5 million, or 10.1%, for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. The increase was partially attributable to the 5.7%\nincrease in units booked during fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. Also contributing was increased inventory costs, as the average cost of goods sold per unit\nfor fiscal 2024 was 4.2% higher compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to product and mix changes as well as increases in manufacturing costs attributable to\na) increased raw materials costs resulting from ongoing inflationary pressures and b) ongoing supply chain disruptions that resulted in higher purchase costs for\ncomponents.\nThe $1.6 million, or 3.1%, increase in parts segment cost of goods sold for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was primarily due to increased purchased parts\ncosts, driven by ongoing inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, as well as slight variations due to product and channel mix.\nOperating profit. Operating profit was $139.3 million for fiscal 2024, an increase of $87.7 million, or 169.7%, compared to $51.7 million for fiscal 2023.\nProfitability was primarily impacted by an increase of $117.3 million in gross profit, as outlined in the revenue and cost of goods sold discussions above. The\nincrease in gross profit was partially offset by an increase of $29.6 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily due to an increase in labor\ncosts. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 benefited from actions taken by management to reduce\nlabor costs and certain discretionary spending to mitigate the significant adverse impact of ongoing supply chain constraints on the Company's operations and\nresults.\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $10.6 million for fiscal 2024, a decrease of $7.4 million, or 41.3%, compared to $18.0 million for fiscal 2023. The\ndecrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the stated term loan interest rate from 10.0% at September 30, 2023 to 6.9% at September 28, 2024, as well\nas lower outstanding borrowings during fiscal 2024 when compared with fiscal 2023.\nOther expense/income, net. Other expense, net, was $4.4 million for fiscal 2024, a decrease of $3.9 million, or 47.1%, compared to $8.3 million of other\nexpense, net, in fiscal 2023. We recorded $0.1 million of net periodic pension expense during fiscal 2024 when compared with $0.7 million recorded during\nfiscal 2023.\n36\nAdditionally, on June 7, 2023, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with BofA Securities, Inc. and Barclays Capital Inc., as representatives of\nthe several underwriters and American Securities LLC, Coliseum Capital Partners, L.P., and Blackwell Partners LLC – Series A (\"2023 Selling Stockholders\"),\npursuant to which the 2023 Selling Stockholders agreed to sell 5,175,000 shares of common stock, including the sale of 675,000 shares pursuant to the\nunderwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option, at a purchase price of $20.00 per share. On September 11, 2023, the Company entered into another\nunderwriting agreement with Barclays Capital, Inc. and the 2023 Selling Stockholders, pursuant to which the 2023 Selling Stockholders agreed to sell\n2,500,000 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $21.00 per share (collectively, the \"2023 Offerings\").\nThe 2023 Offerings were conducted pursuant to prospectus supplements, dated June 7, 2023 and September 11, 2023, respectively, to the prospectus, dated\nDecember 22, 2021, included in the Company’s registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-261858) that was initially filed with the SEC on\nDecember 23, 2021 (the \"December 2021 Prospectus\"). The 2023 Offerings closed on June 12, 2023 and September 14, 2023, respectively.\nOn December 14, 2023, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with BofA Securities, Inc. and Barclays Capital Inc., as representatives of the\nseveral underwriters and American Securities LLC (\"2024 Selling Stockholder\"), pursuant to which the 2024 Selling Stockholder agreed to sell 2,500,000\nshares of common stock at a purchase price of $25.10 per share. On February 15, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Barclays\nCapital Inc., as representative of the several underwriters and the 2024 Selling Stockholder, pursuant to which the 2024 Selling Stockholder agreed to sell\n4,042,650 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $32.90 per share (collectively, the \"2024 Offerings\").\nThe 2024 Offerings were conducted pursuant to prospectus supplements, dated December 14, 2023 and February 15, 2024, respectively, to the December 2021\nProspectus. The 2024 Offerings closed on December 19, 2023 and February 21, 2024, respectively.\nAlthough the Company did not sell any shares or receive any proceeds from the 2023 Offerings or 2024 Offerings, it was required to pay certain expenses in\nconnection with these transactions that totaled approximately $7.4 million and $3.2 million in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, respectively.\nAlso, on May 23, 2024, eligible members of the USW voted to ratify a three-year CBA with Blue Bird Body Company (\"BBBC\"), a subsidiary of the\nCompany. Among other items, the CBA required the payment of a $750 signing bonus to the approximate 1,500 covered workers in our Fort Valley and Perry,\nGeorgia facilities as well as a lump-sum payment to certain employees who were not eligible for the approximate 12%, on average, year one wage increase\nbecause their current hourly wage rate exceeded the rate required by the terms of the CBA. During fiscal 2024, the Company paid the above amounts to those\nemployees covered by the CBA as well as similar amounts to a small number of hourly employees not covered by the CBA so that their total compensation is\ncompetitive with that of unionized employees performing comparable job functions. These payments totaled $2.7 million in fiscal 2024 and were recorded in\nother (expense) income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations because such compensation is not reflective of wages paid for services provided by\nthe direct and indirect employees who support our operating activities and is expensed within cost of goods sold. There was no similar expense recorded during\nfiscal 2023.\nFinally, during fiscal 2024, the Company sold certain state emissions credits that it was not projecting to use for approximately $1.5 million, with no similar\nincome recorded during fiscal 2023. The proceeds from this sale were recorded in other (expense) income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as\nthis transaction is not indicative of our normal revenue generating activities.\nIncome taxes. Income tax expense was $33.2 million for fiscal 2024 and $9.0 million for fiscal 2023.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 differed from the statutory Federal income tax rate of 21.0%. The increase in the effective tax rate to 26.2% was primarily\ndue to the impacts of state taxes and certain permanent items on the federal rate, which were partially offset by the impacts from federal and state tax credits\n(net of valuation allowances) and discrete period items.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 differed from the statutory Federal income tax rate of 21.0%. The increase in the effective tax rate to 34.7% was primarily\ndue to the impacts of state taxes and certain permanent items on the federal rate.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA was $182.9 million, or 13.6% of net sales, for fiscal 2024, an increase of $95.0 million, or 108.0%, compared to $87.9\nmillion, or 7.8% of net sales, for fiscal 2023. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA is primarily the result of the $81.7 million increase in net income, as a result of\nthe factors discussed above, as well as the corresponding $24.3 million increase in income tax expense. Among other smaller offsetting items, these increases\nwere partially offset by the $10.5 million decrease in interest expense, net as a result of the factors discussed above.\n37\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years presented:\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nNet income $ 105,547 $ 23,812\nAdjustments:\nInterest expense, net (1) 6,847 17,380\nIncome tax expense 33,228 8,953\nDepreciation, amortization, and disposals (2) 16,736 17,914\nOperational transformation initiatives — 1,757\nLoss on debt refinancing or modification 1,558 537\nShare-based compensation expense 8,609 4,173\nStockholder transaction costs 3,154 7,371\nMicro Bird total interest expense, net; income tax expense or benefit; depreciation expense and\namortization expense 7,362 5,456\nOther (132) 574\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 182,909 $ 87,927\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin (percentage of net sales) 13.6 % 7.8 %\n(1) Includes $0.4 million for both fiscal 2024 and 2023, representing interest expense on operating lease liabilities, which are a component of lease expense and\npresented as a single operating expense in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(2) Includes $1.6 million and $1.8 million for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing amortization on right-of-use operating lease assets, which are a\ncomponent of lease expense and presented as a single operating expense in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of\nOperations.\n38\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022:\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nNet sales $ 1,132,793 $ 800,637\nCost of goods sold 993,943 764,091\nGross profit $ 138,850 $ 36,546\nOperating expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 87,193 77,246\nOperating profit (loss) $ 51,657 $ (40,700)\nInterest expense (18,012) (14,675)\nInterest income 1,004 9\nOther (expense) income, net (8,307) 2,947\nLoss on debt modification (537) (632)\nIncome (loss) before income taxes $ 25,805 $ (53,051)\nIncome tax (expense) benefit (8,953) 11,451\nEquity in net income (loss) of non-consolidated affiliate(s) 6,960 (4,159)\nNet income (loss) $ 23,812 $ (45,759)\nOther financial data:\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 87,927 $ (14,746)\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin 7.8 % (1.8)%\nThe following provides the results of operations of Blue Bird's two reportable segments:\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nNet Sales by Segment\nBus $ 1,034,625 $ 723,505\nParts 98,168 77,132\nTotal $ 1,132,793 $ 800,637\nGross Profit by Segment\nBus $ 91,003 $ 5,065\nParts 47,847 31,481\nTotal $ 138,850 $ 36,546\nNet sales. Net sales were $1,132.8 million for fiscal 2023, an increase of $332.2 million, or 41.5%, compared to $800.6 million for fiscal 2022. The increase in\nnet sales is primarily due to increased unit bookings, product and mix changes, as well as pricing actions taken by management in response to increased\ninventory purchase costs. Significant supply chain disruptions began limiting the availability of certain critical components primarily beginning towards the\nend of the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and continuing throughout fiscal 2022. However, during fiscal 2023, supply chain constraints began to improve slightly,\nallowing for increased production during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.\nBus sales increased $311.1 million, or 43.0%, reflecting a 24.8% increase in units booked and a 14.6% increase in average sales price per unit. In fiscal 2023,\n8,514 units were booked compared to 6,822 units booked for fiscal 2022. The increase in units sold was primarily due to constraints in the Company's ability to\nproduce and deliver buses due to shortages of critical components in fiscal 2022. The 14.6% increase in average sales price per unit reflects pricing actions\ntaken by management as well as product and customer mix changes.\nParts sales increased $21.0 million, or 27.3%, for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. This increase is primarily attributed to pricing actions taken by\nmanagement to offset increases in purchased parts costs and increased inventory availability as supply chain constraints began to improve during fiscal 2023\nrelative to fiscal 2022.\nCost of goods sold. Total cost of goods sold was $993.9 million for fiscal 2023, an increase of $229.9 million, or 30.1%, compared to $764.1 million for fiscal\n2022. As a percentage of net sales, total cost of goods sold decreased from 95.4% to 87.7%.\n39\nBus segment cost of goods sold increased $225.2 million, or 31.3%, for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the 24.8%\nincrease in units booked during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Also contributing was increased inventory costs, as the average cost of goods sold per unit\nfor fiscal 2023 was 5.2% higher compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to increases in manufacturing costs attributable to a) increased raw materials costs\nresulting from ongoing inflationary pressures and b) ongoing supply chain disruptions that resulted in higher purchase costs for components and freight.\nThe $4.7 million, or 10.2%, increase in parts segment cost of goods sold for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to increased purchased parts\ncosts, driven by ongoing inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, as well as slight variations due to product and channel mix.\nOperating profit. Operating profit was $51.7 million for fiscal 2023, an increase of $92.4 million, or 226.9%, compared to $40.7 million of operating loss for\nfiscal 2022. Profitability was primarily impacted by an increase of $102.3 million in gross profit, as outlined in the revenue and cost of goods sold discussions\nabove. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase of $9.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily due to an\nincrease in labor costs..\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $18.0 million for fiscal 2023, an increase of $3.3 million, or 22.7%, compared to $14.7 million for fiscal 2022. The\nincrease was primarily attributable to an increase in the stated term loan interest rate from 7.9% at October 1, 2022 to 10.0% at September 30, 2023 (which was\nhigher for much of fiscal 2023 due to the spread we pay above the market rate, which is dependent on our TNLR at the end of each fiscal quarter), which was\npartially offset by lower borrowings during fiscal 2023 when compared with fiscal 2022.\nOther expense/income, net. Other expense, net, was $8.3 million for fiscal 2023, a change of $11.3 million, or 381.9%, compared to $2.9 million of other\nincome, net, in fiscal 2022. We recorded $0.7 million of net periodic pension expense during fiscal 2023 when compared with $3.0 million of net periodic\npension income recorded during the fiscal 2022.\nAdditionally, during fiscal 2023, the Company completed the 2023 Offerings. Although the Company did not sell any shares or receive any proceeds from the\n2023 Offerings, it was required to pay certain expenses in connection with these transactions that totaled $7.4 million, with no similar expense recorded during\nfiscal 2022.\nIncome taxes. Income tax expense was $9.0 million for fiscal 2023 compared to a benefit of $11.5 million for fiscal 2022.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 differed from the statutory Federal income tax rate of 21.0%. The increase in the effective tax rate to 34.7% was primarily\ndue to the impacts of state taxes and certain permanent items on the Federal rate.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 differed from the statutory Federal income tax rate of 21.0%. The increase in the effective tax rate to 21.6% was primarily\ndue to the impacts of state taxes on the Federal rate. This increase was partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA was $87.9 million, or 7.8% of net sales, for fiscal 2023, an increase of $102.7 million, or 696.3%, compared to $(14.7)\nmillion, or (1.8)% of net sales, for fiscal 2022. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA is primarily the result of a $69.6 million increase in net income, as a result of\nthe factors discussed above, the corresponding $20.4 million increase in income tax expense, the $7.4 million in stockholder transaction costs that were\nincurred in fiscal 2023 with no similar costs incurred in fiscal 2022 and the $5.5 million increase in Micro Bird's total interest expense, net; income tax expense\nor benefit; depreciation expense and amortization expense, which primarily resulted from a $4.2 million increase in income tax expense as a result of Micro\nBird reporting net income during fiscal 2023 and a net loss in fiscal 2022.\n40\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years presented:\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nNet income (loss) $ 23,812 $ (45,759)\nAdjustments:\nInterest expense, net (1) 17,380 14,973\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 8,953 (11,451)\nDepreciation, amortization, and disposals (2) 17,914 15,212\nOperational transformation initiatives 1,757 7,213\nLoss on debt modification 537 632\nShare-based compensation expense 4,173 3,690\nProduct redesign initiatives — 549\nStockholder transaction costs 7,371 —\nMicro Bird total interest expense, net; income tax expense or benefit; depreciation expense and\namortization expense 5,456 (90)\nOther 574 285\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 87,927 $ (14,746)\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin (percentage of net sales) 7.8 % (1.8)%\n(1) Includes $0.4 million and $0.3 million for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing interest expense on operating lease liabilities, which are a\ncomponent of lease expense and presented as a single operating expense in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of\nOperations.\n(2) Includes $1.8 million and $1.1 million for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing amortization on right-of-use operating lease assets, which are a\ncomponent of lease expense and presented as a single operating expense in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of\nOperations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company's primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from its operations, available cash and cash equivalents, and borrowings under its revolving\ncredit facility. At September 28, 2024, the Company had $127.7 million of available cash and cash equivalents (net of outstanding checks) and $143.3 million\nof additional borrowings available under the revolving line of credit portion of its credit facility. The Company’s revolving line of credit is available for\nworking capital requirements, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.\nCredit Agreement\nOn November 17, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), BBBC (\"Borrower\") executed a $250.0 million five-year credit agreement with Bank of Montreal, acting as\nadministrative agent and an issuing bank; several joint lead arranger partners and issuing banks, including Bank of America; and a syndicate of other lenders\n(the \"Credit Agreement\").\nThe credit facilities provided for under the Credit Agreement consist of a term loan facility in an aggregate initial principal amount of $100.0 million (the\n“Term Loan Facility”) and a revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of $150.0 million. The revolving credit facility includes a $25.0 million\nletter of credit sub-facility and $5.0 million swingline sub-facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility,” and together with the Term Loan Facility, each a “Credit\nFacility” and collectively, the “Credit Facilities”).\nA minimum of $100.0 million of additional term loans and/or revolving credit commitments may be incurred under the Credit Agreement, subject to certain\nlimitations as set forth in the Credit Agreement, and which additional loans and/or commitments would require further commitments from existing lenders or\nfrom new lenders.\nBorrower has the right to prepay the loans outstanding under the Credit Facilities without premium or penalty (subject to customary breakage costs, if\napplicable). Additionally, proceeds from asset sales, condemnation, casualty insurance and/or debt issuances (in certain circumstances) are required to be used\nto prepay borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facilities. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, which were made at the Closing Date, may not be\nreborrowed once they are repaid while borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be repaid and reborrowed from time to time at our election.\n41\nThe Term Loan Facility is subject to amortization of principal, payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each fiscal quarter, which commenced\non March 30, 2024, with 5.0% of the $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of all initial term loans outstanding at the Closing Date payable each year prior\nto the maturity date of the Term Loan Facility. The remaining initial aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, as well as any\noutstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be payable on the November 17, 2028 maturity date of the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Facilities are guaranteed by all of the Company’s wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries (subject to customary exceptions) and are secured\nby a security agreement which pledges a lien on virtually all of the assets of Borrower, the Company and the Company’s other wholly-owned domestic\nrestricted subsidiaries, other than any owned or leased real property and subject to customary exceptions.\nThe $100.0 million of Term Loan Facility proceeds and $36.2 million of Revolving Credit Facility proceeds that were borrowed on the Closing Date were used\nto pay (i) the $131.8 million of term loan indebtedness outstanding under the previous credit agreement (\"Amended 2016 Credit Agreement\"), which was also\nthe amount outstanding as of September 30, 2023 (there were no amounts outstanding on the revolving credit facility portion of the Amended 2016 Credit\nAgreement on either date), (ii) interest and commitment fees accrued under the Amended 2016 Credit Agreement through the Closing Date and (iii) transaction\ncosts associated with the consummation of the Credit Agreement. During fiscal 2024, we used cash generated from operations to make $3.8 million of required\nquarterly principal payments on the Term Loan Facility and repay all $36.2 million of Revolving Credit Facility borrowings from the Closing Date.\nUnder the terms of the Credit Agreement, Borrower, the Company and the Company’s other wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries are subject to\ncustomary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable, and lender\nremedies).\nBorrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest, at our option, at (i) base rate (\"ABR\") or (ii) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as administered by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York (\"SOFR\") plus 0.10%, plus an applicable margin depending on the TNLR (which is defined in the Credit Agreement as the\nratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA on a trailing four quarter basis) of the Company as follows:\nLevel TNLR ABR Loans SOFR Loans\nI Less than 1.00x 0.75% 1.75%\nII Greater than or equal to 1.00x and less than 1.50x 1.50% 2.50%\nIII Greater than or equal to 1.50x and less than 2.25x 2.00% 3.00%\nIV Greater than or equal to 2.25x 2.25% 3.25%\nPricing on the Closing Date was set at Level III until receipt of the financial information and related compliance certificate for the first fiscal quarter ending\nafter the Closing Date, with pricing as of September 28, 2024 set at Level I.\nBorrower is also required to pay lenders an unused commitment fee of between 0.25% and 0.45% per annum on the undrawn commitments under the\nRevolving Credit Facility, depending on the TNLR, quarterly in arrears.\nThe Credit Agreement also includes a requirement that the Company comply with the following financial covenants on the last day of each fiscal quarter\nthrough maturity: (i) a pro forma TNLR of not greater than 3.00:1.00 and (ii) a pro forma fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of\nnot less than 1.20:1.00.\nAt September 28, 2024, Borrower and the guarantors under the Credit Agreement were in compliance with all covenants.\nShort-Term and Long-Term Liquidity Requirements\nOur ability to make principal and interest payments on borrowings under our Credit Facilities and our ability to fund planned capital expenditures will depend\non our ability to generate cash in the future, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other conditions.\nBased on the current level of operations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and expected cash flows from operations will be\nsufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nWe have operating leases for office and warehouse space and finance leases for equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 0.2 years to 5.7\nyears with the option to extend certain leases for up to 1.0 year year. Finance leases run through fiscal 2025 and have total payments of approximately $1.0\nmillion, all of which is due in fiscal 2025. Operating leases have remaining terms up to 5.7 years and total payments of approximately $5.4 million, of which\napproximately $2.1 million is due in fiscal 2025.\n42\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into short-term contractual purchase orders for manufacturing inventory and capital assets. At\nSeptember 28, 2024, total purchase commitments were $136.1 million, of which $134.1 million is expected to be paid in fiscal 2025.\nTo increase our liquidity in future periods, we could pursue raising additional capital via an equity or debt offering utilizing a currently effective \"shelf\"\nregistration statement. However, we can offer no assurance that we would be successful in raising this additional capital, which could also lead to increased\nexpense and larger up-front fees when compared with our historical financial statements.\nSeasonality\nIn the years preceding the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, our business was highly seasonal with school districts buying their new school buses so that they would\nbe available for use on the first day of the school year, typically in mid-August to early September. This historically resulted in our third and fourth fiscal\nquarters representing our two busiest quarters from a sales and production perspective, the latter ending on the Saturday closest to September 30. Our quarterly\nresults of operations, cash flows, and liquidity have historically been, and are likely to be in future periods, impacted by seasonal patterns. Working capital has\nhistorically been a significant use of cash during the first fiscal quarter due to planned shutdowns and a significant source of cash generation in the fourth fiscal\nquarter. With the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent supply chain constraints, seasonality and working capital trends have become unpredictable.\nSeasonality and variations from historical seasonality have impacted the comparison of working capital and liquidity results between fiscal periods.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth general information derived from our statement of cash flows for the fiscal years presented:\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of year $ 78,988 $ 10,479 $ 11,709\nTotal cash provided by (used in) operating activities 111,112 119,928 (24,437)\nTotal cash used in investing activities (15,815) (8,520) (6,453)\nTotal cash (used in) provided by financing activities (46,598) (42,899) 29,660\nChange in cash and cash equivalents 48,699 68,509 (1,230)\nCash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 127,687 $ 78,988 $ 10,479\nTotal cash provided by (used in) operating activities\nCash provided by operating activities totaled $111.1 million for fiscal 2024 and $119.9 million for fiscal 2023. The primary drivers of the $8.8 million decrease\nwere the following:\nThe net decrease primarily resulted from the effect of net changes in operating assets and liabilities that negatively impacted operating cash flows by $84.1\nmillion during fiscal 2024 when compared with fiscal 2023. The primary drivers in this category were unfavorable changes in accounts receivable; accounts\npayable; and accrued expenses, pension and other liabilities of $46.5 million, $22.0 million, and 15.9 million, respectively, as follows:\n• A shift in our customer mix resulted in an increase in the accounts receivable balance (a net use of cash) at the end of the fiscal 2024 when compared\nwith fiscal 2023. Specifically, we had a significant increase in fleet orders, which make up the majority of orders on credit, during fiscal 2024 when\ncompared with fiscal 2023.\n• At the end of fiscal 2022 and during fiscal 2023, inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions significantly increased our purchase costs for\ncomponents and freight, which, when coupled with increased production and sales volumes during fiscal 2023, resulted in a significant increase in the\naccounts payable balance (a net source of cash). Although inflationary pressures continued during fiscal 2024, they were smaller when compared to\nfiscal 2023. This factor, when coupled with our production and sales volumes largely stabilizing during fiscal 2024, resulted in a smaller increase in the\naccounts payable balance during fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 (a smaller net source of cash).\n• As of the end of fiscal 2023, we had received approximately $18.5 million of advanced funds awarded by the U.S. EPA in administering the CSBP that\nwere recorded as unearned revenue within other current liabilities (which is included within accrued expenses, pension and other liabilities). As we built\nand sold the underlying buses during fiscal 2024, we recognized\n43\nthis amount in revenue. As of the end of fiscal 2024, we had a corresponding balance of $2.2 million, representing a $16.3 million net use of cash when\ncomparing the two periods.\nThe above decreases were partially offset by the $81.7 million increase in net income during fiscal 2024 when compared to fiscal 2023.\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities totaled $119.9 million for fiscal 2023 and $(24.4) million for fiscal 2022. The primary drivers of the $144.4\nmillion increase were the following:\n• A year over year increase of $69.6 million in net income.\n• The effect of net changes in operating assets and liabilities positively impacted fiscal 2023 operating cash flows by $79.0 million compared to fiscal\n2022. The primary drivers in this category were favorable changes in accounts receivable, inventory, and accrued expenses, pension and other\nliabilities of $2.5 million, $34.2 million, and $50.1 million respectively. These favorable changes were partially offset by unfavorable changes in\naccounts payable and other assets of $6.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively. At the end of fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2023, we became\nmore efficient at managing supply chain disruptions, and thus building and selling buses. These efficiencies resulted in us consuming more inventory\nin production, which resulted in a decrease in the inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2023 (a net source of cash) when compared with an increase in\nthe inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2022 (a net use of cash). The accounts payable balance is significantly influenced by the purchase of\ninventory that is required to produce buses during the last few weeks of each fiscal year. However, the supply chain disruptions that we experienced\nduring fiscal 2022 resulted in us purchasing inventory (and therefore, increasing accounts payable) that was not consumed in the production process as\nwe were missing certain critical components that prevented us from building and selling buses. Accordingly, the increase in the accounts payable\nbalance (a net source of cash) was higher in fiscal 2022 than in fiscal 2023, which had an unfavorable impact on cash flows. Finally, in fiscal 2023 we\nbegan receiving deposits for school buses ordered under the terms the CSBP, which provided a net source of cash year over year as there was no\nsimilar activity in fiscal 2022.\n• The impact of non-cash items (net source of cash) was $4.2 million lower in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Non-cash items impact net income\nor loss but do not have direct cash flows associated with them. The significant differences relate to the impact of an $8.8 million lower of cost or net\nrealizable value loss and $1.4 million fixed assets impairment, both present in fiscal 2022, with no similar losses in fiscal 2023, as well as an $11.1\nmillion increase in equity in net income of non-consolidated affiliate(s), a $2.6 million decrease in amortization of deferred actuarial pension losses\nand a $1.9 million decrease in non-cash interest expense, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. These decreases were partially offset by a $19.1\nmillion increase in deferred income tax expense and a $1.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, in fiscal 2023 compared to\nfiscal 2022.\nTotal cash used in investing activities\nCash used in investing activities totaled $15.8 million and $8.5 million for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. The $7.3 million increase in cash used was\nprimarily due to an increase in spending on fixed assets, as increased profitability in fiscal 2024 when compared fiscal 2023 allowed for more capital spending.\nDuring the first half of fiscal 2023, capital spending was reduced to lower than normal amounts in an effort to mitigate the impact of supply chain constraints\non our operations, financial results and cash flows.\nCash used in investing activities totaled $8.5 million and $6.5 million for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. The $2.1 million increase in cash used was\nprimarily due to increased spending on fixed assets in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022, as increased profitability in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022\nallowed for slightly more capital spending. During fiscal 2022, capital spending was reduced to lower than normal amounts in an effort to mitigate the impact\nof supply chain constraints on our operations, financial results and cash flows.\nTotal cash (used in) provided by financing activities\nCash used in financing activities totaled $46.6 million for fiscal 2024 and $42.9 million for fiscal 2023. The $3.7 million increase in cash used was primarily\nattributable to a $115.8 million increase in term loan repayments and $9.9 million in purchases of Company stock. This was partially offset by $100.0 million\nof proceeds received from term loan borrowings under the Credit Agreement, a $20.0 million net increase in revolving line of credit borrowings, and a $2.7\nmillion increase in cash received from stock option exercises.\n44\nCash (used in) provided by financing activities totaled $(42.9) million for fiscal 2023 and $29.7 million for fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2022, the private placement\nsale of our common stock provided $74.8 million of net cash proceeds, with no similar activity in fiscal 2023. Also contributing to the increase in cash used\nwas a $5.0 million increase in term loan repayments in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. These were partially offset by a $5.0 million decrease in net\nrevolving credit facility repayments, and a $1.3 million decrease in cash paid for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in connection with employee\nstock award exercises, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.\nFree cash flow\nManagement believes the non-GAAP measurement of Free Cash Flow, defined as net cash used in or provided by operating activities less cash paid for fixed\nassets and acquired intangible assets, fairly represents the Company’s ability to generate surplus cash that could fund activities not in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. See “Key Measures We Use to Evaluate Our Performance” for further discussion. The following table sets forth the calculation of Free Cash Flow for\nthe fiscal years presented:\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nTotal cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 111,112 $ 119,928 $ (24,437)\nCash paid for fixed assets and acquired intangible assets (15,263) (8,520) (6,453)\nFree Cash Flow $ 95,849 $ 111,408 $ (30,890)\nFree Cash Flow for fiscal 2024 was $15.6 million lower than for fiscal 2023, due to an $8.8 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities, as well as\na $6.7 million increase in cash paid for fixed assets, both as discussed above.\nFree Cash Flow for fiscal 2023 was $142.3 million higher than for fiscal 2022, due to a $144.4 million increase in cash provided by (used in) operating\nactivities, which was partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in cash paid for fixed assets, both as discussed above.\nOff-Balance Sheet arrangements\nWe had outstanding letters of credit totaling $6.7 million at September 28, 2024, the majority of which secure our self-insured workers compensation program,\nthe collateral for which is regulated by the State of Georgia.\nShare Repurchase Program and Treasury Stock Retirement\nOn January 31, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized and approved a share repurchase program for up to $60 million of outstanding shares\nof the Company’s common stock over a period of 24 months, expiring January 31, 2026. Under the share repurchase program, the Company may repurchase\nshares through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance\nwith applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nIn the latter part of August and first half of September 2024, the Company repurchased 201,818 shares of its common stock for $9.9 million, pursuant to the\nshare repurchase plan. No such repurchases were made in fiscal 2023. The total remaining authorization for future common stock repurchases under the\nCompany's share repurchase program was $50.1 million as of September 28, 2024. Because of the timing of these share repurchases, they had no material\nimpact on earnings per share for fiscal 2024.\nIn mid-September 2024, the Company constructively retired the shares of common stock it had recently repurchased by recording the $9.9 million paid in\nexcess of the $0.0001 par value of each share as a reduction in retained earnings. Later that same month, the Company retired the shares of common stock that\nhad previously been reflected as treasury stock within its historical consolidated financial statements by recording the amount paid in excess of the $0.0001 par\nvalue of each share as a $39.9 million reduction in retained earnings, which reduced the value in this account to zero, with the remaining $10.4 million\nrecorded as a reduction in additional paid-in capital.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. At the date of the financial\nstatements, these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, and during\nthe reporting period, these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. For example, significant management judgments\nare required in determining excess, obsolete, or unsalable inventory; allowance for doubtful accounts; potential impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and\nintangible assets; and the accounting for self-insurance reserves, warranty reserves, pension obligations, income taxes, environmental liabilities and\n45\ncontingencies. Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty, and, accordingly, the Company’s accounting estimates require the exercise of\njudgment. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more\nexperience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Company’s operating environment changes. The Company evaluates and updates its\nassumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances, and may employ outside experts to assist in the Company’s evaluations. Management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure\nof accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Actual results could differ from the estimates that the Company has used.\nThe estimates that require management to exercise the greatest extent of judgment in establishing assumptions and that could have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements should they change significantly in a future period are defined as \"critical\" in nature and include the following:\nSelf-Insurance Reserves\nThe Company is self-insured for the majority of its workers’ compensation and medical claims. The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance\nsheet date is not discounted and is recognized as a liability. Self-insurance losses for claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon\nestimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using loss development factors and actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and\nhistorical loss development experience. The establishment of the reserves utilizing such estimates and assumptions is based on the premise that historical\nclaims experience, both in terms of the volume of claims activity and related cost, is indicative of current or future expected activity, which could differ\nsignificantly. At September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, reserves totaled approximately $7.3 million and $6.2 million, respectively.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the fair value of the assets acquired less liabilities assumed in connection with\nsuch acquisition. In accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”),\ngoodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives acquired in an acquisition are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually or\nmore frequently should an event occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Such events or circumstances may be a significant\nchange in business climate, economic and industry trends, legal factors, negative operating performance indicators, significant competition, changes in strategy\nor disposition of a reporting unit or a portion thereof. Although management believes the assumptions used in the determination of the value of the enterprise\nare reasonable, no assurance can be given that these assumptions will be achieved. As a result, impairment charges may occur when goodwill and intangible\nassets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment in the future.\nWe have two reporting units for which we test goodwill for impairment: Bus and Parts. In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we have the option to\nperform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary or to perform a quantitative assessment by comparing the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Under the qualitative assessment, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a\nreporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. If under the quantitative assessment\nthe fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the amount of the impairment loss, if any, must be measured under step two of the\nimpairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we would record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill\nover its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise.\nFair value of the reporting units is estimated primarily using the income approach, which incorporates the use of discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") analysis. A\nnumber of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and\nmarket shares, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, tax rates, capital spending, discount rate and working capital changes. The cash flow forecasts are\nbased on approved strategic operating plans.\nDuring the fourth quarter of each fiscal year presented, we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill that did not indicate that an impairment\nexisted.\nIn the evaluation of indefinite lived assets for impairment, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment\ntesting is necessary, or to perform a quantitative assessment by comparing the fair value of an asset to its carrying amount. The Company’s intangible asset with\nan indefinite useful life is the Blue Bird trade name. Under the qualitative assessment, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of the asset unless the\nentity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. If a qualitative assessment is not performed or if a quantitative\nassessment is otherwise required, then the entity compares the fair value of an asset to its carrying amount and the amount of the impairment loss, if any, is the\ndifference between fair value and carrying value. The fair value of our trade name is derived by using the relief from\n46\nroyalty method, which discounts the estimated cash savings we realize by owning the name instead of otherwise having to license or lease it.\nDuring the fourth quarter of each fiscal year presented, we performed our annual impairment assessment of our trade name that did not indicate that an\nimpairment existed.\nOur intangible assets with definite useful lives include customer relationships and engineering designs, which are amortized over their estimated useful lives of\n7 or 20 years using the straight-line method. These assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount\nof the assets may not be recoverable. No impairments have been recorded.\nThe recorded balances for goodwill were $15.1 million and $3.7 million for the Bus and Parts segments, respectively, at both September 28, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023. The recorded balances for intangible assets were $43.6 million and $45.4 million at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023,\nrespectively.\nPensions\nWe have pension benefit costs and obligations, which are developed from actuarial valuations. Actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and are\nused in calculating the expense and liability relating to our plan. These factors include assumptions we make about interest rates and expected investment\nreturn on plan assets. In addition, our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as mortality rates to develop our valuations. We review and update\nthese assumptions on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year. We are required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest\nrates, in making these assumptions. Effective January 1, 2006, the benefit plan was frozen to all participants. No accrual of future benefits is earned or\ncalculated beyond this date. Accordingly, our obligation estimate is based on benefits earned at that time discounted using an estimate of the single equivalent\ndiscount rate determined by matching the plan’s future expected cash flows to spot rates from a yield curve comprised of high-quality corporate bond rates of\nvarious durations. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to\nprovide for the pension benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, appropriate consideration is given to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the fund\nand rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment and we consider asset allocations, input from an external pension investment adviser, and risks and\nother factors adjusted for our specific investment strategy. The focus is on long-term trends and provides for the consideration of recent plan performance.\nThe actuarial assumptions that we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions as well as longer or shorter\nlife spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the measurement of our pension benefit obligations, and to the amount of\npension benefits expense we may record. For example, at September 28, 2024, a one-half percent increase in the discount rate would reduce the projected\nbenefit obligation of our pension plans by approximately $4.9 million, while a one-half percent decrease in the discount rate would increase the projected\nbenefit obligation of our pension plans by approximately $5.3 million.\nThe projected benefit obligation for the pension plan was $113.6 million and $108.4 million at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\nProduct Warranty Costs\nThe Company’s products are generally warranted against defects in material and workmanship for a period of one to five years. A provision for estimated\nwarranty costs is recorded at the time a unit is sold. The methodology to determine the warranty reserve calculates the average expected future warranty claims\nusing historical warranty claims by body type, by month, over the life of the bus, which is then multiplied by remaining months under warranty, by warranty\ntype. The establishment of the reserve utilizing such estimates and assumptions is based on the premise that historical claims experience, both in terms of the\nvolume of claims activity and related cost, is indicative of future expected claims activity. Management believes the methodology is reasonable (i) since the\nCompany's product offerings and manufacturing processes do not change quickly or significantly and (ii) given the significant investments that the Company\nhas made, and expects to continue making, to improve the quality, reliability and safety of the school buses it manufactures. Accordingly, while management\nbelieves that this methodology provides an accurate reserve estimate, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring future\nadjustments. For example, at September 28, 2024, a 5% increase or decrease in the average lifetime historical warranty claims by body type, by month would\nincrease or decrease accrued product warranty costs by approximately $0.8 million.\nAt September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, accrued product warranty costs totaled approximately $16.2 million and $15.4 million, respectively.\n47\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which requires an asset and liability\napproach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred income taxes represent the expected future tax consequences of\ntemporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates its ability, based on the weight of evidence\navailable, to realize future tax benefits from deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance to reduce a deferred tax asset to a level which, more likely\nthan not, will be realized in future years. At September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, deferred tax liabilities totaled approximately $22.4 million and $22.9\nmillion, respectively, while deferred tax assets totaled approximately $22.0 million and $22.6 million, respectively.\nThe Company recognizes uncertain tax positions based on a cumulative probability assessment if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be\nsustained upon examination by an appropriate tax authority with full knowledge of all information. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest\namount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Amounts recorded for uncertain tax positions are periodically assessed, including the evaluation of\nnew facts and circumstances, to ensure sustainability of the positions. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in\nincome tax expense. There was no liability for uncertain tax positions at September 28, 2024 or September 30, 2023.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nA discussion of recently issued accounting standards applicable to the Company is described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Report, and we incorporate such\ndiscussion by reference herein.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, and commodity prices.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are charged variable rates of interest on our indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement, which exposes us to fluctuations in interest rates. We\nmonitor and manage interest rate exposure as part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of interest rates and seeks to\nreduce potentially adverse effects on our business. However, changes in interest rates cannot always be predicted, hedged, or offset with price increases to\neliminate earnings volatility. Based upon the balance of term loan and revolving credit facility borrowings outstanding as of September 28, 2024, a one percent\nchange in market interest rates would increase or decrease, as applicable, annual interest expense, and ultimately cash flows from operations, by approximately\n$1.0 million.\nCommodity Risk\nThe Company and its suppliers incorporate raw and finished commodities such as steel, copper, aluminum, and other automotive type commodities into its\nproducts. We often bid on contracts weeks or months before school buses are delivered and enter into school bus sales contracts with fixed prices per bus. The\nsales bids historically have not included price escalation provisions to account for economic fluctuations between the bid date and the contract date. As a result,\nwe have historically been unable to pass along increased costs due to economic fluctuations to our customers, which is not expected to continue as the\nCompany now includes price escalation provisions when bidding on contracts. However, once a sales contract containing a fixed bus price is executed with a\ncustomer, we are generally unable to pass along increased costs resulting from economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date. We generally\npurchase steel up to four quarters in advance at fixed prices, but because we generally do not otherwise hedge steel or the other primary commodities we\npurchase (rubber, aluminum and copper), changes in prices of raw materials can significantly impact future operating margins.\nCurrency Risk\nThe Company transacts substantially all of its sales in U.S. Dollars. Our foreign customers have exposure to risks related to changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates on our sales in that region, due in part to the time that elapses between a fixed price order date and delivery/payment for the order. Foreign\ncurrency exchange rates can have material adverse effects on our foreign customers' ability to purchase our products. Therefore, at times, we may allow them to\npay in their local currency and we may utilize derivative instruments to hedge changes in foreign currency exchange rates for those transactions.\n48\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nStockholders and Board of Directors\nBlue Bird Corporation\nMacon, Georgia\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Blue Bird Corporation (the “Company”) as of September 28, 2024, and September 30, 2023,\nthe related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ (deficit) equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended September 28, 2024, and the related notes and schedule (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the\nconsolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023,\nand the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and our report dated November 25, 2024 expressed an unqualified\nopinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\nand the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,\nand performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in\nthe consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated\nor required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements\nand (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate\nopinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of Warranty Reserve\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's warranty reserve is calculated based on the average expected warranty claims\nusing warranty claims by body type, by month, over the life of the bus, which is then multiplied by remaining months under warranty, by warranty type. The\ntotal warranty reserve was $16.2 million as of September 28, 2024.\nWe identified the evaluation of the methodology, including the assumptions for the average warranty costs per unit and the payment patterns over the term of\nthe warranty, used in the evaluation of the warranty reserve as a critical audit matter.\nThe principle considerations for our determination were (i) the Company’s methodology and assumptions relating to the average warranty costs per unit and the\npayment patterns over the term of the warranty involved a higher degree of auditor judgment, and (ii) specialized actuarial skills were needed to assess the\nCompany's process and evaluate the methodology and assumptions regarding the determination of the average expected warranty claims and the effect of those\nassumptions on the reserve.\n49\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n• Testing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's warranty claim process, and controls over the data,\ninputs, and methodology and assumptions utilized to estimate the warranty reserve;\n• Testing management's process used to develop the warranty reserve, including the mathematical accuracy of the calculation and the relevance,\nreliability, and appropriateness of the methodology and assumptions and the sources of data from which the assumptions were derived;\n• Utilizing actuarial professionals with specialized knowledge and skills to assist in: (i) reviewing the Company’s actuarial methodology in calculating\nthe warranty reserve, (ii) evaluating certain key assumptions related to the average warranty costs per unit and payment patterns over the term of the\nwarranty, in the determination of the average expected warranty claims, and (iii) determining whether the methodology, assumptions, and calculation\nwere consistent with historical evaluations and the aggregate impact of any changes to assumptions.\n/s/ BDO USA, P.C.\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2016.\nAtlanta, Georgia\nNovember 25, 2024\n50\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nStockholders and Board of Directors\nBlue Bird Corporation\nMacon, Georgia\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Blue Bird Corporation’s (the “Company’s”) internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO criteria”). In\nour opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on the COSO\ncriteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated\nbalance sheets of the Company as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income\n(loss), stockholders’ (deficit) equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024, and the related notes and schedule and\nour report dated November 25, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying “Item 9A, Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.” Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our\naudit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and\nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ BDO USA, P.C.\nAtlanta, Georgia\nNovember 25, 2024\n51\nBLUE BIRD CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in

Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation\nNature of Business\nBlue Bird Body Company (\"BBBC\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Blue Bird Corporation, was incorporated in 1958 and has manufactured, assembled and\nsold school buses to a variety of municipal, federal and commercial customers since 1927. The majority of BBBC’s sales are made to an independent dealer\nnetwork, which in turn sells buses to ultimate end users. References in these notes to financial statements to “Blue Bird,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”\nrefer to Blue Bird Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless the context specifically indicates otherwise. We are headquartered in Macon, Georgia.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company\ntransactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30 with its quarters consisting of thirteen weeks in most years. The fiscal years ended\nSeptember 28, 2024, September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 are referred to herein as “fiscal 2024,” “fiscal 2023” and “fiscal 2022,” respectively. There were\n52 weeks in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.\nImpacts of Supply Chain Constraints on our Business\nDuring the second half of our fiscal year that ended October 3, 2020 (\"fiscal 2020\") and first half of our fiscal year that ended on October 2, 2021 (\"fiscal\n2021\"), the novel coronavirus known as \"COVID-19\" materially affected demand for new buses and replacement/maintenance parts, significantly impacting\nour business and operations. Although demand for school buses strengthened substantially during the second half of fiscal 2021, the Company, and automotive\nindustry as a whole, began experiencing significant supply chain constraints around this same period of time. These supply chain disruptions had a significant\nadverse impact our operations and results due to higher purchasing costs, including freight costs incurred to expedite receipt of critical components, increased\nmanufacturing inefficiencies and our inability to complete the production of buses to fulfill sales orders during most of fiscal 2022.\nAdditionally, Russian military forces launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, which further exacerbated global supply chain\ndisruptions. While the Company has no assets or customers in either of these countries, this military conflict significantly impacted our financial results,\nprimarily in an indirect manner since the Company does not sell to customers located in, or source goods directly from, either country. Specifically, it\ncontributed to increased volatility in a) costs charged by suppliers for the purchase of inventory that is at least partially dependent on resources originating from\neither of the countries and b) freight costs, both of which negatively impacted the gross profit recognized on sales during the second half of fiscal 2022 and\ncontinuing into fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024.\nTowards the end of fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2023, there were slight improvements in the supply chain's ability to deliver the parts and components\nnecessary to support our production operations, resulting in increased (i) manufacturing efficiencies and (ii) production of buses to fulfill sales orders during\nfiscal 2023. However, the higher costs charged by suppliers to procure inventory that continued into fiscal 2023 had a significant adverse impact on our\noperations and results. Specifically, such cost increases outpaced the increases in sales prices that we charged for the buses that were sold during the first\nquarter of fiscal 2023, many of which were included in the backlog of fixed price sales orders originating in fiscal 2021 and the early months of fiscal 2022 that\ncarried forward into fiscal 2023. During the remainder of fiscal 2023, the buses that were sold were generally included in the backlog of fixed price sales orders\noriginating more recently (i.e., the latter months of fiscal 2022 and in fiscal 2023), with the cumulative increases in sales prices we charged for those buses\ngenerally outpacing the higher costs we paid to procure inventory, resulting in gross profit during the quarters. While the gross margin on bus sales during the\nsecond quarter of fiscal 2023 lagged the historical gross margin reported prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it returned to more normal historical levels during\nthe latter half of fiscal 2023.\nSupply chain disruptions continued into fiscal 2024 as there were still occasional shortages of certain critical components as well as ongoing increases in raw\nmaterials costs, both of which impacted our business and operations by limiting the number of school buses that we could produce and sell as well as\nincreasing the costs to manufacture buses. Nonetheless, an increase in the number of school buses produced and sold, when coupled with periodic pricing\nactions taken by the Company to ensure that the increased sales prices charged for buses kept pace with increased costs to procure inventory to produce the\nbuses, resulted in a significant increase in gross profit during fiscal 2024 when compared with fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.\n58\nSignificant uncertainty exists concerning the magnitude and duration of the ongoing supply chain constraints and accordingly, precludes any prediction as to\nthe ultimate severity of the adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions. At the date of the financial statements, these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, and during the reporting period, these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of revenues and\nexpenses. For example, significant management judgments are required in determining excess, obsolete, or unsalable inventory, allowance for doubtful\naccounts, potential impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets, the accounting for self-insurance reserves, warranty reserves, pension\nobligations, income taxes, environmental liabilities and contingencies. Future events, including continued supply chain constraints and their related economic\nimpacts, and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty, and, accordingly, the Company’s accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. The\naccounting estimates used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is\nacquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Company’s operating environment changes. The Company evaluates and updates its assumptions and\nestimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in the Company’s evaluations. Actual results could differ from the estimates that the\nCompany has used.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company\ndeposits its cash and cash equivalents, which are or may become in excess of federally insured limits, with many of the same high credit-quality financial\ninstitutions with which it has outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement (defined below) and evaluates and manages the risk of credit loss on a net basis. To\ndate, the Company has not experienced any losses related to its cash and cash equivalents balances.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable consist of amounts owed to the Company by customers. The Company monitors collections and payments from customers, and generally\ndoes not require collateral. Accounts receivable are generally due within 30 to 90 days. The Company provides for the possible inability to collect accounts\nreceivable by recording an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company reserves for an account when it is considered potentially uncollectible. The\nCompany estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience, aging of accounts receivable and information regarding the\ncreditworthiness of its customers. To date, losses have been within the range of management’s expectations. The Company writes off accounts receivable if it\ndetermines that the account is uncollectible.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company records revenue when the following five steps have been completed:\n1. Identification of the contract(s) with a customer;\n2. Identification of the performance obligation(s) in the contract;\n3. Determination of the transaction price;\n4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and\n5. Recognition of revenue, when, or as, we satisfy performance obligations.\nThe Company records revenue when performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to the customer. The Company\nevaluates the transfer of control primarily from the customer’s perspective where the customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of\nthe remaining benefits from, that good or service.\nOur product revenue includes sales of buses and bus parts, each of which are generally recognized as revenue at a point in time, once all conditions for revenue\nrecognition have been met, as they represent our performance obligations in a sale. For buses, control is generally transferred and the customer has the ability\nto direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the product when the product is delivered or when the product has been completed,\nis ready for delivery, has been paid for, its title has transferred and it is awaiting pickup by the customer. For certain bus sale transactions, we may provide\nincentives including payment\n59\nof a limited amount of future interest charges our customers may incur related to their purchase and financing of the bus with third party financing companies.\nWe reduce revenue at the recording date by the full amount of potential future interest we may be obligated to pay, which is an application of the \"most likely\namount\" method. For parts sales, control is generally transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the\nremaining benefits of the products, which generally coincides with the point in time when the customer has assumed risk of loss and title has passed for the\ngoods sold.\nThe Company sells extended warranties related to its products. Revenue related to these contracts is recognized based on the stand-alone selling price of the\narrangement, on a straight-line basis over the contract period, and costs thereunder are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company includes shipping and handling revenues, which are costs billed to customers, in net sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nShipping and handling costs incurred are included in cost of goods sold.\nSee Note 12, Revenue, for further revenue information. See Note 3, Supplemental Financial Information, for further information on warranties.\nSelf-Insurance\nThe Company is self-insured for the majority of its workers’ compensation and medical claims. The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance\nsheet date is not discounted and is recognized as a liability. Self-insurance losses for claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon\nestimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims, using loss development factors and actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and\nhistorical loss development experience. See Note 3, Supplemental Financial Information, and Note 16, Benefit Plans, for further information.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, accounts payable, revolving credit facility and long-\nterm debt. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accounts payable approximate their fair values because of the short-term\nmaturity and highly liquid nature of these instruments. The carrying value of the Company’s revolving credit facility and long-term debt approximates fair\nvalue due to the variable rates of interest, which reset frequently, relating to these debt instruments. See Note 8, Debt, for further discussion.\nDerivative Instruments\nIn limited circumstances, we may utilize derivative instruments to manage certain exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates\nrelating to variable rate debt. The fair values of all derivative instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date. Changes in the fair\nvalue of these derivative instruments are recognized in our operating results or included in other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative\ninstrument qualifies, and is appropriately designated, for hedge accounting treatment and if so, whether it represents a fair value or cash flow hedge. Gains and\nlosses on derivative instruments are recognized in the operating results line item that reflects the underlying exposure that was mitigated either via a formal\nhedge accounting relationship or economically.\nInventories\nThe Company values inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company uses a standard costing methodology, which approximates cost on a\nfirst-in, first-out (“FIFO”) basis. The Company reviews the standard costs of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods inventory on a periodic basis to\nensure that its inventories approximate current actual costs. Manufacturing cost includes raw materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead. Obsolete\ninventory amounts are based on historical usage and assumptions about future demand.\n60\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is calculated on a straight-line\nbasis using the following periods, which represent the estimated useful lives of the assets:\nYears\nBuildings 15 - 33\nMachinery and equipment 5 - 10\nOffice furniture, equipment and other 3 - 10\nComputer equipment and software 3 - 7\nCosts, including capitalized interest and certain design, construction and installation costs related to assets that are under construction and are in the process of\nbeing readied for their intended use, are recorded as construction in progress and are not depreciated until such time as the subject asset is placed in service.\nRepairs and maintenance that do not extend the useful life of the asset are expensed as incurred. Upon sale, retirement, or other disposition of these assets, the\ncosts and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any gain or loss on the disposition is included on our Consolidated\nStatements of Operations.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. The Company enters into lease arrangements primarily for office space, warehouse space, or\na combination of both. We elected to account for leases with initial terms of 12 months or less by recording operating lease expense on a straight-line basis\ninstead of recording lease assets or liabilities. For a lease with an initial term greater than 12 months, the Company records a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and\nlease liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our\nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.\nWe determine whether the lease is an operating or finance lease at inception based on the information and expectations for the lease at that time. Operating\nlease ROU assets are included in property, plant and equipment and the lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Finance lease ROU assets are included in finance lease ROU assets and the lease liabilities are included in finance lease\nobligations (current) and finance lease obligations (long-term) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nLease ROU assets and liabilities are recorded at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the leases recorded\ntypically do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the\npresent value of lease payments. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that\noption. Operating lease ROU assets also include any base rental or lease payments made and exclude lease incentives.\nThe two components of operating lease expense, amortization and interest, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as a single expense\nelement within selling, general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Under the finance lease model, interest on the lease\nliability is recognized in interest expense and amortization of ROU assets is recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations based on the underlying\nuse of the assets.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the\ncarrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If we are required to analyze recoverability based on a triggering event, undiscounted future cash flows\nover the estimated remaining life of the asset, or asset group, are projected. If these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss\nis recognized to the extent the fair value of the asset less any costs of disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Judgments regarding the\nexistence of impairment indicators are based on market and operational performance. Evaluating potential impairment also requires estimates of future\noperating results and cash flows.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the fair value of the assets acquired less liabilities assumed in connection with\nsuch acquisition. In accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification Topic (\"ASC\") 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other, goodwill and\nintangible assets with indefinite useful lives acquired in an acquisition are not\n61\namortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently should an event occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount\nmay be impaired. Such events or circumstances may include a significant change in business climate, economic and industry trends, legal factors, negative\noperating performance indicators, significant competition, changes in strategy or disposition of a reporting unit or a portion thereof.\nWe have two reporting units for which we test goodwill for impairment: Bus and Parts. In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we have the option to\nperform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary or to perform a quantitative assessment by comparing the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. When performing a qualitative assessment, an entity is not required to calculate the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. If, when performing a\nquantitative assessment, the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the amount of the impairment loss, if any, must be measured\nusing step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we would record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the\nreporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value, should such a circumstance arise.\nThe fair value of the reporting units is estimated primarily using the income approach, which incorporates the use of discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") analysis. A\nnumber of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and\nmarket shares, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, tax rates, capital spending, discount rate and working capital changes. The cash flow forecasts are\nbased on approved strategic operating plans and long-term forecasts.\nIn the evaluation of indefinite lived assets for impairment, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment\ntesting is necessary, or to perform a quantitative assessment by comparing the fair value of an asset to its carrying amount. The Company’s intangible asset with\nan indefinite useful life is the \"Blue Bird\" trade name. When performing a qualitative assessment, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of the asset\nunless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. If a qualitative assessment is not performed or if a\nquantitative assessment is otherwise required, then the entity compares the fair value of an asset to its carrying amount and the amount of the impairment loss,\nif any, is the difference between fair value and carrying value. The fair value of our trade name is derived by using the relief from royalty method, which\ndiscounts the estimated cash savings we realized by owning the name instead of otherwise having to license or lease it.\nOur intangible assets with a definite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful lives, 7 or 20 years, using the straight-line method. The useful lives of\nour intangible assets are reassessed annually and they are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of\nthe asset may not be recoverable.\nDebt Issue Costs\nAmounts paid directly to lenders or as an original issue discount and amounts classified as issuance costs are recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of\nthe debt, for which the Company had deferred financing costs totaling $1.3 million and $1.5 million at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023,\nrespectively, incurred in connection with its debt facilities and related amendments.\nAll deferred financing costs are amortized to interest expense. The effective interest method is used for debt discounts related to the term loan. The Company’s\namortization of these costs was $0.4 million, $1.5 million and $1.5 million for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively, and is reflected as a\ncomponent of interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 8, Debt, for a discussion of the Company’s indebtedness.\nPensions\nThe Company accounts for its pension benefit obligations using actuarial models. The measurement of plan obligations and assets was made at September 30,\n2024. Effective January 1, 2006, the benefit plan was frozen to all participants. No accrual of future benefits is earned or calculated beyond this date.\nAccordingly, our obligation estimate is based on benefits earned at that time discounted using an estimate of the single equivalent discount rate determined by\nmatching the plan’s future expected cash flows to spot rates from a yield curve comprised of high-quality corporate bond rates of various durations. The\nCompany recognizes the funded status of its pension plan obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and records in other comprehensive income certain\ngains and losses that arise during the period, but are deferred under pension accounting rules. Pension expense is recognized as a component of other (expense)\nincome, net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n62\nProduct Warranty Costs\nThe Company’s products are generally warranted against defects in material and workmanship for a period of one year to five years. A provision for estimated\nwarranty costs is recorded at the time a unit is sold. The methodology to determine the warranty reserve calculates the average expected warranty claims using\nwarranty claims by body type, by month, over the life of the bus, which is then multiplied by remaining months under warranty, by warranty type. Management\nbelieves the methodology provides an accurate reserve estimate. Actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring future adjustments.\nThe Bus segment also sells extended warranties related to its products. Revenue related to these contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract\nperiod and costs thereunder are expensed as incurred. All warranty expenses are recorded in the cost of goods sold line on the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations. The current methodology to determine short-term extended warranty income reserve is based on twelve months of the remaining warranty value\nfor each effective extended warranty at the balance sheet date. See Note 3, Supplemental Financial Information, for further information.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of\nOperations. For fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, the Company expensed $9.4 million, $6.6 million and $6.1 million, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which requires an asset and liability\napproach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred income taxes represent the expected future tax consequences of\ntemporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates its ability, based on the weight of evidence\navailable, to realize future tax benefits from deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance to reduce a deferred tax asset to a level which, more likely\nthan not, will be realized in future years.\nThe Company recognizes uncertain tax positions based on a cumulative probability assessment if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be\nsustained upon examination by an appropriate tax authority with full knowledge of all information. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest\namount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Amounts recorded for uncertain tax positions are periodically assessed, including the evaluation of\nnew facts and circumstances, to ensure sustainability of the positions. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in\nincome tax expense.\nThe Company's policy for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive loss is to use a specific identification approach.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nThe Company records reserves for environmental liabilities on a discounted basis when environmental investigation and remediation obligations are probable\nand related costs are reasonably estimable. See Note 10, Guarantees, Commitments and Contingencies, for further information.\nRetirement of Common Stock\nWhen the Company decides to actually or constructively retire the shares of common stock it has repurchased, including those repurchases that have been\npreviously reflected as treasury stock within its historical consolidated financial statements, it records the amount paid in excess of par value as a reduction in\nretained earnings, to the extent such recording does not reduce retained earning to an amount below zero. In those instances in which such recording would\nreduce retained earnings below zero, it records the difference as a reduction in additional paid-in capital. See Note 13, Stockholders' (Deficit) Equity, for further\ninformation.\nSegment Reporting\nOperating segments are components of an entity that engage in business activities with discrete financial information available that is regularly reviewed by the\nchief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in order to assess performance and allocate resources. The Company’s CODM is its President and Chief Executive\nOfficer. As discussed further in Note 11, Segment Information, the Company determined its operating and reportable segments to be Bus and Parts. The Bus\nsegment includes the manufacturing and assembly of school buses to be sold to a variety of customers across the U.S., Canada and in certain limited\ninternational markets. The Parts\n63\nsegment consists primarily of the purchase of parts from third parties to be sold to dealers within the Company’s network and certain large fleet customers.\nStatement of Cash Flows\nWe classify distributions received from our equity method investment(s), if any, using the nature of distribution approach, such that distributions received are\nclassified based on the nature of the activity of the investee that generated the distribution. Returns on investment are classified within operating activities,\nwhile returns of investment are classified within investing activities.\nThe exchange of cash, if any, associated with derivative transactions is classified in the same category as the cash flows from the underlying items giving rise\nto the foreign currency or interest rate exposures.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nASU 2023-07 On November 27, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2023-07, Segment\nReporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires public entities to disclose information about their reportable\nsegments’ significant expenses on an interim and annual basis. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods\nwithin fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.\nASU 2023-09 On December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires\nentities to disclose more detailed information in their reconciliation of their statutory tax rate to their effective tax rate. Public business entities (\"PBEs\") are\nrequired to provide this incremental detail in a numerical, tabular format. The ASU also requires entities to disclose more detailed information about income\ntaxes paid, including by jurisdiction; pretax income (or loss) from continuing operations; and income tax expense (or benefit). The ASU is effective for PBEs in\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.\nASU 2024-03 On November 4, 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement — Reporting Comprehensive Income — Expense Disaggregation\nDisclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires PBEs to disclose disaggregated information about certain\nincome statement expense line items. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2027.\nThe new ASUs will not impact amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements, but, instead, will require more detailed disclosures in the footnotes to\nthe financial statements. The Company plans to provide the updated disclosures required by the ASUs in the periods in which they are effective.\nAny recently issued accounting standards not identified above do not apply to the Company or the impact is expected to be immaterial.\n3. Supplemental Financial Information\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable, net, consisted of the following at the dates indicated:\n(in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nAccounts receivable $ 59,199 $ 12,674\nAllowance for doubtful accounts (100) (100)\nAccounts receivable, net $ 59,099 $ 12,574\n64\nProduct Warranties\nThe following table reflects activity in accrued warranty cost (current and long-term portion combined) for the fiscal years presented:\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nBalance at beginning of period $ 15,434 $ 15,970 $ 18,550\nAdd: current period accruals 9,985 9,084 7,348\nLess: current period reductions of accrual (9,240) (9,620) (9,928)\nBalance at end of period $ 16,179 $ 15,434 $ 15,970\nExtended Warranties\nThe following table reflects activity in deferred warranty income (current and long-term portions combined), for the sale of extended warranties of two years to\nfive years, for the fiscal years presented:\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nBalance at beginning of period $ 23,123 $ 18,795 $ 20,144\nAdd: current period deferred income 13,245 12,013 6,847\nLess: current period recognition of income (8,406) (7,685) (8,196)\nBalance at end of period $ 27,962 $ 23,123 $ 18,795\nThe outstanding balance of deferred warranty income in the table above is considered a \"contract liability,\" and represents a performance obligation of the\nCompany that we satisfy over the term of the arrangement but for which we have been paid in full at the time the warranty was sold. We expect to\nrecognize $9.4 million of the outstanding contract liability in fiscal 2025, and the remaining balance thereafter.\nOther Current Liabilities\nThe balance in other current liabilities as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 includes approximately $2.2 million and $18.5 million, respectively,\nof funds awarded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in administering the Clean School Bus Program (“CSBP”) that was signed into law in mid-\nNovember 2021. The CSBP allocates federal funds to help local school jurisdictions purchase zero- and low-emission school buses over a five year period. The\nCompany recorded the receipt of these funds as deferred revenue. The balance at September 30, 2023 was largely recognized as revenue during the first half of\n2024 and the Company expects to recognize the vast majority of the September 28, 2024 balance as revenue during the first half of fiscal 2025, as the\nunderlying buses are produced and delivered.\nSelf-Insurance\nThe following table reflects the total accrued self-insurance liability, comprised of workers' compensation and health insurance related claims, at the dates\nindicated:\n(in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nCurrent portion $ 5,008 $ 4,475\nLong-term portion 2,248 1,771\nTotal accrued self-insurance $ 7,256 $ 6,246\nThe current and long-term portions of the accrued self-insurance liability are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively, on the\naccompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling revenues recognized were $21.7 million, $18.5 million and $16.0 million for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. The\nrelated cost of goods sold were $19.9 million, $16.6 million and $14.3 million for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.\n65\nDerivative Instruments\nOn October 24, 2018, the Company entered into a four year interest rate collar with a $150.0 million notional value with an effective date of November 30,\n2018. The collar was entered into in order to partially mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our variable rate debt. The collar established a range\nwhere we paid the counterparty if the three month U.S. Dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") fell below the established floor rate of 1.5%, and the\ncounterparty paid us if the three month LIBOR exceeded the ceiling rate of 3.3%. The collar settled quarterly through the termination date of September 30,\n2022. No payments or receipts were exchanged on the interest rate collar contracts unless interest rates rose above or fell below the contracted ceiling or floor\nrates. Throughout much of fiscal 2022, the three month LIBOR fell below the established floor, which required us to make $1.2 million in total cash payments\nto the counterparty.\n4. Inventories\nThe following table presents components of inventories at the dates indicated:\n(in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nRaw materials $ 83,027 $ 88,116\nWork in process 32,556 45,875\nFinished goods 12,215 1,295\nTotal inventories $ 127,798 $ 135,286\nAt October 1, 2022, certain Bus segment inventory had an approximate $8.8 million cumulative cost in excess of net realizable value, which was recognized as\na loss in fiscal 2022. No such cumulative loss in excess of net realizable value was present at September 28, 2024 or September 30, 2023 and no such losses\nwere recognized in fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023.\n5. Property, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment, net, consisted of the following at the dates indicated:\n(in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nLand $ 2,504 $ 2,504\nBuildings 65,237 64,206\nMachinery and equipment 121,048 115,248\nOffice furniture, equipment and other 2,467 2,355\nComputer equipment and software 20,718 20,662\nConstruction in process 12,408 7,151\nProperty, plant and equipment, gross 224,382 212,126\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization (131,413) (121,323)\nOperating lease right-of-use assets (1) 4,353 4,298\nProperty, plant and equipment, net $ 97,322 $ 95,101\n(1) Further information is included in Note 10, Guarantees, Commitments and Contingencies.\nDepreciation and amortization expense for property, plant and equipment was $12.2 million, $13.3 million, and $10.9 million for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and\nfiscal 2022, respectively.\nWe capitalized $0.3 million of interest expense in fiscal 2024 related to the construction of plant manufacturing assets.\nA $1.4 million impairment loss for certain equipment that was no longer used in the Bus segment production process was recognized in fiscal 2022. No\nimpairment loss was recognized in fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023.\n66\n6. Goodwill\nThe carrying amounts of goodwill by reporting unit are as follows at the dates indicated:\nGross Accumulated\n(in thousands) Goodwill Impairments Net Goodwill\nSeptember 28, 2024\nBus $ 15,139 $ — $ 15,139\nParts 3,686 — 3,686\nTotal $ 18,825 $ — $ 18,825\nSeptember 30, 2023\nBus $ 15,139 $ — $ 15,139\nParts 3,686 — 3,686\nTotal $ 18,825 $ — $ 18,825\nIn the fourth quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill that did not indicate that an impairment\nexisted; therefore, no impairments of goodwill have been recorded.\n7. Intangible Assets\nThe gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization of intangible assets are as follows at the dates indicated:\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nGross Gross\nCarrying Accumulated Carrying Accumulated\n(in thousands) Amount Amortization Total Amount Amortization Total\nFinite lived: Engineering designs $ 3,156 $ 3,156 $ — $ 3,156 $ 3,156 $ —\nFinite lived: Customer relationships 37,425 33,687 3,738 37,425 31,817 5,608\nTotal amortized intangible assets 40,581 36,843 3,738 40,581 34,973 5,608\nIndefinite lived: Trade name 39,816 — 39,816 39,816 — 39,816\nTotal intangible assets $ 80,397 $ 36,843 $ 43,554 $ 80,397 $ 34,973 $ 45,424\nManagement considers the \"Blue Bird\" trade name to have an indefinite useful life and, accordingly, it is not subject to amortization. Management reached this\nconclusion principally due to the longevity of the Blue Bird name and because management considers renewal upon reaching the legal limit of the trademarks\nrelated to the trade name as perfunctory. The Company expects to maintain usage of the trade name on existing products and introduce new products in the\nfuture that will also display the trade name. During the fourth quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, we performed our annual impairment assessment of our\ntrade name, which did not indicate that an impairment existed; therefore, no impairment of our indefinite lived intangible asset has been recorded.\nCustomer relationships are amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated life of 20 years. Engineering designs are amortized on a straight-line basis over\nan estimated life of 7 years. Total amortization expense for intangible assets was $1.9 million, $2.0 million, and $2.0 million for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and\nfiscal 2022, respectively.\nRemaining amortization expense for finite lived intangible assets is expected to be as follows:\n(in thousands)\nFiscal Years Ending Amortization Expense\n2025 $ 1,869\n2026 1,869\nTotal amortization expense $ 3,738\n67\n8. Debt\n2016 Credit Agreement\nOn December 12, 2016, BBBC (\"Borrower\"), executed a $235.0 million five-year credit agreement with Bank of Montreal, which acted as the administrative\nagent and an issuing bank, Fifth Third Bank, as co-syndication agent and an issuing bank, and Regions Bank, as co-syndication agent, together with other\nlenders (\"2016 Credit Agreement\").\nThe credit facilities provided for under the 2016 Credit Agreement consisted of a term loan facility in an aggregate initial principal amount of $160.0\nmillion (the “2016 Term Loan Facility”) and a revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of $75.0 million. The revolving credit facility included\na $15.0 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $5.0 million swing-line sub-facility (“2016 Revolving Credit Facility,” and together with the 2016 Term Loan\nFacility, each a “2016 Credit Facility” and collectively, the “2016 Credit Facilities”). The obligations under the 2016 Credit Agreement and the related loan\ndocuments (including without limitation, the borrowings under the 2016 Credit Facilities and obligations in respect of certain cash management and hedging\nobligations owing to the agents, the lenders or their affiliates), were, in each case, secured by a lien on and security interest in substantially all of the assets of\nthe Company and its subsidiaries including the Borrower, with certain exclusions as set forth in a collateral agreement entered into on the closing date.\nFirst Amendment to the 2016 Credit Agreement\nOn September 13, 2018, the Company entered into a first amendment to the 2016 Credit Agreement (\"First Amended 2016 Credit Agreement\"). The First\nAmended 2016 Credit Agreement provided for additional funding of $50.0 million and was funded in the first quarter of the fiscal year that ended September\n28, 2019. Substantially all of the proceeds were used to complete a tender offer to purchase shares of our common and preferred stock.\nThe First Amended 2016 Credit Agreement also increased the revolving credit facility to $100.0 million from $75.0 million, a $25.0 million increase. The\namendment extended the maturity date to September 13, 2023, five years from the effective date of the first amendment. The first amendment also amended the\ninterest rate pricing matrix (as follows) as well as the principal payment schedule (which was subsequently amended as discussed below). In connection with\nthe First Amended 2016 Credit Agreement, we incurred $2.0 million of debt discount and issuance costs, which were recorded as contra-debt and were being\namortized over the life of the Amended 2016 Credit Agreement (defined below) using the effective interest method.\nThe interest rate on the 2016 Term Loan Facility was (i) from the first amendment effective date until the first quarter ended on or about September 30, 2018,\nLIBOR plus 2.25%, and (ii) commencing with the fiscal quarter ended on or about September 30, 2018 and thereafter, dependent on the Total Net Leverage\nRatio (\"TNLR\") of the Company, an election of either base rate (\"ABR\") or LIBOR pursuant to the table below:\nLevel Total Net Leverage Ratio ABR Loans LIBOR Loans\nI Less than 2.00x 0.75% 1.75%\nII Greater than or equal to 2.00x and less than 2.50x 1.00% 2.00%\nIII Greater than or equal to 2.50x and less than 3.00x 1.25% 2.25%\nIV Greater than or equal to 3.00x and less than 3.25x 1.50% 2.50%\nV Greater than or equal to 3.25x and less than 3.50x 1.75% 2.75%\nVI Greater than 3.50x 2.00% 3.00%\nSecond Amendment to the 2016 Credit Agreement\nOn May 7, 2020, the Company entered into a second amendment to the 2016 Credit Agreement and First Amended 2016 Credit Agreement (“Second Amended\n2016 Credit Agreement”). The Second Amended 2016 Credit Agreement provided $41.9 million in additional revolving commitments bringing the total\nrevolving commitments to $141.9 million. The revolving commitments under the Second Amended 2016 Credit Agreement were scheduled to mature on\nSeptember 13, 2023, which was the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the First Amended 2016 Credit Agreement. The interest rate pricing grid remained\nunchanged, but the LIBOR floor was amended from 0% to 0.75%. We incurred $0.9 million in fees related to the amendment. The fees were capitalized to\nother assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were being amortized on a straight-line basis to interest expense until maturity of the Amended 2016\nCredit Agreement (defined below).\n68\nThird Amendment to the 2016 Credit Agreement\nOn December 4, 2020, the Company executed a third amendment to the 2016 Credit Agreement, First Amended 2016 Credit Agreement and Second Amended\n2016 Credit Agreement (\"Third Amended 2016 Credit Agreement\"). The Third Amended 2016 Credit Agreement, among other things, provided for certain\ntemporary amendments to the 2016 Credit Agreement from the third amendment effective date through and including the first date on which (a)(i) a\ncompliance certificate was timely delivered with respect to a fiscal quarter ending on or after March 31, 2022 demonstrating compliance with certain financial\nperformance covenants for such fiscal quarter (the “Limited Availability Period”), or (ii) the Borrower elected to terminate the Limited Availability Period; and\n(b) the absence of a default or event of default.\nAmendments to the financial performance covenants provided that during the Limited Availability Period, a higher maximum TNLR was permitted, and\nrequired the Company to maintain liquidity (in the form of undrawn availability under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and unrestricted cash and cash\nequivalents) of at least $15.0 million. For the duration between the fiscal quarter ended on or around December 31, 2020 and the fiscal quarter ended on or\naround September 30, 2021 that fell within the Limited Availability Period, a quarterly minimum consolidated EBITDA covenant applied instead of a\nmaximum TNLR.\nThe pricing grid in the First Amended 2016 Credit Agreement, which was based on the ratio of the Company’s consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA,\nremained unchanged. However, during the Limited Availability Period, an additional margin of 0.50% applied.\nDuring the Limited Availability Period, the Amended 2016 Credit Agreement required that Borrower prepay existing revolving loans and, if undrawn and\nunreimbursed letters of credit exceeded $7.0 million, cash collateralize letters of credit if unrestricted cash and cash equivalents exceeded $20.0 million, as\ndetermined on a semimonthly basis. Any issuance, amendment, renewal, or extension of credit during the Limited Availability Period could not cause\nunrestricted cash and cash equivalents to exceed $20.0 million, or cause the aggregate outstanding 2016 Revolving Credit Facility principal to exceed $100.0\nmillion. The Third Amended 2016 Credit Agreement also implemented a cap on permissible investments, restricted payments, certain payments of\nindebtedness and the fair market value of all assets subject to permitted dispositions during the Limited Availability Period.\nFor the duration of the Limited Availability Period, the Amended 2016 Credit Agreement (defined below) set forth additional monthly reporting requirements,\nand required subordination agreements and intercreditor arrangements for certain other indebtedness and liens subject to administrative agent approval.\nThe Company incurred approximately $2.5 million in lender fees and other issuance costs relating to the third amendment. Of such total, approximately\n$1.1 million and $0.9 million was capitalized within other assets and long-term debt (as a contra-balance), respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nand were being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense on a straight-line basis and utilizing the effective interest method, respectively, until maturity of\nthe Amended 2016 Credit Agreement (defined below). The remaining approximate $0.5 million was recorded to loss on debt modification on the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations.\nIn conjunction with executing the third amendment, previously capitalized lender fees and other issuance costs incurred in prior periods totaling approximately\n$0.1 million were expensed to loss on debt modification on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFourth Amendment to the 2016 Credit Agreement\nOn November 24, 2021, the Company executed a fourth amendment to the 2016 Credit Agreement, First Amended 2016 Credit Agreement, Second Amended\n2016 Credit Agreement and Third Amended 2016 Credit Agreement (the \"Fourth Amended 2016 Credit Agreement\"). The Fourth Amended 2016 Credit\nAgreement, among other things, provided for certain temporary amendments to the 2016 Credit Agreement from the third amendment effective date through\nand including (a) April 1, 2023 (the “Amended Limited Availability Period”), or (b) the first date on which Borrower elected to terminate the Amended Limited\nAvailability Period, in each case, subject to (x) the absence of a default or event of default and (y) pro forma compliance with the financial covenant\nperformance covenants under the Fourth Amended 2016 Credit Agreement.\nWith respect to the financial performance covenants, during the Amended Limited Availability Period for the fiscal quarters ended January 1, 2022 through\nOctober 1, 2022, the TNLR requirement was not applicable, although it continued to impact the interest rate that was charged on outstanding borrowings as\ndiscussed below. Instead, the minimum consolidated EBITDA that the Company was required to maintain during the Amended Limited Availability Period was\nupdated to include fiscal 2022 as set forth in the table below (in millions):\n69\nMinimum\nConsolidated\nPeriod EBITDA\nFiscal quarter ending January 1, 2022 $14.5\nFiscal quarter ending April 2, 2022 $(4.5)\nFiscal quarter ending July 2, 2022 $(6.8)\nFiscal quarter ending October 1, 2022 $20.0\nHowever, in the event that Borrower elected to terminate the Amended Limited Availability Period in fiscal 2022, the maximum TNLR permitted was 3.50x.\nThe minimum liquidity (in the form of undrawn availability under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) that the\nCompany was required to maintain during the Amended Limited Availability Period was amended as set forth in the table below (in millions):\nMinimum\nPeriod Liquidity\nFourth amendment effective date through January 1, 2022 $10.0\nJanuary 2, 2022 through April 2, 2022 $5.0\nApril 3, 2022 through July 2, 2022 $15.0\nThereafter $20.0\nAdditionally, a new financial performance covenant was added in the Fourth Amended 2016 Credit Agreement, requiring that school bus units manufactured by\nthe Company (“Units”) not fall below the pre-set thresholds set forth in the table below on a three month trailing basis (“Units Covenant”). The Units Covenant\nwas triggered only if the Company’s liquidity for the most-recently ended fiscal month was less than $50 million during the Amended Limited Availability\nPeriod:\nMinimum Units\nPeriod Manufactured\nThree month period ending November 27, 2021 1,128\nThree month period ending January 1, 2022 776\nThree month period ending January 29, 2022 748\nThree month period ending February 26, 2022 727\nThree month period ending April 2, 2022 763\nThree month period ending April 30, 2022 1,111\nThree month period ending May 28, 2022 1,525\nThree month period ending July 2, 2022 2,053\nThree month period ending July 30, 2022 2,072\nThree month period ending August 27, 2022 2,199\nThree month period ending October 1, 2022 2,306\nIf the Units during any three fiscal month period set forth above was less than the minimum required by the Units Covenant, Borrower could elect to carry\nforward up to 50% of certain applicable excess Units to satisfy the Units Covenant requirement. However, Borrower could not make such election in two\nconsecutive three fiscal month periods.\nThe pricing grid in the Fourth Amended 2016 Credit Agreement, which was based on the TNLR, was determined in accordance with the amended pricing\nmatrix set forth below:\n70\nLevel Total Net Leverage Ratio ABR Loans LIBOR Loans\nI Less than 2.00x 0.75% 1.75%\nII Greater than or equal to 2.00x and less than 2.50x 1.00% 2.00%\nIII Greater than or equal to 2.50x and less than 3.00x 1.25% 2.25%\nIV Greater than or equal to 3.00x and less than 3.25x 1.50% 2.50%\nV Greater than or equal to 3.25x and less than 3.50x 1.75% 2.75%\nVI Greater than or equal to 3.50x and less than 4.50x 2.00% 3.00%\nVII Greater than or equal to 4.50x and less than 5.00x 3.25% 4.25%\nVIII Greater than 5.00x 4.25% 5.25%\nDuring the Amended Limited Availability Period (notwithstanding the pricing grid set forth above), the applicable rate was (a) solely to the extent that the\naggregate revolving exposures exceeded $100.0 million, 5.75% with respect to such excess and (b) with respect to all other revolving exposures, the sum of the\nrate determined by the administrative agent in accordance with the pricing grid set forth above, plus 0.50%.\nAdditional allowances were made in the Fourth Amended 2016 Credit Agreement for the Company to issue or incur up to $100.0 million of qualified equity\ninterests issued by the Company, unsecured subordinated indebtedness or unsecured convertible indebtedness (collectively, “Junior Capital”). Upon the\nissuance or incurrence of any Junior Capital, the Company was required to prepay the outstanding revolving loans (with no permanent reduction in the\nrevolving commitments) in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) 100% of the net proceeds from such Junior Capital and (b) the aggregate of revolving exposures\nthen outstanding. Prior to the initial issuance or incurrence of any Junior Capital, any issuance, amendment, renewal, or extension of credit during the Amended\nLimited Availability Period could not cause the aggregate outstanding 2016 Revolving Credit Facility principal to exceed $110.0 million (“Availability Cap”).\nFollowing the issuance and sale of $75.0 million of common stock in a private placement transaction on December 15, 2021 (see Note 13, Stockholders'\n(Deficit) Equity, for further details), the Availability Cap was permanently reduced to $100.0 million.\nFor the duration of the Amended Limited Availability Period, the Fourth Amended 2016 Credit Agreement set forth additional monthly reporting requirements\nin connection with the manufactured school bus units required by the financial performance covenants, when applicable.\nThe Company incurred approximately $2.5 million in lender fees and other issuance costs relating to the fourth amendment. Of such total, approximately\n$1.1 million and $0.8 million was capitalized within other assets and long-term debt (as a contra-balance), respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nand was being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense on a straight-line basis and utilizing the effective interest method, respectively, until maturity of\nthe Amended 2016 Credit Agreement (defined below). The remaining approximate $0.5 million was recorded to loss on debt modification on the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations.\nIn conjunction with executing the fourth amendment, previously capitalized lender fees and other issuance costs incurred in prior periods totaling\napproximately $0.1 million were also expensed to loss on debt modification on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFifth Amendment and Limited Waiver to the 2016 Credit Agreement\nOn September 2, 2022, the Company executed a fifth amendment and limited waiver to the 2016 Credit Agreement, First Amended 2016 Credit Agreement,\nSecond Amended 2016 Credit Agreement, Third Amended 2016 Credit Agreement and Fourth Amended 2016 Credit Agreement (\"Fifth Amended 2016 Credit\nAgreement\"). The Fifth Amended 2016 Credit Agreement, among other things, resulted in Borrower and administrative agent jointly electing an early opt-in to\nchange one of the market interest rate indices that Borrower could elect to accrue interest on outstanding borrowings from LIBOR, which was discontinued\nsubsequent to June 30, 2023, to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (\"SOFR\"). Such change\nbecame effective at the end of the applicable interest period for any LIBOR borrowings outstanding on the fifth amendment effective date.\nThe Fifth Amended 2016 Credit Agreement also provided covenant relief, through December 31, 2022, via a waiver of the $20.0 million minimum\nconsolidated EBITDA covenant calculated on a four quarter trailing basis for the fiscal quarter ended October 1, 2022 and the 2,306 minimum Units Covenant\ncalculated on a three fiscal month trailing basis for the fiscal month ended October 1, 2022. The Company requested such covenant relief given the supply\nchain disruptions that continued to challenge the Company throughout fiscal 2022.\nFinally, the Fifth Amended 2016 Credit Agreement required the Company to provide a rolling thirteen week cash flow forecast to the administrative agent, on a\nmonthly basis, beginning with the fiscal month ended August 27, 2022 and ending with the fiscal month ending April 1, 2023.\n71\nThe Company incurred approximately $0.3 million in lender fees and other issuance costs relating to the fifth amendment. Of such total, approximately\n$0.1 million and $0.1 million was capitalized within other assets and long-term debt (as a contra-balance), respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nand was being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense on a straight-line basis and utilizing the effective interest method, respectively, until maturity of\nthe Amended 2016 Credit Agreement (defined below). The remaining approximate $0.1 million was recorded to loss on debt modification on the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations.\nSixth Amendment to the 2016 Credit Agreement\nOn November 21, 2022, the Company executed a sixth amendment to the 2016 Credit Agreement, First Amended 2016 Credit Agreement, Second Amended\n2016 Credit Agreement, Third Amended 2016 Credit Agreement, Fourth Amended 2016 Credit Agreement and Fifth Amended 2016 Credit Agreement (\"Sixth\nAmended 2016 Credit Agreement\" and collectively, the \"Amended 2016 Credit Agreement\"). The Sixth Amended 2016 Credit Agreement, among other things,\nextended the maturity date for both the 2016 Term Loan Facility and 2016 Revolving Credit Facility from September 13, 2023 to December 31, 2024. The total\n2016 Revolving Credit Facility commitment was reduced to an aggregate principal amount of $90.0 million, of which $80.0 million was available for Borrower\nto draw, with the remaining $10.0 million subject to written approval from the lenders, which, once obtained, was irrevocable. There was no change in the 2016\nTerm Loan Facility commitment; however, the Sixth Amended 2016 Credit Agreement required principal repayments approximating $5.0 million on a\nquarterly basis through September 30, 2024, with the remaining balance due upon maturity. There were $151.6 million of term loan borrowings outstanding on\nthe sixth amendment effective date.\nThe Sixth Amended 2016 Credit Agreement also provided for temporary amendments to certain financial performance covenants during the Amended Limited\nAvailability Period, which terminated on the date on which the Company’s TNLR for the two fiscal quarters most recently ended was each less than 4.00x and\nno default or event of default had occurred and was continuing. However, the Amended Limited Available Period could re-occur upon a default or event of\ndefault or if the TNLR for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter was equal to or greater than 4.00x.\nThe minimum consolidated EBITDA that the Company was required to maintain during the Amended Limited Availability Period was updated as set forth in\nthe table below (in millions):\nMinimum\nConsolidated\nPeriod EBITDA\nFiscal quarter ending July 1, 2023 $50.0\nFiscal quarter ending September 30, 2023 $60.0\nFor purposes of complying with the above minimum consolidated EBITDA covenant, the Company’s consolidated EBITDA for the (i) two fiscal quarter period\nending July 1, 2023 was multiplied by 2 and (ii) three fiscal quarter period ending September 30, 2023 was multiplied by 4/3.\nThe minimum liquidity (in the form of undrawn availability under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) that the\nCompany was required to maintain at the end of each fiscal month during the Amended Limited Availability Period was amended as set forth in the table below\n(in millions):\nMinimum\nPeriod Liquidity\nSixth amendment effective date through December 30, 2023 $30.0\nAdditionally, the Units Covenant was amended for Units to be calculated at the end of each applicable fiscal month on a cumulative basis, with the minimum\ncumulative threshold that the Company was required to maintain during the Amended Limited Availability Period amended as set forth in the table below. The\nUnits Covenant was triggered only if the Company’s liquidity for the most-recently ended fiscal month was less than $50.0 million during the Amended\nLimited Availability Period:\n72\nMinimum Units\nPeriod Manufactured\nPeriod from October 2, 2022 and ending October 29, 2022 450\nPeriod from October 2, 2022 and ending November 26, 2022 900\nPeriod from October 2, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022 1,400\nPeriod from October 2, 2022 and ending January 28, 2023 1,900\nPeriod from October 2, 2022 and ending February 25, 2023 2,400\nPeriod from October 2, 2022 and ending April 1, 2023 3,000\nThe Company was not required to comply with a maximum TNLR financial maintenance covenant for any fiscal quarters from the sixth amendment effective\ndate through September 30, 2023, with the maximum threshold amended thereafter as follows:\nMaximum Total\nPeriod Net Leverage Ratio\nFiscal Quarter ending December 30, 2023 through the fiscal quarter ending March 30, 2024 4.00:1.00\nFiscal quarter ending June 29, 2024 and thereafter 3.50:1.00\nThe pricing grid in the Amended 2016 Credit Agreement, which was based on the TNLR, was applicable to both term loan and revolving borrowings and was\ndetermined in accordance with the amended pricing matrix set forth below:\nLevel Total Net Leverage Ratio ABR Loans SOFR Loans\nI Less than 2.00x 0.75% 1.75%\nII Greater than or equal to 2.00x and less than 2.50x 1.00% 2.00%\nIII Greater than or equal to 2.50x and less than 3.00x 1.25% 2.25%\nIV Greater than or equal to 3.00x and less than 3.25x 1.50% 2.50%\nV Greater than or equal to 3.25x and less than 3.50x 1.75% 2.75%\nVI Greater than or equal to 3.50x and less than 4.00x 2.00% 3.00%\nVII Greater than or equal to 4.00x and less than 4.50x 2.75% 3.75%\nVIII Greater than or equal to 4.50x and less than 5.00x 3.75% 4.75%\nIX Greater than 5.00x 4.75% 5.75%\nFurther, the pricing margins for levels VII though IX above were each increased (x) by 0.25% if the aggregate revolving borrowings were equal to or greater\nthan $50.0 million and less than or equal to $80.0 million and (y) by 0.50% if the aggregate revolving borrowings were greater than $80.0 million. On the sixth\namendment effective date, the interest rate was set at SOFR plus 5.75% and was adjusted, as applicable, for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2022 and\nsubsequently in accordance with the amended pricing grid set forth above.\nFinally, the Company was required to deliver to the administrative agent, on a quarterly basis, a projected consolidated balance sheet and consolidated\nstatements of projected operations and cash flows for the next four fiscal quarter period.\nThe Company incurred approximately $3.3 million in lender fees and other issuance costs relating to the sixth amendment. Of such total, approximately\n$1.2 million and $1.5 million was capitalized within other assets and long-term debt (as a contra-balance), respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nand was being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense on a straight-line basis and utilizing the effective interest method, respectively, until maturity of\nthe Amended 2016 Credit Agreement. The remaining approximate $0.5 million was recorded to loss on debt modification on the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations.\nFiscal 2024 Credit Agreement\nOn November 17, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), BBBC, as Borrower, executed a $250.0 million five-year credit agreement with Bank of Montreal, acting as\nadministrative agent and an issuing bank; several joint lead arranger partners and issuing banks, including Bank of America; and a syndicate of other lenders\n(the \"Credit Agreement\").\nThe credit facilities provided for under the Credit Agreement consist of a term loan facility in an aggregate initial principal amount of $100.0 million (the\n“Term Loan Facility”) and a revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of $150.0 million. The\n73\nrevolving credit facility includes a $25.0 million letter of credit sub-facility and $5.0 million swingline sub-facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility,” and\ntogether with the Term Loan Facility, each a “Credit Facility” and collectively, the “Credit Facilities”).\nA minimum of $100.0 million of additional term loans and/or revolving credit commitments may be incurred under the Credit Agreement, subject to certain\nlimitations as set forth in the Credit Agreement, and which additional loans and/or commitments would require further commitments from existing lenders or\nfrom new lenders.\nBorrower has the right to prepay the loans outstanding under the Credit Facilities without premium or penalty (subject to customary breakage costs, if\napplicable). Additionally, proceeds from asset sales, condemnation, casualty insurance and/or debt issuances (in certain circumstances) are required to be used\nto prepay borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facilities. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, which were made on the Closing Date, may not be\nreborrowed once they are repaid while borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be repaid and reborrowed from time to time at our election.\nThe Term Loan Facility is subject to amortization of principal, payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each fiscal quarter, which commenced\non March 30, 2024, with 5.0% of the $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of all initial term loans outstanding at the Closing Date payable each year prior\nto the maturity date of the Term Loan Facility. The remaining initial aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, as well as any\noutstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be payable on the November 17, 2028 maturity date of the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Facilities are guaranteed by all of the Company’s wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries (subject to customary exceptions) and are secured\nby a security agreement which pledges a lien on virtually all of the assets of Borrower, the Company and the Company’s other wholly-owned domestic\nrestricted subsidiaries, other than any owned or leased real property and subject to customary exceptions.\nThe $100.0 million of Term Loan Facility proceeds and $36.2 million of Revolving Credit Facility proceeds that were borrowed on the Closing Date were used\nto pay (i) the $131.8 million of term loan indebtedness outstanding under the Amended 2016 Credit Agreement, (ii) interest and commitment fees accrued\nunder the Amended 2016 Credit Agreement through the Closing Date and (iii) transaction costs associated with the consummation of the Credit Agreement.\nUnder the terms of the Credit Agreement, Borrower, the Company and the Company’s other wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries are subject to\ncustomary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable, and lender\nremedies).\nBorrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest, at our option, at (i) ABR or (ii) SOFR plus 0.10%, plus an applicable margin depending on the TNLR\n(which is defined in the Credit Agreement as the ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA on a trailing four quarter basis) of the Company as\nfollows:\nLevel TNLR ABR Loans SOFR Loans\nI Less than 1.00x 0.75% 1.75%\nII Greater than or equal to 1.00x and less than 1.50x 1.50% 2.50%\nIII Greater than or equal to 1.50x and less than 2.25x 2.00% 3.00%\nIV Greater than or equal to 2.25x 2.25% 3.25%\nPricing on the Closing Date was set at Level III until receipt of the financial information and related compliance certificate for the first fiscal quarter that ended\nafter the Closing Date, with pricing as of September 28, 2024 set at Level I.\nBorrower is also required to pay lenders an unused commitment fee of between 0.25% and 0.45% per annum on the undrawn commitments under the\nRevolving Credit Facility, depending on the TNLR, quarterly in arrears.\nThe Credit Agreement also includes a requirement that the Company comply with the following financial covenants on the last day of each fiscal quarter\nthrough maturity: (i) a pro forma TNLR of not greater than 3.00:1.00 and (ii) a pro forma fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of\nnot less than 1.20:1.00. The Company was in compliance with such covenants as of September 28, 2024.\nThe Company incurred approximately $3.1 million in lender fees and other issuance costs relating to the Credit Agreement. Of such total, approximately\n$1.9 million and $0.8 million was capitalized within other assets and long-term debt (as a contra-balance), respectively, on the Condensed Consolidated\nBalance Sheets and is being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense on a straight-line basis and utilizing the effective interest method, respectively, until\nmaturity of the Credit Agreement. The remaining approximate $0.4 million was recorded to loss on debt refinancing or modification on the Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Operations.\n74\nIn conjunction with executing the Credit Agreement, previously capitalized lender fees and other issuance costs relating to the Amended 2016 Credit\nAgreement and incurred in prior periods totaling $1.1 million were also expensed to loss on debt refinancing or modification on the Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Operations.\nAdditional Disclosures\nDebt consisted of the following at the dates indicated:\n(in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nTerm loans, net of deferred financing costs of $1,256 and $1,456, respectively $ 94,994 $ 130,344\nLess: Current portion of long-term debt 5,000 19,800\nLong-term debt, net of current portion $ 89,994 $ 110,544\nTerm loan borrowings are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the unpaid principal balance, and are not subject to fair value measurement;\nhowever, given the variable rates on the loans, the Company estimates the unpaid principal balance to approximate fair value. If measured at fair value in the\nfinancial statements, the term loans would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. At September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, $96.3 million\nand $131.8 million, respectively, were outstanding on the term loans.\nAt September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the stated interest rates on the term loans were 6.9% and 10.0%, respectively. At September 28, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023, the weighted-average annual effective interest rates for the term loans were 8.2% and 10.9%, respectively, which included amortization of\nthe deferred debt issuance costs.\nThere were no borrowings outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility at September 28, 2024. Additionally, there were $6.7 million of Letters of Credit\noutstanding on September 28, 2024, providing the Company the ability to borrow $143.3 million on the revolving line of credit.\nInterest expense on all indebtedness for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 was $10.6 million, $18.0 million, and $14.7 million, respectively.\nThe schedule of remaining principal maturities for the term loans is as follows at September 28, 2024:\n(in thousands)\nFiscal Year Principal Payments\n2025 $ 5,000\n2026 5,000\n2027 5,000\n2028 5,000\n2029 5,000\nThereafter 71,250\nTotal remaining principal payments $ 96,250\n75\n9. Income Taxes\nThe components of income tax (expense) benefit were as follows for the fiscal years presented:\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nCurrent tax provision:\nFederal $ (30,188) $ (645) $ 380\nState (4,447) (243) —\nForeign (267) — —\nTotal current tax (expense) benefit $ (34,902) $ (888) $ 380\nDeferred tax provision:\nFederal $ 2,046 $ (6,230) $ 10,862\nState (372) (1,835) 209\nTotal deferred tax benefit (expense) 1,674 (8,065) 11,071\nIncome tax (expense) benefit $ (33,228) $ (8,953) $ 11,451\nAt September 28, 2024, the Company had $8.0 million (tax effected) in total state tax attributes, primarily comprised of $6.7 million (tax effected) in state tax\ncredit carryforwards and $0.6 million (tax effected) in state net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards. The Company maintains a partial valuation allowance on\nthese state tax attributes. Specifically, the Company estimates that approximately $5.3 million (tax effected) of state tax credit carryforwards will expire unused\nbetween 2025 and 2032 and approximately $0.5 million (tax effected) of state NOL carryforwards will expire unused between 2028 and 2033.\nAt September 28, 2024, the Company had no federal NOL carryforwards.\nThe effective tax rates for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 were 26.2%, 34.7% and 21.6%, respectively.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0%. The increase in the effective tax rate to 26.2% was primarily\ndue to the impacts of state taxes and certain permanent items on the federal rate, which were partially offset by the impacts from federal and state tax credits\n(net of valuation allowances) and discrete period items.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0%. The increase in the effective tax rate to 34.7% was primarily\ndue to the impacts of state taxes and certain permanent items on the federal rate.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0%. The increase in the effective tax rate to 21.6% was primarily\ndue to the impacts of state taxes on the federal rate. This increase was partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance.\nA reconciliation between the reported income tax (expense) benefit and the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate is as follows:\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nFederal tax (expense) benefit at statutory rate $ (26,594) $ (5,419) $ 11,141\n(Increase) reduction in income tax expense resulting from:\nState taxes, net (4,808) (1,700) 2,240\nChange in uncertain tax positions — 240 395\nShare-based compensation (675) (95) (513)\nPermanent items (700) (1,582) (31)\nValuation allowance (17) (319) (2,050)\nTax credits 273 330 285\nReturn to accrual adjustments 4 3 (212)\nInvestor tax on non-consolidated affiliate income (700) (404) 231\nOther (11) (7) (35)\nIncome tax (expense) benefit $ (33,228) $ (8,953) $ 11,451\nThe guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires that a determination be made regarding whether a tax position, based solely on its\ntechnical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, which is the threshold required for\n76\nrecognition of the tax position in the financial statements. The Company's liability arising from uncertain tax positions (\"UTPs\"), including accrued interest and\npenalties, is recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits\nis as follows:\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nBalance, beginning of year $ — $ 110 $ 370\nAdditions for tax positions of prior years — — —\nLapses of applicable statute of limitations — (110) (260)\nBalance, end of year $ — $ — $ 110\nThe Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no accrued interest and\npenalties at September 28, 2024 or September 30, 2023.\nThe Company is subject to taxation mostly in the U.S. and various state jurisdictions. At September 28, 2024, tax years prior to 2020 are generally no longer\nsubject to examination by federal and most state tax authorities.\nThe following table sets forth the sources of and differences between the financial accounting and tax bases of the Company’s assets and liabilities which give\nrise to the net deferred tax liabilities at the dates indicated:\n(in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nDeferred tax liabilities\nProperty, plant and equipment $ (9,894) $ (10,880)\nOther intangible assets (10,679) (11,167)\nInvestor tax on non-consolidated affiliate income (1,261) (866)\nOther (566) —\nTotal deferred tax liabilities $ (22,400) $ (22,913)\nDeferred tax assets\nNOL carryforward $ 731 $ 1,168\nAccrued expenses 8,017 5,586\nCompensation 2,257 2,839\nInterest limitation carryforward — 5,235\nInventories 812 743\nCapitalized research & development 5,035 3,052\nUnearned income 4,301 3,096\nTax credits 6,702 6,685\nTotal deferred tax assets $ 27,855 $ 28,404\nLess: valuation allowance (5,839) (5,822)\nDeferred tax assets less valuation allowance $ 22,016 $ 22,582\nNet deferred tax liabilities $ (384) $ (331)\n10.

Management believes that, considering the Company’s\ninsurance coverage and its intention to vigorously defend its positions, the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on the\nCompany’s financial statements.\nEnvironmental\nThe Company is subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials used in its\nmanufacturing processes. Failure by the Company to comply with present and future regulations could subject it to future liabilities. In addition, such\nregulations could require the Company to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations. The\nCompany is currently not involved in any material environmental\n77\nproceedings and therefore, management believes that the resolution of environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nfinancial statements. Our environmental liability, included in current accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was\n$0.5 million and $0.3 million at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Cash flows over the next five years are expected to be immaterial\neach year, with no material difference between total cash flows and our accrued balance.\nLease Commitments\nWe have operating leases for office and warehouse space and finance leases for equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 0.2 years to 5.7\nyears with the option to extend certain leases for up to 1 year.\nThe components of lease costs included on the Consolidated Statements of Operations are as follows:\n(in thousands) Fiscal Years Ended\nLease cost Classification 2024 2023\nOperating leases Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 2,031 $ 2,188\nFinance leases\nAmortization of lease assets Cost of goods sold 702 702\nInterest on lease liabilities Interest expense 40 60\nShort-term leases (1) Cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses 1,720 1,993\nTotal lease cost $ 4,493 $ 4,943\n(1) Short-term lease cost includes both leases and rentals with initial terms of one year or less.

Segment Information\nWe manage our business in two operating segments: (i) the Bus segment, which includes the manufacture and assembly of buses to be sold to a variety of\ncustomers across the U.S., Canada, and in certain limited international markets; and (ii) the Parts segment, which consists primarily of the purchase of parts\nfrom third parties to be sold to dealers within the Company’s network and certain large fleet customers. Management evaluates the segments based primarily\nupon revenues and gross profit, which are reflected in the tables below for the periods presented:\n79\nNet sales\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nBus (1) $ 1,242,885 $ 1,034,625 $ 723,505\nParts (1) 104,269 98,168 77,132\nSegment net sales $ 1,347,154 $ 1,132,793 $ 800,637\n(1) Parts segment revenue includes $9.3 million, $5.6 million, and $3.9 million for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively, related to inter-\nsegment sales of parts that was eliminated by the Bus segment upon consolidation.\nGross profit\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nBus $ 203,791 $ 91,003 $ 5,065\nParts 52,365 47,847 31,481\nSegment gross profit $ 256,156 $ 138,850 $ 36,546\nThe following table is a reconciliation of segment gross profit to consolidated income (loss) before income taxes for the fiscal years presented:\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nSegment gross profit $ 256,156 $ 138,850 $ 36,546\nAdjustments:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (116,825) (87,193) (77,246)\nInterest expense (10,579) (18,012) (14,675)\nInterest income 4,136 1,004 9\nOther (expense) income, net (4,394) (8,307) 2,947\nLoss on debt refinancing or modification (1,558) (537) (632)\nIncome (loss) before income taxes $ 126,936 $ 25,805 $ (53,051)\nSales are attributable to geographic areas based on customer location and were as follows for the fiscal years presented:\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nUnited States $ 1,199,527 $ 1,048,279 726,227\nCanada 146,609 78,907 69,683\nRest of world 1,018 5,607 4,727\nTotal net sales $ 1,347,154 $ 1,132,793 800,637\n12.

Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity\nSale of Common Stock\nOn December 15, 2021, the Company issued and sold through a private placement an aggregate 4,687,500 shares of its common stock at $16.00 per share\n(“Private Placement”) to Coliseum Capital Partners, L.P. and Blackwell Partners LLC – Series A (collectively, “Coliseum”), with net proceeds of $74.8 million.\nSubsequent to the sale, Coliseum owned an approximate 15% equity interest in the Company. During the second half of fiscal 2023, Coliseum sold all of its\nshares of common stock purchased through the Private Placement (see Note 19, Stockholder Transaction Costs, for further information).\nShare Repurchase Program and Common Stock Retirement\nOn January 31, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized and approved a share repurchase program for up to $60 million of outstanding shares\nof the Company’s common stock over a period of 24 months, expiring January 31, 2026. Under the share repurchase program, the Company may repurchase\nshares through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance\nwith applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nIn the latter part of August and first half of September 2024, the Company repurchased 201,818 shares of its common stock for $9.9 million, pursuant to the\nshare repurchase plan. No such repurchases were made in fiscal 2023. The total remaining authorization for future common stock repurchases under the\nCompany's share repurchase program was $50.1 million as of September 28, 2024.\nIn mid-September 2024, the Company constructively retired the shares of common stock it had recently repurchased by recording the $9.9 million paid in\nexcess of the $0.0001 par value of each share as a reduction in retained earnings. Later that same month, the Company retired the shares of common stock that\nhad previously been reflected as treasury stock within its historical consolidated financial statements by recording the amount paid in excess of the $0.0001 par\nvalue of each share as a $39.9 million reduction in retained earnings, which reduced the value in this account to zero, with the remaining $10.4 million\nrecorded as a reduction in additional paid-in capital.\n14. Earnings (Loss) Per Share\nThe following table presents the basic and diluted earnings per share computation for the fiscal years presented:\n(in thousands except share data) 2024 2023 2022\nNumerator:\nNet income (loss) $ 105,547 $ 23,812 $ (45,759)\nBasic earnings (loss) per share:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 32,270,711 32,071,940 31,020,399\nBasic earnings (loss) per share $ 3.27 $ 0.74 $ (1.48)\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share (1):\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 32,270,711 32,071,940 31,020,399\nWeighted average dilutive securities, restricted stock 407,773 166,720 —\nWeighted average dilutive securities, stock options 283,061 19,992 —\nWeighted average dilutive securities, warrants 387,676 — —\nWeighted average shares and dilutive potential common shares 33,349,221 32,258,652 31,020,399\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share $ 3.16 $ 0.74 $ (1.48)\n(1) There were no potentially dilutive securities for fiscal 2024 while potentially dilutive securities representing 0.7 million and 0.5 million shares of common\nstock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively, as their effect would have been anti-\ndilutive.\nBecause of the timing of the share repurchases discussed in Note 13 above, they had no material impact on earnings per share for fiscal 2024.\n81\n15. Share-Based Compensation\nIn fiscal 2015, we adopted the Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (\"Plan\") and in fiscal 2020, amended and restated it. The Plan is administered by the\nCompensation Committee of our Board of Directors and the Committee may grant awards for the issuance of up to an aggregate of 5,200,000 shares of\ncommon stock in the form of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights (collectively, “SARs,” and each individually, a\n“SAR”), restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, incentive bonus awards, other cash-based awards and other stock-based\nawards. The exercise price of a share subject to a stock option may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock\nwith respect to the grant date of such stock option. No portion of the options vest and become exercisable after the date on which the optionee’s service with\nthe Company and its subsidiaries terminates. The vesting of all unvested shares of common stock subject to an option will automatically be accelerated in\nconnection with a “Change in Control,” as defined in the Plan.\nNew shares of the Company's common stock are issued upon stock option exercises, or at the time of vesting for restricted stock. We have granted performance\nawards as part of our overall compensation plans. The vesting of these awards is primarily based upon the attainment of certain performance metrics\nestablished under our annual Management Incentive Plan (\"MIP\"), with the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors maintaining final discretion\nover vesting amounts.\nStock-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units (\"RSU\"), are recognized in the financial\nstatements based on their fair value. The fair value of each stock option award on the grant date is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with\nthe following assumptions: expected dividend yield, expected stock price volatility, weighted-average risk-free interest rate and weighted average expected\nterm of the options. Because we do not have sufficient history with respect to stock option activity and post-vesting cancellations, the expected term\nassumption is based on the simplified method under U.S. GAAP, which is based on the vesting period and contractual term for each vesting tranche of awards.\nThe mid-point between the vesting date and the expiration date is used as the expected term under this method. The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-\nScholes model is based on the implied yield curve available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues at the date of grant with a remaining term equal to the\nCompany’s expected term assumption. The Company has never declared or paid a cash dividend on its common stock. Restricted stock and RSUs are valued\nbased on the intrinsic value of the difference between the exercise price, if any, of the award and the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date.\nBeginning in fiscal 2024, the Compensation Committee decided that all new annual stock awards issued in accordance with the terms of the Plan would be\nRSUs.\nWe expense any award with graded-vesting features using a straight-line attribution method and account for forfeitures in recording share-based compensation\nexpense as they occur.\nRSU Awards\nThe following table summarizes the Company's RSU activity for the fiscal year presented:\n2024\nWeighted-Average\nGrant Date Fair\nRSU Activity Number of Shares Value\nBalance, beginning of year 584,063 $ 22.99\nGranted 209,708 21.35\nVested (93,766) 15.96\nForfeited (64,357) 23.19\nBalance, end of year 635,648 23.07\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSU awards granted in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 was $23.41 and $17.35, respectively.\nCompensation expense for RSU awards, recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, was $7.2\nmillion, $3.2 million, and $2.6 million for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022, respectively, with associated tax benefits of $1.8 million, $0.8 million, and\n$0.7 million, respectively. At September 28, 2024, unrecognized compensation cost related to RSU awards totaled $6.1 million and is expected to be\nrecognized over a weighted-average period of 0.9 years.\n82\nStock Option Awards\nThe following table summarizes the Company's stock option activity for the fiscal year presented:\n2024\nWeighted Average\nExercise Price per\nNumber of Options Share ($)\nOutstanding options, beginning of year 640,353 $ 16.38\nGranted 63,300 14.45\nExercised (1) (248,015) 16.27\nExpired (4,442) 15.62\nForfeited (15,769) 13.62\nOutstanding options, end of year (2) 435,427 $ 16.27\nFully vested and exercisable options, end of year (3) 278,678 $ 17.58\n(1) Stock options exercised during the fiscal year had an aggregate intrinsic value totaling $6.2 million.\n(2) Stock options outstanding at the end of the fiscal year had $14.0 million intrinsic value.\n(3) Fully vested and exercisable options at the end of the fiscal year had $8.6 million intrinsic value.\nThe total aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 was $0.3 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively.\nCompensation expense for stock option awards, recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, was\n$1.2 million, $0.8 million, and $0.9 million for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022, respectively, with associated tax benefits of $0.3 million, $0.2 million,\nand $0.2 million, respectively. At September 28, 2024, unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards totaled $0.5 million and is expected to\nbe recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.7 years.\nThe fair value of each option award at grant date was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions made and\nresulting grant-date fair values during the fiscal years presented:\n2024 2023 2022\nExpected volatility 62 % 51 % 46 %\nExpected dividend yield 0 % 0 % 0 %\nRisk-free interest rate 4.24 % 3.78 % 1.30 %\nExpected term (in years) 4.5 - 5.0 4.5 - 6.0 4.5 - 6.0\nWeighted-average grant-date fair value $ 16.30 $ 6.17 $ 7.04\n16. Benefit Plans\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan\nThe Company has a defined benefit pension plan (“Defined Benefit Plan”) covering U.S. hourly and salaried personnel. On May 13, 2002, the Defined Benefit\nPlan was amended to freeze new participation as of May 15, 2002, and therefore, any new employees who started on or after May 15, 2002 were not permitted\nto participate in the Defined Benefit Plan. Effective January 1, 2006, the benefit plan was frozen to all participants. No accrual of future benefits is calculated\nbeyond this date.\nThe Company made no contributions to the Defined Benefit Plan during fiscal 2024 and made $1.1 million of contributions in fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2024 and\nfiscal 2023, benefits paid were $8.8 million and $13.2 million, respectively. The fiscal 2023 benefit payments included $5.2 million paid to certain participants\nwho met certain specified criteria (including that they were former employees of the Company who earned enough service to qualify for pension benefits under\nthe terms of the Defined Benefit Plan while they were employed but were not otherwise receiving retirement payments on the date that the benefits were paid)\nand elected to receive a single lump-sum payment in lieu of future retirement payments, with no similar payments made in fiscal 2024. The projected benefit\nobligation (“PBO”) for the Defined Benefit Plan was $113.6 million and $108.4 million at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n83\nThe reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the PBO for the Defined Benefit Plan for the fiscal years indicated is presented in the following\ntable:\nBenefit Obligation\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nProjected benefit obligation balance, beginning of year $ 108,393 $ 122,571\nInterest cost 5,936 6,035\nActuarial loss (gain) (1) 8,091 (7,038)\nBenefits paid (8,786) (13,175)\nProjected benefit obligations balance, end of year $ 113,634 $ 108,393\n(1) Includes assumption changes, as applicable, resulting from (i) changes in the utilized discount rate to value the future obligations, and (ii) updates to the\nmortality table projections used in the calculation of the benefit obligations.\nPlan Assets: The summary and reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the fair value of the Defined Benefit Plan assets are as follows:\nPlan Assets\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nFair value of plan assets, beginning of year $ 105,989 $ 106,547\nActual return on plan assets 21,080 11,504\nEmployer contribution — 1,113\nBenefits paid (8,786) (13,175)\nFair value of plan assets, end of year $ 118,283 $ 105,989\nFunded Status: The following table reconciles the benefit obligations, plan assets, funded status and net asset (liability) information of the Defined Benefit Plan\nat the dates indicated. The net pension asset or liability is reflected in long-term assets or liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFunded Status\n(in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nBenefit obligation $ 113,634 $ 108,393\nFair value of plan assets 118,283 105,989\nFunded status 4,649 (2,404)\nNet pension asset (liability) recognized $ 4,649 $ (2,404)\nFair Value of Plan Assets: The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments in accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures\nTopic of the ASC. Fair value represents the price to hypothetically sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly manner in the principal market for that asset\nor liability. This topic provides a hierarchy that gives highest priority to unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This\ntopic requires that financial assets and liabilities are classified into one of the following three categories:\nLevel 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\nLevel 2 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability\nThe Company evaluates fair value measurement inputs on an ongoing basis in order to determine if there is a change of sufficient significance to warrant a\ntransfer between levels. Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized on the actual date of the event or circumstances that caused the\ntransfer, which generally coincides with the Company's valuation process.\nThe Defined Benefit Plan assets are comprised of various investment funds, which are valued based upon their quoted market prices. The invested pension plan\nassets of the Defined Benefit Plan are all Level 2 assets under the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (“ASC 820”). During fiscal 2024 and fiscal\n2023, there were no transfers between levels. There are no sources of significant concentration risk in the invested assets at September 30, 2024.\n84\nThe following table sets forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, a summary of the Defined Benefit Plan’s investments measured at fair value:\n(in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nSeptember 28, 2024\nAssets:\nEquity securities $ — $ 77,817 $ — $ 77,817\nDebt securities — 40,466 — 40,466\nTotal assets at fair value $ — $ 118,283 $ — $ 118,283\nSeptember 30, 2023\nAssets:\nEquity securities $ — $ 60,055 $ — $ 60,055\nDebt securities — 45,934 — 45,934\nTotal assets at fair value $ — $ 105,989 $ — $ 105,989\nThe following table represents net periodic benefit expense (income) and changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive\nincome, before tax effect, for the fiscal years presented:\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nInterest cost $ 5,936 $ 6,035 $ 4,368\nExpected return on plan assets (6,481) (6,518) (8,491)\nAmortization of net loss 687 1,195 1,163\nNet periodic benefit expense (income) $ 142 $ 712 $ (2,960)\nNet gain $ (6,507) $ (12,024) $ (2,605)\nAmortization of net loss (687) (1,195) (1,163)\nTotal recognized in other comprehensive income $ (7,194) $ (13,219) $ (3,768)\nTotal recognized in net periodic pension benefit expense (income) and other\ncomprehensive income $ (7,052) $ (12,507) $ (6,728)\nThe estimated net loss for the Defined Benefit Plan that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost over the\nnext fiscal year is $0.3 million. The unrecognized gain or loss is amortized as follows: the total unrecognized gain or loss, less the larger of 10% of the liability\nor 10% of the assets, is divided by the average future working lifetime of active plan participants.\nThe following actuarial assumptions were used to determine the benefit obligations at the dates indicated:\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations: September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nDiscount rate 4.80 % 5.70 %\nRate of compensation increase N/A N/A\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost: September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nDiscount rate 5.70 % 5.10 %\nExpected long-term return on plan assets 6.37 % 6.37 %\nRate of compensation increase N/A N/A\nThe benchmark for the discount rates is an estimate of the single equivalent discount rate determined by matching the Defined Benefit Plan’s future expected\ncash flows to spot rates from a yield curve comprised of high-quality corporate bond rates of various durations.\nThe Defined Benefit Plan asset allocations at the dates indicated are as follows:\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nEquity securities 66 % 57 %\nDebt securities 34 % 43 %\nTotal securities 100 % 100 %\n85\nThere was no Company common stock included in equity securities. Assets of the Defined Benefit Plan are invested primarily in funds that further invest in\nequity or debt securities. Assets are valued using quoted prices in active markets.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the\nbenefits included in the PBO. In estimating that rate, appropriate consideration is given to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the fund and rates of\nreturn expected to be available for reinvestment and a building block method. The expected rate of return on each asset class is broken down into three\ncomponents: (1) inflation, (2) the real risk-free rate of return (i.e., the long-term estimate of future returns on default free U.S. government securities), and\n(3) the risk premium for each asset class (i.e., the expected return in excess of the risk-free rate).\nThe investment strategy for pension plan assets is to limit risk through asset allocation, diversification, selection and timing. Assets are managed on a total\nreturn basis, with dividends and interest reinvested in the account.\nThe Company expects to make $0.8 million of contributions to its Defined Benefit Plan in fiscal 2025 in accordance with required IRS minimums. The\nfollowing benefit payments are expected to be paid out of the Company's pension assets to the plan participants in the fiscal years indicated:\n(in thousands) Expected Payments\n2025 $ 8,676\n2026 8,701\n2027 8,682\n2028 8,624\n2029 8,547\n2030 - 2034 40,614\nTotal expected future benefit payments $ 83,844\nDefined Contribution Plan\nThe Company offers a defined contribution 401(k) plan covering substantially all U.S. employees and a defined contribution plan for Canadian employees.\nDuring fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, the Company offered a 50% match on the first 6% of the employee’s contributions. However, due to the\nimpacts of supply chain constraints on the Company's operations and cash flows, the Company temporarily paused this match from August 2022 through\nDecember 2022. The plans also provide for an additional discretionary match depending on Company performance. Compensation expense related to defined\ncontribution plans totaled $2.3 million, $1.3 million and $1.6 million for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022, respectively.\nHealth Benefits\nThe Company provides and is predominantly self-insured for medical, dental, and accident and sickness benefits.

There was $17.4 million in MIP bonus liabilities included in accrued\nexpenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 28, 2024 and $8.3 million at September 30, 2023.\n17. Equity Investment in Affiliate(s)\nMicro Bird Holdings, Inc.\nOn October 14, 2009, Blue Bird and Girardin MiniBus JV Inc. entered into a joint venture, Micro Bird Holdings, Inc. (“Micro Bird”), to combine the\ncomplementary expertise of the two separate manufacturers. Blue Bird Micro Bird by Girardin Type A buses are produced in Drummondville, Quebec by\nMicro Bird.\nThe Company holds a 50% equity interest in Micro Bird, utilizing the equity method of accounting as the Company does not have control to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact Micro Bird’s financial performance based on the shared powers of the\n86\nventure partners. The carrying amount of the equity method investment is adjusted for the Company’s proportionate share of net earnings or losses and any\ndividends received. At September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the carrying value of the Company's investment in Micro Bird was $24.4 million and\n$17.6 million, respectively. During fiscal 2024, Micro Bird paid each venture partner $5.3 million in dividends. No dividends were paid by Micro Bird in fiscal\n2023.\nIn recognizing the Company’s 50% portion of Micro Bird net income or loss, the Company recorded $12.1 million, $7.0 million, and $(4.2) million in equity in\nnet income (loss) of non-consolidated affiliate(s) for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022, respectively.\nMicro Bird's summarized balance sheet information at its September 30 year end is as follows (denominated in U.S. Dollars):\nBalance Sheet\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nCurrent assets $ 100,974 $ 72,232\nNon-current assets 25,097 21,220\nTotal assets $ 126,071 $ 93,452\nCurrent liabilities 86,788 64,230\nNon-current liabilities 1,201 2,359\nTotal liabilities $ 87,989 $ 66,589\nNet assets $ 38,082 $ 26,863\nMicro Bird's summarized financial results for its three fiscal years ended September 30 are as follows (denominated in U.S. Dollars):\nIncome Statement\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nRevenues $ 280,943 $ 203,086 $ 128,343\nGross profit 54,599 35,453 2,071\nOperating income (loss) 32,075 18,310 (10,453)\nNet income (loss) 21,726 13,244 (8,924)\nClean Bus Solutions, LLC\nOn December 7, 2023, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, BBBC, and GC Mobility Investments I, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of\nGenerate Capital, PBC (“Generate Capital”), a sustainable investment company focusing on clean energy, transportation, water, waste, agriculture, smart cities\nand industrial decarbonization, executed a definitive agreement (“Joint Venture Agreement”) establishing a joint venture, Clean Bus Solutions, LLC, to provide\na fleet-as-a-service (\"FaaS\") offering using electric school buses manufactured and sold by the Company (“CBS”). The service will be offered to qualified\ncustomers of the Company. Through CBS, the Company will provide its end customers with turnkey electrification solutions, including a wide product range\nconsisting of, among others, electric school buses, financing of electric buses and supporting charging infrastructure, project planning and management, and\nfleet optimization.\nThe Company and Generate Capital will initially have an equal common ownership interest in CBS, and will initially jointly share management responsibility\nand control, with each party having certain customary consent and approval rights and control triggers. The parties have each agreed to contribute up to\n$10.0 million to CBS, as agreed from time to time, for common interests to fund administrative expenses, and up to an additional $100.0 million of capital in\nthe form of preferred interests to fund the purchase, delivery, installation, operation and maintenance of FaaS projects, inclusive of Blue Bird electric school\nbuses and associated charging infrastructure. Of this amount, the Company has committed to provide up to $20.0 million and Generate Capital has committed\nto provide up to $80.0 million, with the Company’s aggregate commitment in any one year not to exceed $10.0 million without its consent.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement, the Company will promote CBS as its preferred FaaS offering for electric school buses and has\nagreed to not participate as a joint venture partner in any other similar FaaS offering for electric school buses, except as an original equipment manufacturer of\nbuses. The Company’s obligations do not prevent or limit any activities of its dealers.\nCBS has a perpetual duration subject to the right of either party to terminate early upon the occurrence of certain events of default or the failure to achieve\ncertain milestones set forth in the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement.\nThe Company utilizes the equity method of accounting in recording its interest in CBS as it does not have control to direct the activities that most significantly\nimpact CBS' financial performance based on the shared powers of the venture partners. The carrying\n87\namount of the equity method investment is adjusted for the Company’s proportionate share of net earnings or losses and any dividends received.\nIn connection with the execution of the Joint Venture Agreement, the Company granted Generate Capital warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares\nof Company common stock at an exercise price of $25.00 per share during a five-year exercise period (“Warrants”). Two-thirds of the Warrants were\nimmediately exercisable while the remaining Warrants became exercisable upon Generate Capital satisfying certain funding conditions during our fiscal 2024.\nThe exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants are subject to adjustment in the event of a recapitalization, stock dividend\nor similar event.\nThe Company recorded the $7.4 million fair value of the Warrants upon issuance as permanent equity within additional paid-in capital on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets and is not required to subsequently record changes in fair value as long as the Warrants continue to be classified within stockholders' equity.\nAdditionally, since the Warrants were provided in exchange for an investment in CBS, the Company recorded the cost of its investment based on the fair value\nof the Warrants upon issuance, which increased the balance of equity investment in affiliate(s) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets by a corresponding\n$7.4 million.\nDuring fiscal 2024, the Company also made a $0.6 million contribution to CBS, which was recorded to equity investment in affiliate(s). CBS paid no dividends\nduring fiscal 2024. In recognizing the Company’s proportionate percentage of CBS' net income or loss, the Company recorded $(0.3) million in equity in net\nincome (loss) of non-consolidated affiliate(s) for fiscal 2024. At September 28, 2024, the carrying value of the Company's investment in CBS was $7.7 million.\n18.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company\nfiles or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\"Exchange Act\"), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the\ndisclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.\nIn connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision of and with the\nparticipation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of September 28, 2024 on the effectiveness\nof the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange\nAct.

Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control\nover financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this Report. In making this\nassessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control\n– Integrated Framework (2013). Based on management's assessment and those criteria, management concluded that our internal control over financial\nreporting was effective as of September 28, 2024.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has issued its report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 28,\n2024, which appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024 that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n90\nItem 9B.

The outstanding shares of our Common Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-\nassessable.\nCommon Stock\nOur charter provides that the Common Stock will have identical rights, powers, preferences and privileges.\nVoting Power\nExcept as otherwise required by law or as otherwise provided in any certificate of designation for any series of preferred stock, the holders of\nCommon Stock possess all voting power for the election of our directors and all other matters requiring stockholder action. Holders of Common Stock are\nentitled to one vote per share on matters to be voted on by stockholders.\nDividends\nHolders of Common Stock will be entitled to receive such dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors in its\ndiscretion out of funds legally available therefor. In no event will any stock dividends or stock splits or combinations of stock be declared or made on Common\nStock unless the shares of Common Stock at the time outstanding are treated equally and identically.\nLiquidation, Dissolution and Winding Up\nIn the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, distribution of assets or winding-up, the holders of the Common Stock will be\nentitled to receive an equal amount per share of all of our assets of whatever kind available for distribution to stockholders, after the rights of the holders of the\npreferred stock have been satisfied.\nPreemptive or Other Rights\nThere are no preemptive rights, redemption provisions or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Common Stock.\nElection of Directors\nOur board of directors is divided into three separate classes with each class serving a three-year term. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the\nelection of directors, with the result that the holders of more than 50% of the shares voted for the election of directors can elect all of the directors.\nPreferred Stock\nOur charter provides that shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our board of directors will be authorized to\nfix the voting rights, if any, designations, powers, preferences, the relative, participating, optional or other special rights and any qualifications, limitations and\nrestrictions thereof, applicable to the shares of each series. Our board of directors will be able to, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with\nvoting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of the Common Stock and could have anti-takeover effects.\nThe ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of\ncontrol of our company or the removal of existing management.\nExhibit 4.5\nAs of our fiscal year ended September 28, 2024, there were no shares of Preferred Stock outstanding. Shares of Series A Convertible Cumulative\nPreferred Stock issued in connection with our 2015 business combination were either purchased by us or converted by us into Common Stock.\nWarrants\nAs of our fiscal year ended September 28, 2024, there were outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of our Common Stock,\non a one-for-one basis, at an exercise price of $25.00 per share during a five-year exercise period, expiring at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 7, 2028\n(the “Warrants”). Two-thirds of the Warrants were immediately exercisable upon issuance (on December 7, 2023), while the remaining Warrants became\nexercisable upon the holder satisfying certain funding conditions pursuant to a joint venture agreement during our fiscal year 2024. The exercise price and the\nnumber of shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants are subject to proportional adjustment in the event of a recapitalization, stock dividend or similar\nevent. In the event of any reorganization or reclassification of our company, consolidation or merger where we are not the surviving entity, or dissolution or\nliquidation or winding up of our company, upon exercise of the Warrants the holder(s) have the right to receive the same consideration as other holders of our\nCommon Stock. The Warrants are transferable, subject to certain conditions, and were issued without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,\npursuant to an exemption therefrom.\nA more detailed description of the Warrants is contained in the Warrant Agreements filed as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended September 28, 2024.\nDividends\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends. In addition, certain of our loan\nagreements restrict the payment of dividends. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital\nrequirements, debt covenants and general financial condition. The payment of any cash dividends will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such\ntime.\nCertain Anti-Takeover Provisions Under our Charter and Pursuant to Delaware Law\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our\nmanagement without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include:\n• no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n• the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or\nthe resignation, death, or removal of a director with or without cause by stockholders, which prevents stockholders from being able\nto fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n• subject to any rights of holders of existing preferred shares, the ability of our board of directors to determine whether to issue shares\nof our preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without\nstockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n• a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting\nof our stockholders;\nExhibit 4.5\n• the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief\nexecutive officer, or the board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to\ntake action, including the removal of directors;\n• limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n• controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of stockholder meetings;\n• providing for a staggered board, in which the members of the board of directors are divided into three classes to serve for a period of\nthree years from the date of their respective appointment or election;\n• permitting the removal of directors with or without cause by stockholders voting a majority of the votes cast if, at any time and for\nso long as, American Securities LLC (through its affiliate ASP BB Holdings LLC) beneficially owns, in the aggregate, capital stock\nrepresenting at least 40% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock;\n• advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to\npropose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a\nsolicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company;\n• requiring an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our entire board of directors and by the holders of at least 66.67% of the voting\npower of our outstanding voting stock in order to adopt an amendment to our certificate of incorporation if, at any time and for so\nlong as, American Securities LLC (through its affiliate ASP BB Holdings LLC) beneficially owns, in the aggregate, capital stock\nrepresenting at least 50% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock; and\n• requiring an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our entire board of directors or by the holders of at least 66.67% of the voting\npower of our outstanding voting stock to amend our bylaws if, at any time and for so long as, American Securities LLC (through its\naffiliate ASP BB Holdings LLC) beneficially owns, in the aggregate, capital stock representing at least 50% of the outstanding\nshares of our Common Stock.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of our Company or changes in our board of directors and\nmanagement.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the\n“DGCL”), which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding Common Stock from engaging in certain business combinations\nwithout approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding Common Stock. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware\nlaw that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our\nCommon Stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Common Stock.\nExecution Version\nCertain identified information has been redacted/excluded from this exhibit because it is both not\nmaterial and is the type that the registrant treats as private or confidential\nDATED AS OF AUGUST 8, 2024\nAMENDED AND RESTATED LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY\nAGREEMENT\nOF\nCLEAN BUS SOLUTIONS, LLC\nTHE INTERESTS EVIDENCED BY THIS AGREEMENT HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF\n1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE SECURITIES ACT OF ANY STATE, HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT, AND MAY\nNOT BE SOLD, OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF, OR OFFERED FOR SALE UNLESS REGISTRATION STATEMENTS UNDER\nSUCH ACTS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH INTERESTS ARE THEN IN EFFECT OR EXEMPTIONS FROM THE\nREGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH ACTS ARE THEN APPLICABLE TO SUCH OFFER OR SALE, AND UNLESS\nTHE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE SATISFIED.\nCONTENTS\nSection Page\n1.

In any Exercise Notice, the\nMember electing to exercise its pre-emptive rights pursuant to this Section 3.3 (each, an “Electing Member”) shall specify the\nnumber of Pre-emptive Securities, up to its Class A Pro Rata Share, that it desires to purchase. Any Member who fails to give the\nCompany an Exercise Notice during the Exercise Period shall be deemed to have forfeited such Member’s right to acquire the Pre-\nemptive Securities offered pursuant to such Pre-emptive Rights Notice but, for the avoidance of doubt, any such failure shall not\naffect such Member’s pre-emptive rights pursuant to this Section 3.3 with respect to any future issuances or sales of Pre-emptive\nSecurities.\n(b) During the 120 days (which such 120-day period may be extended for a reasonable time to obtain any required regulatory approvals)\nfollowing the expiration of the Exercise Period, the Company shall be entitled to issue or sell the Pre-emptive Securities described in\nthe Pre-emptive Rights Notice with respect to which the Electing Members declined to exercise the pre-emptive right set forth in this\nSection 3.3 on a price per unit of Pre-emptive Securities not less than, and otherwise on terms no less favorable to the Company than,\nthose set forth in the Pre-emptive Rights Notice.

Contribution\npursuant to this Section 4.2 to the extent it would cause the aggregate amount of Capital Contributions made by Blue Bird in any\nFiscal Year to exceed [REDACTED] without its prior

To the extent the Company issues\nCapital Call Notices that would cause Blue Bird to exceed the Annual Limit and Blue Bird declines to fund Capital Contributions in\naccordance with its Drawdown Percentage, the Investor may, but shall not be obligated to, extend a Member Loan to cover such\namounts in accordance with the terms of Section 4.3 below; provided that such Member Loan shall initially be extended to the\nCompany, and shall convert to a Member Loan extended to Blue Bird as the Non-Contributing Member for purposes of Section 4.3\nupon the end of the Fiscal Year in which such Member Loan was made (being such time as the relevant Annual Limit no longer\napplies).\n(d) All Capital Contributions (other than in kind Capital Contributions) shall be made in U.S. Dollars by wire transfer or other direct\nfunds transfer in immediately available funds to the bank account of the Company specified in writing by the Company.\n(e) The Board may from time to time, in its discretion, request or accept funding by way of subordinated loans from the Members in lieu\nof Capital Contributions on terms to be determined at such time.\n(f) The Members shall not have any right to make additional Capital Contributions to the Company except in accordance with the terms\nof this Agreement.\n4.3 Failure to Fund Capital Contributions\n(a) If a Member fails to make all or part of any Capital Contribution (such amount its “Unfunded Contribution”) requested under\nSection 4.2 within thirty (30) days after delivery of written notice from the Board of such request (a “Non-Contributing Member”),\nthe other Member(s) will have the option, but not be obligated, to contribute to the Company all or part of the Unfunded Contribution\n(each such Member who funds any part of an Unfunded Contribution, a “Contributing Member”). If the proposed contributions by\nthe Contributing Members exceed the Unfunded Contribution, then each Contributing Member may fund a portion of the Unfunded\nContribution on a pro rata basis according to the respective Class A Pro Rata Share or Class B Pro Rata Share (as applicable) of such\nContributing Members in place of such Non-Contributing Member. The amount contributed by any Contributing Member in\naccordance with the foregoing sentence is deemed a “Member Loan”, which will be treated as loaned by such Contributing Member\nto the Non-Contributing Member (or as applicable under Section 4.2(c), to the Company), and in turn, contributed by the Non-\nContributing Member to the Company.

Following such notice by any Capital\nMember, the Capital Members shall cooperate in good faith to determine a plan for the continued operation or transfer of any existing\nCompany Projects and eventual wind down and dissolution of the Company following runoff or transfer of such Company Projects.\n4.5 Voluntary Redemption\nAt any time following the Effective Date, and from time to time, the Board shall have the right to redeem the Class B Interests in\nwhole or in part (a “Voluntary Redemption”) for an amount, paid in cash, equal to [REDACTED] of the Liquidation Preference for\nsuch Class B Interests (the “Voluntary Redemption Amount”).

For greater clarity, the foregoing shall include, but\nnot be limited to, counting such Class A Interests held by the Management Aggregator towards the applicable Class A Member’s\nrespective Class A Pro Rata Shares for the purpose of determining pre-emptive rights pursuant to Section 3.3, Capital Contributions\npursuant to this Article 4, distributions pursuant to Section 5.4, and voting power pursuant to Section 6.3.\n5. CAPITAL ACCOUNTS; DISTRIBUTIONS; ALLOCATIONS\n5.1 Capital Accounts\n(a) A Capital Account shall be maintained for each Member in accordance with the rules of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)\n(iv). The Capital Account of each Member shall be credited with (i) the amount of any Capital Contribution made in cash by such\nMember, (ii) the Agreed Value (net of any liabilities the Company is considered to assume under or take subject to Section 752 of the\nCode) of any Capital Contribution made in property other than cash by such Member, (iii) allocations to such Member of Net Income\npursuant to Section 5.2, and (iv) any other item required to be credited for proper maintenance of capital accounts by the Treasury\nRegulations under Section 704(b) of the Code. A Member’s Capital Account shall be debited with (w) the amount of any cash\ndistributed to such Member,\n(x) the Agreed Value (net of liabilities that such Member is considered to assume under or take subject to Section 752 of the Code) of\nany property other than cash distributed to such Member, (y) allocations to such Member of Net Loss pursuant to Section 5.2, and (z)\nany other item required to be debited for proper maintenance of capital accounts by the Treasury Regulations under Section 704(b) of\nthe Code. Each Member’s Capital Account shall be adjusted as required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.704- 1(b)(2)(iv)(f) to reflect\na revaluation of Company Property at Agreed Value upon the occurrence of any event described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-\n1(b)(2)(iv)(f)(5) based upon the manner in which gain or loss upon a sale of all the assets of the Company for Agreed Value would be\nallocated. A Member that has more than one class or series of Interests shall have a single Capital Account that reflects all such\nInterests; provided, however, that the Capital Accounts shall be maintained in such manner as will facilitate a determination of the\nportion of each Capital Account attributable to each class or series of Interests.\n(b) In the event that all or any portion of any Member’s Interests are transferred in accordance with this Agreement, the transferee(s) of\nsuch Interests shall succeed to all or the corresponding portion, as the case may be, of the transferor’s Capital Account.\n(cid:3)(cid:239) (cid:3)(cid:237)\n(cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:239) (cid:3)æ (cid:3)(cid:243) (cid:3)(cid:244) (cid:3)ı (cid:3)r(cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:239) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E (cid:0)z (cid:0)K (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:238) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:243) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)ı (cid:3)(cid:243) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:239) (cid:3)X(cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:237)\n5.2 Book Allocation of Net Income and Net Loss\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 5.2(b) through (h) and (k), Net Income or Net Loss for any Fiscal Year, and to the extent that\nthe Members determine it is necessary or appropriate, individual items of income, gain, loss and deduction of the Company shall be\nallocated among the Members so as to cause each Member’s Adjusted Capital Account balance to equal as nearly as possible (i) the\namount of the distribution pursuant to Section 11.1(b)(iv), accounting first for discretionary distributions made or declared under\nSection 5.4(c)(i), which such Member would receive if, at the end of such Fiscal Year, each Company asset were sold for an amount\nof cash equal to such asset’s Book Value, each liability of the Company were satisfied in cash in accordance with its terms (limited,\nwith respect to each Nonrecourse Liability, to the Book Value of any asset or assets securing such Nonrecourse Liability), and all\nremaining cash of the Company were distributed to the Members in accordance with Section 11.1(b) minus (ii) such Member’s shares\nof Company Minimum Gain and Minimum Gain Attributable to Member Nonrecourse Debt, computed immediately prior to the\nhypothetical sale of assets.\n(b) If there is a net decrease in Company Minimum Gain during a Company taxable year, each Member shall be specially allocated items\nof income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, for subsequent years) in proportion to, and to the extent of, an amount equal to the\nportion of such Member’s share of the net decrease in Company Minimum Gain during such year (which share of such net decrease\nshall be determined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(g)(2)). This Section 5.2(b) is intended to be a “minimum gain\nchargeback” described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(f) and is to be interpreted in a manner consistent therewith.\n(c) If there is a net decrease during a Company taxable year in the Minimum Gain Attributable to a Member Nonrecourse Debt (as\ndetermined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(3)), any Member with a share of Minimum Gain Attributable to such\nMember Nonrecourse Debt at the beginning of such year shall be specially allocated items of income and gain for such year (and, if\nnecessary, for subsequent years) in proportion to, and to the extent of, an amount equal to the portion of such Member’s share of the\nnet decrease in Minimum Gain Attributable to such Member Nonrecourse Debt (as determined under Treasury Regulation Section\n1.704-2(g)(2)), during such year. This Section 5.2(c) is intended to be a “partner minimum gain chargeback” described in Treasury\nRegulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and is to be interpreted in a manner consistent therewith.\n(d) Items of Company loss, deduction or Section 705(a)(2)(B) Expenditure that are attributable to a Member Nonrecourse Debt shall be\nallocated among the Members who bear the Economic Risk of Loss for such Member Nonrecourse Debt. This provision is to be\ninterpreted in a manner consistent with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(1).\n(e) The Nonrecourse Deductions for each taxable year of the Company shall be allocated to the Members in proportion to their Pro Rata\nCapital Shares.\n(f) In the event that any Member unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations, or distributions described in Treasury Regulation\nSection 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or 1.704- 1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), items of Company income and gain shall be\nspecifically allocated to such member in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury\nRegulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the deficit balance, if any, in its Adjusted Capital Account created by such\nadjustments, allocations or distributions as quickly as possible. This provision is intended to be a “qualified income offset” described\nin Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and is to be interpreted in a matter consistent therewith.\n(cid:3)(cid:239) (cid:3)(cid:238)\n(cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:239) (cid:3)æ (cid:3)(cid:243) (cid:3)(cid:244) (cid:3)ı (cid:3)r(cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:239) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E (cid:0)z (cid:0)K (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:238) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:243) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)ı (cid:3)(cid:243) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:239) (cid:3)X(cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:237)\n(g) To the extent that an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Company Property pursuant to Code Section 734(b) or Code Section\n743(b) is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704- 1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) or Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)\n(iv)(m)(4), to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts as a result of a distribution to a Member, the amount of such\nadjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the Company Property)\nor loss (if the adjustment decreases the basis of the Company Property), and such gain or loss shall be allocated to the Members in\naccordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704- 1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) or Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4), as the\ncase may be.\n(h) In the event that any item of Company income, gain, loss, deduction or Section 705(a)(2)(B) Expenditure is allocated pursuant to\nSection 5.2(b) through (g), subsequent items of Company income, gain, loss, deduction or Section 705(a)(2)(B) Expenditure (as\ndetermined for purposes of computing Net Income or Net Loss) shall, to the extent consistent with Section 5.2(b) through (g), be\nallocated between the Members so as to eliminate as quickly as possible on a proportionate basis, with respect to each Member, any\ndisparity between (i) the sum of (x) such Member’s Capital Account balance and (y) such Member’s share of Company Minimum\nGain and Minimum Gain Attributable to Member Nonrecourse Debts determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections\n1.704-2(g) and (i)(5) and (ii) the Capital Account which such Member would have had if all Company Minimum Gain and Minimum\nGain Attributable to any Member Nonrecourse Debt had been realized and all allocations of Net Income and Net Loss had been made\npursuant to Section 5.2(a) (without giving effect to the reference therein to Section 5.2(b) through (h)).\n(i) In the event that any item or items of income, gain, loss or deduction of the Company or any Member (or any person related to a\nMember) is reallocated between the Company and any Member (or any person related to a Member) pursuant to Code Section 482,\nthen the allocation of the income, gain, loss or deduction of the Company for the year in which such reallocation occurs shall be made\nin such a fashion that the Capital Accounts of all Members, after taking into account any deemed contributions or distributions arising\nin connection with such reallocation, shall be equal to what they would have been if no reallocation had occurred.\n(j) In the event that the Pro Rata Capital Shares of the Members shall change pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, there shall be an\ninterim closing of the books of the Company as of the close of the day of such change (the “Interest Change Date”) and the Capital\nAccounts of the Members shall be revalued pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) revalued effective\nimmediately prior to the event giving rise to the interim closing of the books of the Company. The Net Income or Net Loss of the\nCompany for the period ending on the Interest Change Date shall be allocated to the Members in accordance with their respective Pro\nRata Capital Shares in effect prior to the Interest Change Date. The Net Income or Net Loss of the Company for any period\ncommencing after the Interest Change Date shall be allocated to the members in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Capital\nShares in effect after the Interest Change Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Interest Change Date is not the last day of a\nmonth, Net Income or Net Loss of the Company for the month in which the Interest Change Date occurs shall be prorated on a daily\nbasis between the portion of the month ending on the Interest Change Date and the remainder of such month.\n(k) In the event that any Member contributes any services to the Company, or such member otherwise provides or makes available such\nservices to the Company and in connection therewith the Company is entitled to a current tax deduction (including depreciation and\namortization allowed in any current year) in excess of the amount paid for such services by the Company in cash or property (other\nthan an interest in the Company) or otherwise taken into account as part of the Agreed Value of such Member’s Capital Contributions\ncontributed to the Company on the Execution Date, the amount of such excess shall be\n(cid:3)(cid:239) (cid:3)(cid:239)\n(cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:239) (cid:3)æ (cid:3)(cid:243) (cid:3)(cid:244) (cid:3)ı (cid:3)r(cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:239) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E (cid:0)z (cid:0)K (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:238) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:243) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)ı (cid:3)(cid:243) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:239) (cid:3)X(cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:237)\ntreated as a Capital Contribution by such Member and a corresponding amount of the Company’s deductions shall be specially\nallocated to such Member, with no net effect on such Member’s Capital Account.\n(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (i) the Company is authorized to follow the proposed Treasury\nRegulations that were issued on May 24, 2005 regarding the issuance of partnership equity for services (including Proposed Treasury\nRegulations Sections 1.83-3, 1.83-6, 1.704-1, 1.706-3, 1.721-1 and 1.761-1), as such Treasury Regulations may be subsequently\namended (the “Proposed Regulations”), upon the issuance of Interests issued for services rendered or to be rendered to or for the\nbenefit of the Company, until final Treasury Regulations regarding these matters are issued and, if the Company determines to follow\nsuch Proposed Regulations, in furtherance of the foregoing, the definition of Capital Accounts and Book Value, and the allocations of\nNet Income and Net Loss of the Company set forth in this Agreement, will be made in a manner that is consistent with such Proposed\nRegulations, including Proposed Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(xii), (ii) the Company is expressly authorized by each Member to\nelect to apply the safe harbor set forth in such Proposed Regulations if the provisions of such Proposed Regulations and the proposed\nRevenue Procedure described in IRS Notice 2005-43, or provisions similar thereto, are adopted as final (or temporary) Treasury\nRegulations and, if the Company decides to make such election, the Company is hereby authorized to amend this Agreement without\nthe consent of any Member to provide that (A) the Company is authorized and directed to elect such safe harbor, (B) the Company\nand each of its Members (including any person to whom an Interest is transferred in connection with the performance of services) will\ncomply with all requirements of such safe harbor with respect to all Interests transferred in connection with the performance of\nservices while such election remains in effect and (C) the Company and each of its Members will take all actions necessary, including\nproviding the Company with any required information, to permit the Company to comply with the requirements set forth or referred to\nin the applicable Proposed Regulations for such election to be effective until such time (if any) as the Company determines, in its\ndiscretion, that the Company should terminate such election, and (iii) the Company is further authorized to amend this Agreement to\nthe extent the Company determines in its discretion that such modification is necessary or desirable as a result of the issuance of such\nTreasury Regulations relating to the tax treatment of the transfer of a partnership interest in connection with the performance of\nservices.

All\nquarterly Tax Distributions to a Member shall be treated as an advance of, and shall offset, the cash distribution payable to the\nMember (pursuant to this Section 5.5) on the next Tax Distribution Date. Any distributions made pursuant to this Section 5.5 to a\nMember shall be treated as an advance payment of, and shall reduce, the amounts otherwise distributable to such Member pursuant to\nSection 5.4 in subsequent distributions.\n5.6 No Interest; No Return of Capital\nSubject to (and without limitation of) Sections 5.4 and 11, (a) no interest shall be payable on the Capital Contributions or in respect of\nthe Capital Accounts of the Members, and (b) no Member shall have the right to require that any portion of its Capital Contributions\nor Capital Account be returned or otherwise paid over to it.\n5.7 Negative Capital Accounts\nNo Member shall be required to pay to any other Member or the Company any deficit or negative balance which may exist from time\nto time in such Member’s Capital Account (including upon and after dissolution of the Company).\n6.

other Class A Member (in\neach such instance, the “Tag-Along Holder”) with a copy of such notice which shall offer each such Tag-Along Holder the\nopportunity to participate in such Transfer of Class A Interests. The Tag-Along Notice shall identify (i) the Class A Interests proposed\nto be sold by the Tag-Along Seller (the “Tag-Along Securities”), (ii) the fraction expressed as a percentage, determined by dividing\nthe number of Class A Interests to be purchased from the Tag-Along Seller in such Tag-Along Sale by the total number of Class A\nInterests held by such Tag-Along Seller (the “Tag-Along Sale Percentage”), (iii) the purchase price for the Tag-Along Securities, (iv)\nthe name and address of each proposed transferee,\n(v) the proposed Transfer date and (vi) all other material terms and conditions of the Tag-Along Sale.\n(b) The Tag-Along Holder shall have the right to request that the Tag-Along Seller include in the proposed Transfer a number of Interests\nof the same class of Interests as the Tag-Along Securities held by such Tag- Along Holder (such number of Interests shall not in any\nevent exceed the Tag-Along Sale Percentage of the total number of Interests of the specified class of Tag-Along Securities held by\nsuch Tag-Along Holder) by delivering written notice to each of the Company and the Tag-Along Seller within twenty (20) Business\nDays after delivery of the Tag-Along Notice (such time period, the “Tag-Along Notice Period”), and such notice shall include wire\ntransfer instructions for payment of the purchase price for the Interests of such Tag-Along Holder to be included in the Tag-Along\nSale and a limited power-of-attorney authorizing the Tag-Along Seller to Transfer such Interests on the terms set forth in the Tag-\nAlong Notice (the “Tag-Along Response Notice”). If the Tag-Along Holder has elected to participate in such Tag- Along Sale, the\nTag-Along Seller and the Tag-Along Holder (each, a “Tagging Person”) will each be entitled to sell in the contemplated Transfer, at\nthe same price and on the same terms, with respect to the Interests to be Transferred. If at the termination of the Tag-Along Notice\nPeriod, the Tag-Along Holder has not elected to participate in the Tag-Along Sale by validly delivering a Tag-Along Response Notice,\nsuch Tag-Along Holder shall be deemed to have waived its rights under this Section 8.4 with respect to, and only with respect to, the\nTransfer of its Interests pursuant to such Tag-Along Sale. At the termination of the Tag-Along Notice Period, the Tag-Along Seller\nmay Transfer its Interests pursuant to a Tag-Along Sale provided that (i) the Interests elected to be sold by the Tag-Along Holder prior\nto the termination of the Tag-Along Notice Period, if any, are purchased at the same time, and on the same terms, or (ii) if such\nprospective transferee declines to allow the participation of any Tagging Person (or to purchase all the Interests that a Tagging Person\nhas validly elected to Transfer in connection with such Tag-Along Sale) but the Tag-Along Seller wishes to proceed with the Tag-\nAlong Sale then the Tag-Along Seller may do so provided that simultaneously with such Tag-Along Sale, the Tag-Along Seller\npurchases the aggregate number of Interests from such Tagging Person which such Tagging Person is otherwise entitled to Transfer\npursuant to this Section 8.4 on terms no more or less favorable to the Tag-Along Seller as set forth herein.\n(c) Each participating Tagging Person shall (i) pay its pro rata share of the third party costs and expenses (together with any applicable\nTaxes) incurred by the Tag-Along Seller in connection with such Tag-Along Sale, to the extent that such expenses are not paid or\nreimbursed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,\n(ii) grant the same representations and warranties as the Tag-Along Seller, including in respect of identity, due authorization, solvency,\nnon-contravention and free and clear title on the same terms as such warranties are given by the Tag-Along Seller and (iii) be\nobligated to join on a several (and not joint and several) pro rata basis in the funding of any indemnification in respect of\nrepresentations and warranties or otherwise or other monetary obligations that the Tag-Along Seller itself agrees to undertake in\nconnection with such Tag-Along Sale, except that this clause (iii) shall not apply to any representations or warranties given by the\nTag-Along Seller relating to identity, due authorization, non-contravention and free and clear title given by the Tag-Along Seller\nsolely in respect of its own interests.\n(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 8.4, there shall be no liability on the part of the Tag- Along Seller to the Tag-\nAlong Holder or any other person if the Tag-Along Sale pursuant to this Section\n(cid:3)æ (cid:3)(cid:239)\n(cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:239) (cid:3)æ (cid:3)(cid:243) (cid:3)(cid:244) (cid:3)ı (cid:3)r(cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:239) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E (cid:0)z (cid:0)K (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:238) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:243) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)ı (cid:3)(cid:243) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:239) (cid:3)X(cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:237)\n8.4 is not consummated for any reason. Whether to effect a Tag-Along Sale pursuant to this Section 8.4 by the Tag-Along Seller is in\nthe sole and absolute discretion of the Tag-Along Seller.\n8.5 Event of Default Put and Call Rights\n(a) At any time within sixty (60) Business Days after receipt of notice by another Member (other than any Class C Member), or such\nother Member (other than any Class C Member) otherwise having actual knowledge of, the occurrence of an Event of Default with\nrespect to a Member (such Member and any other Members who are Affiliates of such Member, the “Defaulting Member”, and all\nother Members (other than any Class C Member), collectively, the “Non-Defaulting Member”), the Non-Defaulting Member may\nrequest a determination of the Fair Market Value of its Interests and the Interests of the Defaulting Member by giving the Defaulting\nMember written notice of such request (the “Valuation Notice”). The Non-Defaulting Member may withdraw the Valuation Notice at\nany time after the delivery thereof. It is understood and agreed that once a Valuation Notice has been delivered, the Members shall\nhave the rights and obligations set forth below in this Section 8.5 regardless of whether the Defaulting Member subsequently cures the\nrelevant Event of Default.\n(b) After the delivery of a Valuation Notice, the Members shall follow the FMV Determination Procedure.\n(c) Subject to Section 17.1(c)(i), the Non-Defaulting Member shall have the irrevocable option to (i) require the Defaulting Member to\npurchase all of the Interests of the Non-Defaulting Member, at a [REDACTED] premium over the Fair Market Value of such Interests\n(the “Event of Default Put Right”), or (ii) (either through itself or by way of an Affiliate) purchase from the Defaulting Member all\nof the Interests of the Defaulting Member, subject to Section 17.1(c)(i), at a [REDACTED] discount off of the Fair Market Value of\nsuch Interests (the “Event of Default Call Right”), each such option being exercisable by the Non-Defaulting Member giving the\nDefaulting Member written notice of such exercise (an “Event of Default Put Exercise Notice” or a “Event of Default Call\nExercise Notice”, as applicable) within 30 days after a final determination of the Fair Market Value of such Interests pursuant to the\nFMV Determination Procedure.\n(d) If the Non-Defaulting Member shall timely deliver an Event of Default Put Exercise Notice, the closing of the purchase and sale of\nthe Interest of the Non-Defaulting Member pursuant to the Event of Default Put Right (an “Event of Default Put Right Closing”)\nshall occur at the offices of the Non-Defaulting Member on the tenth Business Day after the latest to occur of (i) the 90th day after the\ndelivery of such Event of Default Put Exercise Notice, and (ii) the date on which all third party consents required to consummate the\ntransaction, if any, have been obtained, or at such other place, date and time mutually agreed upon by the Members. At such closing,\neach Member constituting the Non-Defaulting Member shall execute and deliver the Required Transfer Documentation against receipt\nof the purchase price to be paid in accordance with Section 8.5(g) below, in an amount equal to (A) if such Member is the sole\nMember constituting the Non-Defaulting Member, the Fair Market Value of the Interests of the Non- Defaulting Member so acquired\n(as previously determined pursuant to the FMV Determination Procedure) plus [REDACTED] or (B) if such Member is one of\nmultiple Members constituting the Non- Defaulting Member, such Member’s proportionate share (based on the relative percentage\nshares of all of the Members constituting the Non-Defaulting Member) of the Fair Market Value of the aggregate Interests of the Non-\nDefaulting Member so acquired (as previously determined pursuant to the FMV Determination Procedure) plus [REDACTED].\n(e) If the Non-Defaulting Member shall timely deliver an Event of Default Call Exercise Notice, the closing of the purchase and sale of\nthe Interest of the Defaulting Member pursuant to the Event of Default Call Right (an “Event of Default Call Right Closing”) shall\noccur at the offices of the Non-Defaulting\n(cid:3)æ (cid:3)(cid:240)\n(cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:239) (cid:3)æ (cid:3)(cid:243) (cid:3)(cid:244) (cid:3)ı (cid:3)r(cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:239) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E (cid:0)z (cid:0)K (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:238) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:243) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)ı (cid:3)(cid:243) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:239) (cid:3)X(cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:237)\nMember on the tenth Business Day after the latest to occur of (i) the delivery of such Event of Default Call Exercise Notice, and (ii)\nthe date on which all third party consents required to consummate the transaction, if any, have been obtained, or at such other place,\ndate and time mutually agreed upon by the Members. At such closing, each Member constituting the Defaulting Member shall execute\nand deliver the Required Transfer Documentation against receipt of the purchase price to be paid in accordance with Section 8.5(g), in\nan amount equal to (A) if such Member is the sole Member constituting the Defaulting Member, the Fair Market Value of the Interests\nof the Defaulting Member so acquired (as previously determined pursuant to the FMV Determination Procedure) less [REDACTED]\n(subject to Section 17.1(c)(i)) or (B) if such Member is one of multiple Members constituting the Defaulting Member, such Member’s\nproportionate share (based on the relative percentage shares of all of the Members constituting the Defaulting Member) of the Fair\nMarket Value of the aggregate Interests of the Defaulting Member so acquired (as previously determined pursuant to the FMV\nDetermination Procedure) [REDACTED] (subject to Section 17.1(c)(i)).\n(f) Each Member shall notify the other Member of the existence or occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to itself or any of its\nAffiliates who are Members.\n(g) The purchase price payable at any Event of Default Call Right Closing shall be payable in full on the date of such Event of Default\nCall Right Closing. The purchase price payable at any Event of Default Put Right Closing will be payable [REDACTED] on the date\nof such Event of Default Put Right Closing, with the balance being paid pursuant to a promissory note (which shall accrue interest at\nthe then-current Prime Rate) that is payable on the one (1) year anniversary of such Event of Default Put Right Closing.\n8.6 FMV Determination Procedure\nFollowing delivery of a Valuation Notice indicating the need to determine the Fair Market Value in respect of specified Interests, such\ndetermination shall be made as follows (the “FMV Determination Procedure”):\n(a) The Members will negotiate in good faith to determine the Fair Market Value of the applicable Interests (including by\nconsidering the average of each Member’s initial estimate of Fair Market Value), and will provide each other with reasonable\naccess to appropriate employees and advisors and books and records as may be reasonably requested to assist in the\ndetermination of Fair Market Value. If the Members are unable to agree on Fair Market Value within thirty (30) days of\nreceipt of the Valuation Notice, then the Members shall (i) designate a mutually acceptable investment bank or valuation firm\nof national standing and experience valuing assets in the same industry as the Company Projects to determine the Fair Market\nValue as provided herein (or, if such Members are unable to agree on such one firm, the firm will be designated by the\nAmerican Arbitration Association) (such firm, however selected, the “Appraiser”) and (ii) submit their respective initial\nestimates of Fair Market Value to the Appraiser.\n(b) Within thirty (30) days after appointment, the Appraiser shall determine its own view as to the Fair Market Value and shall\ndeliver such view to each Member. If the Appraiser’s view is in between the range of the higher value claimed by a Member\nand the lower value claimed by a Member, such view shall be deemed the Fair Market Value. If the Appraiser’s view is\noutside the range referred to in the preceding sentence, the value claimed by a Member that is closest to the Appraiser’s view\nshall be deemed the Fair Market Value.\n(c) A determination of Fair Market Value made pursuant to Section 8.6(b) shall be final and binding on the Board and all\nMembers and shall constitute Fair Market Value for the relevant purpose under this Agreement.\n(cid:3)æ (cid:3)æ\n(cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:239) (cid:3)æ (cid:3)(cid:243) (cid:3)(cid:244) (cid:3)ı (cid:3)r(cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:239) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E (cid:0)z (cid:0)K (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:238) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:243) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)ı (cid:3)(cid:243) (cid:3)(cid:236) (cid:3)(cid:239) (cid:3)X(cid:3)(cid:237) (cid:3)(cid:237)\n(d) The Company shall provide reasonable access for the Appraiser to members of management of the Company and to the books\nand records of the Company so as to allow the Appraiser to conduct a due diligence examination in scope and duration as are\ncustomary in valuations of this kind. Each of the Members agrees to cooperate with the Appraiser and to provide such\ninformation as may reasonably be requested.
