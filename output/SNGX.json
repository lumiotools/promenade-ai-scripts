(Nasdaq: SNGX) (Soligenix or the Company), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need, announced today the formation of a European Medical Advisory Board (MAB) to provide additional medical/clinical strategic guidance to the Company as it advances its confirmatory Phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of [HyBryte™](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305680-1&h=3156432376&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hybryte.com%2F&a=HyBryte%E2%84%A2) (synthetic hypericin) in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) patients with early-stage disease. This confirmatory, 18-week study is expected to enroll approximately 80 patients in the United States (U.S.) and Europe, and is targeted to begin patient enrollment by the end of 2024 with top-line results anticipated in the second half of 2026.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Soligenix, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1768046/Soligenix_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1768046/Soligenix_Logo.html)\n\n\"Stemming from the positive feedback from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on the key design components of our confirmatory Phase 3 placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of HyBryte™, we consider expert European involvement a necessary component for the development of this program. As such, it is an honor to have such a prestigious and dedicated group of clinicians and leaders in the field committed to working with us as we develop HyBryte™,\" stated Christopher J. Schaber, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Soligenix. \"We have assembled some of the leading CTCL experts, who collectively have the experience of treating thousands of patients with this rare condition, and complement the strong [CTCL MAB we've established in the U.S](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305680-1&h=3890769470&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soligenix.com%2Fabout%2Fscientific-advisory-boards%2Fcutaneous-t-cell-lymphoma%2F&a=CTCL+MAB+we%27ve+established+in+the+U.S). The support of these European experts is a further testament to the opportunity HyBryte™ could provide for patients suffering from this disease worldwide.\"\n\nComprised of internationally renowned physicians with extensive experience in treating and running clinical research trials in CTCL, this esteemed MAB will play an important advisory role in the conduct and interpretation of the upcoming Phase 3 clinical study and the associated regulatory interactions with health authorities. The MAB will provide feedback, input, and guidance on clinical strategies and their implementation, as well as on other critical items, such as health economics and reimbursement, to assist Soligenix in meeting the needs of patients suffering from CTCL.\n\n**European MAB Members**\n\n**_Martine Bagot , MD, PhD – France _**\n\nMartine Bagot is Professor and Head of the Department of Dermatology at the Hôpital Saint Louis in Paris, France and co-directs the INSERM Unit 976 Human Immunology, Pathophysiology and Immunotherapy.

The active ingredient in HyBryte™ is synthetic hypericin, a potent photosensitizer that is topically applied to skin lesions that is taken up by the malignant T-cells, and then activated by safe, visible light approximately 24 hours later. The use of visible light in the red-yellow spectrum has the advantage of penetrating more deeply into the skin (much more so than ultraviolet light) and therefore potentially treating deeper skin disease and thicker plaques and lesions. This treatment approach avoids the risk of secondary malignancies (including melanoma) inherent with the frequently employed DNA-damaging drugs and other phototherapy that are dependent on ultraviolet exposure. Combined with photoactivation, hypericin has demonstrated significant anti-proliferative effects on activated normal human lymphoid cells and inhibited growth of malignant T-cells isolated from CTCL patients. In a published Phase 2 clinical study in CTCL, patients experienced a statistically significant (p=0.04) improvement with topical hypericin treatment whereas the placebo was ineffective. HyBryte™ has received orphan drug and fast track designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as orphan designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA).\n\nThe [published Phase 3 FLASH trial](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305680-1&h=2452717591&u=https%3A%2F%2Fjamanetwork.com%2Fjournals%2Fjamadermatology%2Farticle-abstract%2F2794396%3FguestAccessKey%3D3f6df822-8049-47b4-917c-03b80f12137f%26utm_source%3DFor_The_Media%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dftm_links%26utm_content%3Dtfl%26utm_term%3D072022&a=published+Phase+3+FLASH+trial) enrolled a total of 169 patients (166 evaluable) with Stage IA, IB or IIA CTCL. The trial consisted of three treatment cycles. Treatments were administered twice weekly for the first 6 weeks and treatment response was determined at the end of the 8th week of each cycle. In the first double-blind treatment cycle (Cycle 1), 116 patients received HyBryte™ treatment (0.25% synthetic hypericin) and 50 received placebo treatment of their index lesions. A total of 16% of the patients receiving HyBryte™ achieved at least a 50% reduction in their lesions (graded using a standard measurement of dermatologic lesions, the CAILS score) compared to only 4% of patients in the placebo group at 8 weeks (p=0.04) during the first treatment cycle (primary endpoint). HyBryte™ treatment in this cycle was safe and well tolerated.\n\nIn the second open-label treatment cycle (Cycle 2), all patients received HyBryte™ treatment of their index lesions. Evaluation of 155 patients in this cycle (110 receiving 12 weeks of HyBryte™ treatment and 45 receiving 6 weeks of placebo treatment followed by 6 weeks of HyBryte™ treatment), demonstrated that the response rate among the 12-week treatment group was 40% (p<0.0001 vs the placebo treatment rate in Cycle 1). Comparison of the 12-week and 6-week treatment responses also revealed a statistically significant improvement (p<0.0001) between the two timepoints, indicating that continued treatment results in better outcomes. HyBryte™ continued to be safe and well tolerated. Additional analyses also indicated that HyBryte™ is equally effective in treating both plaque (response 42%, p<0.0001 relative to placebo treatment in Cycle 1) and patch (response 37%, p=0.0009 relative to placebo treatment in Cycle 1) lesions of CTCL, a particularly relevant finding given the historical difficulty in treating plaque lesions in particular.\n\nThe third (optional) treatment cycle (Cycle 3) was focused on safety and all patients could elect to receive HyBryte™ treatment of all their lesions. Of note, 66% of patients elected to continue with this optional compassionate use / safety cycle of the study. Of the subset of patients that received HyBryte™ throughout all 3 cycles of treatment, 49% of them demonstrated a positive treatment response (p<0.0001 vs patients receiving placebo in Cycle 1). Moreover, in a subset of patients evaluated in this cycle, it was demonstrated that HyBryte™ is not systemically available, consistent with the general safety of this topical product observed to date. At the end of Cycle 3, HyBryte™ continued to be well tolerated despite extended and increased use of the product to treat multiple lesions.\n\nOverall safety of HyBryte™ is a critical attribute of this treatment and was monitored throughout the three treatment cycles (Cycles 1, 2 and 3) and the 6-month follow-up period. HyBryte's™ mechanism of action is not associated with DNA damage, making it a safer alternative than currently available therapies, all of which are associated with significant, and sometimes fatal, side effects. Predominantly these include the risk of melanoma and other malignancies, as well as the risk of significant skin damage and premature skin aging. Currently available treatments are only approved in the context of previous treatment failure with other treatment modalities and there is no approved front-line therapy available. Within this landscape, treatment of CTCL is strongly motivated by the safety risk of each product. HyBryte™ potentially represents the safest available efficacious treatment for CTCL. With very limited systemic absorption, a compound that is not mutagenic and a light source that is not carcinogenic, there is no evidence to date of any potential significant safety issues.\n\nFollowing the first Phase 3 study of HyBryte™ for the treatment of CTCL, the FDA and the EMA indicated that they would require a second successful Phase 3 trial to support marketing approval. With agreement from the EMA on the key design components, the second, confirmatory study, called FLASH2, is expected to be initiated before the end of 2024. This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study that will enroll approximately 80 subjects with early-stage CTCL. The [FLASH2 study](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305680-1&h=204638141&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.soligenix.com%2F2024-04-03-Soligenix-Announces-Agreement-on-the-Design-of-a-Second-Confirmatory-Placebo-Controlled-Trial-for-HyBryte-TM-With-the-European-Medicines-Agency&a=FLASH2+study) replicates the double-blind, placebo-controlled design used in the first successful Phase 3 FLASH study that consisted of three 6-week treatment cycles (18 weeks total), with the primary efficacy assessment occurring at the end of the initial 6-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment cycle (Cycle 1). However, this second study extends the double-blind, placebo-controlled assessment to 18 weeks of _continuous_ treatment (no \"between-Cycle\" treatment breaks) and a more aggressive titration of the light doses with the primary endpoint assessment occurring at the end of the 18-week timepoint. In the first Phase 3 study, a treatment response of 49% (p<0.0001 vs patients receiving placebo in Cycle 1) was observed in patients completing 18 weeks (3 cycles) of therapy. In this second study, all important clinical study design components remain the same as in the first FLASH study, including the primary endpoint and key inclusion-exclusion criteria. The extended treatment for a continuous 18 weeks in a single cycle is expected to statistically demonstrate HyBryte's™ increased effect over a more prolonged, \"real world\" treatment course. Given the extensive engagement with the CTCL community, the esteemed Medical Advisory Board and the previous trial experience with this disease, accelerated enrollment in support of this study is anticipated, including the potential to enroll previously identified and treated HyBryte™ patients from the FLASH study. Discussions with the FDA on an appropriate study design remain ongoing. While collaborative, the agency has expressed a preference for a longer duration comparative study over a placebo-controlled trial. Given the shorter time to potential commercial revenue and the similar trial design to the first FLASH study afforded by the EMA accepted protocol, this study is being initiated. At the same time, discussions with the FDA will continue on potential modifications to the development path to adequately address their feedback.\n\nIn addition, the FDA awarded an Orphan Products Development grant to support the evaluation of HyBryte™ for expanded treatment in patients with early-stage CTCL, including in the home use setting. The grant, totaling $2.6 million over 4 years, was awarded to the University of Pennsylvania that was a leading enroller in the Phase 3 FLASH study. Additional supportive studies have demonstrated the utility of [longer treatment times](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305680-1&h=2211755391&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.soligenix.com%2F2024-07-09-Expanded-HyBryte-TM-Treatment-Demonstrating-Positive-Outcomes-in-Early-Stage-Cutaneous-T-Cell-Lymphoma&a=longer+treatment+times) (Study RW-HPN-MF-01), the [lack of significant systemic exposure](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305680-1&h=3468864987&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.soligenix.com%2F2024-05-16-Positive-Clinical-Results-from-HyBryte-TM-Compatibility-Study-in-the-Treatment-of-Cutaneous-T-Cell-Lymphoma-Published-in-JEADV-Clinical-Practice&a=lack+of+significant+systemic+exposure) to hypericin after topical application (Study HPN-CTCL-02) and its relative efficacy and tolerability [compared to Valchlor®](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305680-1&h=1867545806&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.soligenix.com%2F2024-06-25-Soligenix-Announces-Positive-Clinical-Results-from-a-Comparative-Study-Evaluating-HyBryte-TM-Against-Valchlor-R-in-the-Treatment-of-Cutaneous-T-Cell-Lymphoma&a=compared+to+Valchlor%C2%AE) (Study HPN-CTCL-04).\n\n**About Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL)**\n\nCTCL is a class of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), a type of cancer of the white blood cells that are an integral part of the immune system. Unlike most NHLs which generally involve B-cell lymphocytes (involved in producing antibodies), CTCL is caused by an expansion of malignant T-cell lymphocytes (involved in cell-mediated immunity) normally programmed to migrate to the skin. These malignant cells migrate to the skin where they form various lesions, typically beginning as patches and may progress to raised plaques and tumors. Mortality is related to the stage of CTCL, with median survival generally ranging from about 12 years in the early stages to only 2.5 years when the disease has advanced. There is currently no cure for CTCL. Typically, CTCL lesions are treated and regress but usually return either in the same part of the body or in new areas.\n\nCTCL constitutes a rare group of NHLs, occurring in about 4% of the more than 1.7 million individuals living with the disease in the U.S. and Europe (European Union and United Kingdom). It is estimated, based upon review of historic published studies and reports and an interpolation of data on the incidence of CTCL that it affects approximately 31,000 individuals in the U.S. (based on SEER data, with approximately 3,200 new cases seen annually) and approximately 38,000 individuals in Europe (based on ECIS prevalence estimates, with approximately 3,800 new cases annually).\n\n**About Soligenix, Inc.**\n\nSoligenix is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need.

Schaber, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Soligenix. \"Our previous studies with dusquetide in oral mucositis have validated the biologic activity in aphthous ulcers induced by chemotherapy and radiation. Given the role of the innate immune system in ulcers associated with [Behçet's Disease](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4302052-1&h=402320916&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soligenix.com%2Four-focus%2Fbehcets-disease%2F&a=Beh%C3%A7et%27s+Disease), and the unmet medical need particularly for more severe ulcers such as genital and leg ulcers, we believe that dusquetide may offer significant relief to patients. We are excited to expand dusquetide's development into different innate immune-related inflammatory conditions, such as Behçet's Disease, as a component of our long-term strategy to enhance the value of this unique compound. Behçet's Disease is an area of unmet medical need, with up to 18,000 people in the U.S., 50,000 in Europe, 350,000 people in Turkey and as many as 1 million people worldwide affected by this incurable disease. Given the promising biologic activity observed with aphthous ulcers in oral mucositis, we are hopeful dusquetide will have a role to play in helping underserved patients suffering from this difficult to treat and chronic auto-immune disease. We look forward to completing enrollment and announcing study results in the first half of 2025.\"\n\nThe pilot clinical trial of SGX945 will be an open-label study that will enroll approximately 25 patients age 18 years or older with mild to moderate Behçet's Disease and active oral and/or genital ulcers. Patients will receive SGX945 as a twice weekly 4-minute intravenous (IV) infusion for 4 weeks followed by 4 weeks of follow-up. Efficacy endpoints will include the extent of lesion clearance, timeline to lesion clearance, and patient reported quality of life assessments. \n\n**About Dusquetide**\n\nDusquetide, the active ingredient in SGX945 (Behçet's Disease) and [SGX942 (oral mucositis)](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4302052-1&h=2194726121&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soligenix.com%2Fpipeline-programs%2Fsgx942-treatment-for-oral-mucositis%2F&a=SGX942+\\(oral+mucositis\\)), is an innate defense regulator (IDR), a new class of short, synthetic peptides. It has a novel mechanism of action whereby it modulates the body's reaction to both injury and infection towards an anti-inflammatory, anti-infective, and tissue healing response. IDRs have no direct antibiotic activity but, by modulating the host's innate immune system responses, increase survival after infections caused by a broad range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. Dusquetide also accelerates resolution of tissue damage following exposure to a variety of agents including bacterial pathogens, trauma, and chemo- and/or radiation therapy. Preclinical efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in numerous animal disease models including mucositis, colitis, macrophage activation syndrome as well as bacterial infections. In addition, potential anti-tumor activity has been demonstrated in multiple _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ xenograft studies.\n\nDusquetide has demonstrated safety and tolerability in a [Phase 1 clinical study](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4302052-1&h=2914455082&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc%2Farticles%2FPMC4867239%2F&a=Phase+1+clinical+study) in 84 healthy human volunteers. In Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies with dusquetide in over 350 subjects with oral mucositis due to chemoradiation therapy for head and neck cancer, positive efficacy results were demonstrated, including potential long-term [ancillary benefits](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4302052-1&h=4184659220&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc%2Farticles%2FPMC5470438%2F&a=ancillary+benefits).\n\nSoligenix has a strong intellectual property position in the IDR technology platform, including composition of matter for dusquetide and related analogs. Dusquetide was developed pursuant to discoveries made by Professors B. Brett Finlay, PhD and Robert Hancock, PhD of the University of British Columbia, Canada.\n\n**About Behçet's Disease**\n\nBehçet's Disease is commonly known as an inflammatory disorder of the blood vessels (vasculitis). Often first diagnosed in young adults, its effects and severity will wax and wane over time. Major signs and symptoms usually include mouth sores (approximately 95% of patients), skin rashes and lesions (approximately 50% of patients), genital sores (approximately 50% of patients), leg ulcers (approximately 40% of patients) and eye inflammation (approximately 15% of patients). It is a painful disease, directly impacting the patient's quality of life and ability to productively engage in life activities, including work.\n\nBehçet's Disease is thought to be an auto-immune disease with both genetic and environmental factors. It is most common along the \"Silk Road\" in the Middle East and East Asia, including Turkey, Iran, Japan and China. There are approximately 18,000 known cases of Behçet's Disease in the U.S. and over 50,000 in Europe. There are as many as 1,000,000 people worldwide living with Behçet's Disease. \n\nThere is no cure for Behçet's Disease, rather treatments are prescribed to manage symptoms. Treatments may include both maintenance therapies and those specifically addressing flares (e.g., mouth ulcers, genital ulcers and leg ulcers). Corticosteroids are generally applied topically to sores and as eyedrops and may also be given systemically to reduce inflammation. Although used frequently, they have limited efficacy over the long-term and have significant side effects that become more concerning with more chronic use. Genital ulcers are often associated with significant genital scarring while leg ulcers can result in a post-thrombotic syndrome. Other treatments for Behçet's Disease flares involve suppressing the immune system with drugs (e.g., cyclosporine or cyclophosphamide). These drugs come with a higher risk of infection, liver and kidney problems, low blood counts and high blood pressure. Finally, anti-inflammatory drugs are also used, including anti-TNF medications. The only approved drug in Behçet's Disease is apremilast, which is used as a maintenance therapy to prevent formation of oral ulcers. Unfortunately, apremilast must be used continuously to be effective and is associated with both high cost and side effects including diarrhea, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection and headache.\n\n**About Soligenix**\n\nSoligenix is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need.

Revenues primarily relate to government contracts, grants and subawards awarded in support of SGX943 for treatment of emerging and/or antibiotic-resistant infectious diseases; development of CiVax™, our vaccine candidate for the prevention of COVID-19, and evaluation of HyBryte™ for expanded treatment in patients with early-stage CTCL.\n\nSoligenix's net loss was $1.7 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, or ($0.78) per share and ($2.56) per share, respectively. This increase in net loss was primarily due to decreases in gross profit and tax credits as well as an increase in operating expenses, offset by increases in interest income and the change in the fair value of debt during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $1.0 million as compared to $0.8 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was preliminary due to costs associated with the initiation of our Phase 2 study in Behçet's Disease and the second confirmatory Phase 3 CTCL trial offset by an adjustment of estimated accruals for completed clinical trials.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $0.9 million and $1.0 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to decreases in legal and professional fees.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company's cash position was approximately $9.8 million.\n\n**About Soligenix, Inc.**\n\nSoligenix is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need.
