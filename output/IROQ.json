(NASDAQ Capital: IROQ) (the “Company”), and its wholly owned subsidiary, Iroquois Federal Savings and Loan Association (the “Association”), today announced that the Boards of Directors (the “Boards”) of the Company and the Association unanimously elected Walter H. Hasselbring, III, the current President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Association, as Chair of the Boards. Mr. Hasselbring succeeds, Gary Martin, who, having reached the age limit established by the Board of Directors in the Company’s bylaws, retired from the Boards on November 25, 2024, immediately prior to the Company’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders. In conjunction with these changes, Mr. Hasselbring resigned from his position as President of the Company and the Association and the Boards have appointed Thomas J. Chamberlain, current Chief Lending Officer of the Association and Senior Executive Vice President of the Company and the Association, as President of the Company and the Association. Mr. Hasselbring will continue to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Association and continue to oversee their strategic initiatives while Mr. Chamberlain will oversee the day-to-day operations. \n\nIn accordance with the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines and to provide effective oversight and independence of the Boards, the Boards appointed Joseph A. Cowan as Lead Independent Director. Mr. Cowan has served as an independent director of the Company and the Association since 2000. \n\nThe Boards have determined that combining the Chair and Chief Executive Officer positions, along with appointing a Lead Independent Director and a new President, is the appropriate structure for the Company and the Association at this time and helps provide strong and consistent leadership for management and the Boards. \n\n“On behalf of the Boards, I would like to thank Gary for his many contributions and dedication to the Company and Association as Chair. The Company and the Association have benefited tremendously from his expertise, leadership and integrity,” said Mr. Hasselbring. “I look forward to continuing to work with our highly skilled and dedicated Boards and management to execute on our strategic priorities.” \n\nMr. Hasselbring continued, “I want to congratulate Joe and Tom on their respective new roles as Lead Independent Director and President. Their extensive experience on the Boards and with various senior management positions at the Association, respectively, and their knowledge of the communities we serve make them ideal to serve in these roles.” \n\nIF Bancorp, Inc. is the savings and loan holding company for Iroquois Federal Savings and Loan Association. The Association, originally chartered in 1883 and headquartered in Watseka, Illinois, conducts its operations from seven full-service banking offices located in Watseka, Danville, Clifton, Hoopeston, Savoy, Champaign and Bourbonnais, Illinois and a loan production office in Osage Beach, Missouri. The principal activity of the Association’s wholly owned subsidiary, L.C.I. Service Corporation, is the sale of property and casualty insurance. \n\nThis press release may contain statements relating to the future results of the Company (including certain projections and business trends) that are considered \"forward-looking statements\" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “PSLRA”).

Announces Results for First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2025 (Unaudited)\n\nCompany Release - 11/4/2024 4:15 PM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nWATSEKA, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  IF Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: IROQ) (the “Company”) the holding company for Iroquois Federal Savings and Loan Association (the “Association”), announced unaudited net income of $633,000, or $0.20 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $466,000, or $0.15 per basic share and $0.14 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. \n\nWalter H. “Chip” Hasselbring, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “While the Federal Reserve has recently begun the process of easing the interest rate environment, it will be a while until the full effects of lower interest rates are felt in our financial results. That being said, we were pleased to see earnings improvement in our quarterly results. Our capital ratios and asset quality remain strong. We look forward to moving the Association forward in this competitive banking environment.” \n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income was $4.8 million compared to $4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income increased to $10.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense increased to $6.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $382,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision for credit losses of $222,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Noninterest income increased to $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Noninterest expense increased to $5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense totaled $218,000 compared to $175,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. \n\nTotal assets at September 30, 2024 were $893.4 million compared to $887.7 million at June 30, 2024. Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $7.8 million at September 30, 2024, from $9.6 million at June 30, 2024. Investment securities increased to $192.7 million at September 30, 2024, from $190.5 million at June 30, 2024. Net loans receivable increased to $647.1 million at September 30, 2024, from $639.3 million at June 30, 2024. Deposits decreased to $677.2 million at September 30, 2024, from $727.2 million at June 30, 2024. The large decrease in deposits was due to approximately $62.7 million in deposits from a public entity that collects real estate taxes that were withdrawn during the three months ended September 30, 2024, when tax monies were distributed. Total borrowings, including repurchase agreements, increased to $126.6 million at September 30, 2024 from $76.0 million at June 30, 2024. Stockholders’ equity increased to $78.8 million at September 30, 2024 from $73.9 million at June 30, 2024. Equity increased primarily due to an increase of $4.8 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, net income of $633,000, and ESOP and stock equity plan activity of $134,000, partially offset by the accrual of approximately $670,000 in dividends to our stockholders. The increase in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was primarily due to a decrease in unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale securities, net of tax. \n\nIF Bancorp, Inc. is the savings and loan holding company for Iroquois Federal Savings and Loan Association. The Association, originally chartered in 1883 and headquartered in Watseka, Illinois, conducts its operations from seven full-service banking offices located in Watseka, Danville, Clifton, Hoopeston, Savoy, Champaign and Bourbonnais, Illinois and a loan production office in Osage Beach, Missouri.

Our biggest challenge remains managing the cost of funding our assets, where we are highly sensitive to current pricing. The Board and management continue to evaluate all opportunities to enhance shareholder value and improve earnings,\" said Walter H. “Chip” Hasselbring III, President and CEO. \n\nNet income decreased $2.9 million, or 61.6%, to $1.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2024, from $4.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2023.
