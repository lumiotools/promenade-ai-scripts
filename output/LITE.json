          "content": "Q1 FY25 Conference Call\nNovember 7, 2024\nForward Looking Statements and Financial Presentation\nThis presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These include\nstatements regarding: our belief and expectations with respect to our strategies, our technology, any anticipation or guidance as to demand for our products and technology from our customers,\nincluding drivers of that demand, orders, and timing of fulfilling orders, statements regarding future revenue and revenue growth and trends in our markets, and our guidance with respect to future\nnet revenue, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, and non-GAAP operating margins, and related assumptions. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause\nactual results to differ materially from those projected. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contemplated are: (a) uncertainty and volatility in the global markets,\nincluding uncertainty and volatility in the macroeconomic environment, volatility and uncertainty in banking and financial services sectors, inflationary pressures, changes in the political or economic\nenvironment, such as geopolitical conflicts, war, trade and export restrictions and the imposition of tariffs or other duties, and the effect of such market disruptions on demand for our products,\ntechnology spending by our customers and our ability to obtain components for our products; (b) quarter-over-quarter product mix fluctuations, which can materially impact profitability measures\ndue to the broad gross margin ranges across our portfolio; (c) decline of average selling prices across our businesses or increase in costs, either of which will also decrease our margins; (d) effects\nof seasonality; (e) the ability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers to meet production, quality, and delivery requirements for our forecasted demand; (f) changes in customer demand,\nincluding due to changes in inventory practices and end-customer demand; (g) our ability to attract and retain new customers, particularly in the cloud photonics and imaging and sensing markets;\n(h) the risk that our markets will not grow or develop as expected or that our strategies and ability to compete in those markets are not successful, (i) the risk that Lumentum’s financing or operating\nstrategies will not be successful; and (j) failure to successfully integrate Cloud Light into our business or that we will not achieve the expected benefits. For more information on these and other\nrisks, please refer to the \"Risk Factors\" section included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(the “SEC) and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, including the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 to be filed with the SEC. In addition, the\nresults contained in this presentation are valid only as of today’s date except where otherwise noted. The forward-looking statements contained in this presentation are made as of the date hereof\nand the Company assumes no obligation to update such statements, except as required by applicable law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all financial results and projections are on a non-GAAP basis.

During the first fiscal\nquarter of 2025, the Company refined its methodology to report non-GAAP measures. Prior period non-GAAP financial measures presented herein have been recast to conform to the current\npresentation. The change does not impact the Company’s financial position, cash flows, or GAAP consolidated results of operations.\nWe have not provided reconciliations from GAAP to non-GAAP measures for our outlook. A large portion of non-GAAP adjustments, such as restructuring charges, stock-based compensation,\nacquisition related costs, integration related costs, non-GAAP income tax reconciling adjustments, foreign exchange gains and losses, net, and other costs and contingencies unrelated to current\nand future cash flows, are by their nature highly volatile and we have low visibility as to the range that may be incurred in the future.\n© 2024 Lumentum Operations LLC 2\nQ1 FY25 Key Points\n▪ Total Company\n– Q1 revenue and non-GAAP EPS exceeded guidance ranges\n– Growing cloud customer base\n– Expansion of our cloud and AI data center manufacturing capacity outside of China tracking to plan\n– Executing on differentiated roadmap; collaborating with cloud and AI customers to shape the future of optical technology\n▪ Cloud & Networking\n– Secured additional hyperscale transceiver customer orders beyond previously announced awards\n– Set new record in EML orders reflecting strong demand from multiple customers\n– Received substantial 200G EML orders from transceiver customers and AI infrastructure customer\n– Improving demand trends in broader networking market\n▪ Industrial Tech\n– Challenged due to weak industrial end markets\n– Traction in new semiconductor and advanced chip packaging applications to support high-performance computing\n– Delivered FemtoBlade lasers for thin film and advanced display applications\n© 2024 Lumentum Operations LLC 3\nQ1 FY25 Results (GAAP)\nQ1 FY25 Q4 FY24 Q1 FY24\n$ in millions\nexcept for EPS, % of revenue\nRevenue $336.9 $308.3 $317.6\nGross Margin 77.9 23.1% 51.3 16.6% 76.7 24.1%\nOperating Expenses 160.3 47.6% 184.7 59.9% 157.5 49.6%\nOperating Loss (82.4) (24.5%) (133.4) (43.3)% (80.8) (25.4)%\nDiluted EPS $(1.21) $(3.72) $(1.02)\nDiluted Shares-M 68.3 67.8 66.7\n© 2024 Lumentum Operations LLC 4\nQ1 FY25 Results (Non-GAAP)\n$ in millions Q1 FY25 Q4 FY24(1) Q1 FY24(1)\nexcept for EPS, % of revenue\nRevenue $336.9 $308.3 $317.6\nGross Margin 110.4 32.8% 85.6 27.8% 104.3 32.8%\nOperating Expenses 100.4 29.8% 101.4 32.9% 102.3 32.2%\nOperating Income (Loss) 10.0 3.0% (15.8) (5.1%) 2.0 0.6%\nDiluted EPS $0.18 ($0.13) $0.24\nDiluted Shares-M 69.1 67.8 67.0\n(1) Historical non-GAAP measures recast to conform to current period presentation\n© 2024 Lumentum Operations LLC 5\nQ1 FY25 Segment Results\nQ1 FY25 Q4 FY24 Q1 FY24\n$ in millions\nRevenue $336.9 $308.3 $317.6\nCloud & Networking 282.3 254.7 229.7\nIndustrial Tech 54.6 53.6 87.9\nSegment Profit (Loss)\nCloud & Networking 12.9 % 10.1 % 10.4 %\nIndustrial Tech 4.0 % (0.4) % 17.4 %\n© 2024 Lumentum Operations LLC 6\nBalance Sheet\nSelected Items Q1 FY25 Q4 FY24\n$ in millions\nCash and Short-term Investments $916.1 $887.0\nWorking Capital (1) 415.0 433.8\nProperty, Plant & Equipment, net 638.4 572.5\nTotal Assets 3,969.6 3,931.9\nTotal Liabilities 3,073.7 2,974.6\nShareholder’s Equity 895.9 957.3\n(1) Working capital excluding cash and short-term investments\n© 2024 Lumentum Operations LLC 7\nQ2 FY25 Guidance (Non-GAAP)\nGuidance is based on our expectations as of today and will not be updated or confirmed as of any other date\nQ1 FY25 Q2 FY25\nActual Guidance\n$ in millions\nexcept for EPS, % of revenue\nRevenue $336.9 $380 - $400\nOperating Margin 3.0% 5.5% - 7.5%\nDiluted EPS $0.18 $0.30 - $0.40\nDiluted Shares – M 69.1 69.6\n▪ Mid-point of revenue guidance assumes:\n– Cloud & Networking segment up Q/Q\n– Industrial Tech segment approximately flat Q/Q\n▪ FY25 non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16.5%\n▪ Expected Q2 FY25 net interest and other income to be approximately $4.0 million\n© 2024 Lumentum Operations LLC 8\nThank You"
