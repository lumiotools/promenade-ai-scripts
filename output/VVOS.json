Revenue increased 6% Year-Over-Year; Operating Expenses Decreased 20% as Cost Cutting Initiatives Take Hold Management to Host Conference Call Today at 5:00 pm ET LITTLETON, Colo., June 08, 2023 \\(GLOBE NEWSWIRE\\) -- Vivos Therapeutics, Inc. \\(“Vivos” or the “Company''\\) \\(NASDAQ: VVOS\\), a medical technology company focused on developing and commercializing innovative diagnostic and treatment methods for patients suffering from a variety of health conditions, many of which are associated with breathing related sleep issues arising from certain dentofacial abnormalities, today reported financial results and operating highlights for the first quarter ended March 31, 2023. First Quarter 2023 Financial Highlights Revenue was $3.9 million for the first quarter of 2023, compared to $3.6 million for the first quarter of 2022, mainly due to higher Vivos Integrated Provider \\(“VIP”\\) enrollments as well as increased revenue from seminars conducted at the Vivos Institute \\(readers should note that Vivos’ reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 reflect the application of Vivos’ previously announced updated ASC 606 revenue recognition policies, including deferral of a portion of revenue into future periods\\); During the first quarter of 2023, Vivos enrolled 38 VIPs and recognized VIP revenue of approximately $1.3 million, an increase of 42% in enrollment revenue, compared to 32 VIPs and approximately $0.9 million for the first quarter of 2022; Gross profit was $2.3 million for the first quarter of 2023, compared to gross profit of $2.6 million for the first quarter of 2022, attributable to higher costs associated with increased VIP training as well as the sale and leasing of SleepImage® home sleep test rings; Gross margin was 61% for the first quarter of 2023, compared to 70% for the first quarter of 2022, reflecting higher costs associated with VIP training and new incentives deployed to increase VIP enrollments; Operating expenses decreased by a significant amount \\($1.8 million, or 20%\\) versus the first quarter of 2022, reflecting Vivos’ previously announced cost-cutting initiatives. These initiatives, when combined with a $3.2 million non-cash derivative gain associated with Vivos’ outstanding warrants, led to a significant year-over-year reduction of net loss for the quarter; In January 2023, Vivos completed a private placement for net proceeds of approximately $7.4 million to augment its liquidity position; and Cash and cash equivalents were $7.0 million at March 31, 2023. First Quarter 2023 and Recent Operating Highlights As of March 31 2023, patients treated with The Vivos Method totaled over 35,000, compared to approximately 28,000 as of the first quarter of 2022. Vivos has also trained over 1,750 dentists in the use of The Vivos Method and Vivos’ related value-added services, compared to more than 1,600 as of the first quarter 2022; In February 2023, Vivos acquired certain U.S. and international patents, product rights, and other miscellaneous intellectual property from Advanced Facialdontics, LLC \\(“AFD”\\), a company holding propriety technology with FDA 510\\(k\\) clearances for Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction \\(“TMD”\\) and Bruxism \\(unconscious teeth grinding and clenching\\). With this asset purchase transaction, Vivos acquired recently issued U.S. patents, provisional patent applications as well as international patents, Patent Cooperation Treaty patents and patent applications. One of Vivos’ key strategic goals for the remainder of 2023 is to initiate and grow sales of the AFD products, notably the Preventive Oral Device® \\(known as The POD®\\); and In May 2023, Vivos announced the results of a clinical observational study on the application of the POD® in the treatment and prevention of migraine headaches. The study demonstrated statistically significant results, with ninety-two percent \\(92%\\) of study patients reporting their migraine symptoms were completely resolved following completion of treatment. Migraine headaches affect over 39 million people in the United States alone according to the American Migraine Foundation. “Vivos is evolving into a more scalable and sustainable growth company with a clear path to cash flow positive operations. By broadening and diversifying our core product offerings and giving potential new providers easier and less costly options to enroll and become Vivos-trained, we believe we are positioning ourselves to become the comprehensive go-to source for dental treatments for OSA and other debilitating conditions like TMD and Bruxism. No other company in our market has the evidence-based technologies, or the regulatory clearances, or the clinical and technical expertise, or the full complementary product line, or the strong brand equity that Vivos has with healthcare providers and patients,” stated Kirk Huntsman, Vivos’ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We continue to believe our latest rounds of cost cutting, the impact of which can be seen in our first quarter results, coupled with an intense focus on creating accretive new revenue streams, will allow us to achieve our stated goal of achieving positive cash flow in the first quarter of 2024.” “During the first quarter, we continued to make substantial progress towards realizing our potential. Our focused sales and marketing efforts are gaining traction and our organizational changes have made Vivos a more efficient, streamlined organization. With our expanded products and services offering, we are well positioned to continue attracting more dentists and medical professionals to utilize the Vivos Method, as well as larger organizations, including Durable Medical Equipment \\(known as DME\\) companies and Dental Service Organizations \\(known as DSOs\\), to market and distribute our products. As we seek to drive revenue growth, Vivos now has new or active pilot programs with eight different DSO organizations, representing over 1,000 dental practices, as well as a new pilot program we will be launching shortly with a nationally regarded DME to distribute our devices. We are pleased with what we have achieved so far in 2023, and look forward to continuing this momentum during the rest of the year and into 2024,” Mr. Huntsman concluded. Vivos encourages investors and other interested parties to join its conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time \\(details below\\), where management will discuss further details on topics including: \\(i\\) the acquisition of product rights and patents from AFD and Vivos’ expanded product line and revenue potential, \\(ii\\) the potential significant impact of Vivos’ recent discussions with DME companies on Vivos’ near-term growth, \\(iii\\) an update on Vivos’ DSO and DME sales and marketing efforts; \\(iv\\) additional programs for dentists to enroll with Vivos, and \\(v\\) Vivos’ current cash position and actions taken to reduce cash burn.
