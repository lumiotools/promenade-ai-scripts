All per-share results are presented on a fully diluted basis.\n\n**_Third-Quarter 2024 Results Summary_**\n\n  * **Revenues**\n    * $2.2 billion, a 2% increase over the previous quarter\n    * Includes a minimal negative foreign currency impact when compared to prior guidance rates\n  * **Operating Income**\n    * $425 million, lower than the previous quarter due to the Q2 gain on sale of the Silicon Valley 12 xScale (SV12x) asset\n  * **Net Income attributable to Common Stockholders and Net Income per Share attributable to Common Stockholders**\n    * $297 million, lower than the previous quarter due to the Q2 gain on sale of the SV12x asset\n    * $3.10 per share, lower than the previous quarter\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA**\n    * $1,048 million, a 1% increase over the previous quarter, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 48%\n    * Includes a minimal negative foreign currency impact when compared to prior guidance rates and $2 million of integration costs\n  * **AFFO and AFFO per Share**\n    * $866 million, lower than the previous quarter, due to seasonally higher recurring capital expenditures; partially offset by higher EBITDA flow-through\n    * $9.05 per share, lower than the previous quarter\n\n\n\n**_2024 Annual Guidance Summary_**\n\n  * **Revenues**\n    * $8.748 - $8.788 billion, an increase of approximately 7% over the previous year, or a normalized and constant currency increase of 7 - 8%, excluding the year-over-year impact of the power pass-through\n    * An increase of $36 million compared to prior guidance\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA**\n    * $4.086 - $4.126 billion, a 47% adjusted EBITDA margin\n    * An increase of $10 million compared to prior guidance\n    * Includes $15 million of integration costs\n  * **AFFO and AFFO per Share**\n    * $3.338 - $3.378 billion, an increase of 11 - 12% over the previous year, or a normalized and constant currency increase of 11 - 13%\n    * An increase of $18 million compared to prior guidance\n    * $34.81 - $35.22 per share, an increase of 8 - 10% over the previous year, or a normalized and constant currency increase of 9 - 10%\n\n\n\nEquinix converted the presentation of results from thousands to millions in the first quarter of 2024. Certain rounding adjustments have been made to prior period disclosed amounts.\n\nEquinix is not reasonably able to provide forward-looking guidance for certain financial data, such as depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation, net income (loss) from operations, cash generated from operating activities and cash used in investing activities, and as a result, is not able to provide a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for forward-looking data without unreasonable effort. The impact of such adjustments could be significant.\n\n**_Equinix Quote_**\n\n**Adaire Fox-Martin, CEO and President, Equinix:**\n\n_\"Our 87 th consecutive quarter of revenue growth was also a record-breaking one for gross bookings, with strong results across our three regions. This performance is a testament to the trust our customers place in Equinix and the value they realize partnering strategically with us. We see continued robust demand for AI-enabling digital infrastructure from a highly diverse set of customers of varying sizes, industries, and regions. This, coupled with significant expansion of our xScale capability, further strengthens our value proposition with customers and our leading position in the market.\"_\n\n**_Business Highlights_**\n\n  * Equinix remains dedicated to making extensive investments across its global operations to support the digital infrastructure needs of customers. The company currently has 57 major projects underway in 35 markets across 22 countries, including 13 xScale projects, representing more than 22,000 cabinets of retail capacity and more than 100 megawatts of xScale capacity to be delivered through the end of 2025.\n    * Earlier this month, Equinix announced plans to nearly triple the capital invested in its xScale data center portfolio with the agreement to form a greater than $15 billion joint venture, subject to closing conditions, with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) and GIC, with whom Equinix has previously partnered on xScale projects in Asia, the Americas and Europe. Through this joint venture, Equinix expects to build new state-of-the-art xScale facilities on multiple campuses across the U.S., each with multi-hundred megawatts of capacity. As previously announced, Equinix recently acquired a greater-than-200-acre land parcel as it develops its first multi-hundred-megawatt xScale campus in the Atlanta metro area to support the pursuit of larger AI and hyperscale workloads.\n    * Equinix's global xScale portfolio continues to see strong demand and leasing activity as the need for hyperscale infrastructure to support AI and cloud initiatives continues to grow. Since its Q2 earnings call, the company leased an incremental 20 megawatts of capacity into its Seoul 2 (SL2x) asset, bringing total xScale leasing to 385 megawatts globally with nearly 90% of its operational and under-construction capacity leased.\n    * In August, Equinix opened its first International Business Exchange™ (IBX®) data center in Johannesburg, South Africa to support and enhance the growing digital infrastructure and connectivity needs of enterprises and service providers on the rapidly growing African continent. The company also opened the first phases of its New York 3 (NY3) and Tokyo 15 (TY15) assets, easing capacity constraints in two key markets.\n  * Digital infrastructure, serving as the backbone of today's economy, encompasses connectivity that touches lives daily, enabling everything from online shopping to the lifesaving operations of hospitals, to supporting the data needs of AI training and inferencing. Equinix's industry-leading global interconnection franchise continues to perform with 478,000 total interconnections deployed on its platform. In the third quarter of 2024, net interconnection adds improved to 5,700 due to strong hyperscaler cross connect additions and continued diversification of Equinix's ecosystems.\n    * Equinix Fabric® saw continued solid growth with a roughly 40% global customer attach rate. Fabric growth was driven by solid 100-gigabyte port additions and higher bandwidth virtual connections.\n    * Internet Exchange experienced ongoing growth from existing customers as peak traffic surpassed 40 terabits per second for the first time.\n  * Equinix's Channel program delivered another solid quarter, accounting for approximately 50% of company new logos. It continued to see growth from partners like Avant, Dell, Orange Business and WWT, with wins across a wide range of industry segments and use cases, including AI. Key wins this quarter include a data center modernization project with AT&T. Through this project, Equinix is helping a customer-experience technology company blend cloud and private infrastructure resources, enable multicloud networking and accelerate AI and automation enhancements for customer interactions.\n  * In September, Equinix announced that it issued more than $750 million in green bonds across two completed offerings. The green bonds align the company's financing needs with its Future First sustainability strategy. With these latest issuances, Equinix will have issued a total of approximately $5.6 billion of green bonds, making it one of the top 10 largest U.S. corporate issuers in the investment-grade green bond market.\n\n\n\n**_Business Outlook_**\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, the company expects revenues to range between $2.262 and $2.302 billion, an as-reported increase of 3 - 5% over the previous quarter, or a normalized and constant currency increase of 2 - 4% excluding the quarter-over-quarter impact of the power pass-through. This guidance includes a $26 million foreign currency benefit when compared to the average FX rates in Q3 2024. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.010 and $1.050 billion. This guidance includes a $12 million foreign currency benefit when compared to the average FX rates in Q3 2024, $8 million of integration costs related to acquisitions and higher seasonal spending. Recurring capital expenditures are expected to range between $94 and $114 million, consistent with our typical seasonal investments in Q4.\n\nFor the full year of 2024, total revenues are expected to range between $8.748 and $8.788 billion, an as-reported increase of approximately 7% over the previous year, or a normalized and constant currency increase of approximately 7 - 8% excluding the year-over-year impact of the power pass-through. This $36 million increase from previously issued guidance is due to $12 million of better-than-expected operating performance and a $24 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to the prior guidance rates. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $4.086 and $4.126 billion, an adjusted EBITDA margin of 47%. This $10 million increase over previously issued guidance is due to a positive foreign currency benefit when compared to prior guidance rates. AFFO is expected to range between $3.338 and $3.378 billion, an as-reported increase of 11 - 12% over the previous year, or a normalized and constant currency increase of 11 - 13%. This $18 million increase over the previously issued guidance is due to $15 million from better-than-expected operating performance and a $3 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to prior guidance rates. AFFO per share is expected to range between $34.81 and $35.22, an as-reported increase of 8 - 10% over the previous year, or a normalized and constant currency increase of 9 - 10%. Total capital expenditures are expected to range between $2.850 and $3.100 billion. Non-recurring capital expenditures, including xScale-related capital expenditures, are expected to range between $2.620 and $2.850 billion, and recurring capital expenditures are expected to range between $230 and $250 million.\n\nThe U.S. dollar exchange rates used for 2024 guidance, taking into consideration the impact of our current foreign currency hedges, have been updated to $1.11 to the Euro, $1.28 to the Pound, S$1.29 to the U.S. Dollar, ¥144 to the U.S. Dollar, A$1.45 to the U.S. Dollar, HK$7.77 to the U.S. Dollar, R$5.46 to the U.S. Dollar and C$1.35 to the U.S. Dollar. The Q3 2024 global revenue breakdown by currency for the Euro, British Pound, Singapore Dollar, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar, Brazilian Real and Canadian Dollar is 20%, 10%, 9%, 5%, 5%, 3%, 3% and 2%, respectively.\n\nThe adjusted EBITDA guidance is based on the revenue guidance less our expectations of cash cost of revenues and cash operating expenses. The AFFO guidance is based on the adjusted EBITDA guidance less our expectations of net interest expense, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, a contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, income tax expense, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures, other income (expense), (gains) losses on disposition of real estate property, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items.\n\n**_Q3 2024 Results Conference Call and Replay Information_**\n\nEquinix will discuss its quarterly results for the period ended September 30, 2024, along with its future outlook, in its quarterly conference call on Wednesday, October 30, 2024, at 5:30 PM ET (2:30 PM PT).

Digital leaders harness Equinix's trusted platform to bring together and interconnect foundational infrastructure at software speed. Equinix enables organizations to access all the right places, partners and possibilities to scale with agility, speed the launch of digital services, deliver world-class experiences and multiply their value, while supporting their sustainability goals.\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**\n\nEquinix provides all information required in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, Equinix uses non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its operations.\n\nEquinix provides normalized and constant currency growth rates, which are calculated to adjust for acquisitions, dispositions, integration costs, changes in accounting principles and foreign currency.\n\nEquinix presents adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income excluding income tax expense, interest income, interest expense, other income or expense, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs and gain or loss on asset sales.\n\nIn presenting non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA, cash cost of revenues, cash gross margins, cash operating expenses (also known as cash selling, general and administrative expenses or cash SG&A), adjusted EBITDA margins, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow, Equinix excludes certain items that it believes are not good indicators of Equinix's current or future operating performance. These items are depreciation, amortization, accretion of asset retirement obligations and accrued restructuring charges, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs and gain or loss on asset sales. Equinix excludes these items in order for its lenders, investors and the industry analysts who review and report on Equinix to better evaluate Equinix's operating performance and cash spending levels relative to its industry sector and competitors.\n\nEquinix excludes depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of a data center, and do not reflect its current or future cash spending levels to support its business. Its data centers are long-lived assets, and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of a data center do not recur with respect to such data center, although Equinix may incur initial construction costs in future periods with respect to additional data centers, and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to the initial investment. This is a trend it expects to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of the data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historic costs incurred to build out our data centers and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, Equinix excludes depreciation from its operating results when evaluating its operations.\n\nIn addition, in presenting the non-GAAP financial measures, Equinix also excludes amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of acquisitions, and these charges may vary in amount from period to period. We exclude amortization expense to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our prior periods. Equinix excludes accretion expense, both as it relates to its asset retirement obligations as well as its accrued restructuring charges, as these expenses represent costs which Equinix also believes are not meaningful in evaluating Equinix's current operations. Equinix excludes stock-based compensation expense, as it can vary significantly from period to period based on share price and the timing, size and nature of equity awards. As such, Equinix and many investors and analysts exclude stock-based compensation expense to compare its operating results with those of other companies. Equinix also excludes restructuring charges. Such charges include employee severance, facility closure costs, lease or other contract termination costs and advisory fees related to the realignment of our management structure, operations or products. Equinix also excludes impairment charges related to goodwill or long-lived assets. Equinix also excludes gain or loss on asset sales as it represents profit or loss that is not meaningful in evaluating the current or future operating performance. Finally, Equinix excludes transaction costs from its non-GAAP financial measures to allow more comparable comparisons of the financial results to the historical operations. The transaction costs relate to costs Equinix incurs in connection with business combinations and formation of joint ventures, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional or consulting fees. Such charges generally are not relevant to assessing the long-term performance of Equinix. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the transactions. Management believes items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs and gain or loss on asset sales are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs may occur in future periods.\n\nEquinix also presents funds from operations (\"FFO\") and adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\"), both commonly used in the REIT industry, as supplemental performance measures. Additionally, Equinix presents AFFO per share, which is also commonly used in the REIT industry. AFFO per share offers investors and industry analysts a perspective of Equinix's underlying operating performance when compared to other REIT companies. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). FFO represents net income or loss, excluding gain or loss from the disposition of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items. AFFO represents FFO, excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate assets, accretion, stock-based compensation, stock-based charitable contributions, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, a contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures, net income or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax and adjustments from FFO to AFFO for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items. Equinix excludes depreciation expense, amortization expense, accretion, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges and transaction costs for the same reasons that they are excluded from the other non-GAAP financial measures mentioned above.\n\nEquinix includes an adjustment for revenues from installation fees, since installation fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of contract term, although the fees are generally paid in a lump sum upon installation. Equinix includes an adjustment for straight-line rent expense on its operating leases, since the total minimum lease payments are recognized ratably over the lease term, although the lease payments generally increase over the lease term. Equinix also includes an adjustment to contract costs incurred to obtain contracts, since contract costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated period of benefit on a straight-line basis, although costs of obtaining contracts are generally incurred and paid during the period of obtaining the contracts. The adjustments for installation revenues, straight-line rent expense and contract costs are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results in the consolidated statement of operations. Equinix excludes the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with its debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations. Equinix excludes gain or loss on debt extinguishment since it represents a cost that is not a good indicator of Equinix's current or future operating performance. Equinix includes an income tax expense adjustment, which represents the non-cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions that do not relate to the current period's operations. Equinix excludes recurring capital expenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of its IBX and xScale data centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues. Equinix also excludes net income or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, which represents results that are not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance.\n\nEquinix presents constant currency results of operations, which is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, Equinix has presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate its operating results without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of Equinix's business performance. To present this information, Equinix's current and comparative period revenues and certain operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at a consistent exchange rate for purposes of each result being compared.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Equinix presents such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate its operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be its core, ongoing business operations. Management believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and its ability to perform in subsequent periods. Equinix believes that if it did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze Equinix effectively.\n\nInvestors should note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by Equinix may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. Investors should, therefore, exercise caution when comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. Equinix does not provide forward-looking guidance for certain financial data, such as depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation, net income or loss from operations, cash generated from operating activities and cash used in investing activities, and as a result, is not able to provide a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for forward-looking data without unreasonable effort. The impact of such adjustments could be significant. Equinix intends to calculate the various non-GAAP financial measures in future periods consistent with how they were calculated for the periods presented within this press release.\n\n**_Forward-Looking Statements_**\n\n_This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from expectations discussed in such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, risks to our business and operating results related to the current inflationary environment; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; stock price fluctuations; availability of power, increased costs to procure power and the general volatility in the global energy market; the challenges of acquiring, operating and constructing IBX and xScale data centers and developing, deploying and delivering Equinix products and solutions; delays related to the closing of any planned acquisitions subject to closing conditions; unanticipated costs or difficulties relating to the integration of companies we have acquired or will acquire into Equinix; a failure to receive significant revenues from customers in recently built out or acquired data centers; failure to complete any financing arrangements contemplated from time to time; competition from existing and new competitors; the ability to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds to repay new or outstanding indebtedness; the loss or decline in business from our key customers; risks related to our taxation as a REIT; risks related to regulatory inquiries or litigation; and other risks described from time to time in Equinix filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Certain rounding adjustments have been made to prior period disclosed amounts.\n\nEquinix is not reasonably able to provide forward-looking guidance for certain financial data, such as depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation, net income (loss) from operations, cash generated from operating activities and cash used in investing activities, and as a result, is not able to provide a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for forward-looking data without unreasonable effort. The impact of such adjustments could be significant.\n\n**_Equinix Quote_**\n\n**Adaire Fox-Martin, CEO and President, Equinix:**\n\n_\"Our 87 th consecutive quarter of revenue growth was also a record-breaking one for gross bookings, with strong results across our three regions. This performance is a testament to the trust our customers place in Equinix and the value they realize partnering strategically with us. We see continued robust demand for AI-enabling digital infrastructure from a highly diverse set of customers of varying sizes, industries, and regions. This, coupled with significant expansion of our xScale capability, further strengthens our value proposition with customers and our leading position in the market.\"_\n\n**_Business Highlights_**\n\n  * Equinix remains dedicated to making extensive investments across its global operations to support the digital infrastructure needs of customers. The company currently has 57 major projects underway in 35 markets across 22 countries, including 13 xScale projects, representing more than 22,000 cabinets of retail capacity and more than 100 megawatts of xScale capacity to be delivered through the end of 2025.\n    * Earlier this month, Equinix announced plans to nearly triple the capital invested in its xScale data center portfolio with the agreement to form a greater than $15 billion joint venture, subject to closing conditions, with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) and GIC, with whom Equinix has previously partnered on xScale projects in Asia, the Americas and Europe. Through this joint venture, Equinix expects to build new state-of-the-art xScale facilities on multiple campuses across the U.S., each with multi-hundred megawatts of capacity. As previously announced, Equinix recently acquired a greater-than-200-acre land parcel as it develops its first multi-hundred-megawatt xScale campus in the Atlanta metro area to support the pursuit of larger AI and hyperscale workloads.\n    * Equinix's global xScale portfolio continues to see strong demand and leasing activity as the need for hyperscale infrastructure to support AI and cloud initiatives continues to grow. Since its Q2 earnings call, the company leased an incremental 20 megawatts of capacity into its Seoul 2 (SL2x) asset, bringing total xScale leasing to 385 megawatts globally with nearly 90% of its operational and under-construction capacity leased.\n    * In August, Equinix opened its first International Business Exchange™ (IBX®) data center in Johannesburg, South Africa to support and enhance the growing digital infrastructure and connectivity needs of enterprises and service providers on the rapidly growing African continent. The company also opened the first phases of its New York 3 (NY3) and Tokyo 15 (TY15) assets, easing capacity constraints in two key markets.\n  * Digital infrastructure, serving as the backbone of today's economy, encompasses connectivity that touches lives daily, enabling everything from online shopping to the lifesaving operations of hospitals, to supporting the data needs of AI training and inferencing. Equinix's industry-leading global interconnection franchise continues to perform with 478,000 total interconnections deployed on its platform. In the third quarter of 2024, net interconnection adds improved to 5,700 due to strong hyperscaler cross connect additions and continued diversification of Equinix's ecosystems.\n    * Equinix Fabric® saw continued solid growth with a roughly 40% global customer attach rate. Fabric growth was driven by solid 100-gigabyte port additions and higher bandwidth virtual connections.\n    * Internet Exchange experienced ongoing growth from existing customers as peak traffic surpassed 40 terabits per second for the first time.\n  * Equinix's Channel program delivered another solid quarter, accounting for approximately 50% of company new logos. It continued to see growth from partners like Avant, Dell, Orange Business and WWT, with wins across a wide range of industry segments and use cases, including AI. Key wins this quarter include a data center modernization project with AT&T. Through this project, Equinix is helping a customer-experience technology company blend cloud and private infrastructure resources, enable multicloud networking and accelerate AI and automation enhancements for customer interactions.\n  * In September, Equinix announced that it issued more than $750 million in green bonds across two completed offerings. The green bonds align the company's financing needs with its Future First sustainability strategy. With these latest issuances, Equinix will have issued a total of approximately $5.6 billion of green bonds, making it one of the top 10 largest U.S. corporate issuers in the investment-grade green bond market.\n\n\n\n**_Business Outlook_**\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, the company expects revenues to range between $2.262 and $2.302 billion, an as-reported increase of 3 - 5% over the previous quarter, or a normalized and constant currency increase of 2 - 4% excluding the quarter-over-quarter impact of the power pass-through. This guidance includes a $26 million foreign currency benefit when compared to the average FX rates in Q3 2024. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.010 and $1.050 billion. This guidance includes a $12 million foreign currency benefit when compared to the average FX rates in Q3 2024, $8 million of integration costs related to acquisitions and higher seasonal spending. Recurring capital expenditures are expected to range between $94 and $114 million, consistent with our typical seasonal investments in Q4.\n\nFor the full year of 2024, total revenues are expected to range between $8.748 and $8.788 billion, an as-reported increase of approximately 7% over the previous year, or a normalized and constant currency increase of approximately 7 - 8% excluding the year-over-year impact of the power pass-through. This $36 million increase from previously issued guidance is due to $12 million of better-than-expected operating performance and a $24 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to the prior guidance rates. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $4.086 and $4.126 billion, an adjusted EBITDA margin of 47%. This $10 million increase over previously issued guidance is due to a positive foreign currency benefit when compared to prior guidance rates. AFFO is expected to range between $3.338 and $3.378 billion, an as-reported increase of 11 - 12% over the previous year, or a normalized and constant currency increase of 11 - 13%. This $18 million increase over the previously issued guidance is due to $15 million from better-than-expected operating performance and a $3 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to prior guidance rates. AFFO per share is expected to range between $34.81 and $35.22, an as-reported increase of 8 - 10% over the previous year, or a normalized and constant currency increase of 9 - 10%. Total capital expenditures are expected to range between $2.850 and $3.100 billion. Non-recurring capital expenditures, including xScale-related capital expenditures, are expected to range between $2.620 and $2.850 billion, and recurring capital expenditures are expected to range between $230 and $250 million.\n\nThe U.S. dollar exchange rates used for 2024 guidance, taking into consideration the impact of our current foreign currency hedges, have been updated to $1.11 to the Euro, $1.28 to the Pound, S$1.29 to the U.S. Dollar, ¥144 to the U.S. Dollar, A$1.45 to the U.S. Dollar, HK$7.77 to the U.S. Dollar, R$5.46 to the U.S. Dollar and C$1.35 to the U.S. Dollar. The Q3 2024 global revenue breakdown by currency for the Euro, British Pound, Singapore Dollar, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar, Brazilian Real and Canadian Dollar is 20%, 10%, 9%, 5%, 5%, 3%, 3% and 2%, respectively.\n\nThe adjusted EBITDA guidance is based on the revenue guidance less our expectations of cash cost of revenues and cash operating expenses. The AFFO guidance is based on the adjusted EBITDA guidance less our expectations of net interest expense, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, a contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, income tax expense, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures, other income (expense), (gains) losses on disposition of real estate property, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items.\n\n**_Q3 2024 Results Conference Call and Replay Information_**\n\nEquinix will discuss its quarterly results for the period ended September 30, 2024, along with its future outlook, in its quarterly conference call on Wednesday, October 30, 2024, at 5:30 PM ET (2:30 PM PT).

Digital leaders harness Equinix's trusted platform to bring together and interconnect foundational infrastructure at software speed. Equinix enables organizations to access all the right places, partners and possibilities to scale with agility, speed the launch of digital services, deliver world-class experiences and multiply their value, while supporting their sustainability goals.\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**\n\nEquinix provides all information required in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, Equinix uses non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its operations.\n\nEquinix provides normalized and constant currency growth rates, which are calculated to adjust for acquisitions, dispositions, integration costs, changes in accounting principles and foreign currency.\n\nEquinix presents adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income excluding income tax expense, interest income, interest expense, other income or expense, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs and gain or loss on asset sales.\n\nIn presenting non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA, cash cost of revenues, cash gross margins, cash operating expenses (also known as cash selling, general and administrative expenses or cash SG&A), adjusted EBITDA margins, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow, Equinix excludes certain items that it believes are not good indicators of Equinix's current or future operating performance. These items are depreciation, amortization, accretion of asset retirement obligations and accrued restructuring charges, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs and gain or loss on asset sales. Equinix excludes these items in order for its lenders, investors and the industry analysts who review and report on Equinix to better evaluate Equinix's operating performance and cash spending levels relative to its industry sector and competitors.\n\nEquinix excludes depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of a data center, and do not reflect its current or future cash spending levels to support its business. Its data centers are long-lived assets, and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of a data center do not recur with respect to such data center, although Equinix may incur initial construction costs in future periods with respect to additional data centers, and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to the initial investment. This is a trend it expects to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of the data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historic costs incurred to build out our data centers and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, Equinix excludes depreciation from its operating results when evaluating its operations.\n\nIn addition, in presenting the non-GAAP financial measures, Equinix also excludes amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of acquisitions, and these charges may vary in amount from period to period. We exclude amortization expense to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our prior periods. Equinix excludes accretion expense, both as it relates to its asset retirement obligations as well as its accrued restructuring charges, as these expenses represent costs which Equinix also believes are not meaningful in evaluating Equinix's current operations. Equinix excludes stock-based compensation expense, as it can vary significantly from period to period based on share price and the timing, size and nature of equity awards. As such, Equinix and many investors and analysts exclude stock-based compensation expense to compare its operating results with those of other companies. Equinix also excludes restructuring charges. Such charges include employee severance, facility closure costs, lease or other contract termination costs and advisory fees related to the realignment of our management structure, operations or products. Equinix also excludes impairment charges related to goodwill or long-lived assets. Equinix also excludes gain or loss on asset sales as it represents profit or loss that is not meaningful in evaluating the current or future operating performance. Finally, Equinix excludes transaction costs from its non-GAAP financial measures to allow more comparable comparisons of the financial results to the historical operations. The transaction costs relate to costs Equinix incurs in connection with business combinations and formation of joint ventures, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional or consulting fees. Such charges generally are not relevant to assessing the long-term performance of Equinix. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the transactions. Management believes items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs and gain or loss on asset sales are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs may occur in future periods.\n\nEquinix also presents funds from operations (\"FFO\") and adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\"), both commonly used in the REIT industry, as supplemental performance measures. Additionally, Equinix presents AFFO per share, which is also commonly used in the REIT industry. AFFO per share offers investors and industry analysts a perspective of Equinix's underlying operating performance when compared to other REIT companies. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). FFO represents net income or loss, excluding gain or loss from the disposition of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items. AFFO represents FFO, excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate assets, accretion, stock-based compensation, stock-based charitable contributions, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, a contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures, net income or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax and adjustments from FFO to AFFO for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items. Equinix excludes depreciation expense, amortization expense, accretion, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges and transaction costs for the same reasons that they are excluded from the other non-GAAP financial measures mentioned above.\n\nEquinix includes an adjustment for revenues from installation fees, since installation fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of contract term, although the fees are generally paid in a lump sum upon installation. Equinix includes an adjustment for straight-line rent expense on its operating leases, since the total minimum lease payments are recognized ratably over the lease term, although the lease payments generally increase over the lease term. Equinix also includes an adjustment to contract costs incurred to obtain contracts, since contract costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated period of benefit on a straight-line basis, although costs of obtaining contracts are generally incurred and paid during the period of obtaining the contracts. The adjustments for installation revenues, straight-line rent expense and contract costs are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results in the consolidated statement of operations. Equinix excludes the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with its debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations. Equinix excludes gain or loss on debt extinguishment since it represents a cost that is not a good indicator of Equinix's current or future operating performance. Equinix includes an income tax expense adjustment, which represents the non-cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions that do not relate to the current period's operations. Equinix excludes recurring capital expenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of its IBX and xScale data centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues. Equinix also excludes net income or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, which represents results that are not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance.\n\nEquinix presents constant currency results of operations, which is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, Equinix has presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate its operating results without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of Equinix's business performance. To present this information, Equinix's current and comparative period revenues and certain operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at a consistent exchange rate for purposes of each result being compared.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Equinix presents such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate its operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be its core, ongoing business operations. Management believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and its ability to perform in subsequent periods. Equinix believes that if it did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze Equinix effectively.\n\nInvestors should note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by Equinix may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. Investors should, therefore, exercise caution when comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. Equinix does not provide forward-looking guidance for certain financial data, such as depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation, net income or loss from operations, cash generated from operating activities and cash used in investing activities, and as a result, is not able to provide a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for forward-looking data without unreasonable effort. The impact of such adjustments could be significant. Equinix intends to calculate the various non-GAAP financial measures in future periods consistent with how they were calculated for the periods presented within this press release.\n\n**_Forward-Looking Statements_**\n\n_This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The impact of such adjustments could be significant.\n2\nEquinix Quote\nAdaire Fox-Martin, CEO and President, Equinix:\n“Our 87th consecutive quarter of revenue growth was also a record-breaking one for gross bookings, with\nstrong results across our three regions. This performance is a testament to the trust our customers place\nin Equinix and the value they realize partnering strategically with us. We see continued robust demand\nfor AI-enabling digital infrastructure from a highly diverse set of customers of varying sizes, industries,\nand regions. This, coupled with significant expansion of our xScale capability, further strengthens our\nvalue proposition with customers and our leading position in the market.”\nBusiness Highlights\n• Equinix remains dedicated to making extensive investments across its global operations to\nsupport the digital infrastructure needs of customers. The company currently has 57 major\nprojects underway in 35 markets across 22 countries, including 13 xScale projects, representing\nmore than 22,000 cabinets of retail capacity and more than 100 megawatts of xScale capacity to\nbe delivered through the end of 2025.\n◦ Earlier this month, Equinix announced plans to nearly triple the capital invested in its\nxScale data center portfolio with the agreement to form a greater than $15 billion joint\nventure, subject to closing conditions, with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP\nInvestments) and GIC, with whom Equinix has previously partnered on xScale projects in\nAsia, the Americas and Europe. Through this joint venture, Equinix expects to build new\nstate-of-the-art xScale facilities on multiple campuses across the U.S., each with multi-\nhundred megawatts of capacity. As previously announced, Equinix recently acquired a\ngreater-than-200-acre land parcel as it develops its first multi-hundred-megawatt xScale\ncampus in the Atlanta metro area to support the pursuit of larger AI and hyperscale\nworkloads.\n◦ Equinix’s global xScale portfolio continues to see strong demand and leasing activity as\nthe need for hyperscale infrastructure to support AI and cloud initiatives continues to\ngrow. Since its Q2 earnings call, the company leased an incremental 20 megawatts of\ncapacity into its Seoul 2 (SL2x) asset, bringing total xScale leasing to 385 megawatts\nglobally with nearly 90% of its operational and under-construction capacity leased.\n3\n◦ In August, Equinix opened its first International Business ExchangeTM (IBX®) data center\nin Johannesburg, South Africa to support and enhance the growing digital infrastructure\nand connectivity needs of enterprises and service providers on the rapidly growing\nAfrican continent. The company also opened the first phases of its New York 3 (NY3)\nand Tokyo 15 (TY15) assets, easing capacity constraints in two key markets.\n• Digital infrastructure, serving as the backbone of today’s economy, encompasses connectivity\nthat touches lives daily, enabling everything from online shopping to the lifesaving operations of\nhospitals, to supporting the data needs of AI training and inferencing. Equinix's industry-leading\nglobal interconnection franchise continues to perform with 478,000 total interconnections\ndeployed on its platform. In the third quarter of 2024, net interconnection adds improved to 5,700\ndue to strong hyperscaler cross connect additions and continued diversification of Equinix’s\necosystems.\n◦ Equinix Fabric® saw continued solid growth with a roughly 40% global customer attach\nrate. Fabric growth was driven by solid 100-gigabyte port additions and higher bandwidth\nvirtual connections.\n◦ Internet Exchange experienced ongoing growth from existing customers as peak traffic\nsurpassed 40 terabits per second for the first time.\n• Equinix’s Channel program delivered another solid quarter, accounting for approximately 50% of\ncompany new logos. It continued to see growth from partners like Avant, Dell, Orange Business\nand WWT, with wins across a wide range of industry segments and use cases, including AI. Key\nwins this quarter include a data center modernization project with AT&T. Through this project,\nEquinix is helping a customer-experience technology company blend cloud and private\ninfrastructure resources, enable multicloud networking and accelerate AI and automation\nenhancements for customer interactions.\n• In September, Equinix announced that it issued more than $750 million in green bonds across two\ncompleted offerings. The green bonds align the company’s financing needs with its Future First\nsustainability strategy. With these latest issuances, Equinix will have issued a total of\napproximately $5.6 billion of green bonds, making it one of the top 10 largest U.S. corporate\nissuers in the investment-grade green bond market.\nBusiness Outlook\n4\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, the company expects revenues to range between $2.262 and $2.302 billion,\nan as-reported increase of 3 - 5% over the previous quarter, or a normalized and constant currency\nincrease of 2 - 4% excluding the quarter-over-quarter impact of the power pass-through. This guidance\nincludes a $26 million foreign currency benefit when compared to the average FX rates in Q3 2024.\nAdjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.010 and $1.050 billion. This guidance includes a $12\nmillion foreign currency benefit when compared to the average FX rates in Q3 2024, $8 million of\nintegration costs related to acquisitions and higher seasonal spending. Recurring capital expenditures are\nexpected to range between $94 and $114 million, consistent with our typical seasonal investments in Q4.\nFor the full year of 2024, total revenues are expected to range between $8.748 and $8.788 billion, an as-\nreported increase of approximately 7% over the previous year, or a normalized and constant currency\nincrease of approximately 7 - 8% excluding the year-over-year impact of the power pass-through. This\n$36 million increase from previously issued guidance is due to $12 million of better-than-expected\noperating performance and a $24 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to the prior\nguidance rates. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $4.086 and $4.126 billion, an adjusted\nEBITDA margin of 47%. This $10 million increase over previously issued guidance is due to a positive\nforeign currency benefit when compared to prior guidance rates. AFFO is expected to range between\n$3.338 and $3.378 billion, an as-reported increase of 11 - 12% over the previous year, or a normalized\nand constant currency increase of 11 - 13%. This $18 million increase over the previously issued\nguidance is due to $15 million from better-than-expected operating performance and a $3 million positive\nforeign currency benefit when compared to prior guidance rates. AFFO per share is expected to range\nbetween $34.81 and $35.22, an as-reported increase of 8 - 10% over the previous year, or a normalized\nand constant currency increase of 9 - 10%. Total capital expenditures are expected to range between\n$2.850 and $3.100 billion. Non-recurring capital expenditures, including xScale-related capital\nexpenditures, are expected to range between $2.620 and $2.850 billion, and recurring capital expenditures\nare expected to range between $230 and $250 million.\nThe U.S. dollar exchange rates used for 2024 guidance, taking into consideration the impact of our\ncurrent foreign currency hedges, have been updated to $1.11 to the Euro, $1.28 to the Pound, S$1.29 to\nthe U.S. Dollar, ¥144 to the U.S. Dollar, A$1.45 to the U.S. Dollar, HK$7.77 to the U.S. Dollar, R$5.46\nto the U.S. Dollar and C$1.35 to the U.S. Dollar. The Q3 2024 global revenue breakdown by currency for\nthe Euro, British Pound, Singapore Dollar, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar, Brazilian\nReal and Canadian Dollar is 20%, 10%, 9%, 5%, 5%, 3%, 3% and 2%, respectively.\nThe adjusted EBITDA guidance is based on the revenue guidance less our expectations of cash cost of\nrevenues and cash operating expenses. The AFFO guidance is based on the adjusted EBITDA guidance\n5\nless our expectations of net interest expense, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent\nexpense adjustment, a contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt\ndiscounts and premiums, income tax expense, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital\nexpenditures, other income (expense), (gains) losses on disposition of real estate property, and\nadjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures’ and non-controlling interests’ share of these items.\nQ3 2024 Results Conference Call and Replay Information\nEquinix will discuss its quarterly results for the period ended September 30, 2024, along with its future\noutlook, in its quarterly conference call on Wednesday, October 30, 2024, at 5:30 PM ET (2:30 PM PT).\nA simultaneous live webcast of the call will be available on the company’s Investor Relations website at\nwww.equinix.com/investors.

Digital leaders harness Equinix's\ntrusted platform to bring together and interconnect foundational infrastructure at software speed. Equinix\nenables organizations to access all the right places, partners and possibilities to scale with agility, speed\nthe launch of digital services, deliver world-class experiences and multiply their value, while supporting\ntheir sustainability goals.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n6\nEquinix provides all information required in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles\n(“GAAP”), but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to\nreviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, Equinix uses non-GAAP financial measures to\nevaluate its operations.\nEquinix provides normalized and constant currency growth rates, which are calculated to adjust for\nacquisitions, dispositions, integration costs, changes in accounting principles and foreign currency.\nEquinix presents adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA\nrepresents net income excluding income tax expense, interest income, interest expense, other income or\nexpense, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based\ncompensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs and gain or loss on\nasset sales.\nIn presenting non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA, cash cost of revenues, cash gross\nmargins, cash operating expenses (also known as cash selling, general and administrative expenses or\ncash SG&A), adjusted EBITDA margins, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow, Equinix excludes\ncertain items that it believes are not good indicators of Equinix’s current or future operating performance.\nThese items are depreciation, amortization, accretion of asset retirement obligations and accrued\nrestructuring charges, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction\ncosts and gain or loss on asset sales. Equinix excludes these items in order for its lenders, investors and\nthe industry analysts who review and report on Equinix to better evaluate Equinix’s operating\nperformance and cash spending levels relative to its industry sector and competitors.\nEquinix excludes depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of\na data center, and do not reflect its current or future cash spending levels to support its business. Its data\ncenters are long-lived assets, and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of a\ndata center do not recur with respect to such data center, although Equinix may incur initial construction\ncosts in future periods with respect to additional data centers, and future capital expenditures remain\nminor relative to the initial investment. This is a trend it expects to continue. In addition, depreciation is\nalso based on the estimated useful lives of the data centers. These estimates could vary from actual\nperformance of the asset, are based on historic costs incurred to build out our data centers and are not\nindicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, Equinix excludes depreciation\nfrom its operating results when evaluating its operations.\nIn addition, in presenting the non-GAAP financial measures, Equinix also excludes amortization expense\nrelated to acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and\n7\nmagnitude of acquisitions, and these charges may vary in amount from period to period. We exclude\namortization expense to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and\ncomparisons to our prior periods. Equinix excludes accretion expense, both as it relates to its asset\nretirement obligations as well as its accrued restructuring charges, as these expenses represent costs which\nEquinix also believes are not meaningful in evaluating Equinix’s current operations. Equinix excludes\nstock-based compensation expense, as it can vary significantly from period to period based on share price\nand the timing, size and nature of equity awards. As such, Equinix and many investors and analysts\nexclude stock-based compensation expense to compare its operating results with those of other\ncompanies. Equinix also excludes restructuring charges. Such charges include employee severance,\nfacility closure costs, lease or other contract termination costs and advisory fees related to the realignment\nof our management structure, operations or products. Equinix also excludes impairment charges related to\ngoodwill or long-lived assets. Equinix also excludes gain or loss on asset sales as it represents profit or\nloss that is not meaningful in evaluating the current or future operating performance. Finally, Equinix\nexcludes transaction costs from its non-GAAP financial measures to allow more comparable comparisons\nof the financial results to the historical operations. The transaction costs relate to costs Equinix incurs in\nconnection with business combinations and formation of joint ventures, including advisory, legal,\naccounting, valuation and other professional or consulting fees. Such charges generally are not relevant to\nassessing the long-term performance of Equinix. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges\nvary significantly based on the size and timing of the transactions. Management believes items such as\nrestructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs and gain or loss on asset sales are non-core\ntransactions; however, these types of costs may occur in future periods.\nEquinix also presents funds from operations (“FFO”) and adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”), both\ncommonly used in the REIT industry, as supplemental performance measures. Additionally, Equinix\npresents AFFO per share, which is also commonly used in the REIT industry. AFFO per share offers\ninvestors and industry analysts a perspective of Equinix’s underlying operating performance when\ncompared to other REIT companies. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition established by\nthe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). FFO represents net income or\nloss, excluding gain or loss from the disposition of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization on real\nestate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures’ and non-controlling interests’ share of\nthese items. AFFO represents FFO, excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate\nassets, accretion, stock-based compensation, stock-based charitable contributions, restructuring charges,\nimpairment charges, transaction costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense\nadjustment, a contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and\npremiums, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital\nexpenditures, net income or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax and adjustments from FFO to\n8\nAFFO for unconsolidated joint ventures’ and non-controlling interests’ share of these items. Equinix\nexcludes depreciation expense, amortization expense, accretion, stock-based compensation, restructuring\ncharges, impairment charges and transaction costs for the same reasons that they are excluded from the\nother non-GAAP financial measures mentioned above.\nEquinix includes an adjustment for revenues from installation fees, since installation fees are deferred and\nrecognized ratably over the period of contract term, although the fees are generally paid in a lump sum\nupon installation. Equinix includes an adjustment for straight-line rent expense on its operating leases,\nsince the total minimum lease payments are recognized ratably over the lease term, although the lease\npayments generally increase over the lease term. Equinix also includes an adjustment to contract costs\nincurred to obtain contracts, since contract costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated period\nof benefit on a straight-line basis, although costs of obtaining contracts are generally incurred and paid\nduring the period of obtaining the contracts. The adjustments for installation revenues, straight-line rent\nexpense and contract costs are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or\namortized results in the consolidated statement of operations. Equinix excludes the amortization of\ndeferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums as these expenses relate to the initial costs\nincurred in connection with its debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations. Equinix\nexcludes gain or loss on debt extinguishment since it represents a cost that is not a good indicator of\nEquinix’s current or future operating performance. Equinix includes an income tax expense adjustment,\nwhich represents the non-cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances and uncertain tax\npositions that do not relate to the current period’s operations. Equinix excludes recurring capital\nexpenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of its IBX and xScale data centers or\nother assets that are required to support current revenues. Equinix also excludes net income or loss from\ndiscontinued operations, net of tax, which represents results that are not a good indicator of our current or\nfuture operating performance.\nEquinix presents constant currency results of operations, which is a non-GAAP financial measure and is\nnot meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However,\nEquinix has presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to\nevaluate its operating results without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,\nthereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of Equinix’s business performance. To present this\ninformation, Equinix’s current and comparative period revenues and certain operating expenses\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at a consistent\nexchange rate for purposes of each result being compared.\n9\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with\nGAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered\ntogether with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-\nGAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Equinix presents\nsuch non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate its operating\nresults in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be its core, ongoing business operations.\nManagement believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and\ncomparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the\nbusiness and its ability to perform in subsequent periods. Equinix believes that if it did not provide such\nnon-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze Equinix\neffectively.\nInvestors should note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by Equinix may not be the same non-\nGAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies.\nInvestors should, therefore, exercise caution when comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by us\nto similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. Equinix does not provide forward-\nlooking guidance for certain financial data, such as depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based\ncompensation, net income or loss from operations, cash generated from operating activities and cash used\nin investing activities, and as a result, is not able to provide a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP\nfinancial measures for forward-looking data without unreasonable effort. The impact of such adjustments\ncould be significant. Equinix intends to calculate the various non-GAAP financial measures in future\nperiods consistent with how they were calculated for the periods presented within this press release.\n10\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results\nmay differ materially from expectations discussed in such forward-looking statements. Factors that might\ncause such differences include, but are not limited to, risks to our business and operating results related\nto the current inflationary environment; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; stock price\nfluctuations; availability of power, increased costs to procure power and the general volatility in the\nglobal energy market; the challenges of acquiring, operating and constructing IBX and xScale data\ncenters and developing, deploying and delivering Equinix products and solutions; delays related to the\nclosing of any planned acquisitions subject to closing conditions; unanticipated costs or difficulties\nrelating to the integration of companies we have acquired or will acquire into Equinix; a failure to\nreceive significant revenues from customers in recently built out or acquired data centers; failure to\ncomplete any financing arrangements contemplated from time to time; competition from existing and new\ncompetitors; the ability to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds to repay new or\noutstanding indebtedness; the loss or decline in business from our key customers; risks related to our\ntaxation as a REIT; risks related to regulatory inquiries or litigation; and other risks described from time\nto time in Equinix filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In particular, see recent and\nupcoming Equinix quarterly and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,\ncopies of which are available upon request from Equinix. Equinix does not assume any obligation to\nupdate the forward-looking information contained in this press release.\n11\nEQUINIX, INC.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(in millions,

NAREIT FFO represents net income (loss), excluding gains (or losses) from disposition of real estate property, impairment charges related to\ndepreciable real estate fixed assets, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization expense and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures,\nand non-controlling interests.\nAdjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO)\n- We calculate AFFO by adding to or subtracting from NAREIT FFO:\n1. Plus: Amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums\n2. Plus: Stock-based compensation expense\n3. Plus: Stock-based charitable contributions\n4. Plus: Non-real estate depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses\n5. Less: Recurring capital expenditures\n6. Less/Plus: Straight line revenues/rent expense adjustments\n7.

Less/Plus: Adjustments from discontinued operations, unconsolidated JVs and non-controlling interests\n© 2024 Equinix, Inc. 48\nDefinitions: Non-financial Metrics, Data Center growth, REIT and Capital\nExpenditures\nNon-Financial Metrics\nMRR per Cab: Monthly recurring revenues per billed cabinet: (current quarter recurring revenues / 3) divided by ((quarter end cabinets billing prior quarter + quarter end cabinets billing current quarter) / 2). xScale JV fee income is excluded. Americas MRR\nper Cab excludes Infomart non-IBX tenant income and Equinix Metal. EMEA MRR per Cab excludes MainOne\nVirtual connections: The number of private connections between customers over the Equinix Fabric platform\nInternet Exchange Provisioned Capacity: The sum of all ports provisioned to customers multiplied by the gigabit bandwidth capacity of each port\nData Center Growth\nNew Data Centers: Phase 1 began operating after January 1, 2023\nExpansion Data Centers: Phase 1 began operating before January 1, 2023, and there is an expected expansion of one or more additional phases leveraging the existing capital infrastructure, or a redevelopment of a previous phase.This alsoincludes\ndata centers wherea newphaseor redevelopmenthas opened for a previously stabilized data center after January 1, 2023\nStabilized Data Centers: The final expansion or redevelopment phase began operating before January 1, 2023\nUnconsolidated Data Centers: Excludes non-data center assets\nREIT Disclosures\nAdjusted NOI Composition: Adjusted NOI is calculated by taking recurring revenues, deducting recurring cash costs, adding back operating lease rent expense and deducting cash SG&A allocated to the properties. The impact of operating lease rent\nexpense is removed to reflect an owned income stream. Total cash rent is provided in the components of NAV. Regional SG&A expense is allocated to the properties to reflect the full sales, marketing and operating costs of owning a portfolio of retail\ncolocation properties. In addition, Corporate SG&A is provided to show centralized organization costs that are not property-related and, therefore, excluded from adjusted NOI.\nComponents of NAV: A detailed disclosure of applicable cash flows, assets and liabilities to support a Net Asset Value (NAV). Net asset valuation involves a market-based valuation of assets and liabilities to derive an intrinsic value of equity. Operating\ncash flows are separated into real estate income (adjusted NOI), non-recurring income and other operating income in order to facilitate discrete composition valuations. New properties and CIP generating unstabilized cash flows are reflected based on\ngross asset value. Other assets and liabilities include only tangible items with realizable economic value. Balance sheet assets and liabilities without tangible economic value (i.e. goodwill) are excluded. Other ongoing expenses including cash rent and\ncash tax expenses are disclosed to facilitate a market valuation of those liabilities.

Business\nOverview: Powering the World’s Digital Leaders\nEquinix is the world's digital infrastructure companyTM. Digital leaders harness our trusted platform to bring\ntogether and interconnect the foundational infrastructure that powers their success. We enable our customers to\naccess all the right places, partners and possibilities they need to accelerate their advantage. Platform Equinix®\ncombines a global footprint of International Business Exchange™ (IBX®) and xScale® data centers in the Americas,\nAsia-Pacific, and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (\"EMEA\") regions, interconnection solutions, digital offerings,\nunique business and digital ecosystems and expert consulting and support. Equinix was incorporated on June 22,\n1998, as a Delaware corporation and operates as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.\nAl Avery and Jay Adelson founded Equinix as a network-neutral, multi-tenant data center (\"MTDC\") provider,\nwhere competing networks could connect and share data traffic to help scale the rapid growth of the early internet.\nThe company’s name, Equinix (composed from the words \"equality\", \"neutrality\" and \"internet exchange\"), reflects\nthat vision. The founders also believed they not only had the opportunity but also the responsibility to create a\ncompany that would be the steward of some of the most important digital infrastructure assets in the world. Over\ntwo and a half decades later, we have expanded upon that vision to build Platform Equinix, which we believe is\nunmatched in scale and reach.\nOur interconnected data centers around the world allow our customers to bring together and interconnect the\ninfrastructure they need to fast-track their digital advantage. With Equinix, they can scale with agility, accelerate the\nlaunch of digital offerings, deliver world-class experiences and multiply their value. We enable them to differentiate\nby distributing infrastructure and removing the distance between clouds, users and applications in order to reduce\nlatency and deliver a superior customer, partner and employee experience. The Equinix global platform, and the\nquality of our IBX and xScale data centers, interconnection offerings and edge solutions, have enabled us to\nestablish a critical mass of customers. As more customers choose Platform Equinix for bandwidth cost and\nperformance reasons, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate in the same data centers and\nconnect directly with each other. This adjacency creates a network effect that attracts new customers, continuously\nenhances our existing customers' value and enables them to capture further economic and performance benefits\nfrom our offerings.\n5\nTable of Contents\nIn 2023, we opened nine new data centers, inclusive of new xScale sites via our joint ventures. Our new data\ncenter openings included sites in the following metros: Bogotá, Dubai, Dublin, Frankfurt, Madrid, Milan, Montreal,\nTokyo and Washington D.C. When including five additional data centers which opened in January 2024, this results\nin an increase in our total number of data center facilities to 260. 2023 highlights include:\n• In February, we announced plans to build and operate a second IBX data center in Barcelona, Spain. The\nnew site will serve as a strategic connection point for data communications between Europe, Africa and the\nMiddle East, with Barcelona quickly becoming a vital subsea hub.\n• In June, we announced our plans for expansion into Malaysia, with an additional investment of more than\n$100 million to help businesses capitalize on the country’s digital transformation and economic growth. We\nopened our first data center in Kuala Lumpur in January 2024, which followed our expansion announcement\nto enter Malaysia with a data center in Johor.\n• In August, we announced our plans for expansion of our footprint in Mumbai, India, to address the country’s\nrising demand for digital infrastructure. The new facility, called MB4, will bring Equinix’s total data centers in\nthe country to four. MB4 will offer expanded connectivity options to major telecommunications networks\nalong with Metro Connect® availability to the highly connected Equinix data center sites of MB1 and MB2.\nThe first phase of MB4 is expected to open in Q1 2024 and will provide an initial capacity of 350 cabinets.\nWhen fully built out, the facility is expected to provide 700 cabinets.\n• In September, we opened our new IBX data center in Montreal, Quebec (\"MT2\") to support customer\nexpansions in one of the fastest-growing edge metros in the world. MT2 is our second data center in the\nmetro and brings the full value of our platform and portfolio of solutions to Canadian businesses, including\nthose in the rapidly growing financial services, gaming and aerospace sectors.\n• We also announced an expanded relationship with Southern Cross Cables Limited (\"Southern Cross\") in\nSeptember, which will provide a key U.S.-based interconnectivity access point for the Southern Cross NEXT\n(\"SX NEXT\") submarine cable system. SX NEXT leverages our next-generation cable landing station\n(\"CLS\") architecture, enabling rapid provisioning and cost savings.\nIndustry Trends: Ecosystems unlock digital opportunity\nThe digital economy is growing and evolving dynamically. There is a constant influx of new digital product and\nservice providers and related digital consumers, resulting in new ecosystems forming across all industries. Leading\norganizations are using digital infrastructure as a strong foundation for scalability and flexibility. They are scaling into\nmore markets, with greater flexibility, having invested in cutting-edge capabilities. Additionally, their participation in\ndigital marketplaces offers significant advantages. Several trends have emerged as a result of these changing\nbusiness models. These trends include:\n• The digital presence trend underpins businesses’ prioritization of transformation to engage and deliver\nvalue electronically. To compete in the digital economy, organizations are shifting to digital solutions. The\nmajority of global growth in Gross Domestic Product (\"GDP\") and revenue is coming from digital services.\nDigital revenue sources will be the primary drivers of economic growth in the next decade. As companies\nstrive to shift from traditional to digital services, only half of companies analyzed, as shown by the Global\nInterconnection Index 2024 (\"GXI\"), a market study published by Equinix, are taking advantage of this\nopportunity. The GXI data shows that many enterprises are expanding from being consumers to providers\nof digital services, and not all organizations are moving fast enough.\n6\nTable of Contents\n• The digital participation trend shows that more companies are leveraging digital ecosystems to\ncollaborate and offer services back into the marketplaces faster than ever before. Each industry is growing\nits own forms of electronic exchange. Data in the GXI shows that companies are tapping into the sharing\neconomy to create new revenue streams, showing a rapid growth curve, while fast followers (companies\nreplicating what digital leaders are doing) are shifting gears to succeed by doubling their ecosystem\ninteractions— doing more with less investment.\n• The digital proximity trend indicates that companies are bringing their capabilities closer to business\noperations globally for differentiated value and revenue benefits. Additionally, as data grows exponentially, it\nis being distributed in proximity to where business happens. Companies need to make faster decisions, at\ngreater scale and complexity, with more sources of data. As shown in the GXI, industries are gaining\ncompetitive advantage by investing in edge technologies.\n• The sustainability trend reveals market expectations and industry regulations are making organizations\nprioritize sustainability and hold themselves and their business partners accountable. Sustainable\nbusinesses rely on innovation, sustainable technology and efficient digital practices to reduce emissions\nand achieve net-zero goals. Leaders are involving their supply chain partners, including data centers, to\nensure they reduce carbon emissions. Companies also are using more efficient technologies to strengthen\na sustainable foundation and scale business.\n• Technology adoption trends like composable business--with companies leveraging as-a-Service offerings\nfor commoditized functions and the emergence of artificial intelligence (\"AI\") ecosystems to improve\nefficiency and productivity are also strong trends in the market.\nThese trends are accelerating the need for companies like Equinix that can provide a secure, agile global\nbusiness platform that leverages digital interconnection—or private data exchange—to deliver real-time interactions\naround the world.\nAs part of their digital transformation, businesses in most industries are shifting their centralized IT\ninfrastructures to the edge to bring digital solutions closer to users for better performance, which has become a\nsignificant driver of digital business value. To realize the full potential of the edge, IT organizations require greater\ninterconnection bandwidth. Interconnection bandwidth is defined as the total capacity provisioned to privately and\ndirectly exchange traffic, with a diverse set of partners and providers, at distributed IT exchange points inside\ncarrier-neutral colocation data centers. Private interconnection capacity between businesses, as reported in GXI\n2024, is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (\"CAGR\") of 34% by 2026, potentially reaching\n33,578 terabits per second of data exchanged annually.\nWorldwide Interconnection Bandwidth Capacity CAGR (2022 - 2026) in Terabits per Second (Tbps)\nSource: GXI 2024\nEquinix Business Proposition: To be the platform where the world comes together, enabling the\ninnovations that enrich our work, life and planet\nIn 2023, we continued to build new digital offerings and data center offerings to further our vision to power the\nworld’s digital leaders. On Platform Equinix, digital leaders can reach the most strategic global markets with the\nlargest ecosystem of digital partners, with infrastructure that assembles and deploys virtually in minutes. We enable\n7\nTable of Contents\ncompetitive advantage for our customers and partners by creating the foundational infrastructure capabilities that\npower worldwide businesses.

This shift is being accelerated by the increasing adoption of hybrid multicloud architectures\nand the adoption of artificial intelligence.\nHistorically, the outsourcing market was served by large telecommunications carriers that bundled their products\nand services with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include private and\nvendor-neutral MTDC providers, public and private cloud providers, managed infrastructure and application hosting\nproviders, and systems integrators. It is estimated that Equinix is one of more than 2,200 companies that provide\nMTDC offerings around the world. The global MTDC market is highly fragmented. Each of these data center\nsolutions providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings, outsourced IT\ninfrastructure solutions and managed services. We believe that this outsourcing trend has accelerated and is likely\nto continue to accelerate in the coming years, especially in light of the movement to digital business, the use of\nmultiple cloud service providers, and the adoption of artificial intelligence.\nEquinix is differentiated in this market by being able to offer customers a global platform that reaches over 30\ncountries and contains the industry’s largest and most active ecosystem of partners in our sites, including access to\na leading share of cloud on-ramps, and an increasingly diverse ecosystem of networks and cloud and IT service\nproviders. This ecosystem creates a “network effect,” which improves performance and lowers the cost for our\ncustomers, enabling them to become digital leaders, and is a significant source of competitive advantage for\nEquinix. Additionally, our digital solutions portfolio enables customers to bring together physical and programmable\ntechnologies like compute, storage, network and applications to build a foundation for their company's digital\noperations.\nCustomers\nOur customers include telecommunications carriers, mobile and other network services providers, cloud and IT\nservices providers, digital media and content providers, financial services companies, and global enterprise\necosystems in various industries. We provide each company access to a choice of business partners and solutions\nbased on their colocation, interconnection and managed IT service needs, and delivered 99.999%+ operational\nuptime across our global data centers in 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we had over 10,000 customers worldwide.\nNo one customer made up 10% or more of our total business revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n10\nTable of Contents\nThe following companies represent some of our leading customers and partners:\nWe serve our customers with a direct sales force and channel marketing program. We organize our sales force\nby customer type, as well as by establishing a sales presence in diverse geographic regions, which enables efficient\nservicing of the customer base from a network of regional offices. We also support our customers with a global\ncustomer care organization.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 13,151 employees worldwide with 5,953 based in the Americas, 4,267 based\nin EMEA and 2,931 based in Asia-Pacific. Of those employees, 5,617 employees were in engineering and\noperations, 2,089 employees were in sales and marketing and 5,445 employees were in management, finance and\nadministration. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 72% of our workforce identified as men, approximately\n27% identified as women and less than 1% declined to identify. Women's representation in leadership (defined as\nVP and above) increased year-over-year to 32%.\nAt Equinix, we strive to build a culture where every employee, every day, can say “I’m Safe, I Belong and I\nMatter” and where our workforce, at all levels, reflects and represents the communities in which we operate. Our\nobjective is to continue to make our culture a critical competitive advantage, engaging every leader and every\nemployee in the process. To ensure we are upholding our core corporate values and making progress towards our\naspirational goals, we monitor employee satisfaction through a quarterly pulse survey, which is one of our listening\nmechanisms. In 2023, employee satisfaction scores remained steady between 83-84 out of 100 each quarter,\nresulting in an average score of 83 for Equinix, six points higher than the benchmark score of the top 25th percentile\nof other companies. Managers use their quarterly pulse survey results to engage in dialogue with their teams about\nwhat is top of mind for our employees and how we can do better.\nAttracting, developing and retaining talent at all levels is vital to our continued success and we offer industry\ncompetitive compensation and benefits, along with development opportunities to help every employee achieve their\nfull potential. We continue to benefit from talent sourcing programs such as our global new-to-career programs as\nwell as pathways programs for veterans and women returning to the workforce. In 2023, we continued to enhance\nour portfolio of development programs for our employees and continued use of a system-enabled approach to goal\nsetting, development planning and performance assessment to support objectivity and accountability in our talent\nmanagement process. We offer development tools and opportunities to our employees such as online learning,\nmanager training, including on bias mitigation and cultural humility, professional coaching and 360-degree\nassessments for eligible employees as well as our leadership program specifically designed for high potential\nemployees at the Director level and above.\nWe believe in equitable pay and equitable opportunity at every level of the organization. Equinix remains\ncommitted to ensuring we have consistent practices in place to recognize, reward and promote all employees,\nregardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or other protected class. Equinix operates a rigorous governance\nframework to manage pay and other compensation elements to ensure that all reward decisions are made equitably\nand without discrimination or bias. All roles are mapped and graded to one consistent global organizational\nframework. Each grade has a specific pay range created by benchmarking against the external market in the\ncountry in which the role is located. This global framework is also used to determine target levels for annual\n11\nTable of Contents\nbonuses and long-term incentives. We strive to annually update our market data globally where information is\navailable.\nWe have continued to work towards integrating diversity, inclusion and belonging (\"DIB\") into every aspect of\nhow we run our business. In 2020, we embarked on a multi-year DIB strategy with governance through a DIB\nCouncil chaired by our CEO and CHRO, and in partnership with our Sustainability Program Office, that oversees\nour progress on ESG matters. Our DIB strategy focuses on attracting, developing and retaining a diverse, global\nworkforce; building leadership capability and accountability; and empowering our people to bring DIB to life. We\nhave built multiple pathways to reach new talent from diverse communities. In 2023, we continued to forge\npartnerships and invest in tools and systems to grow and support our inclusive hiring practices and launch inclusive\ntalent marketing efforts to reach a wider candidate pool more effectively. For example, in 2023 our Talent Acquisition\nTeam welcomed our first neurodiverse intern cohort in partnership with Disability:IN and our CEO signed a pledge\ncommitting to disability inclusion. The Global Military Pathways program continues to show success with military\ncandidates and hires across all regions and our Recruiting Pathways programs continue to focus on finding talent\nwith skills and experience gained from adjacent industries and experiences to enrich the diversity of thought and\nexperience on our teams. We have also embedded diversity and inclusive behavior competencies in our leadership\nprofiles and added coaching tools as well as manager training on leading inclusive teams to our development\nprogram.\nOur employee connection networks (\"EECNs\") are integral to our DIB strategy and play an important role in\ncreating belonging and advocating for the needs and goals of communities with common identities, cultures or\nbackgrounds. Each of our nine EECNs represents an identity/community that is marginalized or shares unique\nchallenges. Collaborating with one another, our EECNs work together to shape, support, and execute plans aligned\nwith our shared vision and values at Equinix. Some of our EECN leaders sit on Equinix EECN and DIB Councils\nwhere they represent their communities and share input based on their lived-experiences to influence discussions\nand decisions around business policies and strategies. In 2023, we strengthened our dedication to our EECN\nleaders by hosting an inaugural EECN Summit where leaders participated in panels with internal and external\nspeakers, resource fairs and strategy sessions. We also introduced a recognition program that provides\nacknowledgement, exposure, compensation and developmental opportunities to recognize EECN members who\nhave gone above-and-beyond in leading their respective EECNs. EECNs have continued to be a leading contributor\nto a positive work environment, employee satisfaction and overall organizational success. We also recognize that\ncreating the best workplace and culture we can requires a global effort with localized awareness and approaches. In\n2020, we launched WeAreEquinix employee teams empowered to create, localize and promote purpose, inclusion\nand belonging for their locations across the world. Through live and virtual events, campaigns, and collaboration\nwith the business and their local communities, these volunteer leaders create opportunities to engage in the\nfollowing areas: Wellbeing, Green and Sustainability, Community Impact, Fun and Creativity, DIB, and Employee\nNetworks. We currently have WeAreEquinix teams in 38 locations who are working on strengthening belonging and\ninclusion for our workforce.\nIn 2023, we hosted Days of Understanding events as part of an initiative of CEO ACT!ON, a pledge Equinix has\ntaken along with hundreds of other companies to embrace differences in our organizations, educate our people and\nbuild more inclusive cultures inside and outside of our workplaces. As part of this partnership, Equinix employees\nwho became CEO ACT!ON fellows focused on creating impactful solutions to systemic inequities and bridging the\ndigital divide by launching a pilot program designed to make reliable, affordable internet services available in\nunderserved communities in the states of Michigan, New York and Texas in the United States.\nLastly, Equinix was recognized for our leading social sustainability efforts in 2023 through the following awards:\n• 1st in industry and 17th overall by JUST Capital\n• Diversity & Inclusion Index by Alliance for Global Inclusion\n• Diversity Equity & Inclusion Silver Award by NAREIT\n• #3 in Fortune 500 in Religious Equity Diversity Inclusion Award\n• 100 out of 100 score for Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index\n• Best Places to Work for IT by Computerworld\nOur Community Impact program promotes connection and belonging, and enables employees to give back, with\nthe support of Equinix, to the communities in which we work and live. In 2023, employees volunteered 25,300\nservice hours and approximately $2 million was donated through employee giving, corporate matching funds and\n12\nTable of Contents\ngrants. In 2022, the Equinix Foundation was launched with a $50M contribution and a focus on the advancement of\ndigital inclusion—from access to technology and connectivity to the skills needed to thrive in today's digitally driven\nworld. In 2023, the Equinix Foundation celebrated its one-year anniversary and continues to make strides in co-\nfunding with partners and organizations dedicated in addressing the digital divide such as Big Hope and ClapTech.\nWe believe our commitment to the highest standards of honesty, integrity and ethical behavior differentiates our\nbusiness as much as our technology. We promote these high standards through a number of policies including the\nEquinix Code of Business Conduct. All employees are required to complete trainings on ethics and the company’s\nanti-bribery and corruption policies. In addition, we maintain a confidential ethics helpline where employees are\nencouraged to speak up if they have any questions or concerns that our code is being violated. We have a zero-\ntolerance, non-retaliation policy that protects our employees when they speak up.\nWe have continued a number of precautionary measures in line with our business continuity and pandemic\nplans to minimize the risk of operational impacts and to protect the health and safety of employees, customers,\npartners and our communities. As we look forward to the future of work, and more importantly amplifying Equinix’s\nvibrant culture, we are providing flexible, hybrid work opportunities in many roles, enhanced collaboration\ntechnologies for everyone, and activity-based workspaces at home or onsite. We recognize that the new normal will\nrequire changing behaviors. As such, we are providing learning opportunities and best practices to ensure our\nmeetings, events and work sessions are inclusive and equitable for virtual and in-person participation. Employee\nwell-being has been central to these efforts, driven globally through offerings such as health programs, ergonomic\nsupport, technology reimbursements, and wellness days.\nWe believe that all of these programs and initiatives support our human capital goals, align with our company\nculture, and increase employee satisfaction.\nSustainability\nAt Equinix, our Future First sustainability strategy rallies our people and partners to envision a better future and\nthen do what it takes to make it happen. As the world’s digital infrastructure leader, we have the responsibility to\nharness the power of technology to create a more accessible, equitable and sustainable future. The ESG initiatives\ncomprising our Future First strategy focus on the material issues that have the greatest impact on our stakeholders\nand our business. We continue to progress on our sustainability goals and look to build a business and world that\nreflects our purpose to bring the world together on our platform to create innovations that will enrich our work, life\nand planet. We document our ESG progress in our Annual Report and in our annual Corporate Sustainability Report\nlocated on our corporate website.\nIn 2021, we committed to becoming climate neutral across our global operations by 2030 and set a validated\nnear-term science-based target (“SBT”) for emissions reduction across our global operations and supply chain. Our\nclimate commitments are a critical step to ensure that we continue to advance investments and innovations to\nreduce greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions and keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius in alignment with the\nParis Climate Agreement.\nAs a part of our Future First sustainability strategy, we published an Environmental Sustainability and Global\nClimate Change Policy in 2021 to detail our approach and practices related to the environment, climate change,\n13\nTable of Contents\nresource efficiency and reporting. In alignment with our strategy and policy, we are also evaluating our material\nclimate change risks and opportunities based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related\nFinancial Disclosures (“TCFD”). In 2022, we undertook a qualitative and quantitative climate-related scenario\nanalysis across eight climate scenarios in line with TCFD recommendations. This included scenario analysis\nmodeling for the highest priority physical risks. We are continuing our work to embed climate change risk\nmanagement into our business where relevant.\nEnvironmental Performance\nOur energy usage, specifically electricity consumption, creates our largest environmental impact. Equinix was\nthe first data center company to commit to a long-term goal of 100% renewable energy coverage across our global\nportfolio. We use local renewable energy sources where possible, seek new or recently built renewable sources and\nadvocate for favorable renewable energy policies. In the U.S., we purchase nearly 2.6 million megawatt-hours\n(\"MWh\") of green power annually from a portfolio of renewable energy projects, utility green tariffs and Renewable\nEnergy Certificates (\"RECs\"), including 225 MW of wind power under long-term power purchase agreements\n(\"PPAs\") located in Texas and Oklahoma. As of December 2023, we executed 18 PPAs in Europe which will bring\n687 MW of new wind and solar capacity to Finland, France, Portugal, Spain and Sweden when the projects are\noperational in 2024, 2025 and 2026. In 2022, 96% of our global electricity consumption, and 100% of U.S. electricity\nconsumption, was covered by renewable energy sources.\nWe are committed to transparently measuring and reporting our global carbon footprint across direct (\"Scope\n1\"), indirect energy (\"Scope 2\") and indirect value chain (\"Scope 3\") emissions. Since 2019, we have achieved a\n23% absolute reduction in operational GHG emissions from a 2019 baseline year (Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-\nbased metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent (\"mtCO2e\")), even as the company increased its energy\nconsumption by 36% over the same time period. Equinix achieved an 'A' leadership score for climate action and\nannual disclosures within the 2023 CDP Climate Change Survey. CDP is a global non-governmental organization\ndedicated to helping investors and companies measure and manage their climate risks, recognized our\ncommitments, actions and progress on climate change.\nWe are leveraging technology and innovation to encourage commercialization of solutions that will enable the\n“Data Center of the Future”. To support our ongoing sustainability initiatives and commitment to innovation, since\n2020, we issued six traunches of green bonds approximating $4.9 billion. Our Green Finance Framework aligns our\nsustainability commitments with our long-term financing needs and highlights our pipeline of green projects and data\ncenter innovations. As of December 31, 2023, we had fully allocated the net proceeds from the approximate $4.9\nbillion in issued green bonds to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, ongoing and new projects in categories of\ngreen buildings, renewable energy and energy efficiency.\nWe are committed to advancing environmental progress across other areas of our operations. While we have\nhistorically focused our environmental impact via our energy consumption, to address the growing importance of\nwater within our operations, we launched a Sustainable Water Management Program in 2021. This program drove\nthe implementation of tools to aid in the tracking of water used to cool our data centers, helping create a baseline of\nour Water Usage Effectiveness (\"WUE\") to inform future actions. We consider the consumption of water in the\ndesign and operation of our facilities and are developing a coordinated global approach to water measurement and\nmanagement. Through our efforts to establish the European Climate-Neutral Data Centre Operator Pact in 2021,\nEquinix and the EU data center industry have also committed to advancing initiatives beyond renewable energy and\nenergy efficiency, including water efficiency, waste reduction, and circular economy principles.\nSustainability Accounting Standards Board (\"SASB\") Disclosures\nSASB published the Sustainability Accounting Standard for the Real Estate Industry (\"Real Estate Standard\") in\nOctober 2018. We have aligned our SASB disclosures with the Real Estate Standard to enhance corporate\ndisclosure around ESG performance. In our comprehensive disclosures in our annual Corporate Sustainability\nReport, we also document our progress against metrics as outlined in other frameworks such as the Global\nReporting Initiative (\"GRI\"), UN Sustainable Development Goals (\"SDGs\") and TCFD. The following tables detail our\nenergy metrics, aligned with the SASB Real Estate Standard. We intend to expand our reporting around the Real\nEstate Standard in the coming years.\nThe following metrics represent the performance of our colocation facilities in the calendar years specified.\nEnergy, renewable energy and GHG emissions are independently assured to ISO 14064-3:2019 Standards for the\n14\nTable of Contents\nquantification and reporting of GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3). Calendar year data for 2023 will become\navailable in Q2 2024 and will be published in our annual Corporate Sustainability Report located on our\nsustainability website.\nEnergy Management: Energy Consumption\nLike-for-Like\nLike-for-Like Change in\nChange in Energy\nConsumption\nTotal Energy Energy\nfrom Renewable\nConsumed Consumption Grid Energy\nSources of\nby Portfolio of Portfolio Electricity Consumption Renewable\nPortfolio Area\nEnergy Area with Area with Consumption from Energy as a Renewable\nwith Data\nConsumption Data Data as a % of Renewable % of Energy Energy as a %\nData as a % Coverage Coverage Energy Sources Consumption Coverage of Electricity\nYear of Floor Area (MWh) (1) (MWh) (2) Consumption (MWh) (3) (4) (MWh) (2) (3) Consumption\n2021(5)(6) 98.0% 7,130,000 23.3% 94.6% 6,689,000 94% 26.1% 95%\n2022(7)(8) 96.3% 7,820,000 29.1% 94.2% 6,995,000 90% 32.1% 91%\n(1) The scope of energy includes: energy used onsite (natural gas and diesel), energy procured (purchased electricity, electric power from\nfuel cells under power purchase agreements, and chilled water).\n(2) Like-for-like computed for stabilized asset list for the overlapping list of sites designated as stabilized in 2021 and 2022.\n(3) Excludes renewable energy inherently supplied by the standard utility grid mix. Equinix buys renewable energy for the entire electricity\nconsumption of sites including customer and overhead load. The instruments used include: RECs from PPAs, International RECs (\"I-\nRECs\"), Guarantees of Origin (\"GOOs\") and Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (\"REGOs\") from suppliers, green tariffs and\nbundled contracts.\n(4) Equinix's global renewable energy percentage reported for RE100 and CDP was 96%, which is comprised of 7,434 GWh of renewables\nout of 7,751 GWh of electric power consumption. The discrepancy in the totals arises from non-IBX data center sites' energy usage and\nnon-electric power energy consumption.\n(5) Recently constructed or acquired sites for which no utility data is available are excluded from the 2021 SASB metrics reporting boundary.\nThese include certain data centers in EMEA (FR9x) and APAC (OS2x, OS3, PE3) and Equinix's GPX (India) acquisition sites (MB1,\nMB2). Reseller sites are also excluded in both the gross floor area and the energy metrics (DA99, OS99, SH1).\n(6) 2021 portfolio coverage includes xScaleTM sites: LD11x, LD13x, PA8x, PA9x, SP5x, TY12x.\n(7) Recently constructed or acquired sites for which no utility data is available are excluded from the 2022 SASB metrics reporting boundary.\nThese include certain data centers in AMER (LM1, ST1, ST2, ST3, ST4) and EMEA (AB1, AC1, LG1, LG2, PA10). Reseller sites are also\nexcluded in the energy metrics (DA99, OS99, SH1).\n(8) 2022 portfolio coverage excludes xScaleTM sites: DB5x, SY9x.\nEnergy Management: Green Building Ratings\nOur environmental efforts aim to deliver meaningful and measurable progress against sustainability goals that\npositively impact our customers, partners, investors and employees. Our data centers are designed with high\noperational standards and energy efficiency in mind. Our data centers are planned holistically to incorporate the\nneeds of our communities and we aim to minimize the use of all resources in our operations. We evaluate cost-\nefficient opportunities to enhance energy efficiency and buy renewable energy for existing or acquired sites.\nWe are protecting our planet's resources by pioneering green data center innovations and building and\noperating energy-efficient data centers around the world. Our Energy Efficiency Center of Excellence is driving a\nglobal approach to improving global operational efficiency across our existing IBX locations from lighting and airflow\nmanagement to efficient cooling innovations. The program also engages customers to manage their\nimplementations more sustainably at our facilities, leading to overall improved site efficiencies.\nWe certify our data centers to numerous green buildings and energy management certifications and schemes.\nThese include USGBC LEED green buildings certifications, ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management Standard,\nISO 50001:2011 Energy Management Standard, BCA Green Mark, U.S. EPA Energy Star for Data Centers and\nothers. In 2021, Equinix became a U.S. Green Building Council (\"USGBC\") Gold member, aligning with the\ndeveloper of the LEED rating system and furthering our commitment to green buildings. To increase the scalability\nof certification within our portfolio, we developed a global LEED Scorecard that will help us ensure every new build\nis prioritizing the design and community guidelines developed by USGBC.\n15\nTable of Contents\nData centers receiving green building ratings in 2023 covered 811,000 gross sq. ft.

As of December 2023, eight sites received Energy\nStar for Data Centers recognition, representing 15% of our U.S. portfolio. In contrast, our U.S. portfolio has 19 LEED-certified data\ncenters or 42% of the U.S. portfolio by gross square footage.\nOur Business Segment Financial Information\nWe currently operate in three reportable segments comprised of our Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific\ngeographic regions. Information attributable to each of our reportable segments is set forth in Note 17 within the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nAvailable Information\nEquinix owns and maintains intellectual property in the form of trademarks, patents, application programming\ninterfaces, customer portals and a variety of products and other offerings.\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in June 1998. We are required to file reports under the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, as amended, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). The SEC maintains an internet\nwebsite at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information.\nYou may also obtain copies of our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our\ncurrent reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to such reports, free of charge by visiting the Investor Relations\npage on our website, www.equinix.com. These reports are available as soon as reasonably practical after we file\nthem with the SEC. Information contained on or accessible through our website is not part of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\n16\nTable of Contents\nITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this report, the following risk factors should be considered\ncarefully in evaluating our business:\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to the Macro Environment\nInflation in the global economy, increased interest rates, political dissension and adverse global economic\nconditions, like the ones we are currently experiencing, could negatively affect our business and financial\ncondition.\nInflation is impacting various aspects of our business. We are also experiencing an increase in our costs to\nprocure power and supply chain issues globally. Rising prices for materials related to our IBX data center\nconstruction and our data center offerings, energy and gas prices, as well as rising wages and benefits costs\nnegatively impact our business by increasing our operating costs. Further, disagreement in the U.S. Congress on\ngovernment spending levels could increase the possibility of a government shutdown, further adversely affecting\nglobal economic conditions. The adverse economic conditions we are currently experiencing may cause a decrease\nin sales as some customers may need to take cost cutting measures or scale back their operations. This could\nresult in churn in our customer base, reductions in revenues from our offerings, adverse effects to our days of sales\noutstanding in accounts receivable (\"DSO\"), longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and\nincreased price competition, which could adversely affect our liquidity. Customers and vendors filing for bankruptcy\ncould also lead to costly and time-intensive actions with adverse effects, including greater difficulty or delay in\naccounts receivable collection. The uncertain economic environment could also have an impact on our foreign\nexchange forward contracts if our counterparties' credit deteriorates or if they are otherwise unable to perform their\nobligations. Further, volatility in the financial markets and rising interest rates like we are currently experiencing\ncould affect our ability to access the capital markets at a time when we desire, or need, to do so which could have\nan impact on our flexibility to pursue additional expansion opportunities and maintain our desired level of revenue\ngrowth in the future.\nOur efforts to mitigate the risks associated with these adverse conditions may not be successful and our\nbusiness and growth could be adversely affected.\nOur business could be harmed by increased costs to procure power, prolonged power outages, shortages\nor capacity constraints as well as insufficient access to power.\nAny power outages, shortages, capacity constraints or significant increases in the cost of power may have an\nadverse effect on our business and our results of operations.\nIn each of our markets, we rely on third parties, third party infrastructure, governments, and global suppliers to\nprovide a sufficient amount of power to maintain our IBX data centers and meet the needs of our current and future\ncustomers. Any limitation on the delivered energy supply could limit our ability to operate our IBX data centers.\nThese limitations could have a negative impact on a given IBX data center(s) or limit our ability to grow our business\nwhich could negatively affect our financial performance and results of operations.\nEach new facility requires access to significant quantities of electricity. Limitations on generation, transmission\nand distribution may limit our ability to obtain sufficient power capacity for potential expansion sites in new or\nexisting markets. Utility companies may impose onerous operating conditions to any approval or provision of power\nor we may experience significant delays and substantial increased costs to provide the level of electrical service\nrequired by our current or future IBX data center designs. Our ability to find appropriate sites for expansion may also\nbe limited by access to power, especially as we design our data centers to the specifications of new and evolving\ntechnologies such as artificial intelligence which are more power-intensive.\nOur IBX data centers are affected by problems accessing electricity sources, such as planned or unplanned\npower outages and limitations on transmission or distribution of power. Unplanned power outages, including, but not\nlimited to those relating to large storms, earthquakes, fires, tsunamis, cyber-attacks, physical attacks on utility\n17\nTable of Contents\ninfrastructure, war, and any failures of electrical power grids more generally, and planned power outages by public\nutilities, such as Pacific Gas and Electric Company's practice of planned outages in California to minimize fire risks,\ncould harm our customers and our business. Employees working from home could be subjected to power outages\nat home which could be difficult to track and could affect the day-to-day operations of our non-IBX data center\nemployees. Our international operations are sometimes located outside of developed, reliable electricity markets,\nwhere we are exposed to some insecurity in supply associated with technical and regulatory problems, as well as\ntransmission constraints. Some of our IBX data centers are located in leased buildings where, depending upon the\nlease requirements and number of tenants involved, we may or may not control some or all of the infrastructure\nincluding generators and fuel tanks. As a result, in the event of a power outage, we could be dependent upon the\nlandlord, as well as the utility company, to restore the power. We attempt to limit our exposure to system downtime\nby using backup generators, which are in turn supported by onsite fuel storage and through contracts with fuel\nsuppliers, but these measures may not always prevent downtime or solve for long-term or large-scale outages. Any\noutage or supply disruption could adversely affect our business, customer experience and revenues.\nWe are currently experiencing inflation and volatility pressures in the energy market globally. Various\nmacroeconomic factors are contributing to the instability and global power shortage including the Russia and\nUkraine war, severe weather events, governmental regulations, government relations and inflation. While we have\naimed to minimize our risk, via hedging, conservation, and other efficiencies, we expect the cost for power to\ncontinue to be volatile and unpredictable and subject to inflationary pressures. We believe we have made\nappropriate estimates for these costs in our forecasting, but the current unpredictable energy market could\nmaterially affect our financial forecasting, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East could negatively affect\nour business and financial condition.\nThe war in Ukraine has led to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and\ncapital markets, an increase in cybersecurity incidents as well as supply chain disruptions.\nAdditionally, various of Russia’s actions have led to sanctions and other penalties being levied by the U.S., the\nEuropean Union, the United Kingdom, and other countries, as well as other public and private actors and\ncompanies, against Russia and certain other geographic areas, including agreement to remove certain Russian\nfinancial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication payment system and\nrestrictions on imports of Russian oil, liquified natural gas and coal. We do not have operations in Russia or Ukraine\nand historically we have had a limited number of Russian and Ukrainian customers, which we continue to screen\nagainst applicable sanctions lists per our standard processes. Although we continue to devote resources to this\nscreening effort, including the use of software solutions, the sanctions screening process remains partially manual,\nand the sanctions lists continue to evolve and vary by country. We continue to address necessary changes in global\nsanctions laws and modify our processes as necessary in light of these evolving laws. A material failure to comply\nwith global sanctions laws could have a negative effect on our reputation, business and financial condition.\nIn addition to compliance with applicable sanctions laws, we are currently limiting the ability of Russian\ncustomers to place orders for our offerings unless, after reviewing these orders, we believe they are aligned with our\nstated objectives in support of Ukraine. We do not allow purchases from Russian partners or suppliers and have\ncommitted to not make any direct or indirect investment in Russia absent an end to this conflict. In addition, for our\ncustomers located in Ukraine, we are currently providing offerings free of charge and may continue to do so in the\nfuture.\nThe associated disruptions in the oil and gas markets have caused, and could continue to cause, significant\nincreases in energy prices, which could have a material effect on our business. Additional potential sanctions and\npenalties have also been proposed and/or threatened. If Russia further reduces or turns off energy supplies to\nEurope, our EMEA operations could be adversely affected. Russian military actions and the resulting sanctions\ncould further affect the global economy and financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital\nmarkets, potentially making it more difficult for us to obtain additional debt or equity financing on attractive terms in\nthe future.\nIn the case of the Middle East conflict, the current situation is extremely volatile. It is possible that such events\nwill continue to adversely impact the level of economic activity globally and that we will face increased regulatory\nand legal complexities in the regions affected thus impacting our business and employees, our financial condition\n18\nTable of Contents\nand results of operations. Additionally, any sustained military action in the area of the Red Sea could contribute to\nsupply chain challenges.\nProlonged unfavorable economic conditions or uncertainty, including as a result of the military conflict between\nRussia and Ukraine or in the Middle East, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. Any of the foregoing may also magnify the impact of other risks described in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nWe experienced a cybersecurity incident in the past and may be vulnerable to future security breaches,\nwhich could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation\nand financial condition.\nDespite our efforts to protect against cyber-attacks, we are not fully insulated from such threats. For example, in\nSeptember 2020, we discovered ransomware on certain of our internal systems. While the incident was resolved\nand did not cause a material disruption to our systems nor result in any material costs to us, we expect we will\ncontinue to face risks associated with unauthorized access to our computer systems, loss or destruction of data,\ncomputer viruses, ransomware, malware, distributed denial-of-service attacks or other malicious activities. In the\ncourse of our business we utilize vendors and other partners who are also sources of cyber risks to us. In addition,\nour adaptation to a hybrid working model, that includes both work from home and in an office, could expose us to\nnew security risks.\nWe offer professional solutions to our customers where we consult on data center solutions and assist with\nimplementations. We also offer managed services in certain of our foreign jurisdictions outside of the U.S. where we\nmanage the data center infrastructure for our customers. The access to our clients' networks and data, which is\ngained from these solutions, creates some risk that our clients' networks or data could be improperly accessed. We\nmay also design our clients' cloud storage systems in such a way that exposes our clients to increased risk of data\nbreach. If we were held responsible for any such breach, it could result in a significant loss to us, including damage\nto our client relationships, harm to our brand and reputation, and legal liability.\nAs techniques used to breach security change frequently and are generally not recognized until launched\nagainst a target, we may not be able to promptly detect that a cyber breach has occurred, or implement security\nmeasures in a timely manner or, if and when implemented, we may not be able to determine the extent to which\nthese measures could be circumvented. Recent developments in the cyber threat landscape include use of artificial\nintelligence and machine learning, as well as an increased number of cyber extortion and ransomware attacks, with\nthe potential for higher financial ransom demand amounts and increasing sophistication and variety of ransomware\ntechniques and methodology. Further, any adoption of artificial intelligence by us or by third parties may pose new\nsecurity challenges. A party who is able to compromise the security measures on our networks or the security of our\ninfrastructure could misappropriate the proprietary or sensitive information of Equinix, our customers, including\ngovernment customers, or the personal information of our employees, or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our\noperations or our customers' operations. As we provide assurances to our customers that we provide a high level of\nsecurity, such a compromise could be particularly harmful to our brand and reputation. We also may be required to\nexpend significant capital and resources to protect against such threats or to alleviate problems caused by cyber\nbreaches in our physical or virtual security systems. Any breaches that may occur in the future could expose us to\nincreased risk of lawsuits, regulatory penalties, loss of existing or potential customers, damage relating to loss of\nproprietary information, harm to our reputation and increases in our security costs, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations. The cybersecurity regulatory landscape\ncontinues to evolve and compliance with the proposed reporting requirements could further complicate our ability to\nresolve cyber-attacks. We maintain insurance coverage for cyber risks, but such coverage may be unavailable or\ninsufficient to cover our losses.\nAny failure of our physical infrastructure or negative impact on our ability to meet our obligations to our\ncustomers, or damage to customer infrastructure within our IBX data centers, could lead to significant\ncosts and disruptions that could reduce our revenue and harm our business reputation and financial\ncondition.\nOur business depends on providing customers with highly reliable solutions. We must safeguard our customers'\ninfrastructure and equipment located in our IBX data centers and ensure our IBX data centers and non-IBX\n19\nTable of Contents\nbusiness operations remain operational at all times. We own certain of our IBX data centers, but others are leased\nby us, and we rely on the landlord for basic maintenance of our leased IBX data centers and office buildings and, in\nsome cases, the landlord is responsible for the infrastructure that runs the building such as power connections,\nUPSs and backup power generators. If such landlord has not maintained a leased property sufficiently, we may be\nforced into an early exit from the center which could be disruptive to our business. Furthermore, we continue to\nacquire IBX data centers not built by us. If we discover that these buildings and their infrastructure assets are not in\nthe condition we expected when they were acquired, we may be required to incur substantial additional costs to\nrepair or upgrade the IBX data centers. Newly acquired data centers also may not have the same power\ninfrastructure and design in place as our own IBX data centers. These legacy designs could require upgrades in\norder to meet our standards and our customers’ expectations. Until the legacy systems are brought up to our\nstandards, customers in these IBX data centers could be exposed to higher risks of unexpected power outages. We\nhave experienced power outages because of these legacy design issues in the past and we could experience these\nin the future.\nProblems at one or more of our IBX data centers or corporate offices, whether or not within our control, could\nresult in service interruptions or significant infrastructure or equipment damage. These could result from numerous\nfactors, including but not limited to:\n• human error;\n• equipment failure;\n• physical, electronic and cybersecurity breaches;\n• fire, earthquake, hurricane, flood, tornado and other natural disasters;\n• extreme temperatures;\n• water damage;\n• fiber cuts;\n• power loss;\n• terrorist acts;\n• sabotage and vandalism;\n• global pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n• inability of our operations employees to access our IBX data centers for any reason; and\n• failure of business partners who provide our resale products.\nWe have service level commitment obligations to certain customers. As a result, service interruptions or\nsignificant equipment damage in our IBX data centers could result in difficulty maintaining service level\ncommitments to these customers and potential claims related to such failures. Because our IBX data centers are\ncritical to many of our customers' businesses, service interruptions or significant equipment damage in our IBX data\ncenters could also result in lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to our customers. We cannot\nguarantee that a court would enforce any contractual limitations on our liability in the event that one of our\ncustomers brings a lawsuit against us as a result of a problem at one of our IBX data centers and we may decide to\nreach settlements with affected customers irrespective of any such contractual limitations. Any such settlement may\nresult in a reduction of revenue under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). In addition, any loss\nof service, equipment damage or inability to meet our service level commitment obligations could reduce the\nconfidence of our customers and could consequently impair our ability to obtain and retain customers, which would\nadversely affect both our ability to generate revenues and our results of operations.\nFurthermore, we are dependent upon internet service providers, telecommunications carriers and other website\noperators in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA regions and elsewhere, some of which have experienced\nsignificant system failures and electrical outages in the past. Our customers may in the future experience difficulties\ndue to system failures unrelated to our systems and offerings. If, for any reason, these providers fail to provide the\nrequired services, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely\nimpacted.\n20\nTable of Contents\nOur IBX data center employees are critical to our ability to maintain our business operations and reach our\nservice level commitments. Although we have redundancies built into our workforce, if our IBX employees are\nunable to access our IBX data centers for any reason, we could experience operational issues at the affected site.\nPandemics, weather and climate related crises or any other social, political, or economic disruption in the U.S. or\nabroad could prevent sufficient staffing at our IBX data centers and have a material adverse impact on our\noperations.\nWe are currently making significant investments in our back-office information technology systems and\nprocesses. Difficulties from or disruptions to these efforts may interrupt our normal operations and\nadversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have been investing heavily in our back-office information technology systems and processes for a number\nof years and expect such investment to continue for the foreseeable future in support of our pursuit of global,\nscalable solutions across all geographies and functions that we operate in. These continuing investments include: 1)\nongoing improvements to the customer experience from initial quote to customer billing and our revenue recognition\nprocess; 2) integration of recently acquired operations onto our various information technology systems; and 3)\nimplementation of new tools and technologies to either further streamline and automate processes, or to support our\ncompliance with evolving U.S. GAAP. Our finance team is also working on a multi-year project to move the\nbackbone of our finance systems to the cloud. As a result of our continued work on these projects, we may\nexperience difficulties with our systems, management distraction and significant business disruptions. For example,\ndifficulties with our systems may interrupt our ability to accept and deliver customer orders and may adversely\nimpact our overall financial operations, including our accounts payable, accounts receivables, general ledger, fixed\nassets, revenue recognition, close processes, internal financial controls and our ability to otherwise run and track\nour business. We may need to expend significant attention, time and resources to correct problems or find\nalternative sources for performing these functions. All of these changes to our financial systems also create an\nincreased risk of deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting until such systems are stabilized. Such\nsignificant investments in our back-office systems may take longer to complete and cost more than originally\nplanned. In addition, we may not realize the full benefits we hoped to achieve and there is a risk of an impairment\ncharge if we decide that portions of these projects will not ultimately benefit us or are de-scoped. Finally, the\ncollective impact of these changes to our business has placed significant demands on impacted employees across\nmultiple functions, increasing the risk of errors and control deficiencies in our financial statements, distraction from\nthe effective operation of our business and difficulty in attracting and retaining employees. Any such difficulties or\ndisruptions may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe level of insurance coverage that we purchase may prove to be inadequate.\nWe carry liability, property, business interruption and other insurance policies to cover insurable risks to our\ncompany. We select the types of insurance, the limits and the deductibles based on our specific risk profile, the cost\nof the insurance coverage versus its perceived benefit and general industry standards. Our insurance policies\ncontain industry standard exclusions for events such as war and nuclear reaction. We purchase earthquake\ninsurance for certain of our IBX data centers, but for our IBX data centers in high-risk zones, including those in\nCalifornia and Japan, we have elected to self-insure. The earthquake and flood insurance that we do purchase\nwould be subject to high deductibles. Any of the limits of insurance that we purchase, including those for flood or\ncyber risks, could prove to be inadequate, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to implement our evolving organizational structure, or if we are unable to recruit or retain\nkey executives and qualified personnel, our business could be harmed.\nIn connection with the evolving needs of our customers and our business, we continue to review our\norganizational architecture and have made, and will continue to make, changes as appropriate. We must also\ncontinue to identify, hire, train and retain key personnel who maintain relationships with our customers and who can\nprovide the technical, strategic and marketing skills required for our company's growth. There is a shortage of\nqualified personnel in these fields, and we compete with other companies for the limited pool of talent.\nThe failure to recruit and retain necessary key executives and personnel could cause disruption, harm our\nbusiness and hamper our ability to grow our company.\n21\nTable of Contents\nThe failure to obtain favorable terms when we renew our IBX data center leases, or the failure to renew such\nleases, could harm our business and results of operations.\nWhile we own certain of our IBX data centers, others are leased under long-term arrangements. These leased\nIBX data centers have all been subject to significant development by us in order to convert them from, in most\ncases, vacant buildings or warehouses into IBX data centers. Most of our IBX data center leases have renewal\noptions available to us. However, many of these renewal options provide for the rent to be set at then-prevailing\nmarket rates. To the extent that then-prevailing market rates or negotiated rates are higher than present rates, these\nhigher costs may adversely impact our business and results of operations, or we may decide against renewing the\nlease. There may also be changes in shared operating costs in connection with our leases, which are commonly\nreferred to as common area maintenance expenses. In the event that an IBX data center lease does not have a\nrenewal option, or we fail to exercise a renewal option in a timely fashion and lose our right to renew the lease, we\nmay not be successful in negotiating a renewal of the lease with the landlord. A failure to renew a lease or\ntermination by a landlord of any lease could force us to exit a building prematurely, which could disrupt our\nbusiness, harm our customer relationships, impact and harm our joint venture relationships, expose us to liability\nunder our customer contracts or joint venture agreements, cause us to take impairment charges and affect our\nresults of operations negatively.\nWe depend on a number of third parties to provide internet connectivity to our IBX data centers; if\nconnectivity is interrupted or terminated, our results of operations and cash flow could be materially and\nadversely affected.\nThe presence of diverse telecommunications carriers' fiber networks in our IBX data centers is critical to our\nability to retain and attract new customers. We are not a telecommunications carrier, and as such, we rely on third\nparties to provide our customers with carrier services. We believe that the availability of carrier capacity will directly\naffect our ability to achieve our projected results. We rely primarily on revenue opportunities from the\ntelecommunications carriers' customers to encourage them to invest the capital and operating resources required to\nconnect from their data centers to our IBX data centers. Carriers will likely evaluate the revenue opportunity of an\nIBX data center based on the assumption that the environment will be highly competitive. We cannot provide\nassurance that each and every carrier will elect to offer its services within our IBX data centers or that once a carrier\nhas decided to provide internet connectivity to our IBX data centers that it will continue to do so for any period of\ntime.\nOur new IBX data centers require construction and operation of a sophisticated redundant fiber network. The\nconstruction required to connect multiple carrier facilities to our IBX data centers is complex and involves factors\noutside of our control, including regulatory processes and the availability of construction resources. Any hardware or\nfiber failures on this network may result in significant loss of connectivity to our new IBX data center expansions.\nThis could affect our ability to attract new customers to these IBX data centers or retain existing customers.\nTo date, the network neutrality of our IBX data centers and the variety of networks available to our customers\nhas often been a competitive advantage for us. In certain of our markets, the limited number of carriers available\nreduces that advantage. As a result, we may need to adapt our key revenue-generating offerings and pricing to be\ncompetitive in those markets.\nIf the establishment of highly diverse internet connectivity to our IBX data centers does not occur, is materially\ndelayed or is discontinued, or is subject to failure, our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely\naffected.\nThe use of high-power density equipment may limit our ability to fully utilize our older IBX data centers.\nServer technologies continue to evolve and in some instances these changes can result in customers\nincreasing their use of high-power density equipment in our IBX data centers which can increase the demand for\npower on a per cabinet basis. Additionally, the workloads related to new and evolving technologies such as artificial\nintelligence will increase the demand for high density computing power. Because many of our IBX data centers were\nbuilt a number of years ago, the current demand for power may exceed the designed electrical capacity in these IBX\ndata centers. As power, not space, is a limiting factor in many of our IBX data centers, our ability to fully utilize those\nIBX data centers may be impacted. The ability to increase the power capacity of an IBX data center, should we\ndecide to, is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the local utility's ability to provide additional\n22\nTable of Contents\npower; the length of time required to provide such power; and/or whether it is feasible to upgrade the electrical and\nmechanical infrastructure of an IBX data center to deliver additional power and cooling to customers. Although we\nare currently designing and building to a higher power specification than that of many of our older IBX data centers,\nand are considering redevelopment of certain sites where appropriate, there is a risk that demand could continue to\nincrease, or our redevelopment may not be successful, and our IBX data centers could become underutilized\nsooner than expected.\nRisks Related to our Offerings and Customers\nOur offerings have a long sales cycle that may harm our revenue and results of operations.\nA customer's decision to purchase our offerings typically involves a significant commitment of resources. In\naddition, some customers will be reluctant to commit to locating in our IBX data centers until they are confident that\nthe IBX data center has adequate carrier connections. As a result, we have a long sales cycle. Furthermore, we\nmay devote significant time and resources to pursuing a particular sale or customer that does not result in revenues.\nInstability in the markets and the current macroeconomic environment could also increase delays in our sales\ncycle. Delays due to the length of our sales cycle may materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of\noperations, which could harm our ability to meet our forecasts and cause volatility in our stock price.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nThe global multi-tenant data center market is highly fragmented. It is estimated that we are one of more than\n2,200 companies that provide these offerings around the world. We compete with these firms which vary in terms of\ntheir data center offerings and the geographies in which they operate. We must continue to evolve our product\nstrategy and be able to differentiate our IBX data centers and product offerings from those of our competitors.\nSome of our competitors may adopt aggressive pricing policies, especially if they are not highly leveraged or\nhave lower return thresholds than we do. As a result, we may suffer from pricing pressure that would adversely\naffect our ability to generate revenues. Some of these competitors may also provide our target customers with\nadditional benefits, including bundled communication services or cloud services, and may do so in a manner that is\nmore attractive to our potential customers than obtaining space in our IBX data centers. Similarly, with growing\nacceptance of cloud-based technologies, we are at risk of losing customers that may decide to fully leverage cloud\ninfrastructure offerings instead of managing their own. Competitors could also operate more successfully or form\nalliances to acquire significant market share. Regional competitors may also consolidate to become a global\ncompetitor. Consolidation of our customers and/or our competitors may present a risk to our business model and\nhave a negative impact on our revenues.\nFailure to compete successfully may materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of\noperations.\nIf we cannot continue to develop, acquire, market and provide new offerings or enhancements to existing\nofferings that meet customer requirements and differentiate us from our competitors, our results of\noperations could suffer.\nAs our customers evolve their IT strategies, we must remain flexible and evolve along with new technologies\nand industry and market shifts. The process of developing and acquiring new offerings and enhancing existing\nofferings is complex. If we fail to anticipate customers’ evolving needs and expectations or do not adapt to\ntechnological and IT trends, our results of operations could suffer. Ineffective planning and execution in our cloud,\nartificial intelligence and product development strategies may cause difficulty in sustaining our competitive\nadvantages. Additionally, any delay in the development, acquisition, marketing or launch of a new offering could\nresult in customer dissatisfaction or attrition. If we cannot continue adapting our products, or if our competitors can\nadapt their products more quickly than us, our business could be harmed.\nIn order to adapt effectively, we sometimes must make long-term investments, develop, acquire or obtain\ncertain intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately\nreflect customer demand for the new offerings.\n23\nTable of Contents\nWe are currently making significant investments of resources in expanding our digital services portfolio. In 2020,\nwe acquired Packet Host, Inc. (\"Packet\"), a bare metal automation company to facilitate a new “as-a-service”\nproduct offering for us. “As-a-service” solutions are a relatively new market area for us which can bring challenges\nand could harm our business if not executed in the time or manner that we expect. These solutions may also require\nadditional capital, may have lower margins and customers can more easily churn as compared to our data center\nofferings, thus adversely impacting our results. These offerings also introduce us to different competition and faster\ndevelopment cycles as compared to our data center business. If we cannot develop or partner to quickly and\nefficiently meet market demands, we may also see adverse results. We expect to continue to consider other new\nproduct offerings for our customers, including multi-cloud networking and cloud-adjacent storage. While we believe\nthese product offering and others we may implement in the future will be desirable to our customers and will\ncomplement our other offerings on Platform Equinix, we cannot guarantee the success of this product or any other\nnew product offering.\nWe have also invested in joint ventures in order to develop capacity to serve the large footprint needs of a\ntargeted set of hyperscale customers by leveraging existing capacity and dedicated hyperscale builds. We believe\nthese hyperscale customers will also play a large role in the growth of the market for artificial intelligence. We have\nannounced our intention to seek additional joint ventures for certain of our hyperscale builds. There can be no\nassurances that our joint ventures will be successful or that we find appropriate partners, or that we will be able to\nsuccessfully meet the needs of these customers through our hyperscale offerings.\nFailure to successfully execute on our product strategy or hyperscale strategy could materially adversely affect\nour financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe have government customers, which subjects us to risks including early termination, audits,\ninvestigations, sanctions and penalties.\nWe derive revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, state and local governments and foreign\ngovernments. Some of these customers may terminate all or part of their contracts at any time, without cause.\nThere is increased pressure for governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, to reduce\nspending. Some of our federal government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations being made by\nthe U.S. Congress to fund the expenditures under these contracts. Similarly, some of our contracts at the state and\nlocal levels are subject to government funding authorizations.\nGovernment contracts often have unique terms and conditions, such as most favored customer obligations, and\nare generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and\nadministrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits,\nsuspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business.\nBecause we depend on the development and growth of a balanced customer base, including key magnet\ncustomers, failure to attract, grow and retain this base of customers could harm our business and results of\noperations.\nOur ability to maximize revenues depends on our ability to develop and grow a balanced customer base,\nconsisting of a variety of companies, including enterprises, cloud, digital content and financial companies, and\nnetwork service providers. We consider certain of these customers to be key magnets in that they draw in other\ncustomers. The more balanced the customer base within each IBX data center, the better we will be able to\ngenerate significant interconnection revenues, which in turn increases our overall revenues. Our ability to attract\ncustomers to our IBX data centers will depend on a variety of factors, including the presence of multiple carriers, the\nmix of our offerings, the overall mix of customers, the presence of key customers attracting business through\nvertical market ecosystems, the IBX data center's operating reliability and security and our ability to effectively\nmarket our offerings. However, some of our customers may face competitive pressures and may ultimately not be\nsuccessful or may be consolidated through merger or acquisition. If these customers do not continue to use our IBX\ndata centers it may be disruptive to our business. If customers combine businesses, they may require less\ncolocation space, which could lead to churn in our customer base. Finally, any uncertain global economic climate,\nincluding the one we are currently experiencing, could harm our ability to attract and retain customers if customers\nslow spending, or delay decision-making on our offerings, or if customers begin to have difficulty paying us or seek\nbankruptcy protection and we experience increased churn in our customer base. Any of these factors may hinder\n24\nTable of Contents\nthe development, growth and retention of a balanced customer base and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Financial Results\nOur results of operations may fluctuate.\nWe have experienced fluctuations in our results of operations on a quarterly and annual basis. The fluctuations\nin our results of operations may cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile. We may experience\nsignificant fluctuations in our results of operations in the foreseeable future due to a variety of factors, many of\nwhich are listed in this Risk Factors section. Additional factors could include, but are not limited to:\n• the timing and magnitude of depreciation and interest expense or other expenses related to the acquisition,\npurchase or construction of additional IBX data centers or the upgrade of existing IBX data centers;\n• demand for space, power and solutions at our IBX data centers;\n• the availability of power and the associated cost of procuring the power;\n• changes in general economic conditions, such as those stemming from pandemics or other economic\ndownturns, or specific market conditions in the telecommunications and internet industries, any of which\ncould have a material impact on us or on our customer base;\n• additions and changes in product offerings and our ability to ramp up and integrate new products within the\ntime period we have forecasted;\n• restructuring charges or reversals of restructuring charges, which may be necessary due to revised\nsublease assumptions, changes in strategy or otherwise;\n• the financial condition and credit risk of our customers;\n• the provision of customer discounts and credits;\n• the mix of current and proposed products and offerings and the gross margins associated with our products\nand offerings;\n• increasing repair and maintenance expenses in connection with aging IBX data centers;\n• lack of available capacity in our existing IBX data centers to generate new revenue or delays in opening\nnew or acquired IBX data centers that delay our ability to generate new revenue in markets which have\notherwise reached capacity;\n• changes in employee stock-based compensation;\n• changes in our tax planning strategies or failure to realize anticipated benefits from such strategies;\n• changes in income tax benefit or expense; and\n• changes in or new GAAP as periodically released by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\").\nAny of the foregoing factors, or other factors discussed elsewhere in this report, could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we have experienced growth in\nrevenues in recent quarters, this growth rate is not necessarily indicative of future results of operations. It is possible\nthat we may not be able to generate net income on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. In addition, a relatively\nlarge portion of our expenses are fixed in the short-term, particularly with respect to lease and personnel expenses,\ndepreciation and amortization and interest expenses. Therefore, our results of operations are particularly sensitive\nto fluctuations in revenues. As such, comparisons to prior reporting periods should not be relied upon as indications\nof our future performance. In addition, our results of operations in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the\nexpectations of securities analysts or investors.\nWe may incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, or impairment charges to our\nproperty, plant and equipment, which could result in a significant reduction to our earnings.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually, or\nmore frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment, such as changing\nmarket conditions or any changes in key assumptions. If the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be\nrecoverable, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value\n25\nTable of Contents\nof the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the\nperiod the determination is made.\nWe also periodically monitor the remaining net book values of our property, plant and equipment, including at\nthe individual IBX data center level. Although each individual IBX data center is currently performing in accordance\nwith our expectations, the possibility that one or more IBX data centers could begin to under-perform relative to our\nexpectations is possible and may also result in non-cash impairment charges.\nThese charges could be significant, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations or financial condition.\nWe have incurred substantial losses in the past and may incur additional losses in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our retained earnings were $3.9 billion. We are currently investing heavily in our\nfuture growth through the build out of multiple additional IBX data centers, expansions of IBX data centers and\nacquisitions of complementary businesses. As a result, we will incur higher depreciation and other operating\nexpenses, as well as transaction costs and interest expense, that may negatively impact our ability to sustain\nprofitability in future periods unless and until these new IBX data centers generate enough revenue to exceed their\noperating costs and cover the additional overhead needed to scale our business for this anticipated growth. The\ncurrent global financial uncertainty may also impact our ability to sustain profitability if we cannot generate sufficient\nrevenue to offset the increased costs of our recently opened IBX data centers or IBX data centers currently under\nconstruction. In addition, costs associated with the acquisition and integration of any acquired companies, as well as\nthe additional interest expense associated with debt financing, we have undertaken to fund our growth initiatives,\nmay also negatively impact our ability to sustain profitability. Finally, given the competitive and evolving nature of the\nindustry in which we operate, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nRisks Related to Our Expansion Plans\nOur construction of new IBX data centers, IBX data center expansions or IBX data center redevelopment\ncould involve significant risks to our business.\nIn order to sustain our growth in certain of our existing and new markets, we may have to expand an existing\ndata center, lease a new facility or acquire suitable land, with or without structures, to build new IBX data centers\nfrom the ground up. Expansions or new builds are currently underway, or being contemplated, in new and existing\nmarkets. These construction projects expose us to many risks which could have an adverse effect on our results of\noperations and financial condition. The current global supply chain and inflation issues have exacerbated many of\nthese construction risks and created additional risks for our business. Some of the risks associated with\nconstruction projects include:\n• construction delays;\n• power and power grid constraints;\n• lack of availability and delays for data center equipment, including items such as generators and\nswitchgear;\n• unexpected budget changes;\n• increased prices for and delays in obtaining building supplies, raw materials and data center equipment;\n• labor availability, labor disputes and work stoppages with contractors, subcontractors and other third parties;\n• unanticipated environmental issues and geological problems;\n• delays related to permitting and approvals to open from public agencies and utility companies;\n• unexpected lack of power access;\n• delays in site readiness leading to our failure to meet commitments made to customers planning to expand\ninto a new build; and\n• unanticipated customer requirements that would necessitate alternative data center design, making our\nsites less desirable or leading to increased costs in order to make necessary modifications or retrofits.\nWe are currently experiencing rising construction costs which reflect the increase in cost of labor and raw\nmaterials, supply chain and logistic challenges, and high demand in our sector. While we have invested in creating a\nreserve of materials to mitigate supply chain issues and inflation, it may not be sufficient and ongoing delays,\n26\nTable of Contents\ndifficulty finding replacement products and continued high inflation could affect our business and growth and could\nhave a material effect on our business. Additional or unexpected disruptions to our supply chain, including in the\nevent of any sustained regional escalation of the current conflict in the Middle East in the area around the Red Sea\nor more broadly, or inflationary pressures could significantly affect the cost of our planned expansion projects and\ninterfere with our ability to meet commitments to customers who have contracted for space in new IBX data centers\nunder construction.\nConstruction projects are dependent on permitting from public agencies and utility companies. Any delay in\npermitting could affect our growth. We are currently experiencing permitting delays in most metros due to reduced\nproduction from labor availability. While we don't currently anticipate any material long-term negative impact to our\nbusiness because of these construction delays, these types of delays and stoppages related to permitting from\npublic agencies and utility companies could worsen and have an adverse effect on our bookings, revenue or growth.\nAdditionally, all construction related projects require us to carefully select and rely on the experience of one or\nmore designers, general contractors, and associated subcontractors during the design and construction process.\nShould a designer, general contractor, significant subcontractor or key supplier experience financial problems or\nother problems during the design or construction process, we could experience significant delays, increased costs\nto complete the project and/or other negative impacts to our expected returns.\nSite selection is also a critical factor in our expansion plans. There may not be suitable properties available in\nour markets with the necessary combination of high-power capacity and fiber connectivity, or selection may be\nlimited. We expect that we will continue to experience limited availability of power and grid constraints in many\nmarkets as well as shortages of associated equipment because of the current high demands and finite nature of\nthese resources. These shortages could result in site selection challenges, construction delays or increased costs.\nThus, while we may prefer to locate new IBX data centers adjacent to our existing locations, it may not always be\npossible. In the event we decide to build new IBX data centers separate from our existing IBX data centers, we may\nprovide metro connect solutions to connect these two IBX data centers. Should these solutions not provide the\nnecessary reliability to sustain connection, or if they do not meet the needs of our customers, this could result in\nlower interconnection revenue and lower margins and could have a negative impact on customer retention over\ntime.\nAcquisitions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial or strategic goals that were\ncontemplated at the time of any transaction.\nOver the last several years, we have completed numerous acquisitions, including most recently that of five data\ncenters in Peru and Chile from Entel in 2022, MainOne in West Africa in 2022, and GPX Global Systems, Inc.'s\nIndia operations in 2021. We expect to make additional acquisitions in the future, which may include (i) acquisitions\nof businesses, products, solutions or technologies that we believe to be complementary, (ii) acquisitions of new IBX\ndata centers or real estate for development of new IBX data centers; (iii) acquisitions through investments in local\ndata center operators; or (iv) acquisitions in new markets with higher risk profiles. We may pay for future\nacquisitions by using our existing cash resources (which may limit other potential uses of our cash), incurring\nadditional debt (which may increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements) and/or issuing\nshares (which may dilute our existing stockholders and have a negative effect on our earnings per share).\nAcquisitions expose us to potential risks, including:\n• the possible disruption of our ongoing business and diversion of management's attention by acquisition,\ntransition and integration activities, particularly when multiple acquisitions and integrations are occurring at\nthe same time or when we are entering an emerging market with a higher risk profile;\n• our potential inability to successfully pursue or realize some or all of the anticipated revenue opportunities\nassociated with an acquisition or investment;\n• the possibility that we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, or businesses in\nwhich we invest, or achieve anticipated operating efficiencies or cost savings;\n• the possibility that announced acquisitions may not be completed, due to failure to satisfy the conditions to\nclosing as a result of:\n• an injunction, law or order that makes unlawful the consummation of the acquisition;\n• inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties of, or the non-compliance with covenants\nby, either party;\n27\nTable of Contents\n• the nonreceipt of closing documents; or\n• for other reasons;\n• the possibility that there could be a delay in the completion of an acquisition, which could, among other\nthings, result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other adverse effects resulting from such\nuncertainty;\n• the possibility that our projections about the success of an acquisition could be inaccurate and any such\ninaccuracies could have a material adverse effect on our financial projections;\n• the dilution of our existing stockholders as a result of our issuing stock as consideration in a transaction or\nselling stock in order to fund the transaction;\n• the possibility of customer dissatisfaction if we are unable to achieve levels of quality and stability on par\nwith past practices;\n• the possibility that we will be unable to retain relationships with key customers, landlords and/or suppliers of\nthe acquired businesses, some of which may terminate their contracts with the acquired business as a\nresult of the acquisition or which may attempt to negotiate changes in their current or future business\nrelationships with us;\n• the possibility that we could lose key employees from the acquired businesses;\n• the possibility that we may be unable to integrate certain IT systems that do not meet Equinix's standard\nrequirements with respect to security, privacy or any other standard;\n• the potential deterioration in our ability to access credit markets due to increased leverage;\n• the possibility that our customers may not accept either the existing equipment infrastructure or the \"look-\nand-feel\" of a new or different IBX data center;\n• the possibility that additional capital expenditures may be required or that transaction expenses associated\nwith acquisitions may be higher than anticipated;\n• the possibility that required financing to fund an acquisition may not be available on acceptable terms or at\nall;\n• the possibility that we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under\nantitrust and competition laws on a timely basis or at all, which could, among other things, delay or prevent\nus from completing an acquisition, limit our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic benefits of an\nacquisition or have other adverse effects on our current business and operations;\n• the possible loss or reduction in value of acquired businesses;\n• the possibility that future acquisitions may present new complexities in deal structure, related complex\naccounting and coordination with new partners, particularly in light of our desire to maintain our qualification\nfor taxation as a REIT;\n• the possibility that we may not be able to prepare and issue our financial statements and other public filings\nin a timely and accurate manner, and/or maintain an effective control environment, due to the strain on the\nfinance organization when multiple acquisitions and integrations are occurring at the same time;\n• the possibility that future acquisitions may trigger property tax reassessments resulting in a substantial\nincrease to our property taxes beyond that which we anticipated;\n• the possibility that future acquisitions may be in geographies and regulatory environments to which we are\nunaccustomed and we may become subject to complex requirements and risks with which we have limited\nexperience;\n• the possibility that future acquisitions may appear less attractive due to fluctuations in foreign currency\nrates;\n• the possibility that carriers may find it cost-prohibitive or impractical to bring fiber and networks into a new\nIBX data center;\n• the possibility of litigation or other claims in connection with, or as a result of, an acquisition, or inherited\nfrom the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or\nother third parties;\n28\nTable of Contents\n• the possibility that asset divestments may be required in order to obtain regulatory clearance for a\ntransaction;\n• the possibility of pre-existing undisclosed liabilities, including, but not limited to, lease or landlord related\nliability, tax liability, environmental liability or asbestos liability, for which insurance coverage may be\ninsufficient or unavailable, or other issues not discovered in the diligence process;\n• the possibility that we receive limited or incorrect information about the acquired business in the diligence\nprocess; and\n• the possibility that we do not have full visibility into customer agreements and customer termination rights\nduring the diligence process which could expose us to additional liabilities after completing the acquisition.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, financial condition or cash flows. If an acquisition does not proceed or is materially delayed for any\nreason, the price of our common stock may be adversely impacted, and we will not recognize the anticipated\nbenefits of the acquisition.\nWe cannot assure that the price of any future acquisitions of IBX data centers or businesses will be similar to\nprior IBX data center acquisitions and businesses. In fact, we expect costs required to build or render new IBX data\ncenters operational to increase in the future. If our revenue does not keep pace with these potential acquisition and\nexpansion costs, we may not be able to maintain our current or expected margins as we absorb these additional\nexpenses. There is no assurance we would successfully overcome these risks, or any other problems encountered\nwith these acquisitions.\nThe anticipated benefits of our joint ventures may not be fully realized, or take longer to realize than\nexpected.\nWe have entered into joint ventures to develop and operate data centers (the “Joint Ventures”). Certain sites\nthat are intended to be utilized in Joint Ventures require investment for development. The success of these Joint\nVentures will also depend, in part, on the successful development of the data center sites, and we may not realize\nall of the anticipated benefits. Such development may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected and\ncould result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time\nand energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if\nit is determined these sites are no longer desirable for the Joint Ventures, we would need to adapt such sites for\nother purposes.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from our Joint Ventures. The success of these Joint Ventures\nwill depend, in part, on the successful partnership between Equinix and our Joint Venture partners. Such a\npartnership is subject to risks as outlined below in our risk factor related to Joint Ventures, and more generally, to\nthe same types of business risks as would impact our IBX data center business. A failure to successfully partner, or\na failure to realize our expectations for the Joint Ventures, including any contemplated exit strategy from a Joint\nVenture, could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. These Joint Ventures\ncould also be negatively impacted by inflation, supply chain issues, an inability to obtain financing on favorable\nterms or at all, an inability to fill the xScale sites with customers as planned, and development and construction\ndelays, including those we are currently experiencing in many markets globally.\nJoint venture investments could expose us to risks and liabilities in connection with the formation of the\nnew joint ventures, the operation of such joint ventures without sole decision-making authority, and our\nreliance on joint venture partners who may have economic and business interests that are inconsistent with\nour business interests.\nIn addition to our current and proposed Joint Ventures, we may co-invest with other third parties through\npartnerships, joint ventures or other entities in the future. These joint ventures could result in our acquisition of non-\ncontrolling interests in, or shared responsibility for, managing the affairs of a property or portfolio of properties,\npartnership, joint venture or other entity. We may be subject to additional risks, including:\n• we may not have the right to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the properties, partnership,\njoint venture or other entity;\n29\nTable of Contents\n• if our partners become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, we may choose\nto or be required to contribute such capital;\n• our partners may have economic, tax or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our\nbusiness interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives;\n• our joint venture partners may take actions that are not within our control, which could require us to dispose\nof the joint venture asset, transfer it to a taxable REIT subsidiary (\"TRS\") in order to maintain our\nqualification for taxation as a REIT, or purchase the partner's interests or assets at an above-market price;\n• our joint venture partners may take actions unrelated to our business agreement but which reflect poorly on\nus because of our joint venture relationship;\n• disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses\nand prevent our management from focusing their time and effort on our day-to-day business;\n• we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party partners or guarantee all or a\nportion of the joint venture's liabilities, which may require us to pay an amount greater than its investment in\nthe joint venture;\n• we may need to change the structure of an established joint venture or create new complex structures to\nmeet our business needs or the needs of our partners which could prove challenging; and\n• a joint venture partner's decision to exit the joint venture may not be at an opportune time for us or in our\nbusiness interests.\nEach of these factors may result in returns on these investments being less than we expect or in losses, and our\nfinancial and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we cannot effectively manage our international operations and successfully implement our international\nexpansion plans, our business and results of operations would be adversely impacted.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized approximately 63%, 61% and 61%,\nrespectively, of our revenues outside the U.S. We currently operate outside of the U.S. in Canada, Mexico, South\nAmerica, the Asia-Pacific region and, the EMEA region.\nIn addition, we are currently undergoing expansions or evaluating expansion opportunities outside of the U.S.\nUndertaking and managing expansions in foreign jurisdictions may present unanticipated challenges to us.\nOur international operations are generally subject to a number of additional risks, including:\n• the costs of customizing IBX data centers for foreign countries;\n• protectionist laws and business practices favoring local competition;\n• greater difficulty or delay in accounts receivable collection;\n• difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including negotiating with foreign labor unions or\nworkers' councils;\n• difficulties in managing across cultures and in foreign languages;\n• political and economic instability;\n• fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n• difficulties in repatriating funds from certain countries;\n• our ability to obtain, transfer or maintain licenses required by governmental entities with respect to our\nbusiness;\n• unexpected changes in regulatory, tax and political environments;\n• difficulties in procuring power;\n• trade wars;\n• changes in the government and public administration in emerging markets that may impact the stability of\nforeign investment policies;\n• our ability to secure and maintain the necessary physical and telecommunications infrastructure;\n• compliance with anti-bribery and corruption laws;\n30\nTable of Contents\n• compliance with economic and trade sanctions enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S.\nDepartment of Treasury, the Bureau of Industry and Security of the US Department of Commerce and other\nenforcement agencies in other jurisdictions around the world including those related to the Russian and\nUkrainian war;\n• compliance with changing laws, policies and requirements related to sustainability;\n• increasing scrutiny on the operational resilience of data centers, especially in countries where data centers\nare designated as critical national infrastructure and/or essential ICT service providers;\n• increasing resistance to data center presence and expansion by local communities;\n• compliance with evolving cybersecurity laws including reporting requirements; and\n• compliance with evolving governmental regulation.\nFurther, if we cannot effectively manage the challenges associated with our international operations and\nexpansion plans, we could experience a delay in our expansion projects or a failure to grow. Expansion challenges\nand international operations failures could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our business and\nresults of operations. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and address these risks and manage\nthese difficulties.\nWe continue to invest in our expansion efforts, but may not have sufficient customer demand in the\nfuture to realize expected returns on these investments.\nWe are considering the acquisition or lease of additional properties and the construction of new IBX data\ncenters beyond those expansion projects already announced. We will be required to commit substantial operational\nand financial resources to these IBX data centers, generally 12 to 18 months in advance of securing customer\ncontracts, and we may not have sufficient customer demand in those markets to support these IBX data centers\nonce they are built. In addition, unanticipated technological changes could affect customer requirements for data\ncenters, and we may not have built such requirements into our new IBX data centers. Either of these contingencies,\nif they were to occur, could make it difficult for us to realize expected or reasonable returns on these investments.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Needs and Capital Strategy\nOur substantial debt could adversely affect our cash flows and limit our flexibility to raise additional capital.\nWe have a significant amount of debt and may need to incur additional debt to support our growth. Additional\ndebt may also be incurred to fund future acquisitions, any future special distributions, regular distributions or the\nother cash outlays associated with maintaining our qualification for taxation as a REIT. As of December 31, 2023,\nour total indebtedness (gross of debt issuance cost and debt discount) was approximately $16.1 billion, our\nstockholders' equity was $12.5 billion and our cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.1 billion. In addition, as of\nDecember 31, 2023, we had approximately $3.9 billion of additional liquidity available to us from our $4.0 billion\nrevolving credit facility. In addition to our substantial debt, we lease many of our IBX data centers and certain\nequipment under lease agreements, some of which are accounted for as operating leases. As of December 31,\n2023, we recorded operating lease liabilities of $1.5 billion, which represents our obligation to make lease payments\nunder those lease arrangements.\nOur substantial amount of debt and related covenants, and our off-balance sheet commitments, could have\nimportant consequences. For example, they could:\n• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal\npayments on our debt and in respect of other off-balance sheet arrangements, reducing the availability of\nour cash flow to fund future capital expenditures, working capital, execution of our expansion strategy and\nother general corporate requirements;\n• increase the likelihood of negative outlook from our credit rating agencies, or of a downgrade to our current\nrating;\n• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our various debt instruments;\n• increase our cost of borrowing and even limit our ability to access additional debt to fund future growth;\n31\nTable of Contents\n• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and adverse changes in\ngovernmental regulations;\n• limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry, which may place us\nat a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors;\n• limit our operating flexibility through covenants with which we must comply;\n• limit our ability to borrow additional funds, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, which would\nalso limit our ability to further expand our business; and\n• make us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates because of the variable interest rates on some of our\nborrowings to the extent we have not entirely hedged such variable rate debt.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nWe may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not\nbe able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our\nexisting debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher\ninterest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase.\nThese risks could materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nSales or issuances of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common\nstock.\nFuture sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market\nprice of our common stock, including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures,\nfinance acquisitions or repay debt. In November 2022 and as amended in October 2023, we established an \"at the\nmarket\" equity offering program (the \"2022 ATM Program\") in the amount of $1.5 billion under which we may, from\ntime to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock to or through sales agents up to established limits. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we had approximately $469.7 million available for sale under the 2022 ATM Program. We have\nrefreshed our ATM program in the past and expect to refresh our ATM program periodically, which could lead to\nadditional dilution for our stockholders in the future. We may also seek authorization to sell additional shares of\ncommon stock through other means which could lead to additional dilution for our stockholders. Please see Note 12\nwithin the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for sales of our common stock\nunder our ATM programs.\nIf we are not able to generate sufficient operating cash flows or obtain external financing, our ability to fund\nincremental expansion plans may be limited.\nOur capital expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, obligations to service our debt and the\ncash outlays associated with our REIT distribution requirements, are, and will continue to be, a substantial burden\non our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available\nwhen needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. Our inability to obtain additional debt and/\nor equity financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to prioritize projects or curtail\ncapital expenditures which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur derivative transactions expose us to counterparty credit risk.\nOur derivative transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative\ncontract. Disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty's liquidity, which\ncould make them unable to perform under the terms of their derivative contract and we may not be able to realize\nthe benefit of the derivative contract.\nRisks Related to Environmental Laws and Climate Change Impact\nEnvironmental regulations may impose upon us new or unexpected costs.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in\nthe United States and at our non-U.S. locations, including those relating to the generation, storage, handling and\n32\nTable of Contents\ndisposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Certain of these laws and regulations also impose joint and several\nliability, without regard to fault, for investigation and cleanup costs on current and former owners and operators of\nreal property and persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment. Our\noperations involve the use of hazardous substances and other regulated materials such as petroleum fuel for\nemergency generators, as well as batteries, cleaning solutions, refrigerants and other materials. At some of our\nlocations, hazardous substances or regulated materials are known to be present in soil or groundwater, and there\nmay be additional unknown hazardous substances or regulated materials present at sites that we own, operate or\nlease. At some of our locations, there are land use restrictions in place relating to earlier environmental cleanups\nthat do not materially limit our use of the sites. To the extent any hazardous substances or any other substance or\nmaterial must be investigated, cleaned up or removed from our property, we may be responsible under applicable\nlaws, permits or leases for the investigation, removal or cleanup of such substances or materials, the cost of which\ncould be substantial.\nWe purchase significant amounts of electricity from generating facilities and utility companies. These facilities\nand utility companies are subject to environmental laws, regulations, permit requirements and policy decisions that\ncould be subject to material change, which could result in increases in our electricity suppliers' compliance costs\nthat may be passed through to us. Regulations promulgated by the U.S. EPA or state agencies, or by regulators in\nother countries, could limit air emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants, restrict discharges of cooling water, limit\nthe availability of potable water and otherwise impose new operational restraints on power plants that could\nincrease costs of electricity. Regulatory programs intended to promote increased generation of electricity from\nrenewable sources may also increase our costs of procuring electricity. In addition, we are directly subject to\nenvironmental, health and safety laws regulating air emissions, storm water management and other environmental\nmatters arising in our business. For example, our emergency generators are subject to state, federal and country-\nspecific regulations governing air pollutants, which could limit the operation of those generators or require the\ninstallation of new pollution control technologies. While environmental regulations do not normally impose material\ncosts upon our operations, unexpected events, equipment malfunctions, human error and changes in law or\nregulations, among other factors, can lead to additional capital requirements, limitations upon our operations and\nunexpected increased costs.\nRegulation of greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions could increase our costs of doing business, for example by\nincreasing the cost of electricity produced by more GHG-intensive means (e.g., generated from fossil fuels), which\ncould require the use of management or reduction of GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide capture), or by imposing\ntaxes or fees upon electricity or GHG emissions. In recent years, there has been interest in the U.S. and in\ncountries where we operate abroad in regulating GHG emissions and otherwise addressing risks related to climate\nchange. For example, in the U.S., new regulations and legislation have been proposed or enacted during the Biden\nAdministration that limit or otherwise seeks to discourage carbon dioxide emissions and the use of fossil fuels. Such\nregulations and legislation have included or may in the future include measures ranging from direct regulation of\nGHG emissions to \"carbon taxes,\" and tax incentives to promote the development and use of renewable energy and\notherwise lower GHG emissions. Other countries in which we operate may also impose requirements and\nrestrictions on GHG emissions.\nGovernmental regulations also have the potential to increase our costs of obtaining electricity. Certain U.S.\nstates in which we operate have issued or are considering and may enact environmental regulations that could\nmaterially affect our facilities and electricity costs. For example, California limits GHG emissions from new and\nexisting conventional power plants by imposing regulatory caps and by auctioning the rights to emission allowances.\nMultiple other states have issued regulations (or are considering regulations) to implement carbon cap and trade\nprograms, carbon pricing programs and other mechanisms designed to limit GHG emissions.\nTo date, regulations aimed at reducing GHG emissions have not had a material adverse effect on our electricity\ncosts, but potential new regulatory requirements and the market-driven nature of some of the programs could have\na material adverse effect on electricity costs in the future. Global environmental regulations are expected to\ncontinue to change and evolve and may impose upon us new or unexpected costs. Concern about climate change\nand sustainability in various jurisdictions may result in more stringent laws and regulatory requirements regarding\nemissions of carbon dioxide or other GHGs. Restrictions on carbon dioxide or other GHG emissions could result in\nsignificant increases in operating or capital costs, including higher energy costs generally, and increased costs from\ncarbon taxes, emission cap and trade programs and renewable portfolio standards that are imposed upon our\nelectricity suppliers. These higher energy costs, and the cost of complying across our global platform or of failing to\ncomply with these and any other climate change regulations, may have an adverse effect on our business and our\nresults of operations. The course of future legislation and regulation in the U.S. and abroad remains difficult to\n33\nTable of Contents\npredict and the potential increased costs associated with national or supra-national GHG regulation and other\ngovernment policies cannot be estimated at this time.\nOur business may be adversely affected by physical risks related to climate change and our response to it.\nSevere weather events, such as droughts, wildfires, flooding, heat waves, hurricanes, typhoons and winter\nstorms, pose a threat to our IBX data centers and our customers' IT infrastructure through physical damage to\nfacilities or equipment, power supply disruption, and long-term effects on the cost of electricity. The frequency and\nintensity of severe weather events are reportedly increasing as part of broader climate changes. Changes in global\nweather patterns may also pose long-term risks of physical impacts to our business.\nWe maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that would be implemented in the event of severe\nweather events that interrupt our business or affect our customers' IT infrastructure housed in our IBX data centers.\nWhile these plans are designed to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can interrupt our\nbusiness, we cannot be certain that our plans will work as intended to mitigate the impacts of such disasters or\nevents. Failure to prevent impact to customers from such events could adversely affect our business.\nWe may fail to achieve our Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") and sustainability goals, or may\nencounter objections to them, either of which may adversely affect public perception of our business and\naffect our relationship with our customers, our stockholders and/or other stakeholders.\nWe have prioritized sustainability and ESG objectives, including long term goals of procuring 100% clean and\nrenewable energy coverage and reducing our GHG emissions from our operations and supply chain. We also face\npressure from our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders, such as the communities in which we operate,\nwho are increasingly focused on climate change, to prioritize renewable energy procurement, reduce our carbon\nfootprint and promote sustainable practices. To address these goals and concerns, where possible, we plan to\ncontinue to scale our renewable energy strategy, seek low-carbon alternatives for traditional fuel sources, use\nrefrigerants that pose fewer risks of environmental impact, and pursue opportunities to improve energy and water\nefficiency. As a result of these and other initiatives, we intend to make progress towards reducing our environmental\nimpact and global carbon footprint, meet our public climate related commitments, as well as ensuring that our\nbusiness remains viable in a low-carbon economy.\nPursuing these objectives involves additional costs for conducting our business. For example, developing and\nacting on ESG initiatives, including collecting, measuring, and reporting information, goals and other metrics can be\ncostly, difficult and time consuming. We have separately undertaken efforts to procure coverage from renewable\nenergy projects in order to support availability of new renewables development. These efforts to support and\nenhance renewable electricity generation may increase our costs of electricity above those that would be incurred\nthrough procurement of conventional electricity from existing sources or through conventional grids. Reducing our\ncarbon footprint may require physical or operational modifications that may be costly. These initiatives could\nadversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThere is also a risk that our ESG and sustainability objectives will not be successful. It is possible that we may\nfail to reach our stated environmental goals in a timely manner or that our customers, stockholders or members of\nour communities might not be satisfied with our sustainability efforts or the speed of their adoption. Our customers,\nshareholders or others may object to our ESG and sustainability objectives or the manner in which we seek to\nachieve such objectives. A failure to meet our environmental goals, or significant controversy regarding these goals\nand how we achieve them, could adversely affect public perception of our business, employee morale or customer,\nstockholder or community support. If we do not meet our customers' or stockholders' expectations regarding those\ninitiatives, or lose support in our communities, our business and/or our share price could be harmed.\nThere is some indication that ESG and sustainability goals are becoming more controversial, as some\ngovernmental entities in the U.S. and certain investor constituencies question the appropriateness of or object to\nESG and sustainability initiatives. Some investors may use ESG-related factors to guide their investment strategies\nand may choose not to invest in us, a factor that would tend to reduce demand for our shares and possibly affect\nour share price adversely. We also may face potential governmental enforcement actions or private litigation\nchallenging our ESG and sustainability goals, or our disclosure of those goals and our metrics for measuring\nachievement of them. New or changing regulation or public opinion regarding our ESG and sustainability goals or\n34\nTable of Contents\nour actions to achieve them may result in adverse effects on our financial performance, reputation or demand for\nour services and products, or may otherwise result in obligations and liabilities that cannot predicted or estimated at\nthis time.\nRisks Related to Certain Regulations and Laws, Including Tax Laws\nGeopolitical events contribute to an already complex and evolving regulatory landscape. If we cannot\ncomply with the evolving laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, we may be subject to\nlitigation and/or sanctions, adverse revenue impacts, increased costs and our business and results of\noperations could be negatively impacted.\nGeopolitical events, such as the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union (\"Brexit\"), the Hong\nKong national security law, the trade war between the U.S. and China, the war between Russia and Ukraine and,\nmost recently, the escalation of the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, could have a negative effect on our business\ndomestically and/or internationally. While some time has passed since some of these events first occurred, it\nremains unpredictable how these events will continue to develop and impact the environment in which we do\nbusiness.\nIn addition, many countries and states have increasingly taken a more proactive approach on sustainability\nthrough the adoption of regulations that oblige corporations to make disclosures on their corporate sustainability\nefforts through mandatory ESG reporting and to decarbonize their operations and supply chain. It is possible that\ncompliance with the sustainability-related regulations and directives will require us to re-evaluate and make changes\nto our current operations and our supply chain and thus increase our cost of doing business in the relevant affected\nregions or countries. We may incur incremental costs to enhance our internal systems to collect the data needed to\nmeet these regulatory requirements, including attestation standards.\nIn countries where there are shortages of power, land and water resources, local governments have and/or will\nbe imposing more stringent regulations and requirements to control the growth and development of data centers in\ntheir countries. New builds and further expansion of data center operations in such markets are increasingly being\nevaluated and approvals (where required) may only be granted where a data center operator is not only able to\ndemonstrate that it is efficient in its use of energy and water but also that its operations have and/or will bring\npositive and significant environmental, economic and social impact to the country and the local community.\nDigitalization has been accelerated in many countries as a direct consequence of the pandemic and regulators\nare increasingly aware and recognizing the importance of data centers in ensuring the availability, resiliency,\nsecurity and stability of digitalized critical services such as national security, healthcare and financial and banking\nservices. Regulations such as the US Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (“CIRCIA\n2022”), the SEC Cybersecurity Disclosure Rule, the EU Network and Information Security Directive No.2 (“NISD2”),\nthe EU Digital Operational Resilience Act, and Australia’s Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 make it\nmandatory for Equinix to comply with more stringent requirements related to cybersecurity, controls on data storage\nand cross border data transfer and operational resilience, more so, in countries where our entities and/or IBXs are\ndesignated as critical information or critical national infrastructure. Regulatory compliance may lead to additional\ncosts and impact returns on investments in the relevant jurisdictions.\nWith respect to the current trade war between the U.S. and China, we have several customers in China named\nin restrictive executive orders by the previous U.S. administration that are currently covered by a freeze issued by\nthe current U.S. administration or currently enjoined from enforcement subject to pending litigation. If Equinix is\nrequired to cease business with these companies, or additional companies in the future, our revenues could be\nadversely affected.\nAdditionally, laws and regulations related to economic sanctions, export controls, anti-bribery and anti-\ncorruption, and other international activities may restrict or limit our ability to engage in transactions or dealings with\ncertain counterparties, in or with certain countries or territories, or in certain activities. We cannot guarantee\ncompliance with all such laws and regulations, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could expose us\nto fines, penalties, or costly and expensive investigations.\nViolations of any of applicable domestic or international laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal\nsanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such\n35\nTable of Contents\nviolations could include prohibitions on our ability to provide our offerings in one or more countries, could delay or\nprevent potential acquisitions, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international\nexpansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and results of operations.\nGovernment regulation related to our business or failure to comply with laws and regulations may\nadversely affect our business.\nVarious laws and governmental regulations, both in the U.S. and abroad, governing internet-related services,\nrelated communications services and information technologies remain largely unsettled, even in areas where there\nhas been some legislative action. For example, the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") recently\noverturned network neutrality rules, which may result in material changes in the regulations and contribution regime\naffecting us and our customers. Furthermore, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures are reviewing and\nconsidering changes to the new FCC rules making the future of network neutrality uncertain. Changes to these laws\nand regulations could have a material adverse effect on us and our customers. We expect there may also be\nforthcoming regulation in areas of regulating the responsible use of artificial intelligence, such as the proposed EU\nArtificial Intelligence Act and the introduction of heightened measures to be adopted with respect to cybersecurity,\ndata privacy, sustainability, taxation and data security, any of which could impact us and our customers.\nWe remain focused on whether and how existing and changing laws, such as those governing intellectual\nproperty, privacy, libel, telecommunications services, data flows/data localization, carbon emissions impact,\ncompetition and antitrust, and taxation apply to our business and those which might have a material effect on our\ncustomers’ decisions to purchase our solutions. Substantial resources may be required to comply with regulations or\nbring any non-compliant business practices into compliance with such regulations. In addition, the continuing\ndevelopment of the market for online commerce and the displacement of traditional telephony service by the\ninternet and related communications services may prompt an increased call for more stringent consumer protection\nlaws or other regulation both in the U.S. and abroad that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting\nbusiness online and their service providers.\nOur business was designated \"critical infrastructure\" or \"essential services\" which allowed our data centers to\nremain open in many jurisdictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Any regulations restricting our ability to operate\nour business for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, these \"essential\nservices\" and \"critical infrastructure\" designations could lead countries or local regulators to impose additional\nregulations on the data center industry in order to have better visibility and control over our industry for future events\nand crises.\nWe strive to comply with all laws and regulations that apply to our business. However, as these laws evolve,\nthey can be subject to varying interpretations and regulatory discretion. To the extent a regulator or court disagrees\nwith our interpretation of these laws and determines that our practices are not in compliance with applicable laws\nand regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect our business\noperations. The adoption, or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet and our business, or\ninterpretations of existing laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results\nof operations.\nChanges in U.S. or foreign tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof, including changes to tax rates,\nmay adversely affect our financial statements and cash taxes.\nWe are a U.S. company with global subsidiaries and are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. (although\ncurrently limited due to our taxation as a REIT) and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in\ndetermining our worldwide provision for income and other taxes. Although we believe that we have adequately\nassessed and accounted for our potential tax liabilities, and that our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no\ncertainty that additional taxes will not be due upon audit of our tax returns or as a result of changes to the tax laws\nand interpretations thereof. For example, we are currently undergoing audits in a number of jurisdictions where we\noperate. The final results of these audits are uncertain and may not be resolved in our favor.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\") is an international association made\nup of over 30 countries including the U.S. The OECD has proposed and made numerous changes to long-standing\ntax principles, which, if adopted by the member countries, could have a materially adverse effect on our tax\nliabilities. For example, it has proposed a framework to implement a global minimum tax of 15% for businesses with\n36\nTable of Contents\nglobal revenues and profits above certain thresholds (referred to as Pillar Two). The framework includes a\nmechanism empowering foreign jurisdictions to levy a top-up tax on our profits in the U.S. Certain aspects of Pillar\nTwo became effective January 1, 2024, and the rest of the new tax regime will become effective January 1, 2025.\nWhile it is uncertain whether the U.S. will enact legislation to adopt Pillar Two, certain countries in which we operate\nhave partially adopted Pillar Two, and other countries are in the process of introducing legislation to adopt the new\ntax regime. We are continuing to evaluate the impacts of the development in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to increased spending by many governments in the past years. Because of this,\nthere could be pressure to increase taxes in the future to pay back debts and generate revenues. The nature and\ntiming of any future changes to each jurisdiction's tax laws and the impact on our future tax liabilities cannot be\npredicted with any accuracy, but could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial\nposition or cash flows.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain our complex global legal entity\nstructure.\nWe maintain a complex global organizational structure, containing numerous legal entities of varied types and\nserving various purposes, in each country in which we operate. For example, to maintain our qualification for\ntaxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we use TRSs and qualified REIT subsidiaries (\"QRSs\") in\norder to segregate our income between net income from real estate and net income from other non-real estate\nactivities. This results in significantly more entities than we might otherwise utilize if we were not having to maintain\nour qualification for taxation as a REIT in the U.S.\nAdditionally, we maintain certain other region-specific organizational structures for various tax, legal and other\nbusiness purposes. The organization, maintenance and reporting requirements for our entity structure are complex\nand require coordination amongst many teams within Equinix and the use of outside service providers. While we\nuse automation tools and software where possible to manage this process, a meaningful amount of work continues\nto be manual. We believe we have adequate controls in place to manage these complex structures, but if our\ncontrols fail, there could be significant legal and tax implications to our business and our operations including but\nnot limited to material tax and legal liabilities.\nRisks Related to Our REIT Status in the U.S.\nWe may not remain qualified for taxation as a REIT.\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 taxable year.\nWe believe that our organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under\nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), such that we will continue to qualify for taxation as a\nREIT. However, we cannot assure you that we have qualified for taxation as a REIT or that we will remain so\nqualified. Qualification for taxation as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of\nthe Code to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not\nentirely within our control. There are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of applicable REIT provisions of\nthe Code.\nIf, in any taxable year, we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT and are not entitled to relief under the\nCode:\n• we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;\n• we will be subject to U.S. federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income\ntax rates; and\n• we would not be eligible to elect REIT status again until the fifth taxable year that begins after the first year\nfor which we failed to qualify for taxation as a REIT.\nAny such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other\npurposes. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate\nsome investments to pay any additional tax liability. Accordingly, funds available for investment and distributions to\nstockholders could be reduced.\n37\nTable of Contents\nAs a REIT, failure to make required distributions would subject us to federal corporate income tax.\nWe paid quarterly distributions in each quarter of 2023 and have declared a quarterly distribution for the fourth\nquarter of 2023 to be paid on March 20, 2024. The amount, timing and form of any future distributions will be\ndetermined, and will be subject to adjustment, by our Board of Directors. To remain qualified for taxation as a REIT,\nwe are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the\ndividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year, or in limited circumstances, the following year,\nto our stockholders. Generally, we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income. If our cash\navailable for distribution falls short of our estimates, we may be unable to maintain distributions that approximate\nour REIT taxable income and may fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT. In addition, our cash flows from\noperations may be insufficient to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual\nreceipt of income and the payment of expenses and the recognition of income and expenses for federal income tax\npurposes, or the effect of nondeductible expenditures, such as capital expenditures, payments of compensation for\nwhich Section 162(m) of the Code denies a deduction, interest expense deductions limited by Section 163(j) of the\nCode, the creation of reserves or required debt service or amortization payments.\nTo the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable\nincome, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will\nbe subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on our undistributed taxable income if the actual amount that we\ndistribute to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than the minimum amount specified under the Code.\nComplying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive\nopportunities.\nTo remain qualified for taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy tests\nconcerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets and the\namounts we distribute to our stockholders. For example, under the Code, no more than 20% of the value of the\nassets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. Similar rules apply to other nonqualifying\nassets. These limitations may affect our ability to make large investments in other non-REIT qualifying operations or\nassets. In addition, in order to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we must distribute at least 90% of\nour REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital\ngains. Even if we maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at\nregular corporate income tax rates for our undistributed REIT taxable income, as well as U.S. federal income tax at\nregular corporate income tax rates for income recognized by our TRSs; we also pay taxes in the foreign jurisdictions\nin which our international assets and operations are held and conducted regardless of our qualification for taxation\nas a REIT. Because of these distribution requirements, we will likely not be able to fund future capital needs and\ninvestments from operating cash flow. As such, compliance with REIT tests may hinder our ability to make certain\nattractive investments, including the purchase of significant nonqualifying assets and the material expansion of non-\nreal estate activities.\nOur use of TRSs, including for certain of our international operations, may cause us to fail to remain\nqualified for taxation as a REIT in the U.S.\nOur operations utilize TRSs to facilitate our qualification for taxation as a REIT. The net income of our TRSs is\nnot included in our REIT taxable income unless it is distributed by an applicable TRS, and income that is not\nincluded in our REIT taxable income generally is not subject to the REIT income distribution requirement. Our ability\nto receive distributions from our TRSs is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our qualification\nfor taxation as a REIT. In particular, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must be\nderived from real estate. Consequently, no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income\nfrom our TRSs and other nonqualifying types of income. Thus, our ability to receive distributions from our TRSs may\nbe limited and may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders using cash flows from our TRSs.\nFurther, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our TRSs and the accumulation or\nreinvestment of significant earnings in our TRSs could result in adverse tax treatment. In particular, if the\naccumulation of cash in our TRSs causes (1) the fair market value of our securities in our TRSs to exceed 20% of\nthe fair market value of our assets or (2) the fair market value of our securities in our TRSs and other nonqualifying\nassets to exceed 25% of the fair market value of our assets, then we will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a\nREIT. Further, a substantial portion of our TRSs are overseas, and a material change in foreign currency rates could\nalso negatively impact our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT.\n38\nTable of Contents\nThe Code imposes limitations on the ability of our TRSs to utilize specified income tax deductions, including\nlimits on the use of net operating losses and limits on the deductibility of interest expense.\nEven if we remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, some of our business activities are subject to corporate\nlevel income tax and foreign taxes, which will continue to reduce our cash flows, and we will have potential\ndeferred and contingent tax liabilities.\nEven if we remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign\ntaxes, including taxes on any undistributed income, and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and\ntransfer taxes. In addition, we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which\ncould be significant in amount, in respect of dealer property income or in order to utilize one or more relief\nprovisions under the Code to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT.\nA portion of our business is conducted through wholly owned TRSs because certain of our business activities\ncould generate nonqualifying REIT income as currently structured and operated. The income of our U.S. TRSs will\ncontinue to be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes. In addition, our international assets and\noperations will continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those\noperations are conducted. Any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash.\nWe will also be subject to a U.S. federal corporate level income tax at the highest regular corporate income tax\nrate on gain recognized from a sale of a REIT asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the\nbasis of the asset in the hands of a C corporation (such as an asset that we or our QRSs hold following the\nliquidation or other conversion of a former TRS). This tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset\nduring the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a REIT asset, to the extent of the built-in-gain\nbased on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a REIT asset.\nOur certificate of incorporation contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our stock, though\nthey may not be successful in preserving our qualification for taxation as a REIT.\nIn order for us to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, no more than 50% of the value of outstanding shares\nof our stock may be owned, beneficially or constructively, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half\nof each taxable year. In addition, rents from \"affiliated tenants\" will not qualify as qualifying REIT income if we own\n10% or more by vote or value of the customer, whether directly or after application of attribution rules under the\nCode. Subject to certain exceptions, our certificate of incorporation prohibits any stockholder from owning,\nbeneficially or constructively, more than (i) 9.8% in value of the outstanding shares of all classes or series of our\ncapital stock or (ii) 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or\nseries of our capital stock. We refer to these restrictions collectively as the \"ownership limits\" and we included them\nin our certificate of incorporation to facilitate our compliance with REIT tax rules. The constructive ownership rules\nunder the Code are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or\nentities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than\n9.8% of our outstanding common stock (or the outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock) by an\nindividual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another individual or entity to own constructively in excess\nof the relevant ownership limits. Any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock or of any of our other\ncapital stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable\ntrust or may be void. Even though our certificate of incorporation contains the ownership limits, there can be no\nassurance that these provisions will be effective to prevent our qualification for taxation as a REIT from being\njeopardized, including under the affiliated tenant rule. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able\nto monitor and enforce the ownership limits. If the restrictions in our certificate of incorporation are not effective and,\nas a result, we fail to satisfy the REIT tax rules described above, then absent an applicable relief provision, we will\nfail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT.\nIn addition, the ownership and transfer restrictions could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in\ncontrol that might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. As a\nresult, the overall effect of the ownership and transfer restrictions may be to render more difficult or discourage any\nattempt to acquire us, even if such acquisition may be favorable to the interests of our stockholders.\n39\nTable of Contents\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe effects of a pandemic (including COVID-19) could have a negative effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nWe continuously monitored our global operations in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We implemented\nprocedures focusing on the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners and communities, the\ncontinuity of our business offerings and compliance with governmental regulations and local public health guidance\nand ordinances. While our business operations continued without interruption and our IBX data centers remained\nfully operational to date, we cannot guarantee our business operations or our IBX data centers will not be negatively\nimpacted in the future because of another pandemic, including one related to COVID-19.\nThe market price of our stock may continue to be highly volatile, and the value of an investment in our\ncommon stock may decline.\nThe market price of the shares of our common stock has recently been and may continue to be highly volatile.\nGeneral economic and market conditions, like the ones we are currently experiencing, and market conditions for\ntelecommunications, data center and REIT stocks in general, may affect the market price of our common stock.\nAnnouncements by us or others, or speculations about our future plans, may also have a significant impact on\nthe market price of our common stock. These may relate to:\n• our results of operations or forecasts;\n• new issuances of equity, debt or convertible debt by us, including issuances through any existing ATM\nProgram;\n• increases in market interest rates and changes in other general market and economic conditions, including\ninflationary concerns;\n• changes to our capital allocation, tax planning or business strategy;\n• our qualification for taxation as a REIT and our declaration of distributions to our stockholders;\n• changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws;\n• changes in management or key personnel;\n• developments in our relationships with customers;\n• announcements by our customers or competitors;\n• changes in regulatory policy or interpretation;\n• governmental investigations;\n• changes in the ratings of our debt or stock by rating agencies or securities analysts;\n• our purchase or development of real estate and/or additional IBX data centers;\n• our acquisitions of complementary businesses; or\n• the operational performance of our IBX data centers.\nThe stock market has from time-to-time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have\nparticularly affected the market prices for telecommunications companies, and which have often been unrelated to\ntheir operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common\nstock. One of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell our common stock is our\ndistribution rate as a percentage of our stock price relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates increase,\nprospective investors may demand a higher distribution rate or seek alternative investments paying higher dividends\nor interest. As a result, interest rate fluctuations and conditions in the capital markets may affect the market value of\nour common stock. Furthermore, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have\nbeen subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future.\nSecurities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and/or damages, and divert management's attention\nfrom other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nInadequate or inaccurate external and internal information, including budget and planning data, could lead\nto inaccurate financial forecasts and inappropriate financial decisions.\n40\nTable of Contents\nOur financial forecasts are dependent on estimates and assumptions regarding budget and planning data,\nmarket growth, foreign exchange rates, our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, and our ability to\ngenerate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in the business, fund internal growth, make acquisitions, pay dividends and\nmeet our debt obligations. Our financial projections are based on historical experience and on various other\nassumptions that our management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are\nmade.\nWe continue to evolve our forecasting models as necessary and appropriate but if our predictions are\ninaccurate and our results differ materially from our forecasts, we could make inappropriate financial decisions.\nAdditionally, inaccuracies in our models could adversely impact our compliance with REIT asset tests, future\nprofitability, stock price and/or stockholder confidence.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, especially the strength of the U.S. dollar, in the markets in\nwhich we operate internationally could harm our results of operations.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates. To date, the majority of revenues and costs in our international operations are\ndenominated in foreign currencies. Where our prices are denominated in U.S. Dollars, our sales and revenues could\nbe adversely affected by declines in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, thereby making our offerings more\nexpensive in local currencies. We are also exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange\nrates in connection with our international operations. To the extent we are paying contractors in foreign currencies,\nour operations could cost more than anticipated as a result of declines in the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign\ncurrencies. In addition, fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates have a direct impact on how our international\nresults of operations translate into U.S. Dollars.\nAlthough we currently undertake, and may decide in the future to further undertake, foreign exchange hedging\ntransactions to reduce foreign currency transaction exposure, we do not currently intend to eliminate all foreign\ncurrency transaction exposure. In addition, REIT compliance rules may restrict our ability to enter into hedging\ntransactions. Therefore, any weakness of the U.S. Dollar may have a positive impact on our consolidated results of\noperations because the currencies in the foreign countries in which we operate may translate into more U.S.\nDollars. However, as we have experienced more recently, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to the currencies of\nthe foreign countries in which we operate, our consolidated financial position and results of operations may be\nnegatively impacted as amounts in foreign currencies will generally translate into fewer U.S. Dollars. For additional\ninformation on foreign currency risks, refer to our discussion of foreign currency risk in \"Quantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures about Market Risk\" included in Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf our internal controls are found to be ineffective, our financial results or our stock price may be adversely\naffected.\nOur most recent evaluation of our controls resulted in our conclusion that, as of December 31, 2022, in\ncompliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our internal controls over financial reporting were\neffective. Our ability to manage our operations and growth through, for example, the integration of recently acquired\nbusinesses, the adoption of new accounting principles and tax laws, and our overhaul of our back-office systems\nthat, for example, support the customer experience from initial quote to customer billing and our revenue recognition\nprocess, will require us to further develop our controls and reporting systems and implement or amend new or\nexisting controls and reporting systems in those areas where the implementation and integration is still ongoing. All\nof these changes to our financial systems and the implementation and integration of acquisitions create an\nincreased risk of deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting. If, in the future, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting is found to be ineffective, or if a material weakness is identified in our controls over financial\nreporting, our financial results may be adversely affected. Investors may also lose confidence in the reliability of our\nfinancial statements which could adversely affect our stock price.\n41\nTable of Contents\nTerrorist activity, or other acts of violence, including violence stemming from the current climate of political\nand economic uncertainty, could adversely impact our business.\nThe continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility both domestically and abroad by\nterrorist organizations, organized crime organizations, or other criminals along with violence stemming from political\nunrest, contribute to a climate of political and economic uncertainty in many of the regions in which we operate. Due\nto existing or developing circumstances, we may need to incur additional costs in the future to provide enhanced\nsecurity, including cybersecurity and physical security, which could have a material adverse effect on our business\nand results of operations. These circumstances may also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers\nand employees, our ability to raise capital and the operation and maintenance of our IBX data centers.\nWe may be subject to securities class action and other litigation, which may harm our business and results\nof operations.\nWe may be subject to securities class action or other litigation. For example, securities class action litigation has\noften been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. Litigation\ncan be lengthy, expensive, and divert management's attention and resources. Results cannot be predicted with\ncertainty and an adverse outcome in litigation could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief. Further, any\npayments made in settlement may directly reduce our revenue under U.S. GAAP and could negatively impact our\nresults of operations for the period. For all of these reasons, litigation could seriously harm our business, results of\noperations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe cannot make assurances that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property rights will be\nadequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and\ntake appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. We also are subject to the risk of litigation alleging\ninfringement of third-party intellectual property rights. Any such claims could require us to spend significant sums in\nlitigation, pay damages, develop non-infringing intellectual property or acquire licenses to the intellectual property\nthat is the subject of the alleged infringement.\nWe have various mechanisms in place that may discourage takeover attempts.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a third party\nfrom acquiring control of us in a merger, acquisition or similar transaction that a stockholder may consider favorable.\nSuch provisions include:\n• ownership limitations and transfer restrictions relating to our stock that are intended to facilitate our\ncompliance with certain REIT rules relating to share ownership;\n• authorization for the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock;\n• the prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n• limits on the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n• limits on stockholder action by written consent; and\n• advance notice requirements for nominations to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be\nacted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which restricts certain business\ncombinations with interested stockholders in certain situations, may also discourage, delay or prevent someone\nfrom acquiring or merging with us.\nITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nThere is no disclosure to report pursuant to Item 1B.\n42\nITEM 1C. Cybersecurity\nEquinix Risk Management and Strategy\nEquinix has processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats, both\nintegrated into our Governance, Risk and Compliance Program (the “GRC Program”) and existing within our\nInformation Security function (“InfoSec”) led by our Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”).\nThe foundation of risk oversight at Equinix is our Governance, Risk and Compliance Committee (“GRCC”), led\nby our Chief Compliance Officer, and overseen by the Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board. The\nGRCC is a global, cross-functional group currently comprised of our most senior leaders, across functions such as\nLegal, Compliance and Risk Management. The GRCC considers enterprise and emerging risks via Equinix’s\nEnterprise Risk Management Program (the “ERM Program”). Our ERM Program focuses on the identification,\nassessment, management, monitoring and reporting of key business risks. Risk identification involves periodic risk\nsurveys and/or risk interviews with key business process owners and executives to identify key strategic,\noperational, financial, regulatory, compliance and external risks at the enterprise level. We completed a global risk\nassessment in 2023 to identify enterprise risks. In addition, the ERM Program also includes an Emerging Risks\nTeam of business leaders at Equinix, representing a majority of business functions, that meets monthly to identify\nfast-moving, potentially impactful risks.\nThe GRCC prioritizes top enterprise and emerging risks for reporting to, and dialogue with, our executive staff at\nleast quarterly, and from this discussion, risks are presented to the Nominating and Governance Committee to\nconsider for further assessment and report-out either to a committee or the full Board as appropriate.\nThe ERM Program works with those responsible for a given area of risk to gather, evaluate, and prioritize risk\ninformation for this assessment process through use of an enterprise risk profile document. Top risks, including\nthose related to cybersecurity, are evaluated through a detailed risk assessment, and the risks are reexamined\nperiodically as needed. InfoSec performs an annual refresh of an information security risk profile document as\nrequired by this process, and the results of such assessment are reported out for escalation, prioritization and\nreporting on an annual basis.\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nEquinix cybersecurity risk management activities and outcomes are guided by the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework (“CSF”) and assessed by a third party. In addition,\nour cybersecurity program is certified globally against the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”)\n27001 standards. Currently, our cybersecurity program includes the following key categories of security controls\nwith many security capabilities serving under each category Governance, Access Control, Awareness and Training,\nAudit and Accountability, Configuration Management, Contingency Planning, Incident Response, Data Security,\nContinuous Monitoring, Maintenance Controls, Media Protection, Physical Protections, Risk Assessment, Third-\nParty Risk Management, System and Communications Projection, and System and Information Integrity.\nEquinix has also implemented controls designed to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risk associated with our\nuse of third-party service providers, such as security risk assessments. We use a variety of inputs in such\nassessments, including information supplied by the third parties and regular monitoring.\nEquinix conducts regular employee training on how to spot suspicious activity, educates employees on potential\nsecurity risks, and periodically runs simulations of cyber incidents for employees across various functions to assess\nand refine response capabilities. Equinix also offers a role-based security certification for its software engineering\nemployees.\nEquinix’s cybersecurity risk management processes are carried out in the context of broader business\nobjectives and are integrated into Equinix’s broader risk management processes as described above in “Equinix\nRisk Management and Strategy”.\nEquinix relies on its internal InfoSec team, and does not generally engage any consultants, auditors, or other\nthird parties in connection with processes for assessing, identifying and managing risks from cybersecurity threats.\nHowever, Equinix does regularly engage with law enforcement communities with the intent to continuously improve\nand enhance its cybersecurity program.\n43\nBoard of Directors’ Oversight of Risks from Cybersecurity Threats\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee oversees our GRC Program per its charter, reviewing and\nconsidering developments related to the GRC Program and reporting on the GRC Program’s activities and\nrecommendations to the full Board.\nInformation security risks have been deemed by our Board to be of critical importance to Equinix, and thus the\nNominating and Governance Committee receives quarterly updates on cybersecurity and the full Board receives a\nbriefing on cybersecurity at least annually. These briefings are conducted by our CISO and members of the InfoSec\nleadership team, and cover topics such as key risk indicators, the status of strategic programs, operational updates\nand key initiatives, past and future action plans, and InfoSec functional updates.\nIn the event of a material cybersecurity incident, the full Board would be convened on a frequent basis to\nreceive updates and provide oversight.\nManagement’s Role in Assessing and Managing Material Risks from Cybersecurity Threats\nThe Information Security Steering Committee (“ISSC”) is a key element of our cybersecurity strategy. The ISSC\nis chaired by the CISO and comprises of a cross-functional group from various functions in the company. The ISSC\naims to align our security and compliance programs with business objectives. Specifically, the ISSC (i) facilitates\nidentification of risk-based priorities and trade offs; (ii) aims to ensure economies of scale and consistency of\ninformation security and compliance across IT assets at the company.; (iii) reviews and approves information\nsecurity policies; (iv) reviews requests for policy and risk exceptions to provide a “Risk Acceptance Authorization”;\nand (v) serves as a communications channel and steward to cultivate a culture of trust across the enterprise.\nThe ISSC currently meets quarterly. In addition, various subcommittees meet on an as-needed basis to address\nbusiness needs. At the ISSC, topics such as changes to the InfoSec risk register, notable issues, and information\nsecurity projects are discussed.\nOur CISO has extensive experience leading global security and IT organizations. He also serves on a public\ncompany board as an independent director providing cybersecurity expertise. Team members supporting our\nprogram have relevant education and information security experience.\nRisks From Cybersecurity Threats\nAlthough we believe we have a robust program to protect against cybersecurity risks, we may not be able to\nprevent a cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on us.

For the discussion of 2021 items and 2022 results as compared to 2021 results, please refer to Item\n7 of our 2022 Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on February 17, 2023.\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist\nreaders in understanding our financial information from our management's perspective and is presented as follows:\n• Overview\n• Results of Operations\n• Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n• Liquidity and Capital Resources\n• Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n• Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nOverview\nWe provide a global, vendor-neutral data center, interconnection and edge solutions platform with offerings that\naim to enable our customers to reach everywhere, interconnect everyone and integrate everything. Global\nenterprises, service providers and business ecosystems of industry partners rely on our IBX data centers and\nexpertise around the world for the safe housing of their critical IT equipment and to protect and connect the world's\nmost valued information assets. They also look to Platform Equinix® for the ability to directly and securely\n52\nTable of Contents\ninterconnect to the networks, clouds and content that enable today's information-driven global digital economy. Our\nrecent IBX data center openings and acquisitions, as well as xScaleTM data center investments, including those\nopened in January 2024, have expanded our total global footprint to 260 data centers, including 17 xScale data\ncenters and the MC1 data center that are held in unconsolidated joint ventures, across 71 markets around the\nworld. We offer the following solutions:\n• premium data center colocation;\n• interconnection and data exchange solutions;\n• edge solutions for deploying networking, security and hardware; and\n• remote expert support and professional services.\nOur interconnected data centers around the world allow our customers to increase information and application\ndelivery performance to users, and quickly access distributed IT infrastructures and business and digital\necosystems, while significantly reducing costs. Our global platform and the quality of our IBX data centers,\ninterconnection offerings and edge solutions have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. As more\ncustomers choose Platform Equinix for bandwidth cost and performance reasons, it benefits their suppliers and\nbusiness partners to colocate in the same data centers. This adjacency creates a “network effect” that enables our\ncustomers to capture the full economic and performance benefits of our offerings. These partners, in turn, pull in\ntheir business partners, creating a \"marketplace\" for their services. Our global platform enables scalable, reliable\nand cost-effective interconnection that increases data traffic exchange while lowering overall cost and increasing\nflexibility. Our focused business model is built on our critical mass of enterprise and service provider customers and\nthe resulting \"marketplace\" effect. This global platform, combined with our strong financial position, has continued to\ndrive new customer growth and bookings.\nHistorically, our market was served by large telecommunications carriers who bundled their products and\nservices with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include private and\nvendor-neutral multi-tenant data center (\"MTDC\") providers, hyperscale cloud providers, managed infrastructure\nand application hosting providers, and systems integrators. It is estimated that Equinix is one of more than 2,200\ncompanies that provide MTDC offerings around the world. Each of these data center solutions providers can bundle\nvarious colocation, interconnection and network offerings and outsourced IT infrastructure solutions. We are able to\noffer our customers a global platform that reaches 33 countries with the industry’s largest and most active\necosystem of partners in our sites, proven operational reliability, improved application performance and a highly\nscalable set of offerings.\nOur cabinet utilization rate represents the percentage of cabinet space billed versus total cabinet capacity,\nwhich is used to measure how efficiently we are managing our cabinet capacity. Our cabinet utilization rate varies\nfrom market to market among our IBX data centers across our Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. Our\ncabinet utilization rates were approximately 79% and 82%, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We\ncontinue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity\navailable in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an\nongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling\nrequirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming\nan increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our\ncustomers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain high power-\ndemand customers. This increased power consumption has driven us to build out our new IBX data centers to\nsupport power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers. We could face power limitations in our\nIBX data centers, even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX data\ncenter. This could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance,\nresults of operations and cash flows.\nTo serve the needs of the growing hyperscale data center market, including the world's largest cloud service\nproviders, we have entered into joint ventures to develop and operate xScale data centers. In the past two years,\nwe have closed multiple joint ventures in the form of limited liability partnerships with GIC Private Limited,\nSingapore's sovereign wealth fund (\"GIC\") and an additional joint venture in the form of a limited liability partnership\nwith PGIM Real Estate (\"PGIM\").\n53\nTable of Contents\nStrategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively\nimprove our footprint and offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion\ncriteria will be dependent on a number of factors, including but not limited to demand from new and existing\ncustomers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, clouds and software partners, capacity\navailability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property,\nautomation capabilities, developer talent pool, lead-time to break even on a free cash flow basis and in-place\ncustomers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to\nus. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by\nupfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to our\nstandards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or\nacquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential\ncustomers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant.\nRevenue:\nOur business is primarily based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related\ninterconnection and managed infrastructure offerings. We consider these offerings recurring because our customers\nare generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally\none to three years in length, and thereafter automatically renews in one-year increments. Our recurring revenues\nhave comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. In addition, during the past three\nyears, more than 90% of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our\nrevenue growth. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 3% of our recurring revenues for the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately 37%, 36% and\n39% of our recurring revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nOur non-recurring revenues are primarily derived from fees charged from installations related to a customer's\ninitial deployment and professional services we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring\nbecause they are billed typically once, upon completion of the installation or the professional services work\nperformed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the\ncustomer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from installations are deferred and\nrecognized ratably over the period of the contract term. Additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a\ncustomer wishes to terminate their contract early, is generally treated as a contract modification and recognized\nratably over the remaining term of the contract, if any. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring\nrevenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future.\nOperating Expenses:\nCost of Revenues. The largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to\nour leased IBX data centers, utility costs, including electricity, bandwidth access, IBX data center employees'\nsalaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment, and\nsecurity. A majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period,\nunless we expand our existing IBX data centers or open or acquire new IBX data centers. However, there are\ncertain costs that are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies that are directly related to\ngrowth in our existing and new customer base. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer\nmonths, as compared to other times of the year. Our costs of electricity may also increase as a result of the physical\n54\nTable of Contents\neffects of climate change, global energy supply constraints, increased regulations driving alternative electricity\ngeneration due to environmental considerations or as a result of our election to use renewable energy sources. To\nthe extent we incur increased utility costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition,\nresults of operations and cash flows.\nSales and Marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for\nsales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, amortization of contract costs, marketing\nprograms, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of\ncustomer relationship intangible assets.\nGeneral and Administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related\nexpenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees; and other\ngeneral corporate expenses, such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and some depreciation\nexpense on back office systems.\nTaxation as a REIT\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 taxable year.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our REIT structure included a majority of our data center operations in the Americas and\nEMEA regions, as well as the data center operations in Japan, Singapore, and Malaysia. Our data center operations\nin other jurisdictions are operated as TRSs. We have also included our share of the assets in xScale joint ventures\n(with the exception of Korea) in our REIT structure.\nAs a REIT, we generally are permitted to deduct from our U.S. federal taxable income the dividends we pay to\nour stockholders. The income represented by such dividends is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the\nentity level but is taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. Nevertheless, the income of our TRSs which hold our U.S.\noperations that may not be REIT compliant is subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income taxes, as\napplicable. Likewise, our foreign subsidiaries continue to be subject to local income taxes in jurisdictions in which\nthey hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through TRSs or through qualified\nREIT subsidiaries (\"QRSs\"). We are also subject to a separate U.S. federal corporate income tax on any gain\nrecognized from a sale of a REIT asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the\nasset in the hands of a C corporation (such as an asset held by us or a QRS following the liquidation or other\nconversion of a former TRS). This built-in-gain tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during\nthe five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a REIT asset to the extent of the built-in-gain based\non the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a REIT asset. In addition, should we\nrecognize any net gain from \"prohibited transactions,\" we will be subject to tax on this net gain at a 100% rate.\n\"Prohibited transactions,\" for this purpose, are defined as dispositions, at a gain, of inventory or property held\nprimarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business other than dispositions of foreclosure\nproperty and other than dispositions excepted by statutory safe harbors. If we fail to remain qualified for U.S. federal\nincome taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates.\nEven if we remain qualified for U.S. federal income taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state,\nlocal and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our TRSs' operations.\nIn particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the U.S. federal income tax regime for REITs, many\nstates do not completely follow federal rules, and some may not follow them at all.\nWe continue to monitor our REIT compliance in order to maintain our qualification for U.S. federal income\ntaxation as a REIT. For this and other reasons, as necessary, we may convert some of our data center operations in\nother countries into the REIT structure in future periods.\nOn each of March 22, 2023, June 21, 2023, and September 20, 2023, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of\n$3.41 per share. On December 13, 2023, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $4.26 per share. We expect all of our\n2023 quarterly distributions and other applicable distributions to equal or exceed our REIT taxable income to be\nrecognized in 2023.\n55\nTable of Contents\n2023 Highlights:\n• In February, we settled three forward sale agreements executed under the 2020 and 2022 ATM Programs\nand sold 458,459 shares of our common stock for approximately $301.6 million, net of payment of\ncommissions to sales agents and other offering expenses, at an aggregate weighted-average forward sale\nprice per share of $657.75. See Note 12 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n• In February and March, we issued ¥77.3 billion, or approximately $565.2 million, at the exchange rate in\neffect on issuance, in Japanese Yen Senior Notes due 2035 and 2043 (collectively, the \"Japanese Yen\nSenior Notes\"). See Note 11 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n• In March, we sold the Mexico 3 (\"MX3x\") data center site in connection with the formation of a new joint\nventure with GIC, to develop and operate xScale data centers in the Americas (the \"AMER 1 Joint\nVenture\"). Upon closing, we contributed $8.4 million in exchange for a 20% partnership interest in the joint\nventure. See Notes 5 and 6 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n• In April, we issued additional shares in our Indonesian operating entity to a third party investor for\n$25.0 million, which resulted in the third party investor owning a 25% ownership interest in the entity. See\nNote 12 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n• In September, we issued CHF300.0 million, or approximately $336.9 million, at the exchange rate in effect\non issuance, in Swiss Franc Notes due 2028 (the \"Swiss Franc Senior Notes\"). See Note 10 within the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n• In November, we settled five forward sale agreements executed under the 2022 ATM Program and sold\n564,126 shares of our common stock for approximately $433.3 million, net of payment of commissions to\nsales agents and other offering expenses, at an aggregate weighted-average forward sale price per share\nof $768.03. See Note 12 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 include the results of operations from a data\ncenter in Peru acquired from Entel from August 1, 2022, four data centers in Chile acquired from Entel from May 2,\n2022 and the acquisition of MainOne from April 1, 2022. See Note 3 within the Consolidated Financial Statements\nfor further details.\nIn order to provide a framework for assessing our performance excluding the impact of foreign currency\nfluctuations, we supplement the year-over-year actual change in results of operations with comparative changes on\na constant currency basis. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure.\nSee “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further discussion.\n56\nTable of Contents\nYears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nRevenues.

Growth in EMEA revenues was primarily due to power price increases in\nvarious European countries in response to the increased cost of utilities, as noted below under cost of revenues. In\naddition to power price increases, growth in EMEA revenues was further driven by:\n• $54.6 million of incremental revenues from services provided to our joint ventures;\n• approximately $47.8 million of incremental revenues generated from our IBX data center expansions;\n• $15.1 million of incremental revenues generated from the MainOne acquisition; and\n• an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period.\nAsia-Pacific Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Asia-Pacific revenue increased by\n$162.1 million or 10% (12% on a constant currency basis). Growth in Asia-Pacific revenue was primarily due to an\nincrease in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. In addition to organic\ngrowth, the increase in Asia-Pacific revenues was further driven by:\n• approximately $7.9 million of incremental revenues generated from our IBX data center expansions; and\n• power price increases in response to the increased cost of utilities.\nCost of Revenues.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, Americas cost of revenues increased\nby $55.4 million or 4% (and also 4% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Americas cost of revenues\nwas primarily due to:\n• $42.0 million of higher utilities costs, primarily driven by increases in power costs and higher utility usage;\n• $13.7 million of incremental cost of revenues from the Entel Chile and Entel Peru acquisitions; and\n58\nTable of Contents\n• $10.8 million of additional one-time software expenses related to our managed services business.\nEMEA Cost of Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2023, EMEA cost of revenues increased by\n$372.0 million or 29% (34% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA cost of revenues was\nprimarily due to higher utilities costs as a result of increases in power costs and higher utility usage in France,\nGermany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In addition to increased utilities costs, the increase\nin EMEA cost of revenues was further driven by:\n• after accounting for allocations of foreign currency cash flow hedging activities:\n◦ approximately $32 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses and stock-\nbased compensation, primarily due to headcount growth;\n◦ approximately $32 million of higher depreciation expense driven by IBX data center expansions;\n◦ approximately $12 million of repairs and maintenance driven by increased IBX footprint; and\n• $9.4 million of incremental cost of revenues from the MainOne Acquisition.\nAsia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues\nincreased by $48.8 million or 5% (8% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Asia-Pacific cost of\nrevenues was primarily due to:\n• $16.6 million of higher rent and facilities costs, primarily in Hong Kong;\n• $12.4 million of repairs and maintenance driven by increased IBX footprint;\n• $8.9 million higher utilities costs, primarily driven by increases in power costs and higher utility usage; and\n• $5.7 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation,\nprimarily due to headcount growth.\nWe expect Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific cost of revenues to increase in line with the growth of our\nbusiness, including from the impacts of acquisitions.\n59\nTable of Contents\nSales and Marketing Expenses.

The increase in our EMEA sales and\nmarketing expenses was primarily due to higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, salaries and\nstock-based compensation driven by headcount growth.\nAsia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Asia-Pacific sales and\nmarketing increased by $7.5 million or 7% (10% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Asia-Pacific\nsales and marketing expenses was primarily due to higher compensation costs, including sales compensation,\nsalaries and stock-based compensation driven by headcount growth.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to invest in sales and marketing initiatives across our three regions in line\nwith the growth of our business. We expect our Americas sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of\nrevenues to be higher than those of our other regions since certain global sales and marketing functions are located\nwithin the U.S.\n60\nTable of Contents\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, Americas general\nand administrative expenses increased by $126.0 million or 13% (and also 13% on a constant currency basis). The\nincrease in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:\n• $57.1 million of higher depreciation expense associated with back-office systems to support the growth of\nour business;\n• $24.7 million of higher office expenses primarily due to additional software and support services;\n• $18.5 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation,\nprimarily due to headcount growth; and\n• $17.3 million of higher rent expense primarily due to one-time termination costs associated with the\nconsolidation of office space.\nEMEA General and Administrative Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2023, EMEA general and\nadministrative expenses increased by $18.5 million or 6% (10% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our\nEMEA general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher compensation costs, including sales\ncompensation, salaries and stock-based compensation driven by headcount growth.\nAsia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Asia-Pacific\ngeneral and administrative expenses increased by $10.9 million or 5% (6% on a constant currency basis). The\nincrease in our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expense was primarily due to higher compensation costs,\nincluding sales compensation, salaries and stock-based compensation driven by headcount growth.\nGoing forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect our general and administrative\nexpenses to increase across all three regions as we continue to invest in our operations to support our growth,\nincluding investments to enhance our technology platform, and to integrate recent acquisitions. Additionally, given\n61\nTable of Contents\nthat our corporate headquarters is located in the U.S., we expect the Americas general and administrative expenses\nas a percentage of revenues to be higher than that of other regions.\nTransaction Costs. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded transaction costs\ntotaling $12.4 million and $21.8 million respectively, primarily related to costs incurred in connection with the recent\nacquisitions and formation of the new joint ventures, see Notes 3, 5, and 6 within the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nGain or Loss on Asset Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not record a\nsignificant amount of gain or loss on asset sales.\nIncome from Operations.

Interest income was $94.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and was $36.3\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 4.11%\nversus 1.74% for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased to $402.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from\n$356.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the issuance of the 3.900% Senior Notes in\n2022, the issuance of the 2.000% - 2.57% Japanese Yen Senior Notes due 2035 and 2043 in the first quarter of\n2023, the issuance of the 2.875% Swiss Franc Senior Notes due 2028 in the third quarter of 2023 and an increase\nin the variable rate of our GBP term loan. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we capitalized\n$26.0 million and $18.2 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. See Note 11 within the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Expense. We did not record a significant amount of other expense during the year ended December 31,\n2023. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded net other expense of $51.4 million, including\n$49.0 million in stock-based charitable contributions and foreign currency exchange gains and losses\nGain or Loss on Debt Extinguishment. We did not record a significant amount of gain on debt extinguishment\nduring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nIncome Taxes. We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are generally not\nsubject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income distributed to stockholders. We intend to distribute or\nhave distributed the entire taxable income generated by the operations of our REIT and QRSs for the tax years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As such, other than state income taxes, foreign income and\n62\nTable of Contents\nwithholding taxes, no provision for income taxes has been included for our REIT and QRSs in the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nWe have made TRS elections for some of our subsidiaries in and outside the U.S. In general, a TRS may\nprovide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs to provide and may hold assets that\nmay not be REIT compliant.\nU.S. income taxes for the TRS entities located in the U.S. and foreign income taxes for our foreign operations\nregardless of whether the foreign operations are operated as QRSs or TRSs have been accrued, as necessary, for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded $155.3 million and $124.8 million of income\ntax expenses, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 13.8% and 15.0%, respectively, for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we had a favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions of\napproximately $14.0 million resulting from the settlement of tax audits in the EMEA region. In 2022, we had a\nfavorable resolution of uncertain tax positions of approximately $40.0 million resulting from the settlement of various\ntax audits in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in how we assess the operating performance of our\nsegments and develop regional growth strategies such as IBX data center expansion decisions. We define adjusted\nEBITDA as net income excluding income tax expense, interest income, interest expense, other income or expense,\ngain or loss on debt extinguishment, depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense,\nrestructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, and gain or loss on asset sales. See \"Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures\" below for more information about adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to\nnet income. Our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 by geographic regions was as\nfollows (dollars in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31, $ Change % Change\nConstant\n2023 % 2022 % Actual Actual Currency\nAmericas $ 1,613,696 44 % $ 1,521,775 45 % $ 91,921 6 % 6 %\nEMEA 1,251,276 34 % 1,109,502 33 % 141,774 13 % 18 %\nAsia-Pacific 836,869 22 % 738,423 22 % 98,446 13 % 15 %\nTotal $ 3,701,841 100 % $ 3,369,700 100 % $ 332,141 10 % 12 %\nAmericas Adjusted EBITDA. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Americas adjusted EBITDA increased\nby $91.9 million or 6% (and also 6% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of\nour IBX data center expansion activity, the recent acquisitions and organic growth, as described above.\nEMEA Adjusted EBITDA. During the year ended December 31, 2023, EMEA adjusted EBITDA increased by\n$141.8 million or 13% (18% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX\ndata center expansion activity, incremental services provided to our joint ventures, the recent acquisition and\norganic growth, as described above.\nAsia-Pacific Adjusted EBITDA. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA\nincreased by $98.4 million or 13% (15% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result\nof our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth, as described above.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but we believe that evaluating our ongoing results\nof operations may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, we use non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to evaluate our operations.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the\nmost directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to\n63\nTable of Contents\nthe most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We have presented such non-GAAP financial measures to\nprovide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our results of operations in a manner that focuses on what\nmanagement believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-\nGAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better\nunderstanding of the overall performance of the business and ability to perform in subsequent periods. We believe\nthat if we did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to\nanalyze us effectively.\nInvestors should note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by us may not be the same non-GAAP\nfinancial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. Investors should\ntherefore exercise caution when comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-GAAP\nfinancial measures of other companies.\nOur primary non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\"),\nexclude depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our IBX data\ncenters and do not reflect our current or future cash spending levels to support our business. Our IBX data centers\nare long-lived assets and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of an IBX data center\ndo not recur with respect to such data center, and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to our initial\ninvestment throughout its useful life. Construction costs in future periods are primarily incurred with respect to\nadditional IBX data centers. This is a trend we expect to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the\nestimated useful lives of our IBX data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset,\nare based on historical costs incurred to build out our IBX data centers and are not indicative of current or expected\nfuture capital expenditures. Therefore, we exclude depreciation from our results of operations when evaluating our\noperations.\nIn addition, in presenting adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, we exclude amortization expense related to acquired\nintangible assets. Amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions and\nthese charges may vary in amount from period to period. We exclude amortization expense to facilitate a more\nmeaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our prior periods. We exclude\naccretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations as well as accrued restructuring charge\nliabilities, as these expenses represent costs which we believe are not meaningful in evaluating our current\noperations. We also exclude restructuring charges. Restructuring charges relate to our decisions to exit leases for\nexcess space adjacent to several of our IBX data centers, which we did not intend to build out, or our decision to\nreverse such restructuring charges. We also exclude impairment charges generally related to certain long-lived\nassets. The impairment charges are related to expense recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of assets are not recoverable. We also exclude gain or loss on asset sales as it\nrepresents profit or loss that is not meaningful in evaluating the current or future operating performance.\nAdditionally, we exclude transaction costs from AFFO and adjusted EBITDA to allow more comparable comparisons\nof our financial results to our historical operations. The transaction costs relate to costs we incur in connection with\nbusiness combinations and the formation of joint ventures, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and\nother professional or consulting fees. Such charges generally are not relevant to assessing our long-term\nperformance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing\nof the transactions. Management believes items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, gain or loss on\nasset sales and transaction costs are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs may occur in future\nperiods. Finally, we exclude stock-based compensation expense, as it can vary significantly from period to period\nbased on share price, and the timing, size and nature of equity awards. As such, we, and many investors and\nanalysts, exclude stock-based compensation expense to compare our results of operations with those of other\ncompanies.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding income tax expense, interest income, interest expense,\nother income or expense, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based\n64\nTable of Contents\ncompensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, and gain or loss on asset\nsales as presented below (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet income $ 968,980 $ 704,577 $ 499,728\nIncome tax expense 155,250 124,792 109,224\nInterest income (94,227) (36,268) (2,644)\nInterest expense 402,022 356,337 336,082\nOther expense 11,214 51,417 50,647\n(Gain) loss on debt extinguishment 35 (327) 115,125\nDepreciation, amortization, and accretion expense 1,843,665 1,739,374 1,660,524\nStock-based compensation expense 407,536 403,983 363,774\nTransaction costs 12,412 21,839 22,769\n(Gain) loss on asset sales (5,046) 3,976 (10,845)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 3,701,841 $ 3,369,700 $ 3,144,384\nOur adjusted EBITDA results have increased each year in total dollars due to the improved operating results\ndiscussed earlier in \"Results of Operations\", as well as due to the nature of our business model consisting of a\nrecurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature, as also discussed in\n\"Overview\".\nFunds from Operations (\"FFO\") and AFFO\nWe use FFO and AFFO, which are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in the REIT industry. FFO is\ncalculated in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment\nTrusts. FFO represents net income (loss), excluding gain (loss) from the disposition of real estate assets,\ndepreciation and amortization on real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-\ncontrolling interests' share of these items.\nIn presenting AFFO, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future\noperating performance. AFFO represents FFO excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate\nassets, accretion, stock-based compensation, stock-based charitable contributions, restructuring charges,\nimpairment charges, transaction costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment,\na contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, gain (loss)\non debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures, net income (loss) from\ndiscontinued operations, net of tax, and adjustments from FFO to AFFO for unconsolidated joint ventures' and\nnoncontrolling interests' share of these items. The adjustments for installation revenue, straight-line rent expense\nand contract costs are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results in\nthe consolidated statement of operations. We exclude the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt\ndiscounts and premiums as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings that\nhave no current or future cash obligations. We exclude gain (loss) on debt extinguishment since it generally\nrepresents the write-off of initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings or a cost that is incurred to reduce\nfuture interest costs and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance.

As a result, our revenues and certain\noperating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. dollar against major\ninternational currencies. During the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, the\nU.S. dollar was stronger relative to the Australian dollar and Japanese yen, which resulted in an unfavorable foreign\ncurrency impact on revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA, and a favorable foreign currency impact on\noperating expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, the U.S.\ndollar was weaker relative to the Euro and Singapore dollar, which resulted in a favorable foreign currency impact\non revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA, and an unfavorable foreign currency impact on operating\nexpenses. In order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding\nthe impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and\ncertain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. Our\nconstant currency presentation excludes the impact of our foreign currency cash flow hedging activities. Presenting\nconstant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in\nisolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, we have presented this non-GAAP financial\nmeasure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our results of operations. To present this\ninformation, our current period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities reporting in currencies other\nthan the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange\nrates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2022 are\nused as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2023 when comparing the year ended December 31,\n2023 with the year ended December 31, 2022).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nCustomer collections are our primary source of cash. We believe we have a strong customer base, and have\ncontinued to experience relatively strong collections. As of December 31, 2023, our principle sources of liquidity\nwere $2.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. In addition to our cash balance, we had $3.9 billion of additional\nliquidity available to us from our $4.0 billion revolving facility and general access to both the public and private debt\nand equity capital markets. We also have additional liquidity available to us from our 2022 ATM program, under\nwhich we may offer and sell from time to time our common stock in \"at the market\" transactions on either a spot or\nforward basis. As of December 31, 2023, we had $469.7 million available for sale remaining under the 2022 ATM\nProgram, in addition to approximately $499.4 million of net proceeds of unsettled forward sale transactions.\nWe believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities and\nexternal financing sources, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our\ndebt as it becomes due, distribution of dividends, and completion of our publicly-announced acquisitions, ordinary\ncosts to operate the business, and expansion projects.\nAs we continue to grow, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build out of new IBX\ndata centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as\npotential acquisitions and joint ventures. If the opportunity to expand is greater than planned we may further\nincrease the level of capital expenditure to support this growth as well as pursue additional business and real estate\nacquisitions or joint ventures, provided that we have or can access sufficient funding to pursue such expansion\nopportunities. We may elect to access the equity or debt markets from time to time opportunistically, particularly if\nfinancing is available on attractive terms. We will continue to evaluate our operating requirements and financial\nresources in light of future developments.\n67\nTable of Contents\nCash Flow\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 Change\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 3,216,595 $ 2,963,182 $ 253,413\nNet cash used in investing activities (3,224,364) (3,362,953) 138,589\nNet cash provided by financing activities 211,446 856,766 (645,320)\nOperating Activities\nOur cash provided by our operations is generated by colocation, interconnection, managed infrastructure and\nother revenues. Our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include compensation and related costs,\ninterest payments, other general corporate expenditures and taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities\nincreased by $253.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to December 31, 2022,\nprimarily driven by improved results of operations partially offset by increases in cash paid for costs and operating\nexpenses.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $138.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 as\ncompared to December 31, 2022, primarily due to:\n• $964.0 million decrease in business acquisitions; and\n• $8.8 million decrease in purchases of investments.\nThis decrease was partially offset by:\n• $503.0 million increase in capital expenditures;\n• $173.0 million decrease in the proceeds from the sale of assets to our Joint Ventures;\n• $136.1 million increase in the real estate acquisitions; and\n• $22.1 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of investments.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased by $645.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as\ncompared to December 31, 2022, primarily driven by:\n• $676.9 million decrease in proceeds from mortgages and loans payable;\n• $291.6 million decrease in proceeds from senior notes;\n• $222.7 million increase in dividend distributions;\n• $62.3 million decrease proceeds from the 2020 and 2022 ATM program; and\n• $14.7 million increase in repayments of finance lease liabilities.\nThe decrease was partially offset by:\n• $581.8 million decrease in the repayment of mortgage and loans payable;\n• $25.0 million increase in proceeds from redeemable non-controlling interest;\n• $10.8 million decrease in debt issuance costs; and\n• $5.3 million increase in proceeds from employee awards.\nMaterial Cash Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2023, our principal commitments were primarily comprised of:\n• approximately $13.2 billion of principal from our senior notes (gross of debt issuance cost and debt\ndiscount);\n68\nTable of Contents\n• approximately $3.0 billion of interest on mortgage payable, loans payable, senior notes and term loans,\nbased on their respective interest rates and recognized over the life of these instruments, and the credit\nfacility fee for the revolving credit facility;\n• $671.7 million of principal from our term loans, mortgage and loans payable (gross of debt issuance cost\nand debt discount);\n• approximately $5.4 billion of total lease payments, which represents lease payments under finance and\noperating lease arrangements, including renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised;\n• approximately $2.0 billion of unaccrued capital expenditure contractual commitments, primarily for IBX\nequipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided in connection with the work necessary to complete\nconstruction and open IBX data center expansion projects prior to making them available to customers for\ninstallation, the majority of which is payable within the next 12 months; and\n• approximately $1.7 billion of other non-capital purchase commitments, such as commitments to purchase\npower in select locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods, services\nor arrangements to be delivered or provided during 2024 and beyond, the majority of which is payable\nwithin the next two years.\nWe believe that our sources of liquidity, including our expected future operating cash flows, are sized to\nadequately meet both the near and long term material cash commitments for the foreseeable future. For further\ninformation on maturities of lease liabilities and debt instruments, see Notes 10 and 11, respectively, within the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Contractual Obligations\nWe have additional future equity contributions and commitments to the joint ventures with GIC and PGIM. For\nadditional information, see the \"Equity Method Investments\" in Note 6 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAdditionally, we entered into lease agreements with various landlords primarily for data center spaces and\nground leases which have not yet commenced as of December 31, 2023. For additional information, see “Maturities\nof Lease Liabilities” in Note 10 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our\nfinancial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an\nongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure\nthat our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its\nassumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are\nbelieved to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about\nthe carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because\nfuture events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions\nand estimates, and such differences could be material.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following accounting policies and estimates are the\nmost critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require\nsignificant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently\nuncertain:\n• Accounting for income taxes;\n• Accounting for business combinations;\n• Accounting for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;\n• Accounting for property, plant and equipment; and\n• Accounting for leases.\n69\nTable of Contents\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from\nDescription Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions\nAccounting for Income Taxes.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities The valuation of deferred tax assets As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had\nare recognized based on the future requires judgment in assessing the likely net total deferred tax liabilities of $331.8 million\ntax consequences attributable to future tax consequences of events that and $338.7 million, respectively.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket Risk\nThe following discussion about market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ\nmaterially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to\nchanges in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities,\nprimarily electricity.\nWe employ foreign currency forward and option contracts, cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate\nlocks for the purpose of hedging certain specifically identified exposures. The use of these financial instruments is\nintended to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates, but does\nnot eliminate such risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nInvestment Portfolio Risk\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities that is prioritized on meeting\nREIT asset requirements. All of our marketable securities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair\nvalue with changes in fair values recognized in net income. We consider various factors in determining whether we\nshould recognize an impairment charge for our securities, including the length of time and extent to which the fair\nvalue has been less than our cost basis and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time\nsufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. We anticipate that we will recover the entire cost basis of these\nsecurities and have determined that no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were\nrequired to be recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of\nmoney market funds. The amount in our investment portfolio that could be susceptible to market risk totaled $1.6\nbillion.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our outstanding debt. An immediate increase or decrease in\ncurrent interest rates from their position as of December 31, 2023 would not have a material impact on our interest\nexpense due to the fixed coupon rate on the majority of our debt obligations. However, the interest expense\nassociated with our senior credit facility and term loans that bear interest at variable rates could be affected. For\nevery 100-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, our annual interest expense could increase by\napproximately $6.4 million or decrease by approximately $6.4 million based on the total balance of our term loan\nborrowings as of December 31, 2023.\nWe periodically enter into interest rate locks to hedge the interest rate exposure created by anticipated fixed\nrate debt issuances, which are designated as cash flow hedges. When interest rate locks are settled, any\naccumulated gain or loss included as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) will be amortized to\ninterest expense over the term of the forecasted hedged transaction which is equivalent to the term of the interest\nrate locks. We also use cross-currency swaps to hedge our interest rate risk in our variable rate debt obligations by\nchanging the benchmark rate for a portion of the variable rate debt obligations from SONIA to SOFR. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the total notional amount of such cross-currency interest rate swaps was $280.3 million.\nThe fair value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of\nfixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate\nchanges may affect the fair value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The\nfair value of our mortgage and loans payable, which are not traded in the market, is estimated by considering our\ncredit rating, current rates available to us for debt of the same remaining maturities and the terms of the debt. The\nfair value of our other senior notes, which are traded in the market, was based on quoted market prices. The\nfollowing table represents the carrying value and estimated fair value of our mortgage and loans payable and senior\nnotes as of (in thousands):\n74\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nCarrying Carrying\nValue (1) Fair Value Value (1) Fair Value\nMortgage and loans payable $ 671,694 $ 684,222 $ 653,617 $ 666,387\nSenior notes 13,168,952 11,739,401 12,226,890 10,196,933\n(1) The carrying value is gross of debt issuance cost and debt discount.\nForeign Currency Risk\nTo help manage the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we have implemented a number\nof hedging programs, in particular (i) a cash flow hedging program to hedge the forecasted revenues and expenses\nin our EMEA region as well as our debt denominated in foreign-currencies, (ii) a balance sheet hedging program to\nhedge the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, and (iii) a net\ninvestment hedging program to hedge the long term investments in our foreign subsidiaries. Our hedging programs\nreduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements and their impact on the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nWe have entered into various foreign currency debt obligations. As of December 31, 2023, the total principal\namount of foreign currency debt obligations was $2.8 billion, including $1.2 billion denominated in Euro and\n$636.9 million denominated in British Pound, $549.2 million denominated in Japanese Yen, $356.6 million\ndenominated in Swiss Franc, $27.4 million denominated in Canadian Dollar and $5.8 million denominated in\nNigerian Naira. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar will impact\nthe amount of U.S. Dollars that we will require to settle the foreign currency debt obligations at maturity. If the\nU.S. Dollar would have been weaker or stronger by 10% in comparison to these foreign currencies as of\nDecember 31, 2023, we estimate our obligation to cash settle the principal of these foreign currency debt\nobligations in U.S. Dollars would have increased or decreased by approximately $310.1 million and $253.7 million,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2023, we have designated $1.5 billion of the total principal amount of foreign\ncurrency debt obligations as net investment hedges against our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. For a net\ninvestment hedge, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument designated as a net investment hedge are\nrecorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets.\nWe are also party to cross-currency interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2023, the total notional amount of\ncross-currency interest rate swap contracts was $4.5 billion. We have designated $3.1 billion of the total notional\namount of cross-currency swaps as net investment hedges against our investment in foreign subsidiaries and\n$280.3 million as cash flow hedges against a portion of our foreign currency denominated debt. The remaining $1.1\nbillion of cross-currency interest rate swaps were not designated as hedging instruments, but were used to offset\nremeasurement gains and losses from foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2022,\nthe total notional amount of cross-currency interest rate swap contracts was $4.2 billion. We have designated $3.9\nbillion of the total notional amount of cross-currency swaps as net investment hedges against our investment in\nforeign subsidiaries and $280.3 million as cash flow hedges against a portion of our foreign currency denominated\ndebt. The changes in the fair value of these designated swaps are recorded as a component of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets. If the U.S. Dollar weakened or strengthened by\n10% in comparison to foreign currencies, we estimate our obligation to cash settle these hedges would have\nincreased or decreased by approximately $362.3 million and $294.1 million, respectively.\nThe U.S. Dollar weakened relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023. This has impacted our consolidated financial position and results of\noperations during this period, including the amount of revenues that we reported. Continued strengthening or\nweakening of the U.S. Dollar will continue to impact us in future periods.\nWith the existing cash flow hedges in place, a hypothetical additional 10% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023 would have resulted in a reduction of our revenues and a reduction of\nour operating expenses including depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $281.9 million and\n$256.6 million, respectively.\nWith the existing cash flow hedges in place, a hypothetical additional 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar during\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 would have resulted in an increase of our revenues and an increase of our\n75\nTable of Contents\noperating expenses including depreciation and amortization expenses by approximately $345.2 million and $320.3\nmillion, respectively.\nCommodity Price Risk\nCertain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying\ncommodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price\nchanges are electricity, supplies and equipment used in our IBX data centers. We closely monitor the cost of\nelectricity at all of our locations. We have entered into various power contracts to purchase power at fixed prices in\ncertain locations in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the\nNetherlands, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the U.S.\nIn addition, as we are building new, or expanding existing, IBX data centers, we are subject to commodity price\nrisk for building materials related to the construction of these IBX data centers, such as steel and copper. In\naddition, the lead-time to procure certain pieces of equipment, such as generators, is substantial. Any delays in\nprocuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the construction of our IBX data centers could delay the anticipated\nopenings of these new IBX data centers and, as a result, increase the cost of these projects.\nWe do not currently employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to address commodity price risk\nother than the power contracts discussed above.\nITEM 8.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and\nFinancial Disclosure\nThere is no disclosure to report pursuant to Item 9.\nITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and\nour Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is\ndefined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange\nAct\"). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2023.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Because of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBased on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013), our\nmanagement concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is\nincluded herein on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n76\nTable of Contents\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed and operated to be effective at\nthe reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and\nprocedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no\nmatter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives\nof the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource\nconstraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent\nlimitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues\nand instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in\ndecision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally,\ncontrols can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by\nmanagement override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in\nachieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because\nof changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the\ninherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be\ndetected.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation\nrequired by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control\nover financial reporting.\nITEM 9B.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting\nas of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash\nflows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material\nrespects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial\nreporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.\nOur responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the auditing standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we\nplan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements\nare free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nF-1\nTable of Contents\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may\nbecome inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter\nin any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nIncome taxes - Real estate investment trust asset tests\nAs described in Notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded income tax\nexpense of $155.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company has been operating as a real\nestate investment trust for federal income tax purposes (\"REIT\") effective January 1, 2015. As a result, the\nCompany may deduct the dividends made to its stockholders from taxable income generated by the Company and\nits qualified REIT subsidiaries (\"QRSs\"). The Company’s qualification and taxation as a REIT depends on its\nsatisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on\na continuing basis. The Company’s ability to satisfy quarterly asset tests depends upon its analysis and the fair\nmarket values of its REIT and non-REIT assets. For purposes of the quarterly REIT asset tests, management\nestimates the fair market value of assets within its QRSs and taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”) using a discounted\ncash flow approach, by calculating the present value of forecasted future cash flows. Management applies discount\nrates based on industry benchmarks relative to the market and forecasting risks. Other significant assumptions used\nby management to estimate the fair market value of assets in QRSs and TRSs include projected revenue growth,\nprojected operating margins, and projected capital expenditures. Management revisits significant assumptions\nperiodically to reflect any changes due to the business or economic environment.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to income taxes - REIT asset\ntests is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the fair market value\nof REIT and non-REIT assets, which in turn led to a high degree of subjectivity in performing procedures relating to\nthe REIT asset tests, (ii) the significant audit effort and judgment in evaluating audit evidence related to the\nsignificant assumptions used in the REIT asset tests related to the discount rates, projected revenue growth,\nprojected operating margins, and projected capital expenditures, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of\nprofessionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to the REIT asset tests, including controls over management's determination of the fair market\nvalue of REIT and non-REIT assets. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process\nfor estimating the fair market value of the REIT and non-REIT assets; evaluating the appropriateness of the\nF-2\nTable of Contents\ndiscounted cash flow approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach;\nand evaluating the significant assumptions used by management related to the discount rates, projected revenue\ngrowth, projected operating margins, and projected capital expenditures. Evaluating management’s assumptions\nrelated to projected revenue growth, projected operating margins, and projected capital expenditures involved\nconsidering the current and past performance of the Company, economic and industry trends, as well as whether\nthese assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s discounted cash flow\napproach and the discount rate assumptions.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers

Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Business\nEquinix, Inc. (\"Equinix,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" or \"us\") was incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1998.\nEquinix provides colocation space and related offerings. Global enterprises, content providers, financial companies\nand network service providers rely upon Equinix's insight and expertise to safehouse and connect their most valued\ninformation assets. We operate International Business ExchangeTM (\"IBX®\") data centers, or IBX data centers,\nacross the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (\"EMEA\") and Asia-Pacific geographic regions where\ncustomers directly interconnect with a network ecosystem of partners and customers. More than 2,000 network\nservice providers offer access to the world's internet routes inside our IBX data centers. This access to internet\nroutes provides Equinix customers improved reliability and streamlined connectivity while significantly reducing\ncosts by reaching a critical mass of networks within a centralized physical location. We also invest in data center\njoint ventures or partnerships where we perform a variety of services described in Note 6. As of December 31, 2023,\nwe controlled and operated 241 IBX data centers in 70 markets around the world.\nWe have been operating as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes (\"REIT\") effective\nJanuary 1, 2015. See \"Income Taxes\" in Note 14 below for additional information.\nBasis of Presentation, Consolidation and Foreign Currency\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Equinix and its subsidiaries,\nincluding the acquisitions of:\n• Two data center sites in Mumbai, India from GPX India (\"GPX India Acquisition\") from September 1, 2021;\n• Four data centers as well as a subsea cable and terrestrial fiber network in West Africa acquired from\nMainOne Cable Company (\"MainOne\") from April 1, 2022; and\n• Four data centers in Chile and a data center in Peru acquired from Empresa Nacional De\nTelecomunicaciones S.A. (\"Entel\") from May 2, 2022 and August 1, 2022, respectively.\nWe consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those entities in which we own less than 100% of the\nequity but control, including Variable Interest Entities (\"VIEs\") for which we are the primary beneficiary. Our\ninvestment in consolidated VIEs have not been material to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the\nperiods presented. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Foreign\nexchange gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, including intercompany foreign currency\ntransactions, that are anticipated to be repaid within the foreseeable future, are reported within other income\n(expense) on our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. For additional information on the impact of\nforeign currencies to our consolidated financial statements, see \"Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\" in Note\n12.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with the accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of\nthe consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiod. Actual results could differ from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including,\nbut not limited to, those related to the allowance for credit losses, fair values of financial and derivative instruments,\nintangible assets and goodwill, assets acquired and liabilities assumed from acquisitions, useful lives of intangible\nassets and property, plant and equipment, leases, asset retirement obligations, other accruals, and income taxes.\nWe base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be\nreasonable.\nF-10\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments\nWe consider all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity from the date of purchase of 90 days or less to\nbe cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of money market mutual funds and certificates of deposit with\noriginal maturities up to 90 days. Short-term investments generally consist of certificates of deposit with original\nmaturities of between 90 days and 1 year. Publicly traded equity securities are measured at fair value with changes\nin the fair values recognized within other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations. We review\nour investment portfolio quarterly to determine if any securities may be other-than-temporarily impaired due to\nincreased credit risk, changes in industry or sector of a certain instrument or ratings downgrades.\nEquity Method Investments\nWe enter into joint venture or partnership arrangements to invest in certain entities for business development\nobjectives. At the inception of these arrangements and if a reconsideration event has occurred, we assess our\ninterests with such entities to determine whether any of the entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity\n(\"VIE\"). A VIE is an entity that either (i) has insufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without\nadditional subordinated financial support, or (ii) has equity investors who lack the characteristics of a controlling\nfinancial interest. We are required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of VIEs when we are deemed to be the\nprimary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the entity that meets both of the following criteria: (i) has the\npower to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (ii) has the\nobligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to\nthe VIE. For VIEs where we are not the primary beneficiary, and other joint ventures or partnerships that are not\nVIEs, where we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the entity, we account for those investments\nunder the equity method of accounting.\nEquity method investments are initially measured at cost, or at fair value when the investment represents a\nretained equity interest in a deconsolidated business or derecognized distinct non-financial assets. Equity\ninvestments are subsequently adjusted for cash contributions, distributions and our share of the income and losses\nof the investees. We record our equity method investments in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Our\nproportionate shares of the income or loss from our equity method investments are recorded in other income in the\nconsolidated statement of operations.\nWe review our investments quarterly to determine if any investments may be impaired considering both\nqualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant impact on the investees' fair value. We did not record\nany impairment charges related to our equity method investments for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022\nand 2021. For further information on our Equity Method Investments, see Note 6.\nNon-marketable Equity Investments\nWe also have investments in non-marketable equity securities, where we do not have the ability to exercise\nsignificant influence over the investees. We elected the measurement alternative under which the securities are\nmeasured at cost minus impairment, if any, and adjusted for changes resulting from qualifying observable price\nchanges. We record non-marketable equity investment in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. We review\nour non-marketable equity investments quarterly to determine if any investments may be impaired considering both\nqualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant impact on the investees' fair value. We did not record\nany impairment charges related to our non-marketable equity investments for the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022 and 2021.\nFinancial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash\nequivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and contract assets. Risks associated with cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments are mitigated by our investment policy, which limits our investing to only\nthose marketable securities rated at least A-1/P-1 Short Term Rating or A-/A3 Long Term Rating, as determined by\nindependent credit rating agencies.\nF-11\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nA significant portion of our customer base is comprised of businesses throughout the Americas. However, a\nportion of our revenues are derived from our EMEA and Asia-Pacific operations. The following table sets forth\npercentages of our revenues by geographic region for the years ended December 31:\n2023 2022 2021\nAmericas 44 % 46 % 46 %\nEMEA 35 % 32 % 32 %\nAsia-Pacific 21 % 22 % 22 %\nFor further information on segment information, see Note 17.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at our original cost or initial fair value for property, plant and equipment\nacquired through acquisitions, net of depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful lives of the respective assets. Buildings under finance leases, Leasehold improvements and\nintegral equipment at leased locations are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of\nthe asset or improvement.\nWe capitalize certain internal and external costs associated with the development and purchase of internal-use\nsoftware in property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. This includes costs incurred in\ncloud computing arrangements (\"CCA\"), where it is both feasible and contractually permissible without significant\npenalty for us to take possession of the software. All other CCAs are considered service contracts, and the licensing\nand implementation costs incurred associated with such contracts are capitalized in other assets on the\nconsolidated balance sheets. Capitalized internal-use software costs and capitalized implementation costs are\namortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software or arrangements.\nOur estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are generally as follows:\nCore systems 3 - 40 years\nBuildings 12 - 60 years\nLeasehold improvements 12 - 40 years\nPersonal Property, including capitalized internal-use software 3 - 10 years\nOur construction in progress includes direct and indirect expenditures for the construction and expansion of IBX\ndata centers and is stated at original cost. We contracted out substantially all of the construction and expansion\nefforts of our IBX data centers to independent contractors under construction contracts. Construction in progress\nincludes costs incurred under construction contracts including project management services, engineering and\nschematic design services, design development, construction services and other construction-related fees and\nservices. In addition, we capitalized interest costs during the construction phase. Once an IBX data center or\nexpansion project becomes operational, these capitalized costs are allocated to certain property, plant and\nequipment categories and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the underlying assets.\nWe review our property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group may not be recoverable, such as a significant\ndecrease in market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or an\nasset group is being used or its physical condition, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate\nthat could affect the value of an asset or an asset group or a continuous deterioration of our financial condition.\nRecoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of an\nasset or an asset group to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or\nthe asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset or the asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future\ncash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or the\nasset group exceeds the fair value of the asset. We did not record any impairment charges related to our property,\nplant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nWe enter into non-cancellable lease arrangements as the lessee primarily for our data center spaces, office\nspaces and equipment. Assets acquired through finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, net\non the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, a portion of our property, plant and equipment are used for revenue\narrangements which are accounted for as operating leases where we are the lessor.\nAssets Held for Sale\nAssets and liabilities to be disposed of that meet all of the criteria to be classified as held for sale are reported at\nthe lower of their carrying amounts or fair values less costs to sell. We did not record any impairment charges\nrelated to assets held for sale during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Assets are not\ndepreciated or amortized while they are classified as held for sale. For further information on our assets held for\nsale, see Note 5.\nAsset Retirement Costs and Asset Retirement Obligations\nOur asset retirement obligations are primarily related to our IBX data centers, of which the majority are leased\nunder long-term arrangements and are required to be returned to the landlords in their original condition. The\nmajority of our IBX data center leases have been subject to significant development by us in order to convert them\nfrom, in most cases, vacant buildings or warehouses into IBX data centers. The fair value of a liability for an asset\nretirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred. The associated retirement costs are\ncapitalized and included as part of the carrying value of the long-lived asset and amortized over the useful life of the\nasset. Subsequent to the initial measurement, we accrete the liability in relation to the asset retirement obligations\nover time and the accretion expense is recorded as a cost of revenue. For further information on our asset\nretirement obligations, see Note 7.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe have three reportable segments comprised of the 1) Americas, 2) EMEA and 3) Asia-Pacific geographic\nregions, which we also determined are our reporting units. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at\nleast annually or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill is not recoverable.\nWe assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit\nis less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors considered in the assessment include industry and market\nconditions, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If, after\nassessing the qualitative factors, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit\nis less than its carrying value, then performing a quantitative impairment test is unnecessary. However, if we\nconclude otherwise, then we are required to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative\nimpairment test, which is used to identify both the existence of impairment and the amount of impairment loss,\ncompares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting\nunit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the carrying value of\nthe reporting unit exceeds its fair value, any excess of the reporting unit goodwill carrying value over the respective\nimplied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we concluded that it was more likely than not that goodwill attributed\nto our Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific reporting units was not impaired as the fair value of each reporting unit\nexceeded the carrying value of its respective reporting unit, including goodwill.\nSubstantially all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line\nmethod over their estimated period of benefit. We perform a review of intangible assets for impairment by assessing\nevents or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nRecoverability of assets to be held and used is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to\nestimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the\nasset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by\nwhich the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. We did not record any impairment\ncharges related to our other intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. For\nfurther information on goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note 3 and Note 7 below.\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nDebt Issuance Costs\nCosts and fees incurred upon debt issuances are capitalized and are amortized over the life of the related debt\nbased on the effective interest method. Such amortization is included as a component of interest expense. Debt\nissuance costs related to outstanding debt are presented as a reduction of the carrying amount of the debt\nobligation and debt issuance costs related to the revolving credit facility are presented as other assets. For further\ninformation on debt facilities, see Note 11 below.\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\nWe utilize foreign currency and interest rate derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy.\nForeign currency derivatives help to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on (i) our expected\nrevenues and expenses in the EMEA region, (ii) investments in our foreign operations and (iii) certain monetary\nassets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Interest rate derivatives, on the other hand, are used to\nmanage the interest rate risk associated with anticipated fixed-rate debt issuances.\nThese measures allow us to effectively control our financial exposure and are not used for speculative\npurposes. We recognize all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for\nchanges in the value of a derivative depends on whether the contract qualifies and has been designated for hedge\naccounting. In order to qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be considered highly effective at reducing the\nrisk associated with the exposure being hedged and there must be documentation of the risk management objective\nand strategy, including identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item and the risk exposure, and the\neffectiveness assessment methodology. Hedge designations are reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess whether\ncircumstances have changed that would disrupt the hedge instrument's relationship to the forecasted transactions\nor net investment.\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe instruments we designate as cash flow hedges include foreign currency forwards and options, cross-\ncurrency swaps as well as interest rate locks. For cash flow hedges, we use a regression analysis at the time they\nare designated to assess their effectiveness.\nWe use foreign currency forwards and options to hedge our foreign currency transaction exposure for\nforecasted revenues and expenses in our EMEA region between the U.S. Dollar and foreign currencies, primarily\nthe British Pound and the Euro. We use the forward method to assess effectiveness of qualifying foreign currency\nforwards that are designated as cash flow hedges, whereby, the change in the fair value of the derivative is\nrecorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the same line item in the consolidated statement\nof operations that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings.\nWe use the spot method to assess effectiveness of qualifying foreign currency exchange options that are\ndesignated as cash flow hedges, whereby, the change in fair value due to foreign currency exchange spot rates is\nrecorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the same line item in the consolidated statement\nof operations that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings,\nand the change in fair value of the excluded component is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and\namortized on a straight-line basis to the same line item in the consolidated statement of operations that is used to\npresent the earnings effect of the hedged item. When two or more derivative instruments in combination are jointly\ndesignated as a cash flow hedging instrument, as with foreign currency exchange option collars, they are treated as\na single instrument. If the hedge relationship is terminated for any derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, then\nthe change in fair value of the derivative recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) is recognized in earnings\nwhen the previously hedged item affects earnings, consistent with the original hedge strategy.\nWe also utilize cross-currency interest rate swaps, which we designate as cash flow hedges, to manage the\nforeign currency exposure associated with a portion of our foreign currency-denominated debt. We assess the\neffectiveness of cross-currency interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges using the spot method.\nThe fair value changes are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), and when the hedged item impacts\nearnings, the change in fair value due to foreign currency exchange spot rates is reclassified to the corresponding\nline item in the consolidated statement of operations.\nWe use interest rate derivative instruments such as treasury locks and swap locks, collectively referred to as\n\"interest rate locks\", to manage interest rate exposure created by anticipated fixed rate debt issuances. An interest\nF-14\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nrate lock is a synthetic forward sale of a benchmark interest rate, which is settled in cash based upon the difference\nbetween an agreed upon rate at inception and the prevailing benchmark rate at settlement. It effectively fixes the\nbenchmark rate component of an upcoming debt issuance. The interest rate lock transactions are designated as\ncash flow hedges, with all changes in value reported in other comprehensive income (loss). Subsequent to\nsettlement, amounts in other comprehensive income are amortized to interest expense over the term of the interest\nrate locks.\nFor hedge relationships that are discontinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur\naccording to the original strategy, any related derivative amounts recorded in other comprehensive income (loss)\nare immediately recognized in earnings.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe employ cross-currency swaps, which we designate as net investment hedges, to hedge the currency\nexposure associated with our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. We use the spot method to assess\neffectiveness of cross-currency interest rate swaps that are designated as net investment hedges, whereby, the\nchange in fair value due to foreign currency exchange spot rates is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss)\nand the change in fair value of the excluded component is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and\namortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis.\nOccasionally, we also use foreign exchange forward contracts, which we designate as net investment hedges,\nto hedge against the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on a portion of our net investment in the foreign\nsubsidiaries. We use the spot method to assess effectiveness of qualifying foreign currency forwards that are\ndesignated as net investment hedges, whereby, the change in fair value due to foreign currency exchange spot\nrates is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and the change in fair value of the excluded component is\nrecorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis.\nNon-designated Hedges\nForeign currency gains or losses associated with derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments for\naccounting purposes are recorded within other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations, with\nthe exception of (i) foreign currency embedded derivatives contained in certain of our customer contracts and (ii)\nforeign exchange forward contracts that are entered into to hedge the accounting impact of the foreign currency\nembedded derivatives, which are recorded within revenues in our consolidated statements of operations. For further\ninformation on derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 8 below.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and derivative instruments\nrepresent their fair value, while our accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and accrued\nproperty, plant and equipment approximate their fair value due primarily to the short-term maturity of the related\ninstruments. The fair value of our debt, which is traded in the public debt market, is based on quoted market prices.\nThe fair value of our debt, which is not publicly traded, is estimated by considering our credit rating, current rates\navailable to us for debt of the same remaining maturities and terms of the debt.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe measure and report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including our\ninvestments in money market funds, certificates of deposit, publicly traded equity securities and derivatives.\nWe also follow the accounting standard for the measurement of fair value for non-financial assets and liabilities\non a nonrecurring basis. These include:\n• Non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination or\nother new basis event, but not measured at fair value in subsequent reporting periods;\n• Reporting units and non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities measured at fair value for goodwill\nimpairment tests;\n• Indefinite-lived intangible assets measured at fair value for impairment assessments;\nF-15\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n• Non-financial long-lived assets or asset groups measured at fair value for impairment assessments or\ndisposal;\n• Asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value but not subsequently measured at fair value; and\n• Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are measured at fair value less costs to sell and reported at\nthe lower of the carrying amounts or the fair values less costs to sell.\nFor further information on fair value measurements, see Note 5 and Note 9 below.\nLeases\nWe enter into lease arrangements primarily for land, data center spaces, office spaces and equipment. At its\ninception, we determine whether an arrangement is or contains a lease. We recognize a right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset\nand lease liability on the consolidated balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months, including\nrenewals options that we are reasonably certain to exercise.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. Lease liabilities represent our\nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are classified and recognized\nat the commencement date. When there is a lease modification, including a change in lease term, we reassess its\nclassification and remeasure the ROU asset and lease liability.\nROU lease liabilities are measured based on the present value of fixed lease payments over the lease term.\nROU assets consist of (i) initial measurement of the lease liability; (ii) lease payments made to the lessor at or\nbefore the commencement date less any lease incentives received; and (iii) initial direct costs incurred by us. Lease\npayments may vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement, including\nchanges in inflation indices. Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate (such as the Consumer\nPrice Index or a market interest rate) are included in the measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities using the\nindex or rate at the commencement date. Subsequent changes to lease payments based on changes to the index\nand rate are accounted for as variable lease payments and recognized in the period they are incurred. Variable\nlease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are excluded from the measurement of ROU assets and\nlease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Since most\nof our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our own incremental borrowing rate (\"IBR\") on a collateralized\nbasis in determining the present value of lease payments. We utilize a market-based approach to estimate the IBR.\nThe approach requires significant judgment. Therefore, we utilize different data sets to estimate IBRs via an\nanalysis of (i) sovereign rates; (ii) yields on our outstanding public debt; and (iii) indicative pricing on both secured\nand unsecured debt received from banking partners. We also apply adjustments to account for considerations\nrelated to (i) tenor; and (ii) country credit rating that may not be fully incorporated by the aforementioned data sets.\nThe majority of our lease arrangements include options to extend the lease. If we are reasonably certain to\nexercise such options, the periods covered by the options are included in the lease term. The depreciable lives of\ncertain fixed assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term. We have certain leases\nwith a term of 12 months or less. For such leases, we elected not to recognize any ROU asset or lease liability on\nthe consolidated balance sheet. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. We elected to\naccount for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all classes of underlying assets\nfor which we have identified as lease arrangements. For further information on leases, see Note 10 below.\nRevenue\nRevenue Recognition\nEquinix derives more than 90% of its revenues from recurring revenue streams, consisting primarily of (1)\ncolocation, which includes the licensing of cabinet space and power; (2) interconnection offerings; (3) managed\ninfrastructure solutions and (4) other revenues consisting of rental income from tenants or subtenants. The\nremainder of our revenues are from non-recurring revenue streams, such as installation revenues, professional\nservices, contract settlements and equipment sales. Revenues by service lines and geographic areas are included\nin segment information. For further information on segment information, see Note 17 below.\nRevenues are recognized when control of these products and services is transferred to its customers, in an\namount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products and services.\nRevenues from recurring revenue streams are generally billed monthly and recognized ratably over the term of the\nF-16\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\ncontract, generally 1 to 5 years for IBX data center colocation customers. Non-recurring installation fees, although\ngenerally paid upfront upon installation, are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term. Professional\nservice fees and equipment sales are recognized in the period when the services were provided. For the contracts\nwith customers that contain multiple performance obligations, we account for individual performance obligations\nseparately if they are distinct or as a series of distinct obligations if the individual performance obligations meet the\nseries criteria. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that\nshould be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. The transaction price is\nallocated to the separate performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling\nprice is determined based on overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions, geographic\nlocations and other factors. Other judgments include determining if any variable consideration should be included in\nthe total contract value of the arrangement such as price increases.\nRevenue is generally recognized on a gross basis as a principal versus on a net basis as an agent, as we are\nprimarily responsible for fulfilling the contract, bear inventory risk and have discretion in establishing the price when\nselling to the customer. To the extent we do not meet the criteria for recognizing revenue on a gross basis, we\nrecord the revenue on a net basis. Revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their\ncontract early, is treated as a contract modification and recognized ratably over the remaining term of the contract, if\nany.\nWe guarantee certain service levels, such as uptime, as outlined in individual customer contracts. If these\nservice levels are not achieved due to any failure of the physical infrastructure or offerings, or in the event of certain\ninstances of damage to customer infrastructure within our IBX data centers, we would reduce revenue for any\ncredits or cash payments given to the customer. Historically, these credits and cash payments have not been\nsignificant.\nWe enter into revenue contracts with customers for data centers and office spaces, which contain both lease\nand non-lease components. We elected to adopt the practical expedient which allows lessors to combine lease and\nnon-lease components, by underlying class of asset, and account for them as one component if they have the same\ntiming and pattern of transfer. The combined component is accounted for in accordance with the current lease\naccounting guidance (\"Topic 842\") if the lease component is predominant, and in accordance with the current\nrevenue accounting guidance (\"Topic 606\") if the non-lease component is predominant. In general, customer\ncontracts for data centers are accounted for under Topic 606 and customer contracts for the use of office space are\naccounted for under Topic 842, which are generally classified as operating leases and are recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the lease term.\nCertain customer agreements are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the parties\ninvolved. Under applicable accounting rules, we are deemed to have foreign currency forward contracts embedded\nin these contracts. We assessed these embedded contracts and concluded them to be foreign currency embedded\nderivatives (see Note 8). These instruments are separated from their host contracts and held on our consolidated\nbalance sheet at their fair value. The majority of these foreign currency embedded derivatives arise in certain of our\nsubsidiaries where the local currency is the subsidiary's functional currency and the customer contract is\ndenominated in the U.S. dollar. Changes in their fair values are recognized within revenues in our consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections result in accounts receivables, contract assets\nand deferred revenues. A receivable is recorded at the invoice amount, net of an allowance for credit losses and is\nrecognized in the period when we have transferred products or provided services to our customers and when its\nright to consideration is unconditional. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms\ngenerally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 45 days. In instances where the timing of revenue\nrecognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined that our contracts generally do not include a\nsignificant financing component. We assess collectability based on a number of factors, including past transaction\nhistory with the customer and the credit-worthiness of the customer. We generally do not request collateral from our\ncustomers although in certain cases we obtain a security interest in a customer's equipment placed in our IBX data\ncenters or obtain a deposit. We also maintain an allowance for estimated losses on a lifetime loss basis resulting\nfrom the inability of our customers to make required payments for which we had expected to collect the revenues in\naccordance with the credit loss guidance accounting guidance (\"Topic 326\"). If the financial condition of our\ncustomers were to deteriorate or if they became insolvent, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make\nF-17\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\npayments, greater allowances for credit losses may be required. Management specifically analyzes current\neconomic news, conditions and trends, historical loss rates, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness,\nchanges in customer payment terms and any applicable long term forecast when evaluating revenue recognition\nand the adequacy of our reserves for our accounts receivable. Any amounts that were previously recognized as\nrevenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectable are charged to bad debt expense included in sales and\nmarketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations. A specific bad debt reserve of up to the full amount\nof a particular invoice value is provided for certain problematic customer balances. An additional reserve is\nestablished for all other accounts based on an analysis of historical credits issued. Delinquent account balances are\nwritten off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable.\nA contract asset exists when we have transferred products or provided services to our customers but customer\npayment is conditioned on reasons other than the passage of time, such as upon the satisfaction of additional\nperformance obligations. Certain contracts include terms related to price arrangements such as price increases and\nfree months. We recognize revenues ratably over the contract term, which could potentially give rise to contract\nassets during certain periods of the contract term. Contract assets are recorded in other current assets and other\nassets in the consolidated balance sheet.\nDeferred revenue (a contract liability) is recognized when we have an unconditional right to a payment before\nwe transfer the products or services to customers. Deferred revenue is included in other current liabilities and other\nliabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet.\nContract Costs\nDirect and indirect incremental costs solely related to obtaining revenue contracts are capitalized as costs of\nobtaining a contract, when they are incremental and if they are expected to be recovered. Such costs consist\nprimarily of commission fees and sales bonuses, as well as indirect related payroll costs. In 2023, contract costs\nwere amortized over the estimated period of approximately 6 years on a straight-line basis. We elected to apply the\npractical expedient which allows us to expense contract costs when incurred, if the amortization period is one year\nor less.\nFor further information on revenue recognition, see Note 2 below.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets\nand liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to differences that exist between\nthe financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as tax\nattributes such as net operating loss, capital loss and tax credits carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the\nyear in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets\nand liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nValuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are\nexpected more likely than not to be realized in the future. A tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be\nrecognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely\non its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authority's widely understood administrative practices\nand precedents. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that has a greater than 50\npercent likelihood of being realized. Any subsequent changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the\nperiod in which the change in judgment occurs.\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 taxable year.\nAs a result, we may deduct the dividends distributed to our stockholders from taxable income generated by us and\nthat of our qualified REIT subsidiaries (\"QRSs\"). Our dividends paid deduction generally eliminates the U.S. federal\ntaxable income of our REIT and QRSs, resulting in no U.S. federal income tax due. However, our domestic taxable\nREIT subsidiaries (\"TRSs\") are subject to the U.S. corporate income taxes on any taxable income generated by\nthem. In addition, our foreign operations are subject to local income taxes regardless of whether the foreign\noperations are operated as QRSs or TRSs.\nOur qualification and taxation as a REIT depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational,\ndistribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. Our ability to satisfy quarterly\nF-18\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nasset tests depends upon our analysis and the fair market values of our REIT and non-REIT assets. For purposes\nof the quarterly REIT asset tests, we estimate the fair market value of assets within our QRSs and TRSs using a\ndiscounted cash flow approach, by calculating the present value of forecasted future cash flows. We apply discount\nrates based on industry benchmarks relative to the market and forecasting risks. Other significant assumptions used\nto estimate the fair market value of assets in QRSs and TRSs include projected revenue growth, projected\noperating margins, and projected capital expenditures. We revisit significant assumptions periodically to reflect any\nchanges due to business or economic environment.\nFor further information on income taxes, see Note 14 below.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date for all stock-based awards made to employees\nand directors based on the fair value of the award. We generally recognize stock-based compensation expense on\na straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. However,\nfor awards with market conditions or performance conditions, stock-based compensation expense is recognized on\na straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each vesting tranche of the award. We elected to\nestimate forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rates.\nWe grant restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") or restricted stock awards (\"RSAs\") to our employees and these equity\nawards generally have only a service condition. We grant RSUs to our executives that generally have a service and\nperformance condition or a service and market condition. Performance conditions contained in an equity award are\ngenerally tied to our financial performance. We assess the probability of meeting these performance conditions on a\nquarterly basis. The majority of our RSUs vest over four years, although certain equity awards for executives vest\nover a range of two to four years. Our RSAs vest over three years. The valuation of RSUs and RSAs with only a\nservice condition or a service and performance condition requires no significant assumptions as the fair value for\nthese types of equity awards is based solely on the fair value of our stock price on the date of grant. We use a\nMonte Carlo simulation option-pricing model to determine the fair value of RSUs with a service and market\ncondition.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of our employee stock purchase plan\n(\"ESPP\"). The determination of the fair value of shares purchased under the ESPP is affected by assumptions\nregarding a number of complex and subjective variables including our expected stock price volatility over the term of\nthe awards and actual and projected employee stock purchase behaviors. We estimated the expected volatility by\nusing the average historical volatility of its common stock that it believed was best representative of future volatility.\nThe risk-free interest rate used was based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the\nexpected term of the equity awards. The expected dividend rate used was based on average dividend yields and\nthe expected term used was equal to the term of each purchase window.\nThe accounting standard for stock-based compensation does not allow the recognition of unrealized tax benefits\nassociated with the tax deductions in excess of the compensation recorded (excess tax benefit) until the excess tax\nbenefit is realized (i.e., reduces taxes payable). We record the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation\nas income tax expense through the statement of operations. For further information on stock-based compensation,\nsee Note 13 below.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe financial position of foreign subsidiaries is translated using the exchange rates in effect at the end of the\nperiod, while income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Gains or\nlosses from translation of foreign operations where the local currency is the functional currency are included as\nother comprehensive income (loss). The net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are\nrecorded in net income in the period incurred and recorded within other income (expense). Certain intercompany\nbalances are designated as loans of a long-term investment-type nature. Accordingly, exchange gains and losses\nassociated with these long-term intercompany balances are recorded as a component of other comprehensive\nincome (loss), along with translation adjustments.\nEarnings Per Share\nWe compute basic and diluted EPS for net income. Basic EPS is computed using net income and the weighted-\nF-19\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\naverage number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed using net income and the weighted-\naverage number of common shares outstanding plus any dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Dilutive\npotential common shares include the assumed exercise, vesting and issuance activity of employee equity awards\nusing the treasury stock method. For further information on earnings per share, see Note 4 below.\nTreasury Stock\nWe account for treasury stock under the cost method. When treasury stock is re-issued at a higher price than its\ncost, the difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital to the extent that there are gains to\noffset the losses. If there are no treasury stock gains in additional paid-in capital, the losses are recorded as a\ncomponent of retained earnings.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update\n(\"ASU\") 2023-07, Segment Reporting (\"Topic 280\"): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosure. The ASU is\nintended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about\nsignificant segment expenses. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and interim\nperiods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption is permitted, and retrospective\nadoption required. We are currently evaluating the extent of the impact of this ASU on disclosures in our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (\"Topic 740\"): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures. This ASU is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures\nby requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2)\nincome taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2024 and to be applied prospectively, with retrospective application and early adoption both permitted. We are\ncurrently evaluating the extent of the impact of this ASU on disclosures in our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Standards Recently Adopted\nSupplier Finance Programs\nIn September 2022, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2022-04, \"Liabilities-Supplier Finance\nPrograms (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations\". This guidance requires annual\nand interim disclosures for entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of goods and\nservices. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted,\nexcept for the amendment on roll forward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December\n15, 2023. On January 1, 2023, we adopted this ASU and the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on\nour consolidated financial statements.\nReference Rate Reform\nIn March 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (\"Topic 848\"): Facilitation of the Effects of\nReference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. In addition, FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform\n(\"Topic 848\"), which clarifies the scope of Topic 848. Collectively, the guidance provides optional expedients and\nexceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate\nreform if certain criteria are met. ASU 2021-01 is effective upon issuance and ASU 2020-04 was effective for all\nentities as of March 12, 2020, and together remained effective through December 31, 2022. In December 2022,\nFASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (\"Topic 848\"): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848.\nBecause the current relief in Topic 848 may not cover a period of time during which a significant number of\nmodifications may take place, the amendments in this Update defer the sunset date of Topic 848 from December\n31, 2022 to December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848. We\nadopted these ASUs upon their respective issuances and there was no impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements as a result of adopting the guidance. We will evaluate our debt, derivative and lease contracts that may\nbecome eligible for modification relief and may apply the elections prospectively as needed.\nF-20\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nIncome Taxes\nIn December 2019, FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (\"Topic 740\"): Simplifying the Accounting for\nIncome Taxes. The ASU simplifies accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general\nprinciples in Topic 740. The ASU also improves consistent application of and simplifies generally accepted\naccounting principles (\"GAAP\") for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The ASU\nis effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020, with\nearly adoption permitted including adoption in any interim period for periods for which financial statements have not\nyet been issued. On January 1, 2021, we adopted this ASU on a prospective basis and the adoption of this standard\ndid not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nDebt with Conversion and Other Options\nIn August 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-06: Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20)\nand Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). The ASU simplifies the accounting\nfor convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and\nconvertible preferred stock and modifies the disclosure requirement for the convertible instruments. Additionally, this\nASU improves the consistency of EPS calculations by eliminating the use of the treasury stock method to calculate\ndiluted EPS for convertible instruments and clarifies certain areas under the current EPS guidance. The ASU is\neffective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2021, with\nearly adoption permitted at the beginning of the fiscal year after December 15, 2020. On January 1, 2022, we\nadopted this ASU on a prospective basis and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nBusiness Combinations\nIn October 2021, FASB issued ASU 2021-08 Business Combinations (\"Topic 805\"): Accounting for Contract\nAssets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. The ASU requires contract assets and contract\nliabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date\nin accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as if it had originated the contracts. Under\nthe current business combinations guidance, such assets and liabilities were recognized by the acquirer at fair value\non the acquisition date. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning\nafter December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. On April 1, 2022, we early adopted this ASU and the\nadoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nF-21\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n2. Revenue\nContract Balances\nThe following table summarizes the opening and closing balances of our accounts receivable, net; contract\nassets, current; contract assets, non-current; deferred revenue, current; and deferred revenue, non-current (in\nthousands):\nAccounts Contract Contract Deferred Deferred\nreceivable, assets, assets, non- revenue, revenue,\nnet (1) current current current non-current\nBeginning balances as of January 1, 2023 $ 855,380 $ 27,608 $ 55,405 $ 132,090 $ 155,334\nClosing balances as of December 31, 2023 1,003,792 51,991 85,912 124,945 154,047\nIncrease (Decrease) $ 148,412 $ 24,383 $ 30,507 $ (7,145) $ (1,287)\nBeginning balances as of January 1, 2022 $ 681,809 $ 65,392 $ 55,486 $ 109,736 $ 87,495\nClosing balances as of December 31, 2022 855,380 27,608 55,405 132,090 155,334\nIncrease (Decrease) $ 173,571 $ (37,784) $ (81) $ 22,354 $ 67,839\n(1) The net change in our allowance for credit losses was insignificant during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe difference between the opening and closing balances of our accounts receivable, net, contract assets and\ndeferred revenues primarily results from revenue growth and the timing difference between the satisfaction of our\nperformance obligation and the customer's payment during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The\namounts of revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 from the opening\ndeferred revenue balance were $95.1 million, $82.8 million and $93.1 million, respectively. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, no impairment loss related to contract balances was recognized in the\nconsolidated statement of operations.\nContract Costs\nThe ending balances of net capitalized contract costs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $422.6 million\nand $371.3 million, respectively, which were included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. $103.2\nmillion, $96.0 million, and $87.6 million of contract costs were amortized during years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022, and 2021, respectively, which were included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statement of\noperations.\nRemaining performance obligations\nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately $10.1 billion of total revenues, including deferred installation\nrevenues, are expected to be recognized in future periods. Most of our revenue contracts have an initial term\nvarying from one to five years, and thereafter, automatically renew in one-year increments. Included in the\nremaining performance obligations are contracts that are either under the initial term or under one-year renewal\nperiods. We expect to recognize approximately 70% of our remaining performance obligations as revenues over the\nnext two years, with more revenues expected to be recognized in the first year due to the impact of contract\nrenewals. The remainder of the balance is generally expected to be recognized over the next three to five years. We\nestimate our remaining performance obligations at a point in time. Actual amounts and timing of revenue recognition\nmay differ from these estimates due to changes in actual deployments dates, contract modifications, renewals and/\nor terminations.\nThe remaining performance obligations do not include variable consideration related to unsatisfied performance\nobligations such as the usage of metered power, service fees from xScaleTM data centers that are based on future\nevents or actual costs incurred in the future, or any contracts that could be terminated without any significant\npenalties including the majority of interconnection revenues. The remaining performance obligations above include\nrevenues to be recognized in the future related to arrangements where we are considered the lessor.\nF-22\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n3. Acquisitions\n2022 Acquisitions\nAcquisition of Entel Chile Data Centers (the \"Entel Chile Acquisition\") and Entel Peru Data Center (the \"Entel Peru\nAcquisition\")\nOn May 2, 2022, we further expanded in Latin America through an acquisition of four data centers in Chile from\nEntel, a leading Chilean telecommunications provider, for a total purchase consideration of $638.3 million at the\nexchange rate in effect on that date. On August 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of a data center in Peru from\nEntel for a total purchase consideration of $80.3 million at the exchange rate in effect on that date. The Entel Chile\nAcquisition and Entel Peru Acquisition support our ongoing expansion to meet customer demand in the Latin\nAmerican market.\nAcquisition of MainOne (the \"MainOne Acquisition\")\nOn April 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of MainOne, which consisted of four\ndata centers as well as a subsea cable and terrestrial fiber network. We acquired MainOne and its assets for a total\npurchase consideration of $278.4 million. The MainOne Acquisition supports our ongoing expansion to meet\ncustomer demand in the West African market.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nEach of the acquisitions noted above constitute a business under the accounting standard for business\ncombinations and, therefore, were accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition method of\naccounting. Under this method, the total purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nmeasured at fair value on the date of acquisition, except where alternative measurement is required under GAAP.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we completed the detailed valuation analysis and the final allocation\nof purchase price for the Entel Chile, Entel Peru, and MainOne Acquisitions.\nA summary of the final allocation of total purchase consideration is presented as follows (in thousands):\nEntel Chile Entel Peru MainOne (2)\nCash and cash equivalents $ — $ — $ 33,026\nAccounts receivable — — 9,431\nOther current assets 12,424 — 21,988\nProperty, plant and equipment 81,132 13,423 239,583\nIntangible assets 153,489 10,000 54,800\nGoodwill 380,867 46,285 110,665\nDeferred tax and other assets 12,090 10,801 5,879\nTotal assets acquired 640,002 80,509 475,372\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities (195) — (18,525)\nOther current liabilities (1) — — (13,061)\nMortgage and loans payable — — (25,944)\nDeferred tax and other liabilities (1) (1,463) (167) (139,492)\nNet assets acquired $ 638,344 $ 80,342 $ 278,350\n(1) For the MainOne Acquisition, other current liabilities includes $9.9 million of deferred revenue - current and the other\nliabilities includes $95.4 million of deferred revenue - non-current.\n(2) For the MainOne Acquisition, the purchase price allocation adjustments since the provisional amounts reported as of\nDecember 31, 2022 were not significant.\nF-23\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nProperty, plant and equipment\nThe fair values of property, plant and equipment acquired from these three acquisitions were estimated by\napplying the cost approach, with the exception of land, which we estimated by applying the market approach. The\nkey assumptions of the cost approach include replacement cost new, physical deterioration, functional and\neconomic obsolescence, economic useful life, remaining useful life, age and effective age.\nIntangible assets\nThe following table presents certain information on the acquired intangible assets (in thousands):\nEstimated Weighted-average\nUseful Lives Estimated Useful\nIntangible Assets Fair Value (Years) Lives (Years) Discount Rate\nEntel Chile:\nCustomer relationships (1) $ 153,489 12.0 - 15.0 14.0 8.5% - 9.5%\nEntel Peru:\nCustomer relationships (1) 10,000 15.0 15.0 7.0 %\nMainOne:\nCustomer relationships (1) 51,500 10.0 - 15.0 14.0 11.5 %\nTrade names (2) 3,300 5.0 5.0 11.5 %\n(1) The fair value was estimated by calculating the present value of estimated future operating cash flows generated from\nexisting customers less costs to realize the revenue and/or by using benchmarking. The rates reflect the nature of the\nassets as they relate to the risk and uncertainty of the estimated future operating cash flows, as well as the risk of the\ncountry within which the acquired business operates.\n(2) The fair value of the MainOne trade name was estimated using the relief from royalty method under the income approach.\nWe applied a relief from royalty rate of 1.0%.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is attributable to the workforce of the acquired business and the\nprojected revenue increase expected to arise from future customers after the acquisition. Goodwill from the Entel\nChile and Entel Peru acquisitions is attributable to the Americas region. Goodwill from the Entel Chile acquisition is\namortizable for local tax purposes, while goodwill from the Entel Peru acquisition is not expected to be amortizable\nfor local tax purposes. Goodwill from the MainOne Acquisition is attributable to the EMEA region and is generally not\ndeductible for local tax purposes.\nRevenues and net income from operations\nThe operating results of the Entel Peru and Entel Chile acquisitions are reported in the Americas region and the\noperating results of the MainOne Acquisition are reported in the EMEA region following the date of acquisition.\nDuring the year of acquisition, our results of operations from these acquisitions included $89.9 million of revenues\nand $8.2 million net income from operations.\nTransaction costs\nDuring the year of acquisition, the transaction costs for the Entel Chile and Entel Peru acquisitions were\n$7.2 million and the transaction costs for the MainOne acquisition were not significant.\n2021 Acquisition\nAcquisition of GPX India (the \"GPX India Acquisition\")\nOn September 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of GPX India, representing two data centers in Mumbai,\nIndia, for a total purchase consideration of approximately INR12.5 billion, or $170.5 million at the exchange rate in\neffect on that date. The GPX India Acquisition supports our ongoing expansion to meet customer demand in the\nIndian market.\nF-24\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nRevenues and net income from operations\nThe operating results of the GPX India Acquisition are reported in the Asia-Pacific region following the date of\nacquisition. During the year of acquisition, our results of operations from the GPX India Acquisition included\n$6.9 million of revenues and an insignificant amount of net income from operations.\nTransaction costs\nDuring the year of acquisition, the transaction costs for the GPX India Acquisition were insignificant.\n4. Earnings Per Share\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") for the years\nended December 31 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n2023 2022 2021\nNet income $ 968,980 $ 704,577 $ 499,728\nNet (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests 198 (232) 463\nNet income attributable to common shareholders $ 969,178 $ 704,345 $ 500,191\nWeighted-average shares used to calculate basic EPS 93,615 91,569 89,772\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nEmployee equity awards 394 259 637\nWeighted-average shares used to calculate diluted EPS 94,009 91,828 90,409\nEPS attributable to common shareholders:\nBasic EPS $ 10.35 $ 7.69 $ 5.57\nDiluted EPS $ 10.31 $ 7.67 $ 5.53\nThe following table sets forth potential shares of common stock that are not included in the diluted EPS\ncalculation above because to do so would be anti-dilutive for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):\n2023 2022 2021\nCommon stock related to employee equity awards and other 68 582 206\nTotal 68 582 206\n5. Assets Held for Sale\nIn June 2021, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture in the form of a limited liability partnership\nwith GIC Private Limited, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund (\"GIC\"), to develop and operate xScaleTM data centers\nin Europe and the Americas (the “EMEA 2 Joint Venture”). xScale data centers are engineered to meet the technical\nand operational requirements and price points of core hyperscale workload deployments and also offer access to\nour comprehensive suite of interconnection and edge solutions. The transaction was structured to close in phases\nover the course of approximately two years, pending regulatory approval and other closing conditions. The assets\nand liabilities of the Warsaw 4 (\"WA4\") data center site, which were included within our EMEA region, were\nclassified as held for sale as of June 30, 2021. In June 2022, we sold the WA4 data center in exchange for a total\nconsideration of $61.5 million. We recognized an insignificant gain on the sale of the WA4 data center.\nF-25\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nIn October 2021, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture in the form of a limited liability\npartnership with PGIM Real Estate (\"PGIM\"), to develop and operate xScale data centers in Asia-Pacific (the \"Asia-\nPacific 2 Joint Venture\"). The assets and liabilities of the Sydney 9 (\"SY9\") data center site, which were included\nwithin our Asia-Pacific region, were classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2021. Upon closing the joint\nventure in March 2022, we sold the SY9 data center in exchange for a total consideration of $201.3 million, which\nwas comprised of $165.6 million of net cash proceeds, a 20% partnership interest in the Asia-Pacific 2 Joint Venture\nwith a fair value of $29.8 million, and $5.9 million of receivables. We recognized an insignificant loss on the sale of\nthe SY9 data center.\nIn March 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell the Mexico 3 (\"MX3x\") data center site in connection with\nthe formation of a new joint venture with GIC (the \"AMER 1 Joint Venture\") to develop and operate xScale data\ncenters in the Americas. The assets and liabilities of the MX3x data center, which were included within our Americas\nregion, were classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2021. Upon closing of the joint venture in March 2023,\nwe sold the MX3x data center in exchange for a total consideration of $75.1 million, which was comprised of\n$63.9 million of net cash proceeds, a 20% partnership interest in the AMER 1 Joint Venture with a fair value of\n$8.4 million, and $2.8 million of receivables. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized an\ninsignificant loss on the sale of the MX3x data center.\nAs of December 31, 2023, no assets or liabilities were classified as held for sale. As of December 31, 2022, the\nassets and liabilities that were classified as held for sale of $84.3 million and $10.5 million, respectively, were\nprimarily comprised of property, plant and equipment and accrued property, plant and equipment, respectively.\nLiabilities held for sale were included within other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\n6. Equity Method Investments\nWe hold various equity method investments, primarily joint venture or partnership arrangements, in order to\ninvest in certain entities that are in line with our business development objectives, including the development and\noperation of xScale data centers. Some of these xScale joint ventures are classified as Variable Interest Entities\n(\"VIEs\"), as discussed further below. The Asia-Pacific 1, Asia-Pacific 2, Asia-Pacific 3, EMEA 2 and AMER 1 Joint\nVentures as noted below (the \"VIE Joint Ventures\") share a similar purpose, design and nature of assets. The\nfollowing table summarizes our equity method investments (in thousands), which were included in other assets on\nthe consolidated balance sheets as of December 31:\nOwnership\nInvestee Percentage 2023 2022\nEMEA 1 Joint Venture with GIC 20% $ 150,172 $ 148,895\nVIE Joint Ventures 20% 308,128 191,680\nOther Various 9,931 7,570\nTotal $ 468,231 $ 348,145\nNon-VIE Joint Venture\nEMEA 1 Joint Venture\nWe invested in a joint venture in the form of a limited liability partnership with GIC (the \"EMEA 1 Joint Venture\"),\nto develop and operate xScale data centers in Europe. The EMEA 1 Joint Venture is not a VIE given that both equity\ninvestors' interests have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest and it is sufficiently capitalized to\nsustain its operations, requiring additional funding from its partners only when expanding operations. Our share of\nincome and losses of equity method investments from this joint venture was insignificant for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022 and was included in other income (expense) on the consolidated statement of\noperations.\nWe committed to make future equity contributions to the EMEA 1 Joint Venture for funding its future\ndevelopment. As of December 31, 2023, we had future equity contribution commitments of $13.0 million.\nF-26\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nVIE Joint Ventures\nPreceding 2022, we invested in partnerships with GIC to develop and operate xScale data centers in Asia-\nPacific (the \"Asia-Pacific 1 Joint Venture\") and in Europe and the Americas (the EMEA 2 Joint Venture, see Note 5\nabove).\nOn March 11, 2022, we entered into the Asia-Pacific 2 Joint Venture with PGIM to develop and operate\nadditional xScale data centers in Asia-Pacific (see Note 5 above).\nOn April 6, 2022, we entered into a partnership with GIC (the \"Asia-Pacific 3 Joint Venture\") to develop and\noperate additional xScale data centers in Seoul, Korea. Upon closing, we contributed $17.0 million in exchange for\na 20% partnership interest in the joint venture.\nOn March 10, 2023, we entered into the AMER 1 Joint Venture with GIC to develop and operate xScale data\ncenters in the Americas (see Note 5 above). Upon closing, we contributed $8.4 million in exchange for a 20%\npartnership interest in the joint venture.\nThe VIE Joint Ventures are considered VIEs because they do not have sufficient funds from operations to be\nself-sustaining. While we provide certain management services to their operations and earn fees for the\nperformance of such services, the power to direct the activities of these joint ventures that most significantly impact\neconomic performance is shared equally between us and either GIC or PGIM, as applicable. These activities\ninclude data center construction and operations, sales and marketing, financing, and real estate purchases or sales.\nDecisions about these activities require the consent of both Equinix and either GIC or PGIM, as applicable. We\nconcluded that neither party is deemed to have predominant control over the VIE Joint Ventures and neither party is\nconsidered to be the primary beneficiary. Our share of losses of equity method investments from these joint\nventures was $11.7 million and $8.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and was included in\nother income (expense) on the consolidated statement of operations.\nThe following table summarizes our maximum exposure to loss related to the VIE Joint Ventures as of\nDecember 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nVIE Joint\nVentures\nEquity Investment $ 308,128\nOutstanding Accounts Receivable 23,020\nContract Assets 55,967\nFuture Equity Contribution Commitments (1) 39,610\nMaximum Future Payments under Debt Guarantees (2) 209,040\nTotal $ 635,765\n(1) The joint ventures' partners are required to make additional equity contributions proportionately upon certain\noccurrences, such as a shortfall in capital necessary to complete certain construction phases or make interest payments\non their outstanding debt.\n(2) In connection with our 20% equity investment in the EMEA 2 Joint Venture, we provided the lenders with our guarantees\ncovering 20% of all payments of principal and interest due under EMEA 2 Joint Venture's credit facility agreements.

Derivatives and Hedging Instruments\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\nNet Investment Hedges. We are exposed to the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the value of\ninvestments in our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. Dollar. In order to\nmitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, we have entered into various foreign currency debt\nobligations, which are designated as hedges against our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. As of both\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the total principal amounts of foreign currency debt obligations designated as net\ninvestment hedges was $1.5 billion.\nWe also utilize cross-currency interest rate swaps, designated as net investment hedges, which effectively\nconvert a portion of our U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-rate debt to foreign currency-denominated fixed-rate debt, to\nhedge the currency exposure associated with our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31,\nF-33\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n2023 and 2022, the total notional amount of cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as net investment\nhedges, were $3.1 billion and $3.9 billion respectively, with maturity dates ranging through 2026.\nFrom time to time, we use foreign currency forward contracts, which are designated as net investment hedges,\nto hedge against the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts designated as\nnet investment hedges were $887.5 million and $373.4 million, respectively.\nCertain of our customer agreements that are priced in currencies different from the functional or local currencies\nof the parties involved are deemed to have foreign currency forward contracts embedded in them. These embedded\nderivatives are separated from their host contracts and carried on our balance sheet at their fair value. The majority\nof these embedded derivatives arise as a result of our foreign subsidiaries pricing their customer contracts in U.S.\nDollars. We use these forward contracts embedded within our customer agreements to hedge against the effect of\nforeign exchange rate fluctuations on our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries.\nThe effect of net investment hedges on accumulated other comprehensive income and the consolidated\nstatements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows (in thousands):\nAmount of gain or (loss) recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nForeign currency debt $ (54,120) $ 160,286 $ 93,945\nForeign currency forward contracts (included component) (1) (9,442) 27,323 2,621\nForeign currency forward contracts (excluded component) (2) 2,683 (2,535) (2)\nCross-currency interest rate swaps (included component) (1) (72,049) 276,350 282,935\nCross-currency interest rate swaps (excluded component) (3) 1,045 (35,723) (52,517)\nTotal $ (131,883) $ 425,701 $ 326,982\nAmount of gain or (loss) recognized in earnings:\nYears Ended December 31,\nLocation of gain or (loss) 2023 2022 2021\nForeign currency forward contracts (excluded\ncomponent) (2) Interest expense $ 1,920 $ (469) $ 242\nCross-currency interest rate swaps (excluded\nInterest expense\ncomponent) (3) 45,469 50,188 44,933\nTotal $ 47,389 $ 49,719 $ 45,175\n(1) Included component represents foreign exchange spot rates.\n(2) Excluded component represents foreign currency forward points.\n(3) Excluded component represents cross-currency basis spread and interest rates.\nCash Flow Hedges. We hedge our foreign currency transaction exposure for forecasted revenues and\nexpenses in our EMEA region between the U.S. Dollar and foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound and the\nEuro. The foreign currency forward and option contracts that we use to hedge this exposure are designated as cash\nflow hedges. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts\nwere $1.2 billion and $490.8 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our foreign currency cash flow hedge instruments had maturity dates ranging from\nJanuary 2024 to December 2025 and we had a net loss of $7.2 million recorded within accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) to be reclassified to revenues and expenses for cash flow hedges that will mature in\nthe next 12 months. As of December 31, 2022, our foreign currency cash flow hedge instruments had maturity dates\nranging from January 2023 to February 2024 and we had a net gain of $8.2 million recorded within accumulated\nother comprehensive income (loss) to be reclassified to revenues and expenses for cash flow hedges that will\nmature in the next 12 months.\nF-34\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nWe enter into intercompany hedging instruments (\"intercompany derivatives\") with our wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries in order to hedge certain forecasted revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the\nU.S. Dollar. Simultaneously, we enter into derivative contracts with unrelated third parties to externally hedge the net\nexposure created by such intercompany derivatives.\nWe hedge the interest rate exposure created by anticipated fixed rate debt issuances through the use of\ntreasury locks and swap locks (collectively, interest rate locks), which are designated as cash flow hedges. As of\nboth December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had no interest rate locks outstanding. When interest rate locks are settled,\nany gain or loss from the transactions is deferred and included as a component of other comprehensive income\n(loss) and is amortized to interest expense over the term of the forecasted hedged transaction which is equivalent to\nthe term of the interest rate locks. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had a net gain of $1.1 million and\n$1.4 million, respectively, recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to be reclassified to\ninterest expense in the next 12 months for interest rate locks.\nWe also use cross-currency swaps, which are designated as cash flow hedges, to manage the foreign currency\nexposure associated with a portion of our foreign currency-denominated debt. As of both December 31, 2023 and\n2022, the total notional amount of cross-currency interest rate swaps, designated as cash flow hedges, was\n$280.3 million.\nThe effect of cash flow hedges on accumulated other comprehensive income and the consolidated statements\nof operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows (in thousands):\nAmount of gain or (loss) recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nForeign currency forward and option contracts (included component) (1) $ (15,956) $ (8,711) $ 67,767\nForeign currency option contracts (excluded component) (2) — — 151\nCross-currency interest rate swaps (2,175) (2,386) —\nInterest rate locks (4,971) 49,392 9,624\nTotal $ (23,102) $ 38,295 $ 77,542\nAmount of gain or (loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to income:\nYears Ended December 31,\nLocation of gain or (loss) 2023 2022 2021\nForeign currency forward contracts Revenues $ (9,760) $ 148,100 $ (39,297)\nForeign currency forward contracts Costs and operating\nexpenses 15,425 (71,968) 20,496\nInterest rate locks Interest Expense 1,183 (26) (4,056)\nTotal $ 6,848 $ 76,106 $ (22,857)\n(1) Included component represents foreign exchange spot rates.\n(2) Excluded component represents option's time value.\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nEmbedded Derivatives. As described above, certain of our customer agreements that are priced in currencies\ndifferent from the functional or local currencies of the parties involved are deemed to have foreign currency forward\ncontracts embedded in them.\nEconomic Hedges of Embedded Derivatives. We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage the foreign\nexchange risk associated with our customer agreements that are priced in currencies different from the functional or\nlocal currencies of the parties involved (\"economic hedges of embedded derivatives\"). Foreign currency forward\ncontracts represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an\nagreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date.\nF-35\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nForeign Currency Forward Contracts. We also use foreign currency forward contracts to manage the foreign\nexchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities. As a result of\nforeign currency fluctuations, the U.S. Dollar equivalent values of our foreign currency-denominated monetary\nassets and liabilities change. Gains and losses on these contracts are included in other income (expense), on a net\nbasis, along with the foreign currency gains and losses of the related foreign currency-denominated monetary\nassets and liabilities associated with these foreign currency forward contracts. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nthe total notional amounts of these foreign currency contracts were $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively.\nCross-currency Interest Rate Swaps. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we elected to de-designate a\nportion of our cross-currency interest rate swaps previously designated as net investment hedges. Gains and losses\nsubsequent to the de-designation will be recognized in earnings to offset remeasurement gains and losses from\nforeign currency monetary assets and liabilities. We also entered into $283.4 million of cross-currency interest rate\nswaps, which were not designated as hedging instruments.

The total debt\nissuance costs for the 2022 Revolving Facility and 2022 Term Loan Facility are $6.5 million and $0.8 million,\nrespectively. We borrowed the full £500.0 million available under the 2022 Term Loan Facility, or approximately\n$676.9 million at the exchange rates in effect on that date. On that same day, using a portion of the proceeds from\nthe 2022 Term Loan Facility, we prepaid in full all of the indebtedness outstanding of $549.6 million, at the exchange\nrates in effect on January 7, 2022, related to an approximately $1.0 billion senior unsecured multicurrency term loan\nfacility entered in 2017 and terminated the related credit agreement. In connection with the repayment and\ntermination, we incurred an insignificant amount of loss on debt extinguishment. The remaining unamortized debt\nissuance costs of the repaid facility will continue to be amortized over the contract terms of the 2022 Credit\nFacilities.\nThe 2022 Credit Facilities have a maturity date of January 7, 2027. We may borrow, repay and reborrow\namounts under the 2022 Revolving Facility until the Maturity Date, at which time all amounts outstanding under the\n2022 Revolving Facility must be repaid in full. The term loan made under the 2022 Term Loan Facility has no\nscheduled principal amortization and must be repaid in full on the maturity date. The 2022 Revolving Credit Facility\nprovides for extensions of credit in U.S. Dollars as well as certain other foreign currencies. Borrowings under the\n2022 Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate based on the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"), term\nSOFR, an alternative currency daily rate, or an alternative currency term rate plus a spread adjustment, plus a\nmargin that can vary from 0.555% to 1.200%. Borrowings under the 2022 Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate\nbased on the daily Sterling Overnight Index Average (\"SONIA\"), plus a spread adjustment, plus a margin that can\nvary from 0.625% to 1.450%. We are also required to pay a quarterly letter of credit fee on the face amount of each\nletter of credit, which fee is based on the same margin that applies from time to time to SOFR-indexed borrowings\nunder the revolving credit line. The margin is dependent on either our consolidated net leverage ratio or our credit\nratings. We are also required to pay a quarterly facility fee ranging from 0.07% to 0.25% per annum. The 2022\nCredit Agreement contains customary covenants, including financial ratio covenants that are required to be\nmaintained as of each quarter end.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total amounts outstanding under the 2022 Term Loan Facility, net of\ndebt issuance costs, were $636.2 million and $603.0 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 51 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $84.2 million issued and outstanding\nunder the 2022 Revolving Facility, with approximately $3.9 billion remaining available to borrow under the 2022\nRevolving Facility.\nF-41\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nSenior Notes\nOur senior notes consisted of the following as of December 31 (in thousands):\n2023 2022\nEffective Effective\nSenior Notes Issuance Date Maturity Date Amount Rate Amount Rate\n2.625% Senior Notes due 2024 November 2019 November 2024 $ 1,000,000 2.79 % $ 1,000,000 2.79 %\n1.250% Senior Notes due 2025 June 2020 July 2025 500,000 1.46 % 500,000 1.46 %\n1.000% Senior Notes due 2025 October 2020 September 2025 700,000 1.18 % 700,000 1.18 %\n2.900% Senior Notes due 2026 November 2019 November 2026 600,000 3.04 % 600,000 3.04 %\n1.450% Senior Notes due 2026 May 2021 May 2026 700,000 1.64 % 700,000 1.64 %\n0.250% Euro Senior Notes due 2027 March 2021 March 2027 552,050 0.45 % 534,950 0.45 %\n1.800% Senior Notes due 2027 June 2020 July 2027 500,000 1.96 % 500,000 1.96 %\n1.550% Senior Notes due 2028 October 2020 March 2028 650,000 1.67 % 650,000 1.67 %\n2.000% Senior Notes due 2028 May 2021 May 2028 400,000 2.21 % 400,000 2.21 %\n2.875% Swiss Franc Senior Notes\ndue 2028 September 2023 September 2028 356,633 3.05 % — — %\n3.200% Senior Notes due 2029 November 2019 November 2029 1,200,000 3.30 % 1,200,000 3.30 %\n2.150% Senior Notes due 2030 June 2020 July 2030 1,100,000 2.27 % 1,100,000 2.27 %\n2.500% Senior Notes due 2031 May 2021 May 2031 1,000,000 2.65 % 1,000,000 2.65 %\n3.900% Senior Notes due 2032 April 2022 April 2032 1,200,000 4.07 % 1,200,000 4.07 %\n1.000% Euro Senior Notes due 2033 March 2021 March 2033 662,460 1.18 % 641,940 1.18 %\n2.000% Japanese Yen Series A Notes\ndue 2035 March 2023 March 2035 266,888 2.07 % — — %\n2.130% Japanese Yen Series C Notes\ndue 2035 March 2023 March 2035 104,911 2.20 % — — %\n2.370% Japanese Yen Series B Notes\ndue 2043 March 2023 March 2043 72,516 2.42 % — — %\n2.570% Japanese Yen Series D Notes\ndue 2043 March 2023 March 2043 32,608 2.62 % — — %\n2.570% Japanese Yen Series E Notes\ndue 2043 February 2023 March 2043 70,886 2.62 % — — %\n3.000% Senior Notes due 2050 June 2020 July 2050 500,000 3.09 % 500,000 3.09 %\n2.950% Senior Notes due 2051 October 2020 September 2051 500,000 3.00 % 500,000 3.00 %\n3.400% Senior Notes due 2052 May 2021 February 2052 500,000 3.50 % 500,000 3.50 %\n13,168,952 12,226,890\nLess amount representing unamortized debt discount and debt issuance cost (108,026) (117,351)\n13,060,926 12,109,539\nLess current portion (998,580) —\n$ 12,062,346 $ 12,109,539\n3.900% Senior Notes due 2032\nOn April 5, 2022, we issued $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.900% Senior Notes due 2032 (the\n\"2032 Notes\").

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had no preferred stock issued and outstanding.\nCommon Stock\nIn October 2020, we established an \"at the market\" equity offering program (the \"2020 ATM Program\"), under\nwhich we could, from time to time, offer and sell shares of our common stock to or through sales agents up to an\naggregate of $1.5 billion. In February 2022, we entered into a forward sale amendment to the 2020 ATM Program,\nunder which we could, from time to time, offer and sell shares under the equity distribution agreement pursuant to\nforward sale transactions (the \"Equity Forward Amendment\"). In November 2022, we established a successor ATM\nprogram, also with substantially the same terms as the Equity Forward Amendment noted above, under which we\nmay, from time to time, offer and sell on a spot or forward basis up to an aggregate of $1.5 billion of our common\nstock to or through sales agents in \"at the market\" transactions (the \"2022 ATM Program\"). The forward sale\nagreements provide three settlement alternatives to us: physical settlement, cash settlement or net share\nsettlement. In accordance with ASC 815, the forward sale agreements are classified as equity for balance sheet\npurposes.\nF-45\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nDuring the first half of 2022, we executed five forward sale agreements under the 2020 ATM Program to sell\n579,873 shares of our common stock. On August 3, 2022, we physically settled these forward sale shares for\napproximately $393.6 million, net of payment of commissions to sales agents and other offering expenses, at an\naggregate weighted-average forward sale price of $678.72 per share.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we executed three additional forward sale agreements to sell 458,459 shares of\nour common stock with maturity dates ranging from February 2023 to November 2023. Of this amount, 308,875\nshares were executed under the 2020 ATM Program and the remaining 149,584 shares were executed under the\n2022 ATM Program. On February 28, 2023, we physically settled these forward sale shares for approximately\n$301.6 million, net of payment of commissions to sales agents and other offering expenses, at an aggregate\nweighted-average forward sale price of $657.75 per share.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold an additional 580,833 shares, excluding the forward sale\ntransactions noted above, for approximately $403.6 million, net of payment of commissions to sales agents and\nother offering expenses, under the 2020 ATM Program. As of December 31, 2022, no shares remained available for\nsale under the 2020 ATM Program.\nIn the second quarter of 2023, we executed two forward sale agreements to sell 269,547 shares of our common\nstock with maturity dates ranging from February 2024 to March 2024. In the third quarter of 2023, we executed\nthree additional forward sale agreements to sell 294,579 shares of our common stock with maturity dates ranging\nfrom February 2024 to March 2024. On November 1, 2023, we physically settled 564,126 forward sale shares for\napproximately $433.3 million, net of payment of commissions to sales agents and other offering expenses, at an\naggregate weighted-average forward sale price of $768.03 per share.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we executed seven forward sale agreements to sell 643,428 shares of our\ncommon stock with maturity dates ranging from November 2024 to December 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the\nestimated net settlement value for the forward sale agreements was approximately $499.4 million at an aggregate\nweighted-average forward sale price of $776.23 per share. The weighted-average forward sale price that we expect\nto receive upon physical settlement will be subject to adjustments for a discount rate factor equal to a specified\nbenchmark rate less a spread minus scheduled dividends during the terms of the agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $469.7 million of common stock available for sale under the\n2022 ATM Program, which amount gives effect to the unsettled forward sale transactions noted above. For the year\nended December 31, 2023, other than as noted above, we sold no additional shares under the 2022 ATM Program.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had reserved the following authorized but unissued shares of common stock for\nfuture issuances:\nCommon stock options and restricted stock units 3,978,009\nCommon stock employee purchase plans 2,345,263\nTotal 6,323,272\nRedeemable Non-controlling Interest\nOn April 3, 2023, we issued additional shares in our Indonesian operating entity to a third party investor for\n$25.0 million, which resulted in the third party investor owning a 25% interest in the entity.\nThe Indonesian operating entity is a VIE because it does not have sufficient funds from its operations to be self-\nsustaining. We provide certain management services to the entity and earn fees for the performance of such\nservices. We have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the\nentity and have concluded that we are its primary beneficiary.\nUnder the terms of the shareholders’ agreement, the investor may put its 25% ownership stake in the entity to\nus for a maximum exercise price of $25.0 million, subject to certain contingent conditions. Accordingly, we present\nthe investor’s contingently redeemable non-controlling interest (\"NCI\") outside of permanent equity at the higher of\nits maximum redemption amount of $25.0 million and its balance after attribution of gains and losses in the\nconsolidated balance sheets. There were no changes in the carrying value of the redeemable NCI for the year\nended December 31, 2023.\nF-46\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nAs of December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of the Indonesian VIE, which were\nincluded in other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets were $30.4 million and $2.9 million,\nrespectively.\nThe income and losses attributable to us as well as to the redeemable NCI from the Indonesian VIE were\ninsignificant for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, by components are as follows (in\nthousands):\nDecember Net December Net December Net December\n31, 2020 Change 31, 2021 Change 31, 2022 Change 31, 2023\nForeign currency translation adjustment\n(\"CTA\") gain (loss) $ (508,415) $ (559,984) $ (1,068,399) $ (769,838) $ (1,838,237) $ 250,044 $ (1,588,193)\nUnrealized gain (loss) on cash flow\nhedges (1) (67,152) 60,562 (6,590) 40,543 33,953 (18,370) 15,583\nNet investment hedge CTA gain (loss) (1) (336,934) 326,982 (9,952) 425,701 415,749 (131,883) 283,866\nNet actuarial gain (loss) on defined\nbenefit plans (2) (867) 57 (810) (101) (911) (462) (1,373)\n$ (913,368) $ (172,383) $ (1,085,751) $ (303,695) $ (1,389,446) $ 99,329 $ (1,290,117)\n(1) Refer to Note 8 for a discussion of the amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income.\n(2) We have a defined benefit pension plan covering all employees in two countries where such plans are mandated by law.\nWe do not have any defined benefit plans in any other countries. The unamortized gain (loss) on defined benefit plans\nincludes gains or losses resulting from a change in the value of either the projected benefit obligation or the plan assets\nresulting from a change in an actuarial assumption, net of amortization.\nChanges in foreign currencies can have a significant impact to our consolidated balance sheets (as evidenced\nabove in our foreign currency translation loss), as well as our consolidated results of operations, as amounts in\nforeign currencies are generally translated into more U.S. dollars when the U.S. dollar weakens or less U.S. dollars\nwhen the U.S. dollar strengthens. As of December 31, 2023, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to certain\nof the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate as compared to December 31, 2022. Because of this,\nthe U.S. dollar had an overall favorable impact on our consolidated financial position because the foreign\ndenominations translated into more U.S. dollars as evidenced by a decrease in foreign currency translation loss for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 as reflected in the above table. The volatility of the U.S. dollar as compared to\nthe other currencies in which we operate could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and\nresults of operations including the amount of revenue that we report in future periods.\nF-47\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nDividends\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, our Board of Directors declared quarterly\ndividends whose treatment for federal income tax purposes were as follows:\nNonqualified Total Distribution\nDeclaration Date Record Date Payment Date Total Distribution (1) Ordinary Dividend (2) Amount\n(per share) (in thousands)\nFiscal 2023\n2/15/2023 3/7/2023 3/22/2023 $ 3.410000 $ 3.410000 $ 318,736\n5/3/2023 5/24/2023 6/21/2023 3.410000 3.410000 318,914\n8/2/2023 8/23/2023 9/20/2023 3.410000 3.410000 319,308\n10/25/2023 11/15/2023 12/13/2023 4.260000 4.260000 402,347\nTotal $ 14.490000 $ 14.490000 $ 1,359,305\nFiscal 2022\n2/16/2022 3/7/2022 3/23/2022 $ 3.100000 $ 3.100000 $ 282,031\n4/27/2022 5/18/2022 6/15/2022 3.100000 3.100000 282,168\n7/27/2022 8/17/2022 9/21/2022 3.100000 3.100000 286,136\n11/2/2022 11/16/2022 12/14/2022 3.100000 3.100000 286,868\nTotal $ 12.400000 $ 12.400000 $ 1,137,203\nFiscal 2021\n2/10/2021 2/24/2021 3/17/2021 $ 2.870000 $ 2.870000 $ 256,321\n4/28/2021 5/19/2021 6/16/2021 2.870000 2.870000 257,199\n7/28/2021 8/18/2021 9/22/2021 2.870000 2.870000 257,769\n11/3/2021 11/17/2021 12/15/2021 2.870000 2.870000 258,716\nTotal $ 11.480000 $ 11.480000 $ 1,030,005\n(1) Common stock dividends are characterized for federal income tax purposes as nonqualified ordinary dividend, qualified\nordinary dividend, capital gains or return of capital.

The uncertain tax position was covered by an indemnification\nagreement with the seller. As such, the realization of the unrecognized tax benefit resulted in an impairment of the\nindemnification asset for the same amount, which has been included in Other Income (Expense) on the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nF-51\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nOur accounting policy is to treat any tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\"GILTI\") inclusions as a\ncurrent period cost included in the tax expense in the year incurred. We believe the GILTI inclusion provision will\nresult in no material financial statement impact provided we satisfy our REIT distribution requirement with respect to\nthe GILTI inclusions.\nAs a result of our conversion to a REIT effective January 1, 2015, it is no longer our intent to indefinitely reinvest\nundistributed foreign earnings. However, no deferred tax liability has been recognized to account for this change\nbecause the expected recovery of the basis difference will not result in material U.S. taxes in the post-REIT\nconversion periods due to the fact that the majority of our foreign subsidiaries are either QRSs or owned directly by\nour REIT and QRSs, and the foreign withholding tax effect would be immaterial. We continue to assess the foreign\nwithholding tax impact of our current policy and do not believe the distribution of our foreign earnings would trigger\nany significant foreign withholding taxes, as the majority of the foreign jurisdictions where we operate do not impose\nwithholding taxes on dividend distributions to a corporate U.S. parent.\nThe types of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of our deferred tax assets and liabilities\nare set out below as of December 31 (in thousands):\n2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nStock-based compensation expense $ 9,073 $ 9,002\nNet unrealized losses 10,843 3,988\nOperating lease liabilities 220,745 253,005\nFinance lease liabilities 14,591 —\nDeferred revenue 16,625 13,887\nGoodwill — 20,511\nLoss carryforwards and tax credits 232,471 142,270\nOthers, net 6,600 32,543\nGross deferred tax assets 510,948 475,206\nValuation allowance (220,848) (166,594)\nTotal deferred tax assets, net 290,100 308,612\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nFinance lease liabilities — (8,033)\nProperty, plant and equipment (252,434) (221,343)\nRight-of-use assets (224,253) (256,837)\nDeferred income (26,116) (28,314)\nGoodwill (3,074) —\nIntangible assets (116,070) (132,816)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (621,947) (647,343)\nNet deferred tax liabilities $ (331,847) $ (338,731)\nThe tax basis of REIT assets, excluding investments in TRSs, is greater than the amounts reported for such\nassets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet by approximately $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2023.\nOur accounting for deferred taxes involves weighing positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability\nof our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction. After considering evidence such as the nature, frequency and\nseverity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, the sources of future taxable income, taxable income in\ncarryback years permitted by the tax laws and tax planning strategies, we concluded that valuation allowances were\nrequired in certain jurisdictions. The operations in most of the jurisdictions for which a valuation allowance has been\nestablished have a history of significant losses as of December 31, 2023. As such, we do not believe these\noperations have established a sustained history of profitability and that a valuation allowance is, therefore,\nF-52\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nnecessary. We also provided a valuation allowance against certain gross deferred tax assets in certain taxing\njurisdictions as these deferred tax assets are not expected to be realizable in the foreseeable future.\nChanges in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021 are as follows (in thousands):\n2023 2022 2021\nBeginning balance $ 166,594 $ 100,746 $ 82,344\nAmounts from acquisitions 10,459 13,458 964\nAmounts recognized into income (1,744) 22,905 595\nCurrent increase 44,002 36,513 19,539\nImpact of foreign currency exchange 1,537 (7,028) (2,696)\nEnding balance $ 220,848 $ 166,594 $ 100,746\nOur net operating loss carryforwards for federal, state and foreign tax purposes which expire, if not utilized, at\nvarious intervals from 2024, are outlined below (in thousands):\nExpiration Date Federal State Foreign (1) (2) Total\n2024 $ 819 $ 24 $ 9,736 $ 10,579\n2025 to 2027 2,457 — 34,463 36,920\n2028 to 2030 — — 40,604 40,604\n2031 to 2033 — 667 9,845 10,512\n2034 to 2036 2,441 324 20,286 23,051\n2037 to 2039 2,886 2,618 19,177 24,681\nThereafter 248,941 89,574 624,744 963,259\n$ 257,544 $ 93,207 $ 758,855 $ 1,109,606\n(1) In certain jurisdictions, the net operating loss carryforwards can only be used to offset a percentage of taxable income in a\ngiven year.\n(2) If certain substantial changes in the entity's ownership occur or have determined to have occurred, there may be a\nlimitation on the amount of the carryforwards that can be utilized.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had tax credit carryforwards of $5.7 million, which expire, if not utilized, from 2024\nto 2031.

We are currently unable to estimate the range of possible\nadjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn general, our income tax returns for the years from 2020 through the current year remain open to examination\nby federal and state taxing authorities. In addition, our tax years of 2005 through current year remain open and\nsubject to examination by local tax authorities in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we have major operations.\n15. Commitments and Contingencies\nPurchase Commitments\nAs a result of our various IBX data center expansion projects, as of December 31, 2023, we were contractually\ncommitted for approximately $2.0 billion of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for IBX infrastructure\nequipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided, in connection with the work necessary to open these IBX\ndata centers and make them available to our customers for installation. We also had numerous other, non-capital\npurchase commitments in place as of December 31, 2023, such as commitments to purchase power in select\nlocations through 2024 and thereafter, and other open purchase orders for goods, or services to be delivered or\nprovided during 2024 and thereafter. Such other miscellaneous purchase commitments totaled approximately $1.7\nbillion as of December 31, 2023. For further information on our equity method investments contribution\ncommitments and lease commitments, see Note 6 and Note 10, respectively, above.\nContingent Liabilities\nWe estimate our exposure on certain liabilities, such as indirect and property taxes, based on the best\ninformation available at the time of determination. With respect to real and personal property taxes, we record what\nwe can reasonably estimate based on prior payment history, assessed value by the assessor's office, current\nlandlord estimates or estimates based on current or changing fixed asset values in each specific municipality, as\napplicable. However, there are circumstances beyond our control whereby the underlying value of the property or\nbasis for which the tax is calculated on the property may change, such as a landlord selling the underlying property\nof one of our IBX data center leases or a municipality changing the assessment value in a jurisdiction and, as a\nresult, our property tax obligations may vary from period to period. Based upon the most current facts and\ncircumstances, we make the necessary property tax accruals for each of our reporting periods. However, revisions\nin our estimates of the potential or actual liability could materially impact our financial position, results of operations\nor cash flows.\nOur indirect and property tax filings in various jurisdictions are subject to examination by local tax authorities.\nAlthough we believe that we have adequately assessed and accounted for our potential tax liabilities, and that our\ntax estimates are reasonable, there can be no certainty that additional taxes will not be due upon audit of our tax\nreturns or as a result of further changes to the tax laws and interpretations thereof. For example, we are currently\nundergoing several indirect tax audits and appealing a tentative assessment in Brazil. The final settlement of the\naudit and the outcomes of the appeal are uncertain and may not be resolved in our favor. We regularly assess the\nlikelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and appeals that would affect the adequacy of\nour tax accruals for each of the reporting periods. If any issues arising from the tax examinations and appeals are\nresolved in a manner inconsistent with our expectations, the revision of the estimates of the potential or actual\nliabilities could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nFrom time to time, we may have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of our business\nactivities. Contingent liabilities are accrued when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such\nexpenditures can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, there are no pending claims for which\nthe outcome is expected to result in a material adverse effect in the financial position, results of operations or cash\nflows.\nF-54\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nEmployment Agreements\nWe have entered into a severance agreement with certain of our executive officers that provides for a\nseverance payment equal to 100% of the executive officer's annual base salary and maximum bonus in the event\nhis or her employment is terminated for any reason other than cause or he or she voluntarily resigns under certain\ncircumstances as described in the agreement, or 200% of the executive officer's annual base salary and maximum\nbonus in the event this occurs after a change-in-control of our company. For certain other executive officers, these\nbenefits are only triggered after a change-in-control of our company, in which case the officer is entitled to 200% of\nthe executive officer's annual base salary and maximum bonus. In addition, under these agreements, the executive\nofficer is entitled to the payment of his or her monthly health care premiums under the Consolidated Omnibus\nBudget Reconciliation Act for up to 24 months.\nIndemnification and Guarantor Arrangements\nAs permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for\ncertain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The\nterm of the indemnification period is for the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future\npayments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, in the event\nof a legal action, we have purchased insurance that could limit our exposure, depending upon the details of the\nclaim and the coverage provided. As a result, our estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is\nminimal. We have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2023.\nWe enter into standard indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these\nagreements, we may agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or\nincurred by the indemnified party, generally a business partner or a customer, in connection with matters such as\nany U.S. patent, or any copyright or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to\nour offerings; a breach of confidentiality obligations and certain other contractual warranties; our gross negligence,\nwillful misconduct, fraud, misrepresentation, or violation of law; and/or if we cause tangible property damage,\npersonal injury or death. The term of any such indemnification agreement is generally perpetual after execution of\nthe agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these\nindemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have never incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle\nclaims related to these indemnification agreements. In addition, in the event of a legal action, we have purchased\ninsurance that could limit our exposure, depending upon the details of the claim and the coverage provided. As a\nresult, our estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. We do not have significant liabilities recorded for\nthese agreements as of December 31, 2023.\nWe enter into arrangements with certain business partners, whereby the business partner agrees to provide\nservices as a subcontractor for our installations. Accordingly, we enter into standard indemnification agreements\nwith our customers, whereby we indemnify them for certain acts, such as personal property damage, by our\nsubcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these\nindemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have never incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle\nclaims related to these indemnification agreements. In addition, in the event of a legal action, we have purchased\ninsurance that could limit our exposure, depending upon the details of the claim and the coverage provided. As a\nresult, our estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. We do not have significant liabilities recorded for\nthese agreements as of December 31, 2023.\nWe have service level commitment obligations to certain of our customers. As a result, service interruptions or\nsignificant equipment damage in our IBX data centers, whether or not within our control, could result in obligations\nto these customers. While we have purchased insurance that could limit our exposure, our liability insurance may\nnot be adequate to cover those expenses. In addition, any loss of service, equipment damage or inability to meet\nour service level commitment obligations could reduce the confidence our customers have in us, and could\nconsequently impair our ability to obtain and retain customers, which would adversely affect both our ability to\ngenerate revenues and our operating results. We generally have the ability to determine such service level credits\nprior to the associated revenue being recognized. We do not have significant liabilities in connection with service\nlevel credits as of December 31, 2023.\nF-55\nTable of Contents\nEQUINIX, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nConcurrent with the closing of the EMEA 2 Joint Venture, the EMEA 2 Joint Venture entered into credit facility\nagreements with a group of lenders under which it could borrow up to approximately $1.4 billion in total at the\nexchange rate in effect on December 31, 2023, with such facilities maturing in 2025 and 2026. In connection with\nour 20% equity investment in the EMEA 2 Joint Venture, we provided the lenders with guarantees covering 20% of\nall payments of principal and interest due and payable by the EMEA 2 Joint Venture under these credit facilities, up\nto a limit of $301.4 million in total at the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2023.

As of December 31, 2023,\n$9.4 million of the guarantees related to AMER 1. Our estimated fair value of these guarantees is minimal as the\nlikelihood of making a payout under the guarantees is low.\n16.

Because each individual’s target\nbonus is a specified percentage of base salary, the target bonus amount is based on the annual base salary in effect at the end of\nthe year when bonuses are calculated.

None of these RSUs would be earned unless Equinix achieved greater than 95% of revenue and/or AFFO/Share goals\nfor 2023, with the actual number of RSUs (ranging from the “threshold” to the “maximum” amounts in the table) based on the\nextent to which Equinix achieved the goals. The earned RSUs would then vest, subject to continued service as follows: 50% in\nFeb. 2024 and an additional 25% in each of Feb. 2025 and Feb. 2026. As further described in “Compensation Discussion and\nAnalysis” above, in Feb. 2024, our Talent, Culture and Compensation Committee determined that the number of RSUs earned\nwas at 82% of the target level, based on our achievement of our 2023 revenue, digital services revenue and AFFO/Share goals.\nThese RSUs were granted under our 2020 Equity Incentive Plan.\n(4) These are performance-based RSUs eligible to be earned based on relative TSR over a three-year period. The RSUs may be\nearned based on achievement of relative TSR for the three-year period from 2023 through 2025, as further described above in\n“Compensation Discussion and Analysis.” The extent to which these RSUs are earned will be determined in early 2026, at which\ntime they will vest to the extent earned.

The Grant Date of\nMar. 6, 2024 shown is the date on which RSUs were granted to each named executive officer in payment of their 2023 bonus\nawards (with any fractional RSUs paid in cash), as approved by the Talent, Culture and Compensation Committee.

This non-GAAP measure is not an alternative for a measure prepared in accordance with GAAP\nand may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. This measure should be considered in\naddition to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP but not as a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP\nresults. This non-GAAP measure is used by management to assess our financial performance and as a measurement of\nour performance for certain incentive compensation purposes.\nThe Talent, Culture and Compensation Committee used AFFO/Share as a pre-established performance goal under the\nannual incentive plan for fiscal 2021, 2022 and 2023 and under certain of the fiscal 2021, 2022 and 2023 PSU awards.\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nFFO and AFFO are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in the REIT industry. FFO is calculated in accordance\nwith the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. FFO represents net\nincome (loss), excluding gain (loss) from the disposition of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization on real\nestate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items.\nIn presenting AFFO, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future\noperating performance. AFFO represents FFO excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate\nassets, accretion, stock-based compensation, stock-based charitable contributions, restructuring charges, impairment\ncharges, transaction costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, a contract cost\nadjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, gain (loss) on debt\nextinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures, net income (loss) from\ndiscontinued operations, net of tax, and adjustments from FFO to AFFO for unconsolidated joint ventures' and\nnoncontrolling interests' share of these items. The adjustments for installation revenue, straight-line rent expense and\ncontract costs are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results in the\nconsolidated statement of operations. We exclude the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts\nand premiums as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings that have no\ncurrent or future cash obligations. We exclude gain (loss) on debt extinguishment since it generally represents the\nwrite-off of initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings or a cost that is incurred to reduce future interest\ncosts and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance. We include an income tax expense\nadjustment, which represents the non-cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances, uncertain tax\npositions and deferred taxes that do not relate to the current period's operations. We deduct recurring capital\nexpenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of IBX data centers or other assets that are\nrequired to support current revenues. We also exclude net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax,\nwhich represents results that may not recur and are not a good indicator of our current or future operating\nperformance.\nThe following tables present reconciliations of our most comparable GAAP measures to our non-GAAP measures\npresented:\nEQUINIX 2024 PROXY STATEMENT Appendix Materials / A-2\n(unaudited and in thousands, except per share amounts) Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet income $ 968,980 $ 704,577 $ 499,728\nNet (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests 198 (232) 463\nNet income attributable to common shareholders 969,178 704,345 500,191\nAdjustments:\nReal estate depreciation 1,141,861 1,104,787 1,073,148\n(Gain) loss on disposition of real estate property 1,898 7,134 (6,439)\nAdjustments for FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures 17,040 10,068 6,097\nFFO attributable to common shareholders $ 2,129,977 $ 1,826,334 $ 1,572,997\nAdjustments:\nInstallation revenue adjustment 3,910 17,745 27,928\nStraight-line rent expense adjustment 12,164 16,263 9,677\nContract cost adjustment (46,601) (52,888) (63,064)\nAmortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and\npremiums 18,719 17,826 17,135\nStock-based compensation expense 407,536 403,983 363,774\nStock-based charitable contributions 2,543 49,013 —\nNon-real estate depreciation expense 494,214 426,666 377,658\nAmortization expense 209,063 204,755 205,484\nAccretion expense adjustment (1,473) 3,166 4,234\nRecurring capital expenditures (218,287) (188,885) (199,089)\n(Gain) loss on debt extinguishment 35 (327) 115,125\nTransaction costs 12,412 21,839 22,769\nImpairment charges (1) 1,518 1,815 31,847\nIncome tax benefit adjustment (1) (12,133) (31,165) (38,505)\nAdjustments for AFFO from unconsolidated joint ventures 4,921 (2,262) 3,259\nAFFO attributable to common shareholders $ 3,018,518 $ 2,713,878 $ 2,451,229\n(1) Impairment charges relate to the impairment of an indemnification asset resulting from the settlement of a\npre-acquisition uncertain tax position, which was recorded as Other Income (Expense) on the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations.

PURPOSE OF THE PLAN.\nThe Board adopted the Plan to be effective as of June 3, 2004. The purpose of the Plan is to provide\nEligible Employees with an opportunity to increase their proprietary interest in the success of the Company\nby purchasing Stock from the Company on favorable terms and to pay for such purchases through payroll\ndeductions or other permitted contributions. The Company intends for Offerings under the Plan to qualify as\nan “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Code (each, a “Section 423 Offering”);\nprovided, however, that the Committee may also authorize the grant of rights under offerings of the Plan\nthat are not intended to comply with the requirements of Section 423 of the Code (each, a “Non-423\nOffering”).\nSECTION 2. ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN.\n(a) Committee Composition. The Committee shall administer the Plan. The Committee shall consist\nexclusively of one or more directors of the Company, who shall be appointed by the Board.\n(b) Committee Responsibilities. The Committee will have full power and authority to administer the\nPlan, including, without limitation, the authority to (i) construe, interpret, reconcile any inconsistency in,\ncorrect any default in and supply any omission in, and apply the terms of the Plan and any enrollment form\nor other instrument or agreement relating to the Plan, (ii) determine eligibility and adjudicate all disputed\nclaims filed under the Plan, (iii) determine the terms and conditions of any right to purchase shares of Stock\nunder the Plan and amend an outstanding right to purchase shares of Stock, (iv) establish, amend, suspend or\nwaive such rules and regulations and appoint such agents as it deems appropriate for the proper\nadministration of the Plan, and (v) make all other policy decisions and determinations and take any other\naction that the Committee deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan including, without\nlimitation, the adoption of such rules, procedures, agreements, appendices, or sub-plans (collectively, “Sub-\nPlans”) as are necessary or appropriate to facilitate participation in the Plan by Eligible Employees in\ndifferent jurisdictions and/or to take advantage of tax-qualified treatment for the Plan that may be available\nin certain jurisdictions, as further set forth in Section 2(c) below. The Committee’s determinations under the\nPlan shall be final and binding on all persons.\n(c) Sub-Plans. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Plan, the Committee may adopt\nsuch Sub-Plans relating to the operation and administration of the Plan to accommodate local laws, customs\nand procedures for jurisdictions in which the Plan is offered, the terms of which Sub-Plans may take\nprecedence over other provisions of this Plan, with the exception of Section 13(a) hereof, but unless\notherwise superseded by the terms of such Sub-Plan, the provisions of this Plan will govern the operation of\nsuch Sub-Plan. To the extent inconsistent with the requirements of Section 423 of the Code, any such Sub-\nPlan will be considered part of a Non-423 Offering, and rights granted thereunder will not be required by the\nterms of the Plan to comply with Section 423 of the Code. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,\nthe Committee is specifically authorized to adopt rules and procedures regarding eligibility to participate,\nthe definition of Compensation, handling of Contributions, making of Contributions to the Plan (including,\nwithout limitation, in forms other than payroll deductions), establishment of bank or trust accounts to hold\nContributions, payment of interest, conversion of local currency, obligations to pay payroll tax, withholding\nprocedures and handling of stock certificates that vary with applicable local requirements.\nEQUINIX 2024 PROXY STATEMENT Appendix Materials / B-2\n(d) Delegation. To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, the Committee may, from time to time,\ndelegate some or all of its authority under the Plan to a subcommittee or subcommittees of the Committee,\none or more officers of the Company or other persons or groups of persons as it deems necessary,\nappropriate or advisable under conditions or limitations that it may set at or after the time of the delegation.\nFor purposes of the Plan, reference to the Committee will be deemed to refer to any subcommittee,\nsubcommittees, or other persons or groups of persons to whom the Committee delegates authority pursuant\nto this Section 2(d).\nSECTION 3. ENROLLMENT AND PARTICIPATION.\n(a) Offering Periods.\n(i) Offering Periods. While the Plan is in effect, two overlapping Offering Periods shall commence in\neach calendar year. Such Offering Periods shall consist of the 24-month periods commencing on each\nFebruary 15 and August 15 or such other periods or dates selected from time to time by the Committee.\n(ii) Additional Offering Periods. At the discretion of the Committee, additional Offering Periods may\nbe conducted under the Plan. The Committee shall determine the commencement and duration of each\nOffering Period, and Offering Periods may be consecutive or overlapping.\n(iii) Section 423 Offerings and Non-423 Offerings. Subject to Section 16(o), the Committee, in its\ndiscretion, will determine whether a Participating Company will participate in Section 423 Offering or a\nNon-423 Offering, provided that in no event may a Participating Company simultaneously participate in a\nSection 423 Offering and a Non-423 Offering.

As of the last day of each Accumulation Period, each Participant\nshall be deemed to have elected to purchase the number of shares of Stock calculated in accordance with\nthis Subsection (c), unless the Participant has previously elected to withdraw from the Plan in accordance\nwith Section 5(a). The amount then in the Participant’s Plan Account shall be divided by the Purchase\nPrice, and the number of shares that results shall be purchased from the Company with the funds in the\nParticipant’s Plan Account. The foregoing notwithstanding, no Participant shall purchase more than 2,500\nshares of Stock (or such lesser number announced by the Committee prior to the start of an Offering Period)\nwith respect to any Accumulation Period nor more than the amounts of Stock set forth in Sections 8(b) and\n13(a). The Committee may determine with respect to all Participants that any fractional share, as calculated\nunder this Subsection (c), shall be (i) rounded down to the next lower whole share or (ii) credited as a\nfractional share.\n(d) Available Shares Insufficient. In the event that the aggregate number of shares that all Participants\nelect to purchase during an Accumulation Period exceeds the maximum number of shares remaining\navailable for issuance under Section 13(a), then the number of shares to which each Participant is entitled\nshall be determined by multiplying the number of shares available for issuance by a fraction. The numerator\nof such fraction is the number of shares that such Participant has elected to purchase, and the denominator of\nsuch fraction is the number of shares that all Participants have elected to purchase.\n(e) Issuance of Stock. Certificates representing the shares of Stock purchased by a Participant under the\nPlan shall be issued to him or her (electronically, unless the Company determines to issue shares of Stock in\ncertificated form) as soon as reasonably practicable after the close of the applicable Accumulation Period,\nexcept that the Committee may determine that such shares shall be held for each Participant’s benefit by a\nbroker designated by the Committee, and/or may establish procedures to permit tracking of dispositions of\nsuch shares.\n(f) Tax Withholding.

Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, any amount remaining in\nthe Participant’s Plan Account that represents the Purchase Price for any fractional share shall be carried\nover in the Participant’s Plan Account to the next Accumulation Period. Any amount remaining in the\nParticipant’s Plan Account that represents the Purchase Price for whole shares that could not be purchased\nby reason of Subsection (c) above, Section 8(b) or Section 13(a) shall be refunded to the Participant in cash,\nwithout interest.\n(h) Stockholder Approval. Any other provision of the Plan notwithstanding, no additional rights to\npurchase shares of Stock shall be granted under the Plan after June 3, 2024 unless and until the Company’s\nstockholders have approved the Plan, as amended by the Board on April 10, 2024.\nSECTION 8.

Employee stock purchase plans not\ndescribed in section 423 of the Code shall be disregarded.

If a Participant in any manner attempts to\ntransfer, assign or otherwise encumber his or her rights or interest under the Plan, other than by the laws of\ndescent and distribution, then such act shall be treated as an election by the Participant to withdraw from the\nPlan under Section 5(a).\nSECTION 10. NO RIGHTS AS AN EMPLOYEE.\nNothing in the Plan or in any right granted under the Plan shall confer upon the Participant\nany right to continue in the employ of a Participating Company for any period of specific duration or\ninterfere with or otherwise restrict in any way the rights of the Participating Companies or of the Participant,\nwhich rights are hereby expressly reserved by each, to terminate his or her employment at any time and for\nany reason, with or without cause.\nSECTION 11.

In furtherance of the foregoing and notwithstanding any\nprovision in the Plan to the contrary, if the Committee determines that a right granted under the Plan may be\nsubject to Section 409A of the Code or that any provision in the Plan would cause a right under the Plan to be\nsubject to Section 409A of the Code, the Committee may amend the terms of the Plan and/or of an\noutstanding right granted under the Plan, or take such other action the Committee determines is necessary or\nappropriate, in each case, without the Participant’s consent, to exempt any outstanding right or future right\nthat may be granted under the Plan from or to allow any such rights to comply with Section 409A of the\nCode, but only to the extent any such amendments or action by the Committee would not violate Section\nEQUINIX 2024 PROXY STATEMENT Appendix Materials / B-9\n409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will have no liability to a Participant or any\nother party if the right to purchase shares of Stock under the Plan that is intended to be exempt from or\ncompliant with Section 409A of the Code is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the\nCommittee with respect thereto. The Company makes no representation that the right to purchase Stock\nunder the Plan is compliant with Section 409A of the Code.\n(b) Tax Qualification. Although the Company may endeavor to (i) qualify a right to purchase Stock for\nfavorable tax treatment under the laws of the United States or jurisdictions outside of the United States or (ii)\navoid adverse tax treatment (e.g., under Section 409A of the Code), the Company makes no representation to\nthat effect and expressly disavows any covenant to maintain favorable or avoid unfavorable tax treatment,\nnotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, including Section 14(a) hereof. The Company will be\nunconstrained in its corporate activities without regard to the potential negative tax impact on Participants\nunder the Plan.\nSECTION 15.

All per-share results are presented on a fully diluted basis.\n\n**_Third-Quarter 2024 Results Summary_**\n\n  * **Revenues**\n    * $2.2 billion, a 2% increase over the previous quarter\n    * Includes a minimal negative foreign currency impact when compared to prior guidance rates\n  * **Operating Income**\n    * $425 million, lower than the previous quarter due to the Q2 gain on sale of the Silicon Valley 12 xScale (SV12x) asset\n  * **Net Income attributable to Common Stockholders and Net Income per Share attributable to Common Stockholders**\n    * $297 million, lower than the previous quarter due to the Q2 gain on sale of the SV12x asset\n    * $3.10 per share, lower than the previous quarter\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA**\n    * $1,048 million, a 1% increase over the previous quarter, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 48%\n    * Includes a minimal negative foreign currency impact when compared to prior guidance rates and $2 million of integration costs\n  * **AFFO and AFFO per Share**\n    * $866 million, lower than the previous quarter, due to seasonally higher recurring capital expenditures; partially offset by higher EBITDA flow-through\n    * $9.05 per share, lower than the previous quarter\n\n\n\n**_2024 Annual Guidance Summary_**\n\n  * **Revenues**\n    * $8.748 - $8.788 billion, an increase of approximately 7% over the previous year, or a normalized and constant currency increase of 7 - 8%, excluding the year-over-year impact of the power pass-through\n    * An increase of $36 million compared to prior guidance\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA**\n    * $4.086 - $4.126 billion, a 47% adjusted EBITDA margin\n    * An increase of $10 million compared to prior guidance\n    * Includes $15 million of integration costs\n  * **AFFO and AFFO per Share**\n    * $3.338 - $3.378 billion, an increase of 11 - 12% over the previous year, or a normalized and constant currency increase of 11 - 13%\n    * An increase of $18 million compared to prior guidance\n    * $34.81 - $35.22 per share, an increase of 8 - 10% over the previous year, or a normalized and constant currency increase of 9 - 10%\n\n\n\nEquinix converted the presentation of results from thousands to millions in the first quarter of 2024. Certain rounding adjustments have been made to prior period disclosed amounts.\n\nEquinix is not reasonably able to provide forward-looking guidance for certain financial data, such as depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation, net income (loss) from operations, cash generated from operating activities and cash used in investing activities, and as a result, is not able to provide a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for forward-looking data without unreasonable effort. The impact of such adjustments could be significant.\n\n**_Equinix Quote_**\n\n**Adaire Fox-Martin, CEO and President, Equinix:**\n\n_\"Our 87 th consecutive quarter of revenue growth was also a record-breaking one for gross bookings, with strong results across our three regions. This performance is a testament to the trust our customers place in Equinix and the value they realize partnering strategically with us. We see continued robust demand for AI-enabling digital infrastructure from a highly diverse set of customers of varying sizes, industries, and regions. This, coupled with significant expansion of our xScale capability, further strengthens our value proposition with customers and our leading position in the market.\"_\n\n**_Business Highlights_**\n\n  * Equinix remains dedicated to making extensive investments across its global operations to support the digital infrastructure needs of customers. The company currently has 57 major projects underway in 35 markets across 22 countries, including 13 xScale projects, representing more than 22,000 cabinets of retail capacity and more than 100 megawatts of xScale capacity to be delivered through the end of 2025.\n    * Earlier this month, Equinix announced plans to nearly triple the capital invested in its xScale data center portfolio with the agreement to form a greater than $15 billion joint venture, subject to closing conditions, with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) and GIC, with whom Equinix has previously partnered on xScale projects in Asia, the Americas and Europe. Through this joint venture, Equinix expects to build new state-of-the-art xScale facilities on multiple campuses across the U.S., each with multi-hundred megawatts of capacity. As previously announced, Equinix recently acquired a greater-than-200-acre land parcel as it develops its first multi-hundred-megawatt xScale campus in the Atlanta metro area to support the pursuit of larger AI and hyperscale workloads.\n    * Equinix's global xScale portfolio continues to see strong demand and leasing activity as the need for hyperscale infrastructure to support AI and cloud initiatives continues to grow. Since its Q2 earnings call, the company leased an incremental 20 megawatts of capacity into its Seoul 2 (SL2x) asset, bringing total xScale leasing to 385 megawatts globally with nearly 90% of its operational and under-construction capacity leased.\n    * In August, Equinix opened its first International Business Exchange™ (IBX®) data center in Johannesburg, South Africa to support and enhance the growing digital infrastructure and connectivity needs of enterprises and service providers on the rapidly growing African continent. The company also opened the first phases of its New York 3 (NY3) and Tokyo 15 (TY15) assets, easing capacity constraints in two key markets.\n  * Digital infrastructure, serving as the backbone of today's economy, encompasses connectivity that touches lives daily, enabling everything from online shopping to the lifesaving operations of hospitals, to supporting the data needs of AI training and inferencing. Equinix's industry-leading global interconnection franchise continues to perform with 478,000 total interconnections deployed on its platform. In the third quarter of 2024, net interconnection adds improved to 5,700 due to strong hyperscaler cross connect additions and continued diversification of Equinix's ecosystems.\n    * Equinix Fabric® saw continued solid growth with a roughly 40% global customer attach rate. Fabric growth was driven by solid 100-gigabyte port additions and higher bandwidth virtual connections.\n    * Internet Exchange experienced ongoing growth from existing customers as peak traffic surpassed 40 terabits per second for the first time.\n  * Equinix's Channel program delivered another solid quarter, accounting for approximately 50% of company new logos. It continued to see growth from partners like Avant, Dell, Orange Business and WWT, with wins across a wide range of industry segments and use cases, including AI. Key wins this quarter include a data center modernization project with AT&T. Through this project, Equinix is helping a customer-experience technology company blend cloud and private infrastructure resources, enable multicloud networking and accelerate AI and automation enhancements for customer interactions.\n  * In September, Equinix announced that it issued more than $750 million in green bonds across two completed offerings. The green bonds align the company's financing needs with its Future First sustainability strategy. With these latest issuances, Equinix will have issued a total of approximately $5.6 billion of green bonds, making it one of the top 10 largest U.S. corporate issuers in the investment-grade green bond market.\n\n\n\n**_Business Outlook_**\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, the company expects revenues to range between $2.262 and $2.302 billion, an as-reported increase of 3 - 5% over the previous quarter, or a normalized and constant currency increase of 2 - 4% excluding the quarter-over-quarter impact of the power pass-through. This guidance includes a $26 million foreign currency benefit when compared to the average FX rates in Q3 2024. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.010 and $1.050 billion. This guidance includes a $12 million foreign currency benefit when compared to the average FX rates in Q3 2024, $8 million of integration costs related to acquisitions and higher seasonal spending. Recurring capital expenditures are expected to range between $94 and $114 million, consistent with our typical seasonal investments in Q4.\n\nFor the full year of 2024, total revenues are expected to range between $8.748 and $8.788 billion, an as-reported increase of approximately 7% over the previous year, or a normalized and constant currency increase of approximately 7 - 8% excluding the year-over-year impact of the power pass-through. This $36 million increase from previously issued guidance is due to $12 million of better-than-expected operating performance and a $24 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to the prior guidance rates. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $4.086 and $4.126 billion, an adjusted EBITDA margin of 47%. This $10 million increase over previously issued guidance is due to a positive foreign currency benefit when compared to prior guidance rates. AFFO is expected to range between $3.338 and $3.378 billion, an as-reported increase of 11 - 12% over the previous year, or a normalized and constant currency increase of 11 - 13%. This $18 million increase over the previously issued guidance is due to $15 million from better-than-expected operating performance and a $3 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to prior guidance rates. AFFO per share is expected to range between $34.81 and $35.22, an as-reported increase of 8 - 10% over the previous year, or a normalized and constant currency increase of 9 - 10%. Total capital expenditures are expected to range between $2.850 and $3.100 billion. Non-recurring capital expenditures, including xScale-related capital expenditures, are expected to range between $2.620 and $2.850 billion, and recurring capital expenditures are expected to range between $230 and $250 million.\n\nThe U.S. dollar exchange rates used for 2024 guidance, taking into consideration the impact of our current foreign currency hedges, have been updated to $1.11 to the Euro, $1.28 to the Pound, S$1.29 to the U.S. Dollar, ¥144 to the U.S. Dollar, A$1.45 to the U.S. Dollar, HK$7.77 to the U.S. Dollar, R$5.46 to the U.S. Dollar and C$1.35 to the U.S. Dollar. The Q3 2024 global revenue breakdown by currency for the Euro, British Pound, Singapore Dollar, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar, Brazilian Real and Canadian Dollar is 20%, 10%, 9%, 5%, 5%, 3%, 3% and 2%, respectively.\n\nThe adjusted EBITDA guidance is based on the revenue guidance less our expectations of cash cost of revenues and cash operating expenses. The AFFO guidance is based on the adjusted EBITDA guidance less our expectations of net interest expense, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, a contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, income tax expense, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures, other income (expense), (gains) losses on disposition of real estate property, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items.\n\n**_Q3 2024 Results Conference Call and Replay Information_**\n\nEquinix will discuss its quarterly results for the period ended September 30, 2024, along with its future outlook, in its quarterly conference call on Wednesday, October 30, 2024, at 5:30 PM ET (2:30 PM PT).

Digital leaders harness Equinix's trusted platform to bring together and interconnect foundational infrastructure at software speed. Equinix enables organizations to access all the right places, partners and possibilities to scale with agility, speed the launch of digital services, deliver world-class experiences and multiply their value, while supporting their sustainability goals.\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**\n\nEquinix provides all information required in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, Equinix uses non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its operations.\n\nEquinix provides normalized and constant currency growth rates, which are calculated to adjust for acquisitions, dispositions, integration costs, changes in accounting principles and foreign currency.\n\nEquinix presents adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income excluding income tax expense, interest income, interest expense, other income or expense, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs and gain or loss on asset sales.\n\nIn presenting non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA, cash cost of revenues, cash gross margins, cash operating expenses (also known as cash selling, general and administrative expenses or cash SG&A), adjusted EBITDA margins, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow, Equinix excludes certain items that it believes are not good indicators of Equinix's current or future operating performance. These items are depreciation, amortization, accretion of asset retirement obligations and accrued restructuring charges, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs and gain or loss on asset sales. Equinix excludes these items in order for its lenders, investors and the industry analysts who review and report on Equinix to better evaluate Equinix's operating performance and cash spending levels relative to its industry sector and competitors.\n\nEquinix excludes depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of a data center, and do not reflect its current or future cash spending levels to support its business. Its data centers are long-lived assets, and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of a data center do not recur with respect to such data center, although Equinix may incur initial construction costs in future periods with respect to additional data centers, and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to the initial investment. This is a trend it expects to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of the data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historic costs incurred to build out our data centers and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, Equinix excludes depreciation from its operating results when evaluating its operations.\n\nIn addition, in presenting the non-GAAP financial measures, Equinix also excludes amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of acquisitions, and these charges may vary in amount from period to period. We exclude amortization expense to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our prior periods. Equinix excludes accretion expense, both as it relates to its asset retirement obligations as well as its accrued restructuring charges, as these expenses represent costs which Equinix also believes are not meaningful in evaluating Equinix's current operations. Equinix excludes stock-based compensation expense, as it can vary significantly from period to period based on share price and the timing, size and nature of equity awards. As such, Equinix and many investors and analysts exclude stock-based compensation expense to compare its operating results with those of other companies. Equinix also excludes restructuring charges. Such charges include employee severance, facility closure costs, lease or other contract termination costs and advisory fees related to the realignment of our management structure, operations or products. Equinix also excludes impairment charges related to goodwill or long-lived assets. Equinix also excludes gain or loss on asset sales as it represents profit or loss that is not meaningful in evaluating the current or future operating performance. Finally, Equinix excludes transaction costs from its non-GAAP financial measures to allow more comparable comparisons of the financial results to the historical operations. The transaction costs relate to costs Equinix incurs in connection with business combinations and formation of joint ventures, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional or consulting fees. Such charges generally are not relevant to assessing the long-term performance of Equinix. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the transactions. Management believes items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs and gain or loss on asset sales are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs may occur in future periods.\n\nEquinix also presents funds from operations (\"FFO\") and adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\"), both commonly used in the REIT industry, as supplemental performance measures. Additionally, Equinix presents AFFO per share, which is also commonly used in the REIT industry. AFFO per share offers investors and industry analysts a perspective of Equinix's underlying operating performance when compared to other REIT companies. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). FFO represents net income or loss, excluding gain or loss from the disposition of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items. AFFO represents FFO, excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate assets, accretion, stock-based compensation, stock-based charitable contributions, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, a contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures, net income or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax and adjustments from FFO to AFFO for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items. Equinix excludes depreciation expense, amortization expense, accretion, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges and transaction costs for the same reasons that they are excluded from the other non-GAAP financial measures mentioned above.\n\nEquinix includes an adjustment for revenues from installation fees, since installation fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of contract term, although the fees are generally paid in a lump sum upon installation. Equinix includes an adjustment for straight-line rent expense on its operating leases, since the total minimum lease payments are recognized ratably over the lease term, although the lease payments generally increase over the lease term. Equinix also includes an adjustment to contract costs incurred to obtain contracts, since contract costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated period of benefit on a straight-line basis, although costs of obtaining contracts are generally incurred and paid during the period of obtaining the contracts. The adjustments for installation revenues, straight-line rent expense and contract costs are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results in the consolidated statement of operations. Equinix excludes the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with its debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations. Equinix excludes gain or loss on debt extinguishment since it represents a cost that is not a good indicator of Equinix's current or future operating performance. Equinix includes an income tax expense adjustment, which represents the non-cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions that do not relate to the current period's operations. Equinix excludes recurring capital expenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of its IBX and xScale data centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues. Equinix also excludes net income or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, which represents results that are not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance.\n\nEquinix presents constant currency results of operations, which is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, Equinix has presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate its operating results without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of Equinix's business performance. To present this information, Equinix's current and comparative period revenues and certain operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at a consistent exchange rate for purposes of each result being compared.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Equinix presents such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate its operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be its core, ongoing business operations. Management believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and its ability to perform in subsequent periods. Equinix believes that if it did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze Equinix effectively.\n\nInvestors should note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by Equinix may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. Investors should, therefore, exercise caution when comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. Equinix does not provide forward-looking guidance for certain financial data, such as depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation, net income or loss from operations, cash generated from operating activities and cash used in investing activities, and as a result, is not able to provide a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for forward-looking data without unreasonable effort. The impact of such adjustments could be significant. Equinix intends to calculate the various non-GAAP financial measures in future periods consistent with how they were calculated for the periods presented within this press release.\n\n**_Forward-Looking Statements_**\n\n_This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from expectations discussed in such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, risks to our business and operating results related to the current inflationary environment; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; stock price fluctuations; availability of power, increased costs to procure power and the general volatility in the global energy market; the challenges of acquiring, operating and constructing IBX and xScale data centers and developing, deploying and delivering Equinix products and solutions; delays related to the closing of any planned acquisitions subject to closing conditions; unanticipated costs or difficulties relating to the integration of companies we have acquired or will acquire into Equinix; a failure to receive significant revenues from customers in recently built out or acquired data centers; failure to complete any financing arrangements contemplated from time to time; competition from existing and new competitors; the ability to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds to repay new or outstanding indebtedness; the loss or decline in business from our key customers; risks related to our taxation as a REIT; risks related to regulatory inquiries or litigation; and other risks described from time to time in Equinix filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
