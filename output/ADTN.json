Reports Preliminary Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nNovember 7, 2024\n\nHUNTSVILLE, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADTN and FSE: QH9) (“ADTRAN Holdings” or the “Company”) today announced its preliminary unaudited financial results for the third quarter of 2024. \n\n  * Revenue: $227.7 million, up sequentially and above the mid-point of guidance. \n  * Gross margin: GAAP gross margin: 37.4%; Non-GAAP gross margin: 42.1%, a sequential increase of 134 and 17 basis points, respectively. \n  * Operating margin: GAAP operating margin negative 10.5% up sequentially; Non-GAAP operating margin positive 1.1%, up sequentially and above the mid-point of guidance. \n  * GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.36; Non-GAAP diluted loss per share $0.05. \n\n\n\nADTRAN Holdings’ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tom Stanton stated, “We delivered higher sequential revenue and expanded gross and operating margins in the third quarter. Importantly, we are seeing improvements in our key end markets as we continue to grow our customer base. With the gradual recovery in service provider spending, the success we are having in customer acquisition, and encouraging booking trends, we expect sequential revenue growth to continue in the fourth quarter. This outlook, coupled with improving visibility, gives us confidence our end-markets should continue to improve.” \n\n“ADTRAN remains well-positioned for sustainable and profitable growth as customer inventory levels normalize,” added Mr. Stanton. “The continued trend to increase fiber access and optical transport, combined with the ongoing transition from higher risk vendors to providers like ADTRAN, serve as durable secular catalysts. As we grow, we are confident we can unlock meaningful operational leverage, driving accelerated profitability and increased cash generation.” \n\n**Business Outlook 1 **\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company expects revenue to be within a range of $230 million to $245 million. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be within a range of 0% to 4%. \n\n1GAAP earnings guidance is not provided. Please see the Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this press release for an explanation regarding the Company’s omission of both GAAP earnings guidance and the applicable reconciliation table. In addition, please see the Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and the Supplemental Information Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures at the end of this press release for detailed information on calculating the non-GAAP measures referenced herein. \n\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss its preliminary third quarter results on Thursday, November 07, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. Central Time, or 4:30 p.m. Central European Time.

Forward-looking statements can also generally be identified by the use of words such as “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “will,” “may,” “could” and similar expressions. In addition, ADTRAN Holdings, through its senior management, may from time to time make forward-looking public statements concerning the matters described herein. All such projections and other forward-looking information speak only as of the date hereof, and ADTRAN Holdings undertakes no duty to publicly update or revise such forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except to the extent as may be required by law. All such forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates and reflect management’s best judgment based upon current information. Actual events or results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors. While it is impossible to identify all such factors, factors which have caused and may in the future cause actual events or results to differ materially from those estimated by ADTRAN Holdings include, but are not limited to: (i) risks and uncertainties relating to ADTRAN Holdings’ ability to continue to reduce expenditures and the impact of such reductions on its financial results and financial condition; (ii) the risk of fluctuations in revenue due to lengthy sales and approval processes required by major and other service providers for new products, as well as ongoing tighter inventory management of ADTRAN Holdings’ customers; (iii) risks and uncertainties relating to ongoing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; (iv) risks and uncertainties relating to our ability to comply with the covenants set forth in our credit facility and to satisfy our payment obligations to Adtran Networks’ minority shareholders under the Domination and Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement between us and Adtran Networks; (v) risks posed by potential breaches of information systems and cyber-attacks; (vi) the risk that ADTRAN Holdings may not be able to effectively compete, including through product improvements and development; and (vii) other risks set forth in ADTRAN Holdings’ public filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024, and risks to be disclosed in its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 to be filed with the SEC. \n\nAdditionally, the financial measures presented herein are preliminary estimates, remain subject to our internal controls and procedures, and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, among others, changes in connection with quarter-end adjustments. Any variation between the Company’s actual results and the preliminary financial information set forth herein may be material. \n\n**Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nSet forth in the tables below are reconciliations of gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, operating loss, other (expense) income, net loss inclusive of the non-controlling interest, net loss attributable to the Company, net income attributable to the non-controlling interest, and loss per share - basic and diluted, attributable to the Company, and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, in each case as reported based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), to non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP other expense, non-GAAP net loss inclusive of the non-controlling interest, non-GAAP net loss attributable to the Company, non-GAAP net income attributable to the non-controlling interest, non-GAAP loss per share - basic and diluted, attributable to the Company, respectively, and non-GAAP free cash flow. Such non-GAAP measures exclude acquisition-related expenses, amortization and adjustments (consisting of intangible amortization of backlog, developed technology, customer relationships, and trade names acquired in connection with business combinations and amortization of inventory fair value adjustments as well as legal and advisory fees related to a potential significant transaction), stock-based compensation expense, amortization of pension actuarial losses, deferred compensation adjustments, integration expenses, restructuring expenses, goodwill impairments, the tax effect of these adjustments to net loss and purchases of property, plant and equipment. These measures are used by management in our ongoing planning and annual budgeting processes. Additionally, we believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures, when combined with the presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is beneficial to the overall understanding of ongoing operating performance of the Company. \n\n1 Non-GAAP operating margin (which is calculated as non-GAAP operating loss divided by revenue) is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company has provided fourth quarter guidance with regard to non-GAAP operating margin. This measure excludes from the corresponding GAAP financial measure the effect of adjustments as described below. The Company has not provided a reconciliation of such non-GAAP guidance to guidance presented on a GAAP basis because it cannot predict and quantify without unreasonable effort all of the adjustments that may occur during the period due to the difficulty of predicting the timing and amounts of various items within a reasonable range. In particular, non-GAAP operating margin excludes certain items, including continued restructuring expenses, that will continue to evolve as our business efficiency program is implemented that the Company is unable to quantitatively predict. Depending on the materiality of these items, they could have a significant impact on the Company's GAAP financial results. \n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP and therefore should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, our calculation of non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar measures calculated by other companies.. \n\n**Published by**\n\nADTRAN Holdings, Inc. \n\n[www.adtran.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adtran.com%2F&esheet=54148682&newsitemid=20241106734785&lan=en-US&anchor=www.adtran.com&index=4&md5=3cdc7f04564b752c5ec36bff9131e028)\n\n**Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets** **(Preliminary, Unaudited)** **(In thousands)**  \n---  \n**September 30,** |  **December 31,**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**Assets**  \n**Current Assets**  \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  88,456  |  $  |  87,167   \nAccounts receivable, net  |  172,025  |  216,445   \nOther receivables  |  12,871  |  17,450   \nIncome tax receivable  |  13,466  |  7,933   \nInventory, net  |  282,926  |  362,295   \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets  |  69,112  |  45,566   \n**Total Current Assets** |  **638,856** |  **736,856**  \nProperty, plant and equipment, net  |  147,428  |  123,020   \nDeferred tax assets  |  25,697  |  25,787   \nGoodwill  |  56,884  |  353,415   \nIntangibles, net  |  286,098  |  327,985   \nOther non-current assets  |  86,677  |  87,706   \nLong-term investments  |  31,506  |  27,743   \n**Total Assets** |  **$** |  **1,273,146** |  **$** |  **1,682,512**  \n**Liabilities, Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest and Equity**  \n**Current Liabilities**  \nAccounts payable  |  $  |  173,354  |  $  |  162,922   \nUnearned revenue  |  54,615  |  46,731   \nAccrued expenses and other liabilities  |  34,482  |  36,204   \nAccrued wages and benefits  |  40,366  |  27,030   \nIncome tax payable, net  |  2,007  |  5,221   \n**Total Current Liabilities** |  **304,824** |  **278,108**  \nNon-current revolving credit agreement outstanding  |  189,849  |  195,000   \nDeferred tax liabilities  |  21,483  |  35,655   \nNon-current unearned revenue  |  24,901  |  25,109   \nNon-current pension liability  |  12,149  |  12,543   \nDeferred compensation liability  |  32,046  |  29,039   \nNon-current lease obligations  |  25,635  |  31,420   \nOther non-current liabilities  |  26,489  |  28,657   \n**Total Liabilities** |  **637,376** |  **635,531**  \n**Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest** |  **421,776** |  **442,152**  \n**Equity**  \nCommon stock  |  792  |  790   \nAdditional paid-in capital  |  806,187  |  795,304   \nAccumulated other comprehensive income  |  47,377  |  47,465   \nRetained deficit  |  (635,164  |  )  |  (232,905  |  )   \nTreasury stock  |  (5,198  |  )  |  (5,825  |  )   \n**Total Equity** |  **213,994** |  **604,829**  \n**Total Liabilities, Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest and Equity** |  **$** |  **1,273,146** |  **$** |  **1,682,512**  \n**Condensed Consolidated Statements of Loss** **(Preliminary, Unaudited)** **(In thousands, except per share amounts)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n**September 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Revenue**  \nNetwork Solutions  |  $  |  181,488  |  $  |  228,564  |  $  |  541,955  |  $  |  793,984   \nServices & Support  |  46,216  |  43,767  |  137,913  |  129,637   \n**Total Revenue** |  **227,704** |  **272,331** |  **679,868** |  **923,621**  \n**Cost of Revenue**  \nNetwork Solutions  |  126,103  |  160,244  |  376,886  |  596,334   \nNetwork Solutions -

The Company has evaluated the errors and determined that the related impacts were not material to the previously issued consolidated financial statements for any prior period. A summary of the corrections to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, September 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, is as follows: \n\n  1. Pursuant to the terms of the DPLTA, each Adtran Networks shareholder (other than the Company) is entitled to receive from us an Annual Recurring Compensation payment of €0.52 per share. The Company erroneously accrued this liability every quarter at €0.59 per share, overstating the associated accrual, the net income attributable to non-controlling interest and the net loss attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. for fiscal periods beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2023 through the quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n  2. For the periods beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2023 through the quarter ended June 30, 2024 the Company remeasured the redeemable non-controlling interest each quarter-end at the current exchange rate of Euros to U.S. Dollar. The Company treated the redeemable non-controlling interest as a monetary mezzanine equity instrument but should have treated it as a non-monetary mezzanine equity instrument not subject to remeasurement. \n\n\n\nFor additional information, please see our Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 to be filed with the SEC. \n\n**Supplemental Information** **Reconciliation of Preliminary Gross Profit and Preliminary Gross Margin to** **Preliminary Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Preliminary Non-GAAP Gross Margin** **(Preliminary, Unaudited)** **(In thousands)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023** |  **September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n**Total Revenue** |  **$** |  **227,704** |  **$** |  **225,991** |  **$** |  **272,331** |  **$** |  **679,868** |  **$** |  **923,621**  \n**Cost of Revenue** |  **$** |  **142,453** |  **$** |  **144,416** |  **$** |  **198,094** |  **$** |  **440,787** |  **$** |  **669,023**  \nAcquisition-related expenses, amortizations and adjustments (1) |  (10,276  |  )  |  (10,064  |  )  |  (13,537  |  )  |  (30,517  |  )  |  (79,554  |  )   \nStock-based compensation expense  |  (270  |  )  |  (280  |  )  |  (279  |  )  |  (825  |  )  |  (854  |  )   \nRestructuring expenses (2) |  (7  |  )  |  (2,788  |  )  |  (21,630  |  )  |  (14,042  |  )  |  (21,706  |  )   \nIntegration expenses (3) |  (34  |  )  |  (35  |  )  |  (154  |  )  |  (104  |  )  |  (154  |  )   \n**Non-GAAP Cost of Revenue** |  **$** |  **131,866** |  **$** |  **131,249** |  **$** |  **162,494** |  **$** |  **395,299** |  **$** |  **566,755**  \n**Gross Profit** |  **$** |  **85,251** |  **$** |  **81,575** |  **$** |  **74,237** |  **$** |  **239,081** |  **$** |  **254,598**  \n**Non-GAAP Gross Profit** |  **$** |  **95,838** |  **$** |  **94,742** |  **$** |  **109,837** |  **$** |  **284,569** |  **$** |  **356,866**  \n**Gross Margin** |  **37.4** |  **%** |  **36.1** |  **%** |  **27.3** |  **%** |  **35.2** |  **%** |  **27.6** |  **%**  \n**Non-GAAP Gross Margin** |  **42.1** |  **%** |  **41.9** |  **%** |  **40.3** |  **%** |  **41.9** |  **%** |  **38.6** |  **%**  \n(1) Includes intangible amortization of backlog, inventory fair value adjustments, developed technology, customer relationships, and trade names acquired in connection with business combinations.  \n---  \n(2) Includes expenses for restructuring program designed to optimize the assets and business processes following the business combination with Adtran Networks.

Beginning in period ending September 30, 2024, the Company changed its method of calculating non-GAAP income taxes by applying blended statutory tax rates to non-GAAP losses before income taxes in order to include current and deferred income tax expenses that are commensurate with the non-GAAP measure of profitability. The blended statutory tax rate is calculated using 0%, resulting in no tax benefits net of impact of valuation allowance, for the loss jurisdiction’s non-GAAP losses before income taxes and 30% for all remaining jurisdictions’ non-GAAP income before income taxes. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the application of blended statutory tax rates, net of impact of valuation allowance, to non-GAAP losses before income taxes as opposed to the previous application of blended statutory and effective tax rates to separate non-GAAP adjustments. We previously reported the tax effect of the adjustment to non-GAAP net loss under the prior method of $7.9 million, $49.1 million and $21.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and for the three months ended June 30, 2024, respectively.  \n(5) Loss per common share attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. and Non-GAAP Loss per common share attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc reflects $3.0 million of gain on redemption of redeemable non-controlling interest for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.  \n**Supplemental Information** **Reconciliation of Preliminary Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Operating Activities to Preliminary Free Cash Flow** **(Unaudited)** **(In thousands)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n**September 30,** |  **June 30,** |  **September 30,** |  **September 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Net Cash provided by (used in) operating activities** |  **$** |  **42,030** |  **$** |  **19,898** |  **$** |  **6,846** |  **$** |  **98,526** |  **$** |  **(29,314** |  **)**  \nPurchases of property, plant and equipment (1) |  (18,814  |  )  |  (15,995  |  )  |  (13,556  |  )  |  (48,183  |  )  |  (33,674  |  )   \n**Free cash flow** |  **$** |  **23,216** |  **$** |  **3,903** |  **$** |  **(6,710** |  **)** |  **$** |  **50,343** |  **$** |  **(62,988** |  **)**  \n(1) Purchases related to capital expenditures.  \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241106734785r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**For media** Gareth Spence +44 1904 699 358 public.relations@adtran.com\n\n**For investors** Peter Schuman +1 650 743 7948 investor.relations@adtran.com\n\nSource: ADTRAN Holdings, Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://investors.adtran.com/news-and-events/default.aspx)\n\n## Investor Contact\n\nRhonda Lambert - Corporate Services Administrator\n\n  * [256-963-7450](tel:256-963-7450)\n  * Email Investor Relations\n  * [Request Financial Information](/investor-resources/request-financial-information/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n## Email Alerts\n\nTo receive notifications via email, enter your email address and select at least one subscription below.

(NASDAQ: ADTN and FSE: QH9) (“ADTRAN Holdings” or the “Company”) today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter of 2024. \n\n  * Revenue: $226.0 million \n  * Gross margin: \n    * GAAP gross margin: 36.1%; Non-GAAP gross margin: 41.9% \n  * Operating margin: \n    * GAAP operating margin negative 17.0%; Non-GAAP operating margin positive 0.7% \n  * Net Income (Loss): \n    * GAAP net loss attributable to the Company: $49.9 million; Non-GAAP net loss attributable to the Company: $18.8 million \n  * Earnings (Loss) per share: \n    * GAAP diluted loss per share attributable to the Company: $0.63; Non-GAAP diluted loss per share attributable to the Company: $0.24. \n\n\n\nADTRAN Holdings’ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tom Stanton stated, \"We had a solid second quarter, during which we saw improvements across all our major operating metrics, including profitability and working capital. During the quarter, we saw growth in our customer base across the U.S. and Europe as customers continue to adopt our latest fiber networking solutions”. \n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, the Company expects revenue in a range of $215million to $235million. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected in a range of -1% to +3%. \n\nFurthermore, non-GAAP operating margin (which is calculated as non-GAAP operating loss divided by revenue) is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company has provided third quarter guidance with regard to non-GAAP operating margin. This measure excludes from the corresponding GAAP financial measure the effect of adjustments as described below. The Company has not provided a reconciliation of such non-GAAP guidance to guidance presented on a GAAP basis because it cannot predict and quantify without unreasonable effort all of the adjustments that may occur during the period due to the difficulty of predicting the timing and amounts of various items within a reasonable range. In particular, non-GAAP operating margin excludes certain items, including continued restructuring and integration expenses that will continue to evolve as our business efficiency program is implemented, that the Company is unable to quantitatively predict. Depending on the materiality of these items, they could have a significant impact on the Company's GAAP financial results. \n\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss its second quarter results on Tuesday, August 06, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. Central Time, or 4:30 p.m. Central European Summer Time. The Company will webcast this conference call. To listen, simply visit our Investor Relations site at investors.adtran.com approximately 10 minutes prior to the start of the call, click on the event “ADTRAN Holdings Releases 2 nd Quarter 2024 Financial Results and Earnings Call”, and click on the webcast link. \n\nAn online replay of the Company’s conference call, as well as the transcript of the Company's conference call, will be available on the Investor Relations site approximately 24 hours following the call and will remain available for at least 12 months. For more information, visit investors.adtran.com or email investor.relations@adtran.com . \n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nStatements contained in this press release which are not historical facts, such as those relating to expectations regarding future revenues; ADTRAN Holdings ability to reduce its inventory levels; ADTRAN Holdings’ potential funding opportunities; and ADTRAN Holdings’ strategy and outlook, outlook and financial guidance, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can also generally be identified by the use of words such as “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “will,” “may,” “could” and similar expressions. In addition, ADTRAN Holdings, through its senior management, may from time to time make forward-looking public statements concerning the matters described herein. All such projections and other forward-looking information speak only as of the date hereof, and ADTRAN Holdings undertakes no duty to publicly update or revise such forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except to the extent as may be required by law. All such forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates and reflect management’s best judgment based upon current information. Actual events or results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors. While it is impossible to identify all such factors, factors which have caused and may in the future cause actual events or results to differ materially from those estimated by ADTRAN Holdings include, but are not limited to: (i) risks and uncertainties relating to ADTRAN Holdings’ ability to continue to reduce expenditures and the impact of such reductions on its financial results and financial condition; (ii) the risk of fluctuations in revenue due to lengthy sales and approval processes required by major and other service providers for new products, as well as ongoing tighter inventory management of ADTRAN Holdings’ customers ; (iii) risks and uncertainties relating to ongoing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; (iv) our ability to comply with the covenants set forth in our credit facility; (v) risks posed by potential breaches of information systems and cyber-attacks; (vi) the risk that ADTRAN Holdings may not be able to effectively compete, including through product improvements and development; and (vii) other risks set forth in ADTRAN Holdings’ public filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024, and risks to be disclosed in its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024. \n\n**Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nSet forth in the tables below are reconciliations of gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, operating loss, other (expense) income, net loss inclusive of the non-controlling interest, net loss attributable to the Company, net income attributable to the non-controlling interest, and loss per share - basic and diluted, attributable to the Company, and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, in each case as reported based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), to non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP other expense, non-GAAP net loss inclusive of the non-controlling interest, non-GAAP net loss attributable to the Company, non-GAAP net income attributable to the non-controlling interest, non-GAAP loss per share - basic and diluted, attributable to the Company, respectively, and non-GAAP free cash flow. Such non-GAAP measures exclude acquisition-related expenses, amortization and adjustments (consisting of intangible amortization of backlog, developed technology, customer relationships, and trade names acquired in connection with business combinations and amortization of inventory fair value adjustments as well as legal and advisory fees related to a potential significant transaction), stock-based compensation expense, amortization of pension actuarial losses, deferred compensation adjustments, integration expenses, restructuring expenses, goodwill impairments, the tax effect of these adjustments to net loss and purchases of property, plant and equipment. These measures are used by management in our ongoing planning and annual budgeting processes. Additionally, we believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures when combined with the presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is beneficial to the overall understanding of ongoing operating performance of the Company. \n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP and therefore should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, our calculation of non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar measures calculated by other companies. \n\n**About Adtran**\n\nADTRAN Holdings, Inc.

(NASDAQ: ADTN and FSE: QH9) (“ADTRAN Holdings” or the “Company”) today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter of 2024. \n\nGAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 31.9%, compared to 34.8% in Q4 2023 and 27.1% in the year-ago quarter, representing an improvement of 484 basis points (“bps”) year-over-year but a decrease of 285 bps quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year improvement primarily resulted from lower purchasing and transportation costs, as well as lower acquisition-related expenses, amortizations and adjustments. The sequential margin decline is primarily due to $8.8 million of inventory charges related to a strategy shift as part of our Business Efficiency Program. \n\nNon-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 41.6% compared to 41.9% in Q4 2023 and 37.3% in the year-ago quarter representing a decline of 33 bps sequentially and an improvement of 429 bps year-over-year. \n\nGAAP operating margin for the first quarter was negative 150.2%, primarily driven by a non-cash goodwill impairment charge. \n\nNon-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was negative 3.9%, which was within the guidance range of between -7% and 0% of revenues. Non-GAAP operating margin was negatively impacted by an unfavorable currency rate development and seasonal effects in the first quarter. \n\nGAAP net loss attributable to the Company for the first quarter of 2024, including the above mentioned impairment charge, was $324.6 million. Diluted loss per share attributable to the Company for the first quarter was $4.12. \n\nNon-GAAP net loss attributable to the Company for the first quarter of 2024 was $1.7 million. Non-GAAP diluted loss per share attributable to the Company for the first quarter was $0.02. \n\nADTRAN Holdings’ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tom Stanton stated, \"First quarter revenue and profitability came in as expected, with the weakness still impacting our results. However, we were pleased with the continued momentum in our customer win rate which was bolstered by the ongoing expansion of our Mosaic One platform. As we continued to execute on our business efficiency program, we were able to reduce inventory and significantly improve our operating cashflow while maintaining our diligence in gaining market share during this pivotal time in our industry. We believe that as markets return to normal, our continued focus on these measures, will lead to sustainable margin expansions and shareholder value creation in the mid-term.” \n\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss its first quarter results on Tuesday, May 07, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. Central Time, or 4:30 p.m. Central European Summer Time. The Company will webcast this conference call. To listen, simply visit our Investor Relations site at investors.adtran.com approximately 10 minutes prior to the start of the call, click on the event “ADTRAN Holdings Releases 1st Quarter 2024 Financial Results and Earnings Call”, and click on the webcast link. \n\nAn online replay of the Company’s conference call, as well as the transcript of the Company's conference call, will be available on the Investor Relations site approximately 24 hours following the call and will remain available for at least 12 months. For more information, visit investors.adtran.com or email investor.relations@adtran.com. \n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nStatements contained in this press release which are not historical facts, such as those relating to expectations regarding future revenues; ADTRAN Holdings’ expected future customer win rate and expansion of its Mosaic One platform; the ability of ADTRAN Holdings’ ability to continue to effectively implement the Business Efficiency Program; the impact of the foregoing measures on margin expansion and shareholder value creation; and ADTRAN Holdings’ strategy and outlook, outlook and financial guidance, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can also generally be identified by the use of words such as “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “will,” “may,” “could” and similar expressions. In addition, ADTRAN Holdings, through its senior management, may from time to time make forward-looking public statements concerning the matters described herein. All such projections and other forward-looking information speak only as of the date hereof, and ADTRAN Holdings undertakes no duty to publicly update or revise such forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except to the extent as may be required by law. All such forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates and reflect management’s best judgment based upon current information. Actual events or results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors. While it is impossible to identify all such factors, factors which have caused and may in the future cause actual events or results to differ materially from those estimated by ADTRAN Holdings include, but are not limited to: (i) risks and uncertainties relating to ADTRAN Holdings’ ability to reduce expenditures and the impact of such reductions on its financial results and financial condition; (ii) the risk of fluctuations in revenue due to lengthy sales and approval processes required by major and other service providers for new products, as well as ongoing tighter inventory management of ADTRAN Holdings’ customers ; (iii) risks and uncertainties relating to the recent restatements of our previously issued consolidated financial statements and ongoing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; (iv) our ability to comply with the covenants set forth in our credit facility; (v) risks posed by potential breaches of information systems and cyber-attacks; (vi) the risk that ADTRAN Holdings may not be able to effectively compete, including through product improvements and development; and (vii) other risks set forth in ADTRAN Holdings’ public filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024, and risks to be disclosed in its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024. \n\n**Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nSet forth in the tables below are reconciliations of gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, operating loss, other expense, net loss inclusive of the non-controlling interest, net loss attributable to the Company, net income (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest, and loss per share - basic and diluted, attributable to the Company, in each case as reported based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), to non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP other expense, non-GAAP net loss inclusive of the non-controlling interest, non-GAAP net loss attributable to the Company, non-GAAP net income attributable to the non-controlling interest, non-GAAP loss per share - basic and diluted, attributable to the Company, respectively, and non-GAAP free cash flow. Such non-GAAP measures exclude acquisition related expenses, amortization and adjustments (consisting of intangible amortization of backlog, developed technology, customer relationships, and trade names acquired in connection with business combinations and amortization of inventory fair value adjustments), stock-based compensation expense, amortization of pension actuarial losses, deferred compensation adjustments, integration expenses, restructuring expenses, goodwill impairments, and the tax effect of these adjustments to net income. These measures are used by management in our ongoing planning and annual budgeting processes. Additionally, we believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures when combined with the presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is beneficial to the overall understanding of ongoing operating performance of the Company. \n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP and therefore should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, our calculation of non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar measures calculated by other companies. \n\n**About Adtran**\n\nADTRAN Holdings, Inc.

(NASDAQ: ADTN and FSE: QH9) (“ADTRAN Holdings” or the “Company”) today announced its preliminary unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023. All results in this release are approximate due to the preliminary nature of the announcement. \n\nPreliminary GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 34.8% and improved by 483 bps year-over-year and 754 bps quarter-over-quarter. Besides lower purchasing and transportation costs, the main driver for this improvement were lower acquisition-related expenses, amortizations and adjustments. Additionally, the current quarter was negatively impacted by an inventory write-off of $3.3 million compared to a $21 million inventory write-off in Q3 2023. \n\nPreliminary non-GAAP gross margin of 41.9% was positively impacted by a favorable customer and product mix. This compares to 40.3% in Q3 2023 and 39.1% in the year-ago quarter representing an increase of 155 bps sequentially and 277 bps year over year. \n\nPreliminary GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was negative 16.7%, and it was negatively impacted by lower revenue and acquisition-related expenses, amortizations and adjustments. The company reduced GAAP operating expenses by 7.6% sequentially and 17.0% year-over-year. \n\nPreliminary non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was negative 1.4%, which was at the upper end of the guidance range of between -7% and 0% of revenues. The Company reduced non-GAAP operating expenses by 15.1% sequentially and 17.7% year-over-year. \n\nPreliminary GAAP net loss attributable to the Company for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $109.9 million. Preliminary diluted loss per share attributable to the Company for the fourth quarter was $1.40. \n\nPreliminary non-GAAP net loss attributable to the Company for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $85.9 million. Preliminary non-GAAP diluted loss per share attributable to the Company for the fourth quarter was $1.09. \n\nADTRAN Holdings’ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tom Stanton stated, \"Preliminary Q4 revenue came in as expected with non-GAAP profitability at the upper end of our guidance driven by continued gross margin improvements and lower operating expenses. Although revenues continued to remain challenging due to the macroeconomic environment and elevated customer inventories, we believe the fundamental demand landscape remains unchanged. Service providers continue to pursue the same objectives of expanding their fiber footprint and enhancing bandwidth, necessitating global infrastructure buildouts. With the ongoing implementation of our cost improvement measures, we believe that we are transforming into a more streamlined and efficient company. We expect that this will position us well to excel when spending returns to normal levels.\" \n\nThe Company confirmed that it will hold a conference call to discuss its preliminary fourth quarter results on Tuesday, February 27, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. Central Time, or 4:30 p.m. Central European Summer Time. ADTRAN Holdings will webcast this conference call. To listen, simply visit our Investor Relations site at investors.adtran.com approximately 10 minutes prior to the start of the call, click on the event “ADTRAN Holdings Releases 4th Quarter 2023 Financial Results and Earnings Call”, and click on the webcast link. \n\nAn online replay of the Company’s conference call, as well as the transcript of the Company's conference call, will be available on the Investor Relations site approximately 24 hours following the call and will remain available for at least 12 months.

Forward-looking statements can also generally be identified by the use of words such as “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “will,” “may,” “could” and similar expressions. In addition, ADTRAN Holdings, through its senior management, may from time to time make forward-looking public statements concerning the matters described herein. All such projections and other forward-looking information speak only as of the date hereof, and ADTRAN Holdings undertakes no duty to publicly update or revise such forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except to the extent as may be required by law. All such forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates and reflect management’s best judgment based upon current information. Actual events or results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors. While it is impossible to identify all such factors, factors which have caused and may in the future cause actual events or results to differ materially from those estimated by ADTRAN Holdings include, but are not limited to: (i) risks and uncertainties relating to ADTRAN Holdings’ ability to reduce expenditures and the impact of such reductions on its financial results and financial condition; (ii) the risk of fluctuations in revenue due to lengthy sales and approval processes required by major and other service providers for new products, as well as ongoing tighter inventory management of ADTRAN Holdings’ customers; (iii) risks and uncertainties relating to the recent restatements of our previously issued consolidated financial statements and ongoing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; ; (iv) risks and uncertainties related to the completed business combination between the Company, ADTRAN, Inc. (“ADTRAN”) and Adtran Networks SE (“Adtran Networks”) and subsequent integration efforts;(v) the risk posed by potential breaches of information systems and cyber-attacks; (vi) the risk that ADTRAN Holdings may not be able to effectively compete, including through product improvements and development; and (vii) other risks set forth in ADTRAN Holdings’ public filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as amended, and Form 10‑Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2023, as well as its Form 10‑K for the year ended December 31, 2023 to be filed with the SEC. \n\nAdditionally, the financial measures presented herein are preliminary estimates, remain subject to our internal controls and procedures, and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, among others, changes in connection with quarter-end adjustments. Any variation between the Company’s actual results and the preliminary financial information set forth herein may be material. \n\n**Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nSet forth in the tables below are reconciliations of gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, operating loss, other (expense) income, net (loss) income inclusive of the non-controlling interest, net (loss) income attributable to the Company, net income (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest, and (loss) earnings per share - basic and diluted, attributable to the Company, in each case as reported based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), to non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating (loss) income, non-GAAP other (expense) income, non-GAAP net (loss) income inclusive of the non-controlling interest, non-GAAP net (loss) income attributable to the Company, non-GAAP net income attributable to the non-controlling interest, and non-GAAP (loss) earnings per share - basic and diluted, attributable to the Company, respectively. Such non-GAAP measures exclude acquisition related expenses, amortization and adjustments (consisting of intangible amortization of backlog, developed technology, customer relationships, and trade names acquired in connection with business combinations and amortization of inventory fair value adjustments), stock-based compensation expense, amortization of pension actuarial losses, deferred compensation adjustments, integration expenses, restructuring expenses, asset and goodwill impairments, and the tax effect of these adjustments to net income. These measures are used by management in our ongoing planning and annual budgeting processes. Additionally, we believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures when combined with the presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is beneficial to the overall understanding of ongoing operating performance of the Company. \n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP and therefore should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, our calculation of non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar measures calculated by other companies. \n\n**About Adtran**\n\nADTRAN Holdings, Inc.

BUSINESS\nCompany Overview\nWe are a leading global provider of open networking and communications platforms, software, systems and services focused on the\nbroadband access market, serving a diverse domestic and international customer base in multiple countries that includes traditional\ncommunication services providers, alternative service providers, such as utilities, municipalities and fiber overbuilders, cable/MSOs,\nSMBs and distributed enterprises. Our innovative solutions and services enable voice, data, video and internet-communications across\na variety of network infrastructures and are currently in use by millions of people worldwide. We support our customers through our\ndirect global sales organization and our distribution networks. Our success depends upon our ability to increase unit volume and market\nshare through the introduction of new products and succeeding generations of products having optimal selling prices and increased\nfunctionality as compared to both the prior generation of a product and to the products of competitors in order to gain market share. To\nservice our customers and grow revenue, we are continually conducting research and developing new products addressing customer\nneeds and testing those products for the specific requirements of the particular customers. We offer a broad portfolio of flexible software\nand hardware network solutions and services that enable service providers to meet today’s service demands, while also enabling them\nto transition to the fully converged, scalable, highly-automated, cloud-controlled voice, data, internet and video network of the future.\nIn addition to our global headquarters in Huntsville, Alabama and our European headquarters in Munich, Germany, we have sales,\nresearch and development, and production facilities in strategic global locations.\nIn 2022, following the business combination (the “Business Combination”) with ADVA Optical Networking SE (“ADVA”), which\nincluded the Merger, we became the sole owner of and successor to ADTRAN, Inc. and the majority shareholder of ADVA. ADTRAN,\nInc. is a leading global provider of open, disaggregated networking and communications solutions that enable voice, data, video, and\ninternet communications across any network infrastructure. Its award-winning end-to-end fiber broadband solutions portfolio spans\nfrom OLTs to in-home services and intelligent SaaS solutions. ADVA is a global provider of open networking solutions with over 25\nyears of experience in optical networking, carrier Ethernet access and network synchronization. ADVA has led the industry for over\ntwo decades with open and secure networking solutions that carefully balance space, power and cost. Together, we serve customers in\na broad range of industries in over 100 countries. We believe that our combined technology portfolio can best address current and future\nrequirements, especially regarding the convergence of solutions at the network edge.\nWe operate under two reportable segments: (1) Network Solutions, which includes hardware and software products, and (2) Services &\nSupport, which includes a portfolio of network design and implementation services, support services and cloud-hosted SaaS applications\nthat complement our product portfolio and can be utilized to support other platforms as well. These two segments span across our three\nrevenue categories: (1) Subscriber Solutions, (2) Access & Aggregation Solutions and (3) Optical Networking Solutions. See below for\na detailed discussion of these reportable segments and revenue categories.\nWe are focused on being a top global supplier of fiber-based communications infrastructure and SaaS applications spanning from the\ncloud edge (data center) to the subscriber edge (customer premise) serving both the residential and enterprise connectivity markets. We\noffer a broad portfolio of flexible network infrastructure solutions, customer premises equipment, software applications, and global\nservices and support that enable service providers to meet their service demands now and in the future. These products and services\nenable service providers to transition to a common network supporting the simplified delivery of high-capacity services, regardless of\nsubscriber density, network topology and infrastructure diversity.\nWe began operations in January 1986. Our global headquarters are located at Cummings Research Park in Huntsville, Alabama, the\nsecond largest research park in the U.S. and fourth largest in the world. Our mailing address is 901 Explorer Boulevard, Huntsville,\nAlabama, 35806. Our telephone number at that location is (800) 923-8726. Our website is www.adtran.com. No information contained\non our website is intended to be included as part of, or incorporated by reference into, this report.\nDomination and Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement\nThe DPLTA between the Company, as the controlling company, and ADVA Optical Networking SE, as the controlled company, which\nwas executed on December 1, 2022, became effective on January 16, 2023 as a result of its registration with the commercial register\n(Handelsregister) of the local court (Amtsgericht) at the registered seat of ADVA (Jena).\nUnder the DPLTA, subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, (i) the Company is\nentitled to issue binding instructions to the management board of ADVA, (ii) ADVA will transfer its annual profit to the Company,\nsubject to, among other things, the creation or dissolution of certain reserves, and (iii) the Company will generally absorb the annual net\nloss incurred by ADVA. The obligation of ADVA to transfer its annual profit to the Company applies for the first time to the profit\ngenerated, if any, in the ADVA fiscal year 2023. The obligation of the Company to absorb ADVA’s annual net loss applies for the first\ntime to the loss generated, if any, in the ADVA fiscal year 2023.\nAdditionally, and subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, the DPLTA provides\nthat ADVA shareholders (other than us) be offered, at their election, (i) to put their ADVA shares to the Company in exchange for a\ncompensation in cash of EUR 17.21 per share (the “Exit Compensation”), or (ii) to remain ADVA shareholders and receive a recurring\nFinancial Information 19\ncompensation in cash of EUR 0.59 (EUR 0.52 net under the current tax regime) per share for each full fiscal year of ADVA (the “Annual\nRecurring Compensation”). The Annual Recurring Compensation is due on the third banking day following the ordinary general\nshareholders’ meeting of ADVA for the respective preceding fiscal year (but in any event within eight months following expiration of\nthe fiscal year) and is first granted for the 2023 fiscal year, payable for the first time after the ordinary general shareholders’ meeting of\nADVA in 2024.\nThe adequacy of both forms of compensation have been challenged by minority shareholders of ADVA via court-led appraisal\nproceedings under German law, and it is possible that the courts in such appraisal proceedings may adjudicate a higher Exit\nCompensation or Annual Recurring Compensation (in each case, including interest thereon) than agreed upon in the DPLTA.\nThe opportunity for outside ADVA shareholders to tender ADVA shares in exchange for Exit Compensation had been scheduled to\nexpire on March 16, 2023. However, due to the appraisal proceedings that have been initiated in accordance with applicable German\nlaw, this time period for tendering shares has been extended pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and will end\ntwo months after the date on which a final decision in such appraisal proceedings has been published in the Federal Gazette\n(Bundesanzeiger).\nWe currently hold 33,961,170 no-par value bearer shares of ADVA, representing 65.30% of ADVA’s outstanding shares as of February\n14, 2023.\nThe foregoing description of the DPLTA does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the DPLTA, a\nnon-binding English translation of which incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $14.2 million of transaction costs. We expect to incur integration costs and\ncosts associated with our performance under the DPLTA during 2023 and such costs are expected to be material.\nReportable Segments\nOur business operates under two reportable segments: (1) Network Solutions and (2) Services & Support. We review our financial\nperformance, specifically revenue and gross profit, based on these two segments.\nNetwork Solutions Segment\nThe Network Solutions segment includes hardware and software products that enable a digital future. Our cloud-managed Wi-Fi\ngateways, virtualization software, and switches provide a mix of wired and wireless connectivity at the customer premises. In addition,\nour Carrier Ethernet products support a variety of applications at the network edge ranging from mobile backhaul to connecting\nenterprise customers (“Subscriber Solutions\"). Our portfolio includes products for multi-gigabit service delivery over fiber or alternative\nmedia to homes and businesses. We support traditional chassis-based network solutions, such as the Total Access 5000 and hiX 5600.\nWe also accelerate the industry’s transition to open, disaggregated fiber access solutions with our SDX Series. Data streams are\naggregated via our XG400 product family and synchronized by our Oscilloquartz offerings (“Access and Aggregation Solutions”). All\nresulting traffic requires transport through fiber-based networks as supported by our FSP 3000 and MicroMux product families while\nthe underlying infrastructure is monitored by our ALM product offering (“Optical Networking Solutions”). Our customers can use our\nMosaic and Ensemble software suites to manage and orchestrate our complete portfolio of subscriber solutions, access and aggregation\nsolutions and optical networking solutions. The Mosaic and Ensemble software suites include a mix of orchestration and management\nsolutions that simplify the deployment and virtualization of next generation fiber networks.\nServices & Support Segment\nThe Services & Support segment offers a comprehensive portfolio of network design, implementation, maintenance and cloud-hosted\nservices supporting our Subscriber, Access and Aggregation, and Optical Networking Solutions. These services assist operators in the\ndeployment of multi-vendor networks while reducing their cost to maintain these networks. The cloud-hosted services include a suite\nof SaaS applications under our Mosaic One platform that manages end-to-end network and service optimization for both fiber access\ninfrastructure and mesh Wi-Fi connectivity. We back these services with a global support organization that offers on-site and off-site\nsupport services with varying SLAs. By pairing our network solutions with our global services and support organization, customers can\nturn to us as their single turnkey partner to assist with the deployment and maintenance of modern fiber-based networks to connect\nhomes, businesses and datacenters with the metro or network core.\nRevenue Categories\nIn addition to classifying our operations into two reportable segments, we report revenue across three categories of products and services:\n(1) Subscriber Solutions, (2) Access & Aggregation Solutions and (3) Optical Networking Solutions.\n20 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nPrior to the Business Combination with ADVA on July 15, 2022, we reported revenue across the following three categories: (1) Access\n& Aggregation, (2) Subscriber Solutions & Experience and (3) Traditional & Other Products. Following the Business Combination with\nADVA, we have recast these revenues such that our former Access & Aggregation revenue is combined with a portion of the applicable\nADVA solutions to create Access & Aggregation Solutions, our former Subscriber Solutions & Experience revenue is combined with a\nportion of the applicable ADVA solutions to create Subscriber Solutions, and the revenue from Traditional & Other products is now\nincluded in the applicable Access & Aggregation Solutions or Subscriber Solutions category.

Drivers facilitating this network investment\ncycle include the evolution of government funding programs, private equity infrastructure investment appetite, regulatory broadband\npolicies, competition, merger obligations and ever-increasing subscriber demand for higher speed broadband.\nSubscriber demand for greater bandwidth continues to increase as connectivity is being woven ever more tightly into the fabric of\neveryone’s day-to-day lives. Increasing numbers of connected devices, shifting working arrangements, the transition of entertainment\nover to OTT video, along with the evolution of gaming towards subscription models where new hybrids of download and streaming are\nemerging globally. This is further compounded with the prevalence of IoT and the increasing transition of applications over to cloud-\nbased services and internet applications where recurring revenues replace one-time sales. Performance and user satisfaction are directly\nrelated to bandwidth availability and service robustness. As the demand for high-definition video and game streaming services,\nsymmetric bandwidth for online collaboration, ever lower latency for interactive cloud applications and smart home video surveillance\napplications continue to increase, so too does the need for fiber-based broadband to every home, business and location of socioeconomic\nactivity.\nIn order to satisfy these complex requirements and deliver on the efficiency improvements demanded by operators, communications\nservice providers are transitioning to full fiber access networks. This transition has created an unprecedented market opportunity where\nthe comprehensive replacement of copper and coaxial networks along with the equipment that enables broadband over them, opens what\nhas historically been a stagnant market to an entirely new wave of fresh competition.\nThis new market entrance opportunity is further enhanced by shifts in the geopolitical landscape alongside architectural evolutions.\nSeveral vendors that once dominated the European and other markets have found themselves classified on the high-risk vendor register\nwhere resistance is increasingly emerging about their use in national network infrastructures. This further levels the playing field for the\nremaining vendor community. In their pursuit of efficiency, operators are embracing new architectures, reflecting those used throughout\nthe web scale industry by the hyper-scalers. This is resulting in an additional inflection point where traditional access network equipment\narchitectures are coming under increasing scrutiny about their longevity, efficiency and scalability.\nWe aim to serve as a trusted partner to our customers. Working side-by-side with our customers, we assist them with maximizing the\nperformance of their networks by providing a flexible path for their networks to evolve cost effectively over to full fiber while availing\nthemselves of the benefits that web scale architectures deliver and helping to further monetize their investments.\nOur Strategy\nOur strategy is to provide innovative and cost-effective solutions for our customers that enable them to address their increasing\nbroadband demand. Our solutions focus on technology transformations that are happening in broadband network infrastructure, home\nand business CPE and software platforms, and services needed to help our customers address increasing complexity while scaling to\nmeet increasing consumer demands. ADVA’s technology complements ADTRAN’s portfolio and significantly expands the solutions\nset we can offer to our customers, helping them in their quest to enable the rapidly advancing digitalization of ecosystems around the\nworld. Optical networking technology provides the scalable transmission capacity needed to handle bandwidth growth. Cloud access\nsolutions allow the flexible and fast deployment of new communication services including state-of-the-art edge computing solutions,\nand the synchronization technology ensures maximum performance in the network.\nWe aspire to be one of the top communication technology players in the world and the innovation leader around the converged edge,\nenabling the intelligent, self-optimizing, fiber-everywhere future. We plan to achieve this goal through innovation in network, home and\nbusiness technology paired with a customer-focused organizational structure that tailors solutions to meet the needs of our target\ncustomers. ADTRAN has one of the most comprehensive solutions portfolios that empowers operators to build a converged\ninfrastructure from the metro core to the customer premise, serving all networking applications for residential, business, wholesale and\nmobile users. We take an approach to our portfolio in which we are focused in specific markets where we can offer competitive\ndifferentiation and scale while also having enough diversity and breadth in the portfolio to provide end-to-end connectivity solutions\nthat offer value to our customers. More specifically, our corporate strategy consists of the following elements:\n Leadership in fiber networking: Breadth of portfolio, open and advanced architecture, assured and secure connectivity.\n Growth in focus markets: More turnkey solutions and in-region resources, especially North America and EMEA.\n Investment in converged edge: Innovation in optics, security, AI-driven networking, virtualization, SaaS, etc.\n Transformation through software: Open and cloud-centric systems, end-to-end programmability, simplification through\nsoftware, and innovative SaaS offerings.\n Diversification of customers: Cross-selling current portfolio, acquisition of new customers and partners based on larger\nportfolio and trusted supplier status.\n24 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\n Focus on sustainability: Science-based emissions targets, process-based product eco-design, optimization of operations,\nlogistics and all packaging, circular-economy processes.\nCustomers\nWe have a diverse global customer base that includes Tier-1, -2 and -3 service providers, alternative service providers, such as utilities,\nmunicipalities and fiber overbuilders, cable/MSOs, SMBs and distributed enterprises. Many network operators require product approval\nbefore the purchase or installation of a product. The nature of our business involves a dynamic process of submitting new and succeeding\ngenerations of products for approval prior to orders being placed.\nOne service provider customer individually comprised more than 10% of our revenue in 2022. Additionally, our revenue in the U.S.,\nU.K. and Germany comprised more than 10% of our revenue in 2022. The revenue from this service provider and these countries is\nreported in both our Network Solutions and Services & Support segments.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with customers, service providers and approval processes, see “Risk Factors – The lengthy sales\nand approval process required by service providers for new products could result in fluctuations in our revenue,” “Risk Factors – We\ndepend heavily on sales to certain customers; the loss of any of these customers would significantly reduce our revenue and net income,”\nin Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nDistribution, Sales and Marketing\nWe sell our products through our direct sales organization and our distribution network. Our direct sales organization supports major\naccounts and has offices in domestic and international locations. Sales to most smaller and independent telephone companies are fulfilled\nthrough a combination of direct sales and distributors. Our services offerings can be purchased directly from us or through one of our\nservice providers, channel partners or distribution partners.\nBefore placing an order, service providers typically require lengthy product qualification and standardization processes that can extend\nfor several months or even years. Once approved, product orders are typically placed under single or multi-year supply agreements that\nare generally not subject to minimum volume commitments. Service providers generally prefer having two or more suppliers for most\nproducts. Therefore, individual orders are usually subject to competition based on some combination of total value, service, price,\ndelivery and other terms.\nOrders for end-user products are fulfilled through a combination of direct sales and distributors. This is supported by a direct sales\norganization for major accounts and a channel-based sales organization to facilitate sales to our partners. MSPs, VARs and SIs may be\naffiliated with us as channel partners, or they may purchase from a distributor in an unaffiliated fashion. Affiliated partners participate\nwith us at various program levels, based on sales volume and other factors, to receive benefits such as product discounts, market\ndevelopment funds, technical support and training.\nOutside of the U.S., most service provider products are sold through our direct sales organization and end-user products are sold direct\nor through distribution arrangements customized for each region. Some regions are supported from a field office that offers sales and\nsupport functions, and in some cases, warehousing and manufacturing support. Our field sales organizations, distributors and service\nprovider customers receive support from regional-based marketing, sales and customer support groups.\nOur marketing organization promotes all brands associated with us to key stakeholders, including customers, partners and prospects\nthroughout the world. Marketing is complemented by product marketing and management teams that work with our engineering teams\nto develop and promote new products and services, as well as product enhancements.\nFinancial Information 25\nResearch and Development\nRapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, supply constraints and continuing\ndevelopments in communications service offerings characterize the markets for our products. Our on-going ability to adapt to these\nchanges and to develop new and enhanced products that meet or anticipate market demand is the main factor influencing our competitive\nposition and our ability to grow.\nOur product development activities are a central part of our strategy. We plan to maintain our emphasis on product development to\nenable us to respond to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. Our research and development and engineering\nfunctions are global. We maintain research and development functions at multiple sites in the U.S., Europe, Israel and Asia. During the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, research and development expenditures totaled $173.8 million, $108.7 million and\n$113.3 million, respectively.\nWe develop the majority of our products internally, and we also leverage partners for some solutions. Additionally, we license\nintellectual property or acquire technologies. Internal development on advanced technology products gives us more control over design\nand manufacturing issues, while for traditional designs, ODM and/or licensed intellectual property provides us with the ability to\nleverage the economies of scale of our technology partners. This balanced approach ensures we provide best-in-class solutions for our\ncustomers.\nAs we continue to create more software-based intellectual property, such as our SDN/NFV portfolio, our use of lean agile practices in\nresearch and development ensures we remain responsive and customer-focused. This enables us to deliver products faster, at higher\nquality and more economically to our customers and the market on a continuous basis.\nOur ability to continually reduce product costs, while focusing on delivery and quality, are important parts of our overall business\nstrategy. Our product development efforts are often centered on entering a market with improved technology, enabling us to offer\nproducts at competitive prices and compete for market share. In 2022, we again encountered supply chain disruptions and component\nshortages, which resulted in us re-engineering many of our products to work around component availability and end of life issues. See\nInventory included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding our supply chain disruptions.\nDevelopment activities focus on solutions that support both existing and emerging communications industry technologies in segments\nthat we consider viable revenue opportunities. We are actively engaged in developing and refining technologies to support data, voice\nand video transport primarily over IP/Ethernet and Optical network architectures. This includes optical transport, packet demarcation\nand aggregation, synchronization and fiber-optic access, DSL, access routing, Ethernet switching, wireless LANs, integrated access,\nconverged services, VoIP, network management and professional services. In addition, we focus on vertical optical technologies like\nSilicon Photonics, as well as microelectronics in order to differentiate and fully control the vertical value stack of our solutions. In 2022,\nwe released many market-leading products like additions to our SDX OLT range, new residential gateway and ONT families, outdoor\npacket demarcation devices, 100G packet demarcation, encryption/security products, 800G transport solutions and the unique Optical\nCesium based atomic clocks. Furthermore, we enhanced our SaaS delivery abilities and Mosaic One software.\nOur research function and advanced technology team is driving many specific research projects in the fields of sustainable optical\ntransmission, security, quantum communications, SDN and access technologies. It fosters differentiated product concepts and guides\nour various product design and engineering teams in IPR creation, industry and network standards and technological forecasting.\nWe are an active participant in several SDOs and have assisted with the development of worldwide standards in many technologies.\nOur SDO activities are primarily in the area of broadband access, optical networking and synchronization. This includes involvement\nwith the ITU-T, ATIS, ETSI, ONF and the BBF. We are involved in the evolution of optical access technologies on next-generation\nPON. We also continue to be involved in driving optical networking, synchronization and SDN standardization and participate in\nindustry-wide interoperability, performance-testing and system-level projects related to those standards in e.g. BBF and ONF. We are\nalso members of MEF, TIA, CableLabs and TIP.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with our research and development activities, see “Risk Factors – We must continue to update and\nimprove our products and develop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology” and\n“Risk Factors – We engage in research and development activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application\nof developed technologies, and as a consequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially\ngreater research and development effort and which may focus on more leading edge development,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\n26 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nManufacturing and Operations\nThe principal steps in our manufacturing process include the purchase and management of materials, assembly, testing, final inspection,\npacking and shipping. We purchase parts and components for the assembly of some products from a large number of suppliers through\na worldwide sourcing program. Additionally, we manage a process that identifies the components that are best purchased directly by\ncontract manufacturers for use in the assembly of our products to achieve manufacturing efficiency, quality and cost objectives. Certain\nkey components used in our products are currently available from a single source, and other key components are available from only a\nlimited number of sources. In the past, we have experienced delays in the receipt of certain key components, which has resulted in delays\nin related product deliveries. We attempt to manage these risks through developing alternative sources, by staging inventories at strategic\nlocations, through engineering efforts designed to prevent the necessity of certain components and by maintaining close contact and\nbuilding long-term relationships with our suppliers. With the current global supply chain and transportation constraints, and limited\navailability of semiconductor chips and other components of our products, we have experienced and may continue to experience\nextended lead times, increased logistics intervals and costs, and lower volume of products deliveries, which have and may continue to\nhave a material adverse effect on our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on customer relations and our financial\ncondition. We believe these supply chain challenges and their adverse impact on our industry will continue to ease during 2023. See\nInventory included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information.\nWe rely on subcontractors for assembly and testing of certain printed circuit board assemblies, sub-assemblies, chassis, enclosures and\nequipment shelves, and to purchase some of the raw materials used in such assemblies. We typically manufacture our lower-volume,\nhigher-mix products and build and test product prototypes and many of our initial production units at our manufacturing site in\nHuntsville, Alabama. We later transfer the production of higher-volume, lower-mix assemblies to our subcontractors. Subcontract\nassembly operations can lengthen fulfillment cycle times, but we believe we can respond more rapidly to uncertainties in incoming order\nrates by selecting assembly subcontractors that have significant reserve capacity and flexibility. Our subcontractors have generally\nproven to be flexible and able to meet our quality requirements.\nWe ship the majority of products to our U.S. customers from our facilities in Huntsville, Alabama and Norcross, Georgia. The majority\nof international customers are being served from our logistics hubs in Meiningen, Germany and York, United Kingdom. We also ship\ndirectly from subcontractors to a number of customers in the U.S. and international locations. Most of our facilities are certified pursuant\nto the most current releases of ISO 9001, TL 9000, ISO 14001 and ISO 27001. Our Huntsville, Alabama facilities and many of our key\nsuppliers are C-TPAT certified. Our products are also certified to certain other customer, industry and privacy standards, including those\nrelating to emission of electromagnetic energy and safety specifications.\nOur dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products, combined with supply\nshortages, have prevented and may continue to prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which has had and may\ncontinue to have a material adverse effect on operating results and could have a material adverse effect on customer relations.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with manufacturing activities, see “Risk Factors – Our strategy of outsourcing a portion of our\nmanufacturing requirements to subcontractors located in various international regions may result in us not meeting our cost, quality or\nperformance standards” and “Risk Factors – Our dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key\ncomponents and ODM products, combined with supply shortages, have prevented and may continue to prevent us from delivering our\nproducts on a timely basis, which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on operating results and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on customer relations,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nCompetition\nWe compete in markets for networking and communications services and solutions for service providers, businesses, government\nagencies and other organizations worldwide. Our products and services provide solutions supporting voice, data and video\ncommunications across fiber-, copper-, coaxial- and wireless-based infrastructure, as well as across wide area networks, local area\nnetworks and the internet.\nWe compete with a number of companies in the markets we serve. In the Subscriber Solutions & Experience category, our primary\ncompetitors include Calix, Cisco, CommScope, Juniper Networks, Ribbon Communications. In our Access & Aggregation solutions\ncategory, key competitors include Calix, Casa Systems, Ciena, CommScope, DZS, Harmonic, Huawei, Nokia, Reliance/Radisys,\nVecima Networks and ZTE. Main competitors of our Optical Networking solutions portfolio are Ciena, Cisco, Ekinops, Huawei,\nInfinera, Nokia, Ribbon and ZTE.\nAcross our markets and segments, the principal competitive factors can include, among others:\n differentiated feature functionality of our products and solutions;\n price performance of our solutions and lowest total cost of ownership for customers;\n quality and reliability of our products;\n financial stability and health of our company;\n ability to manage supply chains and produce and deliver products in accordance with customer wish date;\nFinancial Information 27\n ability to innovate and provide customers with differentiated solutions, advantageous to their business model;\n compelling technology roadmap and R&D power;\n industry thought leadership and time to market with innovative solutions;\n country of origin for products and solutions and trusted supplier status;\n security of enterprise value chain, from design to product development, support processes, to products and solutions;\n energy consumption of our products and commitment to sustainability, supporting customers in achieving their climate\ngoals;\n customer relationship and incumbency;\n ability to deliver comprehensive solutions with a high degree of automation and ease-of-use, including hardware, software\nand services; and\n broad range of services and support capabilities.\nFor further discussion of risks associated with our competition, see “Risk Factors – We must continue to update and improve our\nproducts and develop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology” and “Risk Factors\n– We compete in markets that have become increasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and market\nshare,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nSeasonality\nWe experience quarterly fluctuations in our revenue that occur due to many factors, including the varying budget cycles and seasonal\nbuying patterns of our customers. More specifically, our customers tend to spend less in the first fiscal quarter as they are finalizing their\nannual capital spending budgets. These seasonal effects may continue to vary and do not always correlate to our operating results.\nAccordingly, they should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or operating results. Additionally, the effects of\nthe dynamic supply and demand environment we have experienced in recent periods may impact the traditional seasonality in our\nbusiness.\nForeign Currency\nTransactions with customers that are denominated in foreign currencies are recorded using the appropriate exchange rates from\nthroughout the year. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the balance sheet dates using the closing\nrates of exchange between those foreign currencies and the functional currency with any transaction gains or losses reported in other\nincome (expense). Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements are with the Euro and the British pound sterling.\nAdjustments resulting from translating financial statements of international subsidiaries are recorded as a component of accumulated\nother comprehensive (loss) income.\nInventory\nA substantial portion of our shipments in any fiscal period relates to orders received and shipped within that fiscal period for customers\nunder agreements containing non-binding purchase commitments. Further, a significant percentage of orders require delivery within a\nfew days. However, with the current global supply chain and transportation constraints, and limited availability of semiconductor chips\nand other components of our products, we have experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times, increased logistics\nintervals and costs, and lower volume of products deliveries, which have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our\noperating results and could have a material adverse effect on our customer relations and our financial condition.\nWe have seen increased demand for our products due to the Business Combination with ADVA, increased volume of sales activity to\nservice provider customers and as a result of customer strategies designed to mitigate supply constraints and assure access to needed\nproducts. To meet this demand, we have enhanced and implemented supply chain management systems and processes to manage the\nmaterials planning and production processes. We maintain substantial inventories of raw materials for long lead time components to\nsupport this demand and avoid expedite fees. In the current environment, our raw material inventory has grown due to increased\npurchases in preparation for strategic inventory buffer purchases as well as new product ramp ups to ensure supply continuity during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. We expect inventory levels to fluctuate as we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory in response to COVID-\n19 uncertainties related to supply chain and supply, seasonal cycles of our business and ensuring competitive lead times while managing\nthe risk of inventory. We also maintain substantial finished goods inventories. Our practice of maintaining sufficient inventory levels to\nassure prompt delivery of our products and services increases the amount of inventory that may be considered excess and/or obsolete.\nThis excess and obsolete inventory may require us to write down the value of the inventory, which may have an adverse effect on our\noperating results.\nFor further discussion of risks associated with managing our inventory, see “Risk Factors – Managing our inventory is complex and\nmay include write-downs of excess or obsolete inventory,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\n28 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nGovernment Regulation\nOur products must comply with various regulations and standards established by communications authorities in various countries, as\nwell as those of certain international bodies. Environmental legislation within the EU may increase our cost of doing business as we\namend our products to comply with these requirements. For example, the EU issued the RoHS directive, the WEEE directive and the\nREACH regulation. We continue to implement measures to comply with these and other similar directives and regulations from\nadditional countries.\nWe strive to deliver innovative network access solutions that lower the total cost and reduce the time of deploying services, increase the\nlevel of performance achievable with established infrastructures, reduce operating and capital expenses for our customers, increase\nnetwork bandwidth and functionality, and extend network reach. Our development process is conducted in accordance with ISO 9001,\nTL 9000, ISO 14001, and ISO 27001, all of which are international standards for quality and environmental management systems. We\nstrive to ensure that our corporate practices also conform to GDPR requirements, which protect digital data for all EU residents, and to\nother applicable data protection laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating\nto these laws, rules and regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive\nposition.\nFor further discussion of risks associated with government regulation, see “Risk Factors – We are subject to complex and evolving U.S.\nand foreign laws, regulations and standards governing the conduct of our business. Violations of these laws and regulations may harm\nour business, subject us to penalties and to other adverse consequences.”\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance\nWe believe that as we follow our corporate vision to enable a fully connected world, we must continue to be responsible corporate\ncitizens. As more people are connected, work and life can be accomplished using fewer resources. We have established ESG and\nSustainability programs and policies that encompass the elements of Environmental, Health & Safety, Ethics, Labor, and Management\nSystems in alignment with the ISO 26000 Guidelines. We are committed to operating in full compliance with the laws, rules and\nregulations of all the countries in which we operate. The major aims of our program are eliminating waste and emissions, maximizing\nenergy efficiency and productivity and minimizing practices that can adversely affect utilization of natural resources by coming\ngenerations. Our ESG programs are important to us. ESG is a dedicated focus throughout the company. We have Board oversight\nincluding an ESG Committee, strong management support and engagement from our employees.\nAreas of focus in our environmental sustainability program include:\n established an ESG Committee of the Board of Directors;\n maintained our mature environmental management system certified to ISO 14001 from 2006;\n advanced our Energy Management program where we have continually set targets for reduced energy and water\nconsumption since 2005;\n continued investment in Wind Renewable Energy Credits;\n purchased certified carbon offsets to achieve net zero for our Scope 1 emissions;\n continued to monitor and report our carbon emissions to CDP;\n adopted a platform to engage top suppliers to obtain an ESG assessment aligned with international standards, allowing us\nto monitor ESG risks in our supply chain;\n the Technology organization established Eco-Design guidelines;\n completed an initial Life Cycle Assessment pilot;\n initiated innovative packaging solutions to reduce materials and waste;\n committed to SBTi for Net Zero targets within the next two years;\n increased visibility of our program internally and externally through customer engagement, joining peer sustainability\ngroups, offering training to team members and web site enhancements;\n implemented GRI standards; and\n actively engaged our stakeholders with investor and supply chain assessments\nFor further discussion of risks associated with government regulation, see “Risk Factors – Expectations relating to environmental,\nsocial and governance considerations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse\neffects on the Company’s business.”\nFinancial Information 29\nESG Report\nDue to certain regulations, proceedings of the merger and the operations of ADTRAN and ADVA during 2022 there will be separate\nreports published for the two organizations. These ESG reports provide additional information regarding ADTRAN Holding’s ESG\nprogram. Within the report is information on our environmental programs, initiatives related to our people and our community. This\ninformation can be found on our website at: www.adtran.com/en/about-us/esg/environmental. No information contained on our website\nis intended to be included as part of, or incorporated by reference into, this report.\nHuman Capital\nWe believe that our most valuable asset is our people. To ensure we continue to succeed, our objective is to be able to recruit, hire and\nretain top talent. Our ability to attract and retain a high-quality workforce is dependent on our ability to maintain a diverse, equitable\nand inclusive workplace that provides opportunities for our employees to learn and grow in their careers. This is supported by\ncompetitive compensation and benefits, along with strong community service and other programs that enable employees to build\nconnections within the community.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 3,307 full-time employees, with 1,417 in the U.S. and 1,890 in our international subsidiaries located\nin North America, Latin America, EMEA and APAC regions. 1,948 of these full-time employees are employees of ADVA and its\nsubsidiaries. We also utilized 177 contractors and numerous temporary employees domestically and internationally in various\nmanufacturing, engineering, sales and general and administrative capacities. We believe that our relationship with our employees is\ngood. We have a diverse employee base located in 37 countries. We pride ourselves on a highly educated workforce, and the majority\nof our employees serve in engineering, information technology and technical roles within the organization.\nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately 170 employees (75%) of ADTRAN GmbH were subject to collective bargaining agreements\nof either the Association of Metal and Electrical Industry in Berlin and Brandenburg e.V. or NORDMETALL Association of Metal and\nElectrical Industry e.V. Although these collective bargaining agreements will expire on September 30, 2024, negotiations with the\nemployees of ADTRAN GmbH for a new collective bargaining agreement are ongoing and we have not experienced any work stoppage.\nAs of December 31, 2022, ADVA had 85 employees in Switzerland, France, Italy, Finland and Spain that were subject to collective\nbargaining agreements of different associations. None of our other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.\nAdditionally, we continually work to recruit technical talent in diverse communities through our cooperative education program. This\nprogram seeks to identify college students that major in relevant technological areas and expose them to our work environment on an\nalternating semester basis. Our goal is to retain as many of these students as possible for full-time employment after graduation building\nour organization's future.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe believe that maintaining a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to the success of our business. We encourage an environment\nwhere individuality is embraced regardless of age, gender, identity, race, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, ethnicity and\nperspective and where each employee is accepted and respected and can, therefore, bring their most authentic self to work.\nIn addition to diversity in our workforce, we seek to ensure diversity in our Board of Directors with respect to skills, experience, gender,\nrace and ethnicity. Our Board of Directors is comprised of nine members, three of which are females and three of which are ethnically\ndiverse. Additionally, the Board of Directors has a diversity of skills and experience with respect to accounting and finance, management\nand leadership, vision and strategy, business operations, business judgment, crisis management, risk assessment, industry knowledge,\ncorporate governance and global markets.\nHealth, Safety and Wellness\nThe well-being of our employees is paramount to the continued success of our business. To this end, we are committed to each of our\nemployees' health, safety and wellness. We provide our employees with access to various health and wellness benefits designed to enable\nthem and their family members to have affordable access to health, dental and vision insurance. Additionally, we offer access to many\nprograms that provide additional monetary support in the event of a qualifying incident, including accident insurance, life insurance and\nhospital indemnity insurance, among others. We understand that mental health is an essential aspect of our employees’ wellbeing. As a\nresult, we offer an employee assistance program at no charge to employees and their family members. This program provides access to\nqualified personnel to address various issues such as grief, financial stress, family and emotional issues.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that were determined to be in the best interest of our\nemployees and the communities in which we operate. We introduced enhanced health and safety standards that are in compliance with,\nor exceed, local, state and federal recommendations and regulations in the U.S. and at our international locations. This includes having\nour global employees work from home, hybrid or on-site. In areas where it is necessary to have critical, on-site personnel, such as at our\nmanufacturing facilities, additional health and safety measures have been implemented to provide the safest environment possible for\nthese workers.\n30 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe continually work to provide a competitive compensation and benefits program as this plays a key role in our ability to attract and\nretain a highly skilled workforce. In addition to salaries, these programs, which vary by country/region, include long-term equity\nincentive awards with certain vesting requirements, deferred compensation plans (which are offered to certain members of executive\nmanagement), a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, paid\nvolunteer time off, employee assistance program and tuition assistance. Additionally, at our global headquarters in Alabama, we offer\nour employees certain on-site services, including nurse practitioner care and a fitness center, among others.\nTalent Development\nWe invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain a market-leading global supplier of broadband infrastructure. We\noffer numerous training opportunities on both technical and professional development topics. We utilize tools and processes to provide\nperformance feedback which helps develop high potential employees into becoming our future leaders.\nOur Career Development Program provides an opportunity for employees to shape their career journey. The program provides\nopportunities for employees to develop competencies in areas including technology, business acumen, emotional intelligence, design\nand systems thinking. As employees increase their competencies in these areas and master skills within their individual roles, this\nprogram offers a variety of career advancement paths. Employees also have access to the ADTRAN Learning Network. This platform\nhouses all required training, as well as optional training in a variety of areas.\nIntellectual Property\nADTRAN develops and owns a significant amount of intellectual property. We hold over 1,000 patents worldwide related to our products\nand over 50 additional pending patent applications. Our patents expire at various dates between 2023 and 2041. We continue to seek\nadditional patents related to our research and development activities. We do not derive any material amount of revenue from the licensing\nof our patents.\nThe ADTRAN corporate logo is a registered trademark of ours, as is the name “ADTRAN”, “SmartRG” and a number of our product\nidentifiers and names. We also claim rights to a number of unregistered trademarks.\nWe protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights in accordance with good legal and business practices. We believe, however,\nthat our competitive success will not fully depend on the ownership of intellectual property, but instead will depend primarily on the\ninnovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our personnel.\nThe communications industry is characterized by the existence of an ever-increasing volume of patent litigation and licensing activities.\nWe have received, and may continue to receive, notices of claims alleging that we are infringing upon patents or other intellectual\nproperty. We cannot predict whether we will prevail in any claims or litigation over alleged infringements, or whether we will be able\nto license any valid and infringed patents, or other intellectual property, on commercially reasonable terms. It is possible that such\nlitigation may result in significant legal costs and judgments and that intellectual property infringement claims, or related litigation\nagainst or by us could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property and proprietary rights, see “Risk Factors – Our failure to maintain\nrights to intellectual property used in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality, and commercial value of our\nproducts” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nFinancial Information 31\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nSet forth below is certain information regarding our current executive officers.

RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves substantial risks. Any of the risk factors described below or elsewhere in this report could significantly and\nadversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The risks described below are not the only ones\nfacing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely\naffect us.\nRisks related to the Business Combination and DPLTA\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated strategic and financial benefits sought from the Business Combination.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination. The success of the Business Combination will depend\non, among other things, our ability to combine our business with ADVA’s business in a manner that facilitates growth as a provider of\nfiber networking solutions and realizes anticipated cost savings. We believe that the Business Combination provides an opportunity for\nrevenue growth in optical transport solutions, fiber access solutions and subscriber solutions.\nAdditionally, our ability to realize anticipated benefits of the Business Combination could be affected by a number of other factors,\nincluding: the need for greater than expected cash or other financial resources or management time in order to integrate ADVA; increases\nin other expenses related to the Business Combination, including restructuring and other exit costs; the timing and impact of purchase\naccounting adjustments; accounting for IFRS to U.S. GAAP adjustments; difficulties in employee or management integration; the impact\nof appraisal proceedings in connection with the DPLTA; and unanticipated liabilities associated with the Business Combination. Any\npotential cost-saving opportunities may take several years following the Business Combination to implement, and any results of these\nactions may not be realized for several years thereafter, if at all.\nHowever, we must successfully combine the business in a manner that permits these anticipated benefits to be realized. In addition, we\nmust achieve the anticipated growth and cost savings without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth.\nFurther, providing integrated fiber networking solutions can be highly complex and can involve the design, development,\nimplementation and operation of new solutions and the transitioning of clients from traditional platforms to new platforms. If we are not\nable to effectively provide different solutions and successfully achieve the growth and cost savings objectives, the anticipated benefits\nof the Business Combination may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nWe have experienced operational challenges and may also experience negative synergies and loss of customers.\nIntegrating the operations and personnel of the ADTRAN and ADVA businesses involves complex operational, technological and\npersonnel-related challenges. This process has been and will continue to be time-consuming and expensive, and it has and may continue\nto disrupt our business. Difficulties in the integration of the business, which may result in significant costs and delays, include:\n managing a significantly larger company;\n integrating and unifying the offerings and services available to customers and coordinating distribution and marketing\nefforts;\n coordinating corporate and administrative infrastructures and harmonizing insurance coverage;\n unanticipated issues in coordinating accounting, information technology, communications, administration and other\nsystems;\n difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n challenges associated with converting ADVA's financial reporting from international financial reporting standards (IFRS)\nto accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S GAAP) and compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002, as amended, and the rules promulgated thereunder by the SEC;\n legal and regulatory compliance;\n dual market filing and publications obligations;\n creating and implementing uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n litigation relating to the transactions contemplated by a reorganization, including shareholder litigation;\n diversion of management’s attention from other operations;\n maintaining existing agreements and relationships with customers, distributors, providers and vendors and avoiding delays\nin entering into new agreements with prospective customers, distributors, providers and vendors;\n realizing the benefits from our restructuring programs;\n unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the Business Combination, including the risk that certain executive\nofficers may be subject to additional fiduciary duties and liability;\nFinancial Information 33\n identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming functions and assets;\n effecting actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals; and\n a deterioration of credit ratings.\nWe have and may continue to lose customers or our share of customers’ business as entities that were customers of both ADTRAN\nand AVDA seek to diversify their suppliers of services and products.\n34 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nThe terms of the DPLTA may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition.\nOn January 16, 2023, the DPLTA with ADVA became effective. The DPLTA allows us to issue binding instructions to the management\nboard of ADVA, which could be disadvantageous to ADVA and result in a decline in the business and earnings power of ADVA. This\ncould have a material adverse effect on the assets, financial position and income of ADVA, which in turn could have a material adverse\neffect on our financial condition.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the terms of the DPLTA, each ADVA shareholder (other than the Company) has received an offer to elect\neither (1) to remain an ADVA shareholder and receive from us an Annual Recurring Compensation payment, or (2) to receive Exit\nCompensation. Assuming all of the minority holders of currently outstanding ADVA shares were to elect the second option, we would\nbe obligated to make aggregate Exit Compensation payments of approximately EUR 310.6 million or approximately $333.2 million.\nbased on an exchange rate as of December 31, 2022. Shareholders electing the first option of Annual Recurring Compensation may later\nelect the second option. The opportunity for outside ADVA shareholders to tender ADVA shares in exchange for Exit Compensation\nexpires on March 16, 2023 (subject to appraisal proceedings). Our obligation to pay Annual Recurring Compensation under the DPLTA\nwould lead to a continuing payment obligation, which would amount to approximately EUR $10.6 million, or $11.4 million based on\nthe current exchange rate, per year assuming none of the minority ADVA shareholders were to elect Exit Compensation. The foregoing\namounts do not reflect any potential increase in payment obligations that we may have depending on the outcome of ongoing appraisal\nproceedings in Germany.\nThe amount of this Annual Recurring Compensation payment obligation pursuant to the DPLTA could exceed the amount of dividends\nthat otherwise might be distributed by ADVA to minority shareholders and would even have to be paid if ADVA incurs losses, which\ncould have a material adverse impact on our financial results and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to additional litigation risk and uncertainty with respect to the remaining minority shareholders of ADVA, which\nlitigation may require us to pay a higher purchase price for additional ADVA shares than the amount provided for under the DPLTA.\nAs a result of the Business Combination, we continue to be exposed to litigation risk and uncertainty associated with the remaining\nminority shareholders of ADVA. The terms of the DPLTA, including the adequacy of compensation payments to minority ADVA\nshareholders under the terms of the DPLTA, have been challenged by minority shareholders of ADVA by initiating court-led appraisal\nproceedings under German law. We cannot rule out that the competent court in these appraisal proceedings may adjudicate higher Exit\nCompensation or Annual Recurring Compensation payment obligations (in each case, including interest thereon) than agreed upon in\nthe DPLTA, the financial impact and timing of which is uncertain.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant transaction fees and costs in connection with the Business Combination\nand post-closing integration efforts.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur a number of significant non-recurring implementation and restructuring costs\nassociated with combining the operations of ADTRAN and ADVA. In addition, we have incurred significant banking, legal, accounting\nand other transaction fees and costs related to the Business Combination. As of December 31, 2022, we have incurred $26.1 million of\ntransaction costs related to the Business Combination.\nWe expect to incur additional integration costs, as well costs associated with the implementation of the DPLTA and such costs are\nexpected to be material.\nAny cost savings or other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses that could offset these transaction- and combination-\nrelated costs over time may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. In addition, the timeline in which cost savings are expected to be\nrealized is lengthy and may not be achieved. Failure to realize these synergies and cost reductions and other efficiencies in a timely\nmanner or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business and cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness in connection with the Business Combination and the DPLTA. Our failure to\nmeet our debt service obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSubsequent to the closing of the Business Combination, we entered into a new credit facility providing for borrowings of up to $400\nmillion and under which we have incurred $60.0 million of indebtedness as of December 31, 2022. Subsequent to the closing of the\nBusiness Combination, ADVA entered into a new revolving line of credit with Norddeutsche Landesbank - Girozentrale which it\nsubsequently repaid and terminated, and a revolving line of credit with DZ Bank. As of December 31, 2022, ADVA had borrowings of\n$16.1 million and $9.1 million of borrowings under the two revolving lines of credit, respectively. Additionally, subsequent to December\n31, 2022, the Company borrowed an additional $127.5 million under the new credit facility, a portion of which was used to pay down\nand retire ADVA's notes payable and credit facility agreements except for ADVA's new revolving line of credit with DZ Bank, which\nremains outstanding. See “Cash Requirements” in Part I, Item 7 of this report for additional information.\nOur increased indebtedness could adversely affect our operations and liquidity. Our level of indebtedness could, among other things:\n make it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry\nconditions because we may not have sufficient cash flows to make its scheduled debt payments;\nFinancial Information 35\n cause us to use a larger portion of our cash flow to fund interest and principal payments, reducing the availability of cash to\nfund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development and other business activities;\n make it more difficult for us to continue to pay the current dividend or cause us to reduce the dividend paid to the Company's\nstockholders;\n limit our ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to\nchanges in market or industry conditions;\n cause us to be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n cause us to be disadvantaged compared to competitors with less leverage; and\n limit our ability to borrow additional money in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and\ndevelopment and other general corporate purposes.\nOur ability to satisfy our debt obligations and renew the credit facility is dependent upon our future performance and other risk factors\ndiscussed in this section. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. In addition,\nthe credit agreement governing our indebtedness contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be\nin our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived,\ncould result in the acceleration of all its debt.\nWe may also incur additional long-term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would increase\nour total indebtedness. Although the terms of its existing and future credit agreements and of the indentures governing its debt contain\nrestrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, including secured debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions\nand debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If we or our restricted subsidiaries incur significant\nadditional debt, the related risks that we face could intensify.\nWe may be unable to successfully retain and motivate our personnel, including personnel at ADVA.\nThe success of the Business Combination and our post-closing integration efforts depends, in part, on our ability to retain the talents and\ndedication of key employees, including key decision-makers, currently employed by ADTRAN, Inc. and ADVA. Some of our employees\nhave decided and others may decide not to remain with us as a result of the Business Combination. If key employees terminate their\nemployment, or if an insufficient number of employees are retained to maintain effective operations, our business activities may be\nadversely affected and management’s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating ADTRAN and ADVA to hiring suitable\nreplacements, all of which may cause our business to deteriorate. We may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key\nemployees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms. In addition, we may not be able to motivate\ncertain key employees due to organizational changes, reassignments of responsibilities, the perceived lack of appropriate opportunities\nfor advancement or other reasons. If we fail to successfully retain and motivate our employees, relevant capabilities and expertise may\nbe lost which may have an adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and the business operations in\ngeneral.\nThe terms of our and ADVA's credit agreements restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to\nchanges or to take certain actions.\nOur Credit Agreement and ADVA's revolving line of credit with DZ Bank contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose\nsignificant operating and financial restrictions on us and/or our subsidiaries and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in\nour long-term best interest, including restrictions on our and/or our subsidiaries' ability to:\n incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;\n make loans and investments;\n sell assets;\n incur liens;\n enter into transactions with affiliates;\n alter the businesses we conduct; and\n consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\n36 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in such credit facilities require us and/or our subsidiaries to maintain specified financial ratios and\nsatisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control,\nand we may be unable to meet them.\nA breach of the covenants or restrictions under such credit facilities could result in an event of default. Such a default may allow the\ncreditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default\nprovision applies. In addition, an event of default under such credit facilities would permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to\nextend further credit under the applicable facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under such\ncredit facilities, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders or\nnoteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that\nindebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n limited in how we conduct our business;\n unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; and\n unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nFinancial Information 37\nThese restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy. In addition, our financial results, our substantial\nindebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing.\nWe could be required to recognize impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets.\nThe Business Combination added a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets to our consolidated balance sheets. In\naccordance with U.S. GAAP, management periodically assesses these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative\nindustry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, the inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, the underperformance\nof our business as compared to management’s initial expectations, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the\nassets, divestitures, and market capitalization declines may impair goodwill and other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such\nimpairments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the periods recognized.\nNegative publicity related to integration measures may adversely affect us.\nPolitical and public sentiment in connection with post-closing integration measures following the Business Combination may result in\na significant amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements. Adverse press coverage and public statements,\nwhether or not driven by political or popular sentiment, may also result in legal claims or in investigations by regulators, legislators and\nlaw enforcement officials. Responding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceedings, can\ndivert the time and effort of senior management from operating the business. Addressing any adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny\nor enforcement or other legal proceedings could be time-consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions\nbeing made, could have a negative impact on our reputation, on the morale and performance of our employees and on our relationships\nwith regulators, suppliers and customers. It may also have a negative impact on our ability to take timely advantage of various business\nand market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to our financial results and Company success\nOur revenue for a particular period can be difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.\nAs a result of the many factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict and will fluctuate from\nquarter to quarter. Typically, our customers request product delivery within a short period following our receipt of an order.\nConsequently, we do not typically carry a significant order backlog and are dependent upon obtaining orders and completing delivery\nin accordance with shipping terms that are predominantly within each quarter to achieve our targeted revenue. Supply of semiconductor\nchips and other components of our products has become constrained resulting in extended lead times and increased costs. Transportation\nconstraints, including shortages for both air and surface freight, as well as labor shortages in the transportation industry, have also\naffected the timing and the cost of obtaining raw materials and production supplies. As a result, our gross margin percentage declined\nin the second half of 2021 and throughout 2022. If supply chain constraints and transportation constraints continue, it could cause our\nnet revenue and gross profit to decline or to grow at a slower rate than in previous quarters. Our deployment/installation cycle can also\nvary depending on the customer’s schedule, site readiness, network size and complexity and other factors, which can cause our revenue\nto fluctuate from period to period. Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be affected if the variable revenue patterns seen\nin prior quarters recur in future quarters. We have experienced periods of time during which manufacturing issues have delayed\nshipments, leading to variable shipping patterns. In addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages\ncontinue to result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in quarters in which we and our subcontractors are operating at\nhigher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected, and we may not be able to remediate the\nconditions within the same quarter. Currently, our revenue growth and profitability in the near-term are being impacted by supply chain\nconstraint issues. While we are working closely with our suppliers and customers to address the near-term supply chain challenges\nfacing the industry and believe these challenges will continue to lessen and will begin to normalize during 2023, there can be no\nassurance this will be the case.\nIn the past, under certain market conditions, long manufacturing lead times have caused our customers to place the same order multiple\ntimes. When multiple ordering occurs, along with other factors, it may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and, as a result, could\nimpair our ability to manage inventory effectively.\nWe plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term\ncommitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations\nbecause we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes.\nThe lengthy sales and approval process required by service providers for new products could result in fluctuations in our revenue.\nIn the industry in which we compete, sales and approval cycles are often lengthy. Selling efforts often involve a significant commitment\nof time and resources by us and our customers that may include extensive product testing, laboratory or network certification, or region-\nspecific product certification and homologation requirements for deployment in networks. Additionally, a supplier must first obtain\nproduct approval from a major or other service provider to sell its products to these service providers. This process can last from six to\neighteen months, or longer, depending on the technology, the service provider and the demand for the product from the service provider’s\nsubscribers. Consequently, we are involved in a constant process of submitting for approval succeeding generations of products, as well\nas products that deploy new technology or respond to new technology demands from a major or other service provider. We have been\n38 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nsuccessful in the past in obtaining these approvals; however, we cannot be certain that we will obtain these approvals in the future or\nthat sales of these products will continue to occur. Any attempt by a major or other service provider to seek out additional or alternative\nsuppliers, or to undertake, as permitted under applicable regulations, the production of these products internally, could have a material\nadverse effect on our operating results. Furthermore, the delay in sales until the completion of the approval process, the length of which\nis difficult to predict, could result in fluctuations of revenue and uneven operating results from quarter to quarter or year to year. Further,\nonce customer approval or certifications are met, our supply chain customers typically do not guarantee us a minimum, or any, volume\nof sales. We are dependent on individual purchase orders as discussed elsewhere in this report.\nWe depend heavily on sales to certain customers; the loss of any of these customers or a significant project would significantly reduce\nour revenue and net income.\nHistorically, a large percentage of our revenue has been made to major service providers and larger independent communications\ncompanies. As long as the major and larger independent communications companies represent such a substantial percentage of our total\nrevenue, our future success will significantly depend upon certain factors which are not within our control, including:\n the timing and size of future purchase orders, if any, from these customers;\n changes in strategic plans and capital budgets of these customers;\n the product requirements of these customers;\n the subscriber take rate, including subscriber loss or churn, of our customers;\n the financial and operational success of these customers;\n the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on these customers;\n consolidation, acquisition of, or corporate reorganization among these customers;\n the success of these customers' services deployed using our products; and\n the impact of work stoppages at these customers.\nIn the past, revenue to our large customers have fluctuated, and may fluctuate in the future, significantly from quarter to quarter and\nyear to year. The loss of, or a significant reduction or delay in, revenue to any such customer or the occurrence of revenue fluctuations\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, any attempt by a major or other service provider\nto seek out additional or alternative suppliers or to undertake, as permitted under applicable regulations, the production of these products\ninternally, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies\nattempt to strengthen or hold their market positions or are unable to continue operations. This could lead to variability in our operating\nresults and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flow. In addition,\nparticularly in the service provider market, rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers, with the effect that a loss of a major\ncustomer could have a material impact on our results that we would not have anticipated in a marketplace composed of more numerous\nparticipants.\nOur exposure to the credit risks of our customers and distributors may make it difficult to collect accounts receivable and could\nadversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nMost of our revenue is made on an open credit basis, generally with payment terms of 30 to 45 days in the U.S. and typically 45 to 60\ndays in many geographic markets outside the U.S. As our international revenue grows, our total accounts receivable balance has\nincreased and will likely continue to increase. Our DSO could also increase as a result of a greater mix of international revenue.\nAdditionally, international laws may not provide the same degree of protection against defaults on accounts receivable as provided under\nU.S. laws governing domestic transactions; therefore, as our international business grows, we may be subject to higher bad debt expense\ncompared to historical trends. Overall, we monitor individual customer and distributor payment capability in granting such open credit\narrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts that we believe customers and distributors can pay and maintain reserves we\nbelieve are adequate to cover exposure for credit losses and other macroeconomic indicators. In the course of our sales to customers and\ndistributors, we may encounter difficulty collecting accounts receivable and could be exposed to risks associated with uncollectible\naccounts receivable due to various reasons, including potential declining operating cash flows or bankruptcy filings. While we attempt\nto monitor these situations carefully and attempt to take appropriate measures to collect accounts receivable balances, there are no\nassurances we can avoid write-downs and/or write-offs of accounts receivable as a result of declining financial conditions for our\ncustomers, including bankruptcy. Such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results for the period in which\nthey occur and could potentially have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFinancial Information 39\nWe expect gross margins to continue to vary over time, and our levels of product and services gross margins may not be sustainable.\nOur level of gross margins may not be sustainable and has been and may continue to be adversely affected by numerous factors,\nincluding:\n changes in customer, geographic or product or services mix, including software and the mix of configurations and\nprofessional services revenue within each product segment;\n mix of domestic versus international revenue;\n introduction of new products by competitors, including products with price-performance advantages;\n our ability to reduce product cost;\n increases in labor or material cost, including increases in material costs resulting from inflation or tariffs;\n foreign currency exchange rate movements;\n expediting costs incurred to meet customer delivery requirements;\n excess inventory and inventory holding charges;\n excess and obsolescence charges;\n changes in shipment volume;\n our ability to absorb fixed manufacturing costs during short-term fluctuations in customer demand;\n loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts\nordering does not correctly anticipate product demand;\n lower than expected benefits from value engineering;\n increased price competition, including competitors from Asia, specifically China;\n changes in distribution channels;\n increased warranty cost or quality issues;\n liquidated damages costs relating to customer contractual terms;\n our ability to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations relating to our revenue or cost of revenue;\n slowdowns, recessions, economic instability, political unrest, armed conflicts (such as the ongoing military conflict in\nUkraine), or outbreaks of disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, around the world; and\n Business Combination purchase price allocations.\nFor example, since the third quarter of 2021 and continuing throughout 2022, we have incurred and may continue to incur supply chain\nconstraint expenses, including price inflation for certain electronic components, semiconductor chips and transportation related costs,\nwhich have lowered our gross margins and decreased our profitability.\nOur dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products, combined with\nsupply shortages, have prevented and may continue to prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which has had and\nmay continue to have a material adverse effect on operating results and could have a material adverse effect on customer relations.\nThe fact that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business\nand operating results. The financial problems of our suppliers and industry consolidation occurring within one or more component\nsupplier markets, such as the semiconductor market, in each case, could either limit supply or increase costs.\nA reduction or interruption in supply, including disruptions on our global supply chain, caused in part by public health emergencies\n(including the COVID-19 pandemic), geopolitical tensions (including as a result of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and China-Taiwan\nrelations) or a significant natural disaster (including as a result of climate change); a significant increase in the price of one or more\ncomponents (including as a result of inflation); a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers;\na failure to appropriately cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs; or a decrease in demand for our\nproducts could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer\nrelationships. Furthermore, as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase raw\nmaterials or components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market. In the event that we become committed to\npurchasing raw materials or components at prices in excess of the current market price when the raw materials or components are\nactually used, our gross margins could decrease.\n40 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nIn addition, certain raw materials and key components used in our products are currently available from only one source, and others are\navailable from only a limited number of sources. The availability of these raw materials and supplies may be subject to market forces\nbeyond our control, such as inflation, merger and acquisition activity of our suppliers and consolidation in some segments of our supplier\nbase. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased inflationary pressures on input costs, such as, raw materials,\nsupplies, labor and distribution costs to increase. Our attempts to offset these cost pressures, through increases in the selling prices of\nsome of our products, may not be successful and could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, from time to time, there may\nnot be sufficient quantities of raw materials and supplies in the marketplace to meet customer demand. For example, wafer foundries\nthat support chipmakers have not invested enough in recent years to increase capacities to the levels need to support demand from all of\ntheir customers and wafers have a long lead time for production, in some cases in excess of 30 weeks, which has led to a recent shortage\nin chip supplies. Many companies utilize the same raw materials and supplies that we do in the production of their products. Suppliers\nmay be under pressure to allocate product to certain customers for business, regulatory or political reasons, and/or demand changes in\nagreed pricing as a condition of supply. As a result, companies with more resources than our own may have a competitive advantage in\nobtaining raw materials and supplies. These factors have resulted in reduced supply, higher prices of raw materials and delays in the\nreceipt of certain of our key components, which in turn has generated increased costs, lower margins and delays in product delivery,\nwith a corresponding adverse effect on revenue. Delays in product deliveries and corresponding product price increases may likewise\nhave an adverse effect on customer relationships. We attempt to manage these risks through developing alternative sources, by staging\ninventories at strategic locations, through engineering efforts designed to obviate the necessity of certain components and by building\nlong-term relationships and close contact with each of our key suppliers; however, we cannot assure that delays in or failures of deliveries\nof key components, either to us or to our contract manufacturers, and consequent delays in product deliveries, will not continue to occur\nin the future. In addition, our supply chain challenges are forcing us to devote a substantial portion of our research and development\nexpenses to redesign existing products, reducing our capacity to develop new products. For a discussion of the impact of the COVID-\n19 pandemic on our supply chain, see “- The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition, particularly our supply chain and workforce.”\nWe believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future: new markets in which we participate may grow quickly,\nwhich may make it difficult to quickly obtain significant raw materials and/or components; as we acquire companies and new\ntechnologies, we may be dependent on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners; and we face competition for certain\nraw materials or components that are supply-constrained from existing competitors and companies in other markets.\nWe compete in markets that have become increasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and market\nshare.\nThe markets for our products are intensely competitive. New manufacturers have entered the markets in recent years to offer products\nin competition with us. Additionally, certain companies have, in recent years, developed the ability to deliver competing products using\ncoaxial cable and cellular transmission, especially in high-density metropolitan areas. Competition will further increase if new\ncompanies enter the market or existing competitors expand their product lines. Some of these potential competitors may have greater\nfinancial, technological, manufacturing, sales and marketing, and personnel resources. As a result, these competitors may be able to\nrespond more rapidly or effectively to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, withstand significant price\ndecreases, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products.\nIn addition, our present and future competitors may be able to enter our existing or future markets with products or technologies\ncomparable or superior to those that we offer. An increase in competition could cause us to reduce prices, decrease our market share,\nrequire increased spending by us on product development and sales and marketing, or cause delays or cancellations in customer orders,\nany one of which could reduce our gross profit margins and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFinancial Information 41\nOur estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, installation and shipment volumes,\nfield service repair obligations and other rework costs incurred in correcting product failures. If our estimates change, our liability\nfor warranty obligations may increase or decrease, impacting future cost of revenue.\nOur products are highly complex, and we cannot ensure that our extensive product development, manufacturing and integration testing\nwill be adequate to detect all defects, errors, failures and quality issues. Quality or performance problems for products covered under\nwarranty could adversely impact our reputation and negatively affect our operating results, financial position and cash flows. The\ndevelopment and production of new products with high complexity often involves problems with software, components and\nmanufacturing methods. If significant warranty obligations arise due to reliability or quality issues arising from defects in software,\nfaulty components or manufacturing methods, our operating results, financial position and cash flows could be negatively impacted by:\n costs associated with fixing software or hardware defects;\n costs associated with internal or third-party installation errors;\n high service and warranty expenses;\n costs associated with recalling and replacing products with software or hardware defects, including costs from writing-off\ndefective products recalled;\n high inventory obsolescence expense;\n delays in collecting accounts receivable;\n payment of liquidated damages for performance failures;\n extended performance bond expenses; and\n a decline in revenue to existing customers.\nManaging our inventory is complex and may include write-downs of excess or obsolete inventory.\nManaging our inventory of components and finished products is complicated by a number of factors, including the need to maintain a\nsignificant inventory of certain components that are in short supply, that have been discontinued by the component manufacturer, that\nmust be purchased in bulk to obtain favorable pricing or that require long lead times. These issues may result in our purchasing and\nmaintaining significant amounts of inventory, which if not used or expected to be used based on anticipated production requirements,\nmay become excess or obsolete. Any excess or obsolete inventory could also result in sales price reductions and/or inventory write-\ndowns, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe continuing growth of our international operations could expose us to additional risks, increase our costs and adversely affect\nour operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are expanding our presence in international markets, which represented 49.5%, 33.5% and 30.5% of our net revenue for the years\nended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and as a result, we anticipate increased revenue and operating costs in these\nmarkets. This international expansion has increased and may continue to increase our operational risks and impact our results of\noperations, including:\n exposure to unfavorable commercial terms in certain countries;\n the time and cost to staff and manage foreign operations, including the time and cost to maintain good relationships with\nemployee associations and work councils;\n the time and cost to ensure adequate business interruption controls, processes and facilities;\n the time and cost to manage and evolve financial reporting systems, maintain effective financial disclosure controls and\nprocedures, and comply with corporate governance requirements in multiple jurisdictions;\n the cost to collect accounts receivable and extension of collection periods;\n the cost and potential disruption of facilities transitions required in some business acquisitions;\n risks as a result of less regulation of patents or other safeguards of intellectual property in certain countries;\n the potential impact of adverse tax, customs regulations and transfer-pricing issues;\n exposure to increased price competition from additional competitors in some countries;\n exposure to global social, political and economic instability, changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange\nrate movements;\n42 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\n potential exposure to liability or damage of reputation resulting from a higher incidence of corruption or unethical business\npractices in some countries;\n potential regulations on data protection, regarding the collection, use, disclosure and security of data;\n potential trade protection measures, export compliance issues, domestic preference procurement requirements, qualification\nto transact business and additional regulatory requirements;\n potential exposure to natural disasters, epidemics and pandemics (and government regulations in response thereto) and acts\nof war or terrorism; and\n potential exposure to ongoing military conflict in Ukraine. The U.S. and certain other countries imposed sanctions on Russia\nand could impose further sanctions against it, which could damage or disrupt international commerce and the global\neconomy. Other potential consequences include, but are not limited to, a heightened risk of cyber-warfare, biological warfare\nor nuclear warfare, growth in the number of popular uprisings in the region, increased political discontent, especially in the\nregions most affected by the conflict or economic sanctions, continued displacement of persons to regions close to the areas\nof conflict and an increase in the number of refugees, among other unforeseen social and humanitarian effects which could\nimpact our business, customers, and suppliers.\nIn February 2022, armed conflict escalated between Russia and Ukraine. The U.S. and certain other countries have imposed sanctions\non Russia and could impose further sanctions, which could damage or disrupt international commerce and the global economy. We are\ncomplying with a broad range of U.S. and international sanctions and export control requirements imposed on Russia.\nIf we are unable to successfully address the potential risks associated with our overall international expansion, our operating results,\nfinancial condition and cash flows may be negatively impacted.\nFinancial Information 43\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining key personnel.\nOur business has grown significantly since its inception. Our success is dependent in large part on the continued employment of our\nexecutive officers, including Thomas R. Stanton, our Chief Executive Officer, and other key management personnel. The unplanned\ndeparture of one or more of these individuals could adversely affect our business. In addition, for ADTRAN to continue as a successful\nentity we must also be able to attract and retain key engineers and software developers and architects whose expertise helps us maintain\ncompetitive advantages. We believe that our future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to continue to attract, retain, train\nand motivate highly-skilled employees who are in great demand. Stock awards are designed to reward employees for their long-term\ncontributions and to provide incentives for them to remain with us. Changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock\nincentive program, may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees. Properly managing our continued growth, avoiding the\nproblems often resulting from such growth and expansion and continuing to operate in the manner which has proven successful to us to\ndate will be critical to the future success of our business.\nIf we fail to manage our exposure to worldwide financial and securities markets successfully, our operating results and financial\nstatements could be materially impacted.\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and prices of marketable equity and fixed-income securities.\nThe global macroeconomic environment has been challenging and inconsistent due to uncertainty in the global central bank monetary\npolicy and uncertainty in global credit markets and the geopolitical environment in many areas of the world. The primary objective of\nthe majority of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time achieving appropriate yields without significantly\nincreasing risk. To achieve this objective, a majority of our marketable securities are investment grade corporate and municipal fixed-\nrate bonds, U.S. government bonds and municipal money market instruments denominated in U.S. dollars. While we do invest a portion\nof our investment portfolio in equities, which are subject to market risks, including the loss of principal, our equity investments are\ngenerally invested in professionally-managed portfolios with the objective of exceeding the performance of their underlying\nbenchmarks.\nWe have significant investments in corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds,\nU.S. government bonds and foreign government bonds. Through December 31, 2022, we have not been required to impair any of these\ninvestments; however, we have and may continue to experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity in these investments, which may\nhave an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Fixed-rate interest securities may have their fair\nvalue adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while variable-rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest\nrates fall. Our investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may increase because of conditions\nin the financial markets and related credit liquidity issues. Consequently, our future investment income may fall short of expectations\ndue to changes in interest rates, or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in fair value due to\nchanges in interest rates.\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” in\nPart II, Item 7 of this report, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of this report and Note\n6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for more information about our investments.\nWe are exposed to adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations in jurisdictions where we transact in local currency, which could\nharm our financial results and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-\nexchanges rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial\nreporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period’s\ncurrency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements\nare the Euro and the British pound sterling. As a result of our global operations, our revenue, gross margins, operating expense and\noperating income in some international markets have been and may continue to be affected by foreign currency fluctuations.\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness, our potential payment obligations to ADVA shareholders\nunder the DPLTA, and other obligations.\nOur ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to service our outstanding indebtedness could\nharm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we have entered into a DPLTA with ADVA. Additionally,\npursuant to the terms of the DPLTA, each ADVA shareholder (other than the Company) has received an offer to elect either (1) to\nremain an ADVA shareholder and receive from us an Annual Recurring Compensation payment, or (2) to receive Exit Compensation.\nAny failure to satisfy our payment obligations under the DPLTA could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSee “Risk Factors - The terms of the DPLTA may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition\" in Part I, Item\n1A of this report for additional information.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, to cover our payment obligations under the DPLTA, and to fund\nworking capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent,\nis subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If\nour business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient\nto enable us and our subsidiaries to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion\n44 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nof our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital,\nany of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition, we may not be able to effect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to\nrestructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time.\nAny refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could\nfurther restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments or preferred stock may limit or prevent us from\ntaking any of these actions. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness\nor dividend payments on our outstanding shares of preferred stock would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could\nharm our ability to incur additional indebtedness or otherwise raise capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to\ngenerate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service, payment obligations to ADVA shareholders under the DPLTA, and other\nobligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have an adverse effect,\nwhich could be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or securities convertible into equity, or undertake certain\ntransactions intended to address our existing indebtedness, our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage ownership\nof the Company, or our leverage and outstanding indebtedness could increase. Current capital market conditions, including the impact\nof inflation, have increased borrowing rates and can be expected to significantly increase our cost of capital as compared to prior periods\nshould we seek additional funding.\nWe may be unable to successfully and effectively manage and integrate acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions,\nwhich could harm our operating results, business and prospects.\nAs part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions,\nstrategic alliances, joint ventures, divestitures and outsourcing arrangements, and we enter into agreements relating to such transactions\nin order to further our business objectives. In order to pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify suitable candidates, successfully\ncomplete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired\ncompanies or employees and the divestiture of combined businesses, operations and employees. Integration, divestiture and other risks\nof these transactions can be more pronounced in larger and more complicated transactions, or if multiple transactions are pursued\nsimultaneously. If we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to\nexpend resources to develop products and technology internally. This may put us at a competitive disadvantage and we may be adversely\naffected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our revenue, gross margin and profitability.\nIntegration and divestiture issues are complex, time-consuming and expensive and, without proper planning and implementation, could\nsignificantly disrupt our business. The challenges involved in integrating and divesting include:\n combining service and product offerings and entering into new markets in which we are not experienced;\n convincing customers and distributors that any such transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus,\npreventing customers and distributors from deferring purchasing decisions or switching to other suppliers or service\nproviders (which could result in additional obligations to address customer uncertainty), and coordinating service, sales,\nmarketing and distribution efforts;\n consolidating and rationalizing corporate information technology infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems\nfrom various acquisitions and integrating software code;\n minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns;\n persuading employees that business cultures are compatible, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees,\nintegrating employees into our company, correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring\nprograms;\n coordinating and combining administrative, service, manufacturing, research and development and other operations,\nsubsidiaries, facilities and relationships with third parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while\nmaintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures;\n our responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire, some of which we may not anticipate, including costs of\nthird-party advisors to resolve disputes;\n achieving savings from supply chain and administration integration; and\n efficiently divesting combined business operations which may cause increased costs as divested businesses are de-integrated\nfrom embedded systems and operations.\nFinancial Information 45\nWe evaluate and enter into these types of transactions on an ongoing basis. We may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of\nany transaction and the time frame for achieving benefits of a transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees, suppliers\nor other third parties. In addition, the pricing and other terms of our contracts for these transactions require us to make estimates and\nassumptions at the time we enter into these contracts, and, during the course of our due diligence, we may not identify all of the factors\nnecessary to estimate costs accurately. Any increased or unexpected costs, unanticipated delays or failure to achieve contractual\nobligations could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable.\nManaging these types of transactions requires varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other\nbusiness operations. These transactions could result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings, including those related to\nseverance pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, asset impairment charges, charges from the elimination of duplicative\nfacilities and contracts, in-process research and development charges, inventory adjustments, assumed litigation, regulatory compliance\nand other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under\nretention plans. Moreover, we could incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets\nacquired in connection with these transactions, and, to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives\nacquired in connection with a transaction becomes impaired, we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the\nimpairment of those assets. In order to complete an acquisition, we may issue common shares, potentially creating dilution for existing\nshareholders, or borrow funds, which could affect our financial condition, results of operations and potentially our credit ratings. Any\nprior or future downgrades in our credit rating associated with a transaction could adversely affect our ability to borrow and our\nborrowing cost, and result in more restrictive borrowing terms. In addition, our effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain, and\nsuch transactions could impact our effective tax rate. We also may experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a\ntransaction and the risk that an announced transaction may not close. As a result, any completed, pending or future transactions may\ncontribute to financial results that differ materially from the investment community’s expectations.\nRisks related to COVID-19\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition, particularly our supply chain.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. Due to the pandemic and a global\nsemiconductor chip shortage, we experienced disruption and delays in our supply chain and significant price increases with certain of\nour manufacturing partners, and those disruptions, delays and price increases may continue. For example, in the second half of 2021\nand throughout 2022, our results of operations were negatively impacted by increased expenses resulting from supply chain disruptions.\nCurrent global supply chain and transportation constraints, including delays in supply chain deliveries and the related global semi-\nconductor chip shortage, may continue to have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could have a material adverse effect\non customer relations and our financial condition. We believe these supply chain challenges and their adverse impact on our industry\nwill continue to ease during 2023. However, there can be no assurance that the ongoing disruptions due to COVID-19, the related global\nsemiconductor chip shortage or other supply chain constraints or price increases will be resolved in the near term, which could continue\nto adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the\nimpact of COVID-19 and supply chain constraints on our business.\n46 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nRisks related to our control environment\nBreaches of our information systems and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property and cause significant damage to\nour business and reputation.\nWe maintain sensitive data on our information systems and the networks of third-party providers, including intellectual property,\nfinancial data and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business, customers, suppliers, and business partners.\nWe also produce networking equipment solutions and software used by network operators to ensure security and reliability in their\nmanagement and transmission of data. Our customers, particularly those in regulated industries, are increasingly focused on the security\nfeatures of our technology solutions. Maintaining the security of information sensitive to us and our business partners is critical to our\nbusiness and reputation. We rely upon several internal business processes and information systems to support key operations and\nfinancial functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical. Companies are increasingly subjected to cyber-\nattacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. We have a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity, which includes prevention,\ndetection, containment, and response. Our layered defense approach encompasses proactive security monitoring of our global\ninfrastructure by both internal solutions and multiple third-party Security Operation Centers. Additionally, we routinely perform patch\nmanagement, vulnerability scans, penetration tests and continuous monitoring across our entire enterprise. Our security policy\nframework includes meaningful and enforceable Information Security policies and procedures. The cybersecurity program is aligned\nwith our mission and business objectives, reviewed periodically for improvements, and is supported by experienced and certified security\nprofessionals. This is supplemented by an information security awareness program that spans our global workforce. Despite this, our\nnetwork and storage applications and those systems and applications maintained by our third-party providers may be targeted by cyber-\nattacks or potentially breached due to operator error, fraudulent activity, or other system disruptions. For example, a vulnerability named\n“Log4Shell” was reported for the widely used Java logging library, Apache Log4j 2 (“Log4j”), in December of 2021. Although we did\nnot identify indicators of compromise in response to the Log4j vulnerability, we cannot assure that future vulnerabilities or malware\nattacks will not be successful in breaching our system and in turn, have a material impact our business. Unauthorized access or disclosure\nof our information could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. Our information systems are\ndesigned to appropriate industry standards and resiliently engineered to reduce downtime in the event of power outages, weather or\nclimate events and cybersecurity issues. These risks, as well as the number and frequency of cybersecurity events globally, may also be\nheightened during times of geopolitical tension or instability between countries, including, for example, the ongoing military conflict in\nUkraine with Russia, from which a number of recent cybersecurity events have been alleged to have originated. We carry cybersecurity\ninsurance policies meant to limit our risk and exposure should one of these cybersecurity issues occur. However, a significant failure of\nour systems due to these issues could result in significant remediation costs, disrupt business operations, and divert management\nattention, which could result in harm to our business reputation, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.\nAs part of our due diligence and integration planning process, the Company’s cybersecurity team has conducted a review of ADVA’s\ncybersecurity program. Additionally, prior to integration of facilities, networks, or systems, the Company also engage CrowdStrike, a\nglobal cybersecurity leader to conduct an enterprise-wide compromise assessment to determine if there were any targeted compromises\nby nation-state actors of the ADVA information technology landscape. The results from the CrowdStrike Compromise assessment\nindicated that there was no indication of compromise of the ADVA information technology environment. As part of the integration plan,\nthe Company intends to expand its current cybersecurity program to cover all ADVA’s global infrastructure and adopt any mature\ncybersecurity practices already in place. A significant failure of our review and integration of ADVA's cybersecurity program could\nexpose us to penalties for failing to comply with the EU's GDPR requirements as well as result in significant remediation costs and a\ndisruption to our operations.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting we could have a material weakness in our internal\ncontrols, that if not remediated, could materially adversely affect us.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”) requires us to include in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K an\nassessment by the Company’s management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a report from\nour independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We must perform\nsystem and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent\nregistered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section\n404. Our compliance with Section 404 may require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management\nefforts.\nAs permitted by SEC guidance, we currently exclude ADVA in our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting and related\ndisclosure controls and procedures for the first year after the Business Combination. However, we are in the process of extending our\noversight and monitoring processes that support our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to\ninclude ADVA’s operations.\nIf we are not able to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, including any failure to implement required\nnew or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in the implementation of or the implemented controls required in connection\nwith the Business Combination, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed. In addition, if management or\nour independent registered public accounting firm is unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we\nFinancial Information 47\ncould lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements, which could have an adverse effect on our\nstock price or lead to litigation claims.\nRisks related to the telecommunications industry\nWe must continue to update and improve our products and develop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements in\ncommunications technology.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and continuing\nimprovements in the communications service offerings of service providers. If technologies or standards applicable to our products, or\nservice provider offerings based on our products, become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our existing\nproducts or products under development may become obsolete or unmarketable. Moreover, the introduction of products embodying new\ntechnologies, the emergence of new industry standards, or changes in service provider offerings could adversely affect our ability to sell\nour products. For instance, we offer a large number of products that apply primarily to the delivery of high-speed digital communications\nover the local loop utilizing copper wire. We compete favorably with our competitors by developing a high-performance line of these\nproducts. We market products that apply to fiber optic transport in the local loop. We expect, however, that use of coaxial cable and\nfixed and mobile wireless access in place of local loop access will increase. Also, MSOs are increasing their presence in the local loop.\nTo meet the requirements of these new delivery systems and to maintain our market position, we expect to continue to develop new\nproducts and/or modify existing products. We expect that the addition of fiber-based products focused on the cable MSO operators,\nusing EPON and fixed wireless access solutions will better position us to benefit from spending in these adjacent markets.\nOur revenue and profitability in the past have, to a significant extent, resulted from our ability to anticipate changes in technology,\nindustry standards and service provider offerings, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products. Our continued ability to\nadapt will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and our prospects for growth. We cannot assure\nthat we will be able to respond effectively to changes in technology, industry standards, service provider offerings or new product\nannouncements by our competitors. We also cannot assure that we will be able to successfully develop and market new products or\nproduct enhancements, or that these products or enhancements will achieve market acceptance. Any failure by us to continue to anticipate\nor respond in a cost-effective and timely manner to changes in technology, industry standards, service provider offerings or new product\nannouncements by our competitors, or any significant delays in product development or introduction, could have a material adverse\neffect on our ability to competitively market our products and on our revenue, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable environmental regulations could adversely impact\nour results of operations.\nThe manufacture, assembly and testing of our products may require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to environmental,\nhealth and safety regulations. Our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with any of these applicable requirements\ncould result in regulatory penalties, legal claims or disruption of production. In addition, our failure or the failure of our contract\nmanufacturers to properly manage the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage, recycling or disposal of hazardous materials\ncould subject us to increased costs or liabilities. Existing and future environmental regulations may restrict our use of certain materials\nto manufacture, assemble and test products. Any of these consequences could adversely impact our results of operations by increasing\nour expenses and/or requiring us to alter our manufacturing processes.\nIf our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks, installations may be delayed or canceled, which could harm our\nbusiness.\nOur products must interface with existing networks, each of which may have different specifications, utilize multiple protocol standards\nand incorporate products from other vendors. Many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been\nadded over time as these networks have grown and evolved. Our products may be required to interoperate with many or all of the\nproducts within these networks, as well as future products to meet our customers’ requirements. If we find errors in the existing software\nor defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks, we may have to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these\nerrors so that our products will interoperate with the existing software and hardware. Implementation of product corrections involving\ninteroperability issues could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations. Such issues may affect our ability to obtain\nproduct acceptance from other customers.\nWe engage in research and development activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application of developed\ntechnologies, and as a consequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially greater\nresearch and development efforts and which may focus on more leading edge development.\nA portion of our research and development activities are focused on the continued innovation of currently accepted access and edge\ntransmission technologies in order to deliver faster internet speeds, more capacity, better quality of service and operational efficiency.\nThese research and development efforts result in improved applications of technologies for which demand already exists or is latent.\nWe also focus our research and development efforts on developing software, solutions and platforms that enable service providers to\nincrease revenue-generating service velocity, reducing operational costs, increasing scale and providing service agility. We rarely engage\nin research projects that represent a vast departure from the current business practices of our key customers. While we believe our\nstrategy provides a higher likelihood of producing nearer term or more sustainable revenue streams, this strategy could result in lost\nrevenue opportunities and higher operating expenses should a new technology achieve rapid and widespread market acceptance. When\n48 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nwe do engage in research and development activities for new, leading-edge technologies and market approaches, there is no guarantee\nthat those technologies or market approaches will be successful or that they will be adopted and purchased by our customers.\nOur strategy of outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing requirements to subcontractors located in various international regions\nmay result in us not meeting our cost, quality or performance standards.\nWe are heavily dependent on subcontractors for the assembly and testing of certain printed circuit board assemblies, subassemblies,\nchassis, enclosures and equipment shelves, and the purchase of some raw materials used in such assemblies. This reliance involves\nseveral risks, including the unavailability of, or interruptions in, access to certain process technologies and reduced control over product\nquality, delivery schedules, transportation, manufacturing yields and costs. We may not be able to provide product order volumes to our\nsubcontractors that are high enough to achieve sufficient cost savings. If shipments fall below forecasted levels, we may incur increased\ncosts or be required to take ownership of excess inventory. Changes in international tariff structures could adversely impact our product\ncosts. We also have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased inflationary pressures on input costs, such as, raw\nmaterials, labor and distribution costs. Our attempts to offset these cost pressures, such as through increases in the selling prices of some\nof our products and services, may not be successful and could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, a significant component\nof maintaining cost competitiveness is the ability of our subcontractors to adjust their costs to compensate for possible adverse exchange\nrate movements. To the extent that the subcontractors are unable to do so, and we are unable to procure alternative product supplies,\nthen our competitiveness and results of operations could be adversely impaired. These risks may be exacerbated by economic, regulatory\nor political changes or uncertainties, terrorist actions, acts of war, the effects of climate change, natural disasters or pandemics in the\nforeign countries in which our subcontractors are located.\nTo date, we believe that we have successfully managed the risks of our dependence on these subcontractors through a variety of efforts,\nwhich include seeking and developing alternative subcontractors while maintaining existing relationships; however, we cannot be\nassured that delays in product deliveries will not occur in the future because of shortages resulting from this limited number of\nsubcontractors or from the financial or other difficulties of these parties. Our inability to develop alternative subcontractors if and as\nrequired in the future, or the need to undertake required retraining and other activities related to establishing and developing a new\nsubcontractor relationship, could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which, in turn, could have a negative effect on our\ncustomer relationships and operating results.\nOur failure to maintain rights to intellectual property used in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality and\ncommercial value of our products.\nOur future success depends in part upon our proprietary technology. Although we attempt to protect our proprietary technology by\ncontract, trademark, copyright and patent registration and internal security, including trade secret protection, these protections may not\nbe adequate. Furthermore, our competitors can develop similar technology independently without violating our proprietary rights. From\ntime to time, we receive and may continue to receive notices of claims alleging that we are infringing upon patents or other intellectual\nproperty. Any of these claims, whether with or without merit, could result in significant legal fees, divert our management’s time,\nattention and resources, delay our product shipments or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. We cannot predict\nwhether we will prevail in any claims or litigation over alleged infringements, or whether we will be able to license any valid and\ninfringed patents, or other intellectual property, on commercially reasonable terms. If a claim of intellectual property infringement\nagainst us is successful and we fail to obtain a license or develop or license non-infringing technology, our business, operating results,\nfinancial condition and cash flows could be affected adversely.\nSoftware under license from third parties for use in certain of our products may not continue to be available to us on commercially\nreasonable terms.\nWe integrate third-party software into certain of our products. Licenses for this technology may not be available or continue to be\navailable to us on commercially reasonable terms. Difficulties with third-party technology licensors could result in the termination of\nsuch licenses, which may result in increased costs or require us to purchase or develop a substitute technology. Difficulty obtaining and\nmaintaining third-party technology licenses may disrupt the development of our products and increase our costs, which could harm our\nbusiness.\nOur use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products.\nSeveral of our solutions utilize elements of open source or publicly available software. Although we closely monitor our use of open\nsource software, the terms of many open source software licenses have not been interpreted by the courts, and there is a risk that such\nlicenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to sell our products. In\nsuch event, we could be required to make our proprietary software generally available to third parties, including competitors, at no cost,\nto seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of\nour products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or at all, any of which could adversely affect our\nrevenue and operating expenses.\nFinancial Information 49\nWe may incur liabilities or become subject to litigation that would have a material effect on our business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we accept purchase orders, and enter into sales and other related contracts, for the marketing, sale,\nmanufacture, distribution or use of our products and services. We may incur liabilities relating to our performance under such\nagreements, or which result from damage claims arising from certain events as outlined within the particular contract. While we attempt\nto include reasonable limitations of liability and other protective measures to all agreements, such agreements may not always contain,\nor be subject to, maximum loss clauses and liabilities arising from them may result in significant adverse changes to our results of\noperations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including employment disputes, patent claims,\ndisputes over contract agreements and other commercial disputes. In some cases, claimants seek monetary recovery, or other relief,\nincluding damages such as royalty payments related to patents, lost profits or injunctive relief, which, if granted, could require significant\nexpenditures. Any such disputes may be resolved before trial, or if tried, may be resolved in our favor; however, the cost of claims\nsustained in litigation, and costs associated with the litigation process, may not be covered by our insurance. Such costs, and the demands\non management time during such an event, could harm our business, reputation and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity,\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and maintain relationships with SIs, service providers and enterprise VARs, our revenue\nmay be negatively affected.\nAs part of our sales strategy, we are targeting SIs, service providers and enterprise VARs. In addition to specialized technical expertise,\nSIs, service providers and VARs typically offer sophisticated service capabilities that are frequently desired by enterprise customers. To\nexpand our distribution channel to include resellers with such capabilities, we must be able to provide effective support to these resellers.\nIf our sales, marketing or service capabilities are not sufficient to provide effective support to such SIs, service providers and VARs,\nour revenue may be negatively affected, and current SI, service provider and VAR partners may terminate their relationships with us,\nwhich would adversely impact our revenue and overall results of operations.\nRisks related to the Company’s stock price\nOur operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price.\nOur operating results have been, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors.\nThese factors include, but are not limited to:\n fluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially with respect to significant network expansion projects\nundertaken by service providers;\n continued growth of communications network traffic and the adoption of communication services and applications by\nenterprise and consumer end users;\n changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers’ spending plans and\nassociated revenue, especially should a slowdown in communications industry spending occur due to economic downturns,\ntight capital markets, or declining liquidity trends;\n reductions in demand for our traditional products as new technologies gain acceptance;\n our ability, and that of our distributors, to maintain appropriate inventory levels and related purchase commitments;\n price and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change rapidly due to\ntechnological innovation;\n the overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers;\n our dependence on sales of our products by channel partners, the timing of their replenishment orders, the potential for\nconflicts and competition involving our channel partners and large end-user customers and the potential for consolidation\namong our channel partners;\n variations in sales channels, product cost or mix of products and services sold;\n delays in receiving acceptance, as defined under contract, from certain customers for shipments or services performed near\nthe end of a reporting period;\n our ability to maintain high levels of product support and professional services;\n manufacturing and customer order lead times, and potential restrictions in the supply of key components;\n fluctuations in our gross margin and the factors that contribute to this (as described above);\n our ability to achieve cost reductions;\n50 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\n the ability of our customers, channel partners and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures;\n our ability to execute on our strategy and operating plans;\n benefits anticipated from our investments in engineering, sales and marketing activities;\n the effects of climate change and other natural events;\n the effect of political or economic conditions, including the effect of tariffs or so-called “trade wars” on us and our supply\nchain, acts of war, terrorist attacks or other unrest in certain international markets;\n the effect of escalating tensions along the Russia-Ukraine border. The U.S. and certain other countries imposed sanctions\non Russia and could impose further sanctions against it, which could damage or disrupt international commerce and the\nglobal economy; and\n changes in tax laws and regulations or accounting pronouncements.\nAs a result, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and prior results are not necessarily indicative of results\nto be expected in future periods. Any of the above-mentioned factors, or other factors discussed elsewhere in this report, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows that could adversely affect our stock\nprice.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ADTN. Since our initial public offering in August\n1994, there has been, and may continue to be, significant volatility in the market for our common stock, based on a variety of factors,\nincluding factors listed in this section, some of which are beyond our control.\nFinancial Information 51\nRisks related to the regulatory environments in which we do business\nWe are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and standards governing the conduct of our business.\nViolations of these laws and regulations may harm our business, subject us to penalties and to other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that govern conduct by our Company, our employees and agents and the manufacture, sale and\nuse of our products. Our inability to comply with current and evolving laws and regulations governing our business domestically and\ninternationally may adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. New and changing laws,\nregulations and industry practices could require us to modify our business, products or services offered, potentially in a material manner,\nand may limit our ability to develop new products, services and features. If we violate these laws and regulations, governmental\nauthorities in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions could seek to impose civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have an\nadverse effect on our reputation, as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThese laws and regulations include, but are not limited to:\n various regulations and regional standards established by communications authorities and import/export control authorities\nthat govern the manufacture, sale and use of our products. Changes in domestic or international communications regulations,\ntariffs, potential changes in trade policies by the U.S. and other nations, application requirements, import/export controls or\nexpansion of regulation to new areas, including access, communications or commerce over the internet, may affect customer\ndemand for our products or slow the adoption of new technologies which may affect our revenue. Further, the cost of\ncomplying with the evolving standards and regulations, including the cost of product re-design if necessary, or the failure\nto obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certification such that we may not be able to sell our products\nwhere these standards or regulations apply, may adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, financial condition and\ncash flows.\n compliance with a wide variety of provincial, state, national and international laws and regulations applicable to the\ncollection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of data, including personal data. Foreign data\nprotection, privacy and other laws and regulations, including GDPR, are often more restrictive than those in the U.S. These\ndata protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are varied, evolving, can be subject to significant change, may be\naugmented or replaced by new or additional laws and regulations and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public\nscrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. For example, numerous states have adopted within the past\nthree years or are in the process of adopting various privacy-related laws and regulations. In addition, on July 16, 2020, the\nCourt of Justice of the European Union issued a decision that invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework as a basis\nfor transfers of personal data from the EU to the U.S., resulting in uncertainty and potential additional compliance\nobligations to ensure that a valid basis under the GDPR exists for these data transfers. The European Commission published\nrevised standard contractual clauses for data transfers from the European Economic Area in 2021, which were required to\ngo into effect by December 2022. Finally, the U.K. has enacted a version of the GDPR the implementation of which occurred\nby way of the Data Protection Act 2018, collectively referred to as the U.K. GDPR. Uncertainty remains, however, regarding\nhow aspects of data protection in the U.K. will be handled in the medium to long term. There is also a risk that we, directly\nor as the result of a third-party service provider we use, could be found to have failed to comply with the laws and regulations\napplicable in a jurisdiction regarding the collection, consent, handling, transfer or disposal of personal data.\n the FCPA, which prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for\nthe purpose of directing, obtaining or keeping business, and requires companies to maintain reasonable books and records\nand a system of internal accounting controls. The FCPA applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and\nagents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by employees, strategic or local\npartners or other representatives. Because a significant portion of our total revenue is generated from revenue outside of the\nU.S., we have proactively implemented internally and externally focused measures and controls to address this risk. We\nhelp ensure that our employees understand the key requirements of FCPA compliance and the consequences of non-\ncompliance through training courses and detective controls. ADTRAN senior management and employees whose\nresponsibilities include international activities are required to complete an online training program and pass an exam every\ntwo years. We have put processes in place to help detect non-compliance through providing our employees access to a\nworldwide reporting “hotline,” available by phone and online, that is maintained by a third-party provider. Finally, we\nperform annual reviews of our employees’ expense reports and corporate credit card activity to identify possible corruption\nconcerns. We have also implemented controls to help ensure our third-party partners and customers observe FCPA\nrequirements. Prior to selling to new international distributors, resellers or agents, we review third-party data and check\nthem against over 200 denied party lists from government institutions worldwide for potential FCPA concerns. We also\nrequire international distributors, resellers and agents to complete an Anti-Corruption Due Diligence Questionnaire, which\nis reviewed and assessed by a cross-functional compliance committee and our export-compliance function.\n52 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\n environmental, health and safety regulation governing the manufacture, assembly and testing of our products, including\nwithout limitation regulations governing the use of hazardous materials. Our failure or the failure of our contract\nmanufacturers to properly manage the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage, recycling or disposal of hazardous\nmaterials could subject us to increased costs or liabilities. Existing and future environmental regulations may restrict our\nuse of certain materials to manufacture, assemble and test products.\n requirements by the SEC governing the disclosure regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and adjoining countries (the “DRC”) and disclosure with respect to procedures regarding a\nmanufacturer’s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals from the DRC. Certain of these minerals are present in our\nproducts. SEC rules implementing these requirements may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers that can supply\n“conflict free” components and parts, and we may not be able to obtain conflict free products or supplies in sufficient\nquantities for our operations. Because our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers,\nstockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins for the conflict minerals used in our\nproducts and cannot assert that our products are “conflict free.” Environmental or similar social initiatives may also make\nit difficult to obtain supply of compliant components or may require us to write off non-compliant inventory, which could\nhave an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n the insider trading prohibitions and the respective directors' dealing rules under the German Securities Trading Act\n(Wertpapierhandelsgesetz) and Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 16,\n2014, and other applicable regulations.\nChanges in trade policy in the U.S. and other countries, specifically the U.K. and China, including the imposition of additional tariffs\nand the resulting consequences, may adversely impact our gross profits, gross margins, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn recent years, international market conditions and the international regulatory environment have been increasingly affected by\ncompetition among countries and geopolitical frictions. In particular, there have been a number of significant geopolitical events,\nincluding trade tensions and regulatory actions, involving the governments of the U.S. and China. The U.S. government has raised\ntariffs, and imposed new tariffs, on a wide range of imports of Chinese products, including component elements of our solutions and\ncertain finished goods products that we sell. U.S. tariff policy involving imports from China are slated for a broad review in 2023. The\nU.S. government has also introduced broad new restrictions on imports from China allegedly manufactured with forced labor, and the\nEU has debated similar restrictions. China has retaliated by raising tariffs, and imposing new tariffs, on certain exports of U.S. goods to\nChina, as well as introducing blocking measures to restrict the ability of domestic companies to comply with U.S. trade restrictions. For\ninstance, over the course of 2020, the U.S. introduced significant further restrictions limiting access to controlled U.S. technology to\nadditional Chinese government and commercial entities. More recently, in October 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed\nadditional export control restrictions targeting the provision of, inter alia, certain semiconductors and related technology to China that\ncould further disrupt supply chains that could adversely impact our business. In addition, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission\n(the “FCC”) in November 2022 prohibited communications equipment deemed to pose an unacceptable risk to national security from\nobtaining the equipment authorization that allows the products to be imported, marketed, or sold in the U.S. This prohibition currently\nincludes telecommunications equipment produced by Huawei and its affiliates and subsidiaries and four other Chinese companies, and\nadditional entities may be subsequently added to this list. The situation involving U.S.-China trade relations remains volatile and\nuncertain and there can be no assurance that further actions by either country will not have an adverse impact on our business, operations\nand access to technology, or components thereof, sourced from China.\nThe past few years have been challenging for the credit markets due to a shift from a time of quantitative easing to a time of quantitative\ntightening by central banks around the world. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain\nuncertain or further deteriorate, we may experience material impacts on our business and operating results. We may also be adversely\naffected in ways that we do not currently anticipate.\nFinancial Information 53\nNew or revised tax regulations, changes in our effective tax rate, recognition of a valuation allowance or assessments arising from\ntax audits may have an adverse impact on our results.\nWe are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions, both domestically and internationally, in which we conduct business. Significant\njudgment is required in the determination of our provision for income taxes, and this determination requires the interpretation and\napplication of complex and sometimes uncertain tax laws and regulations. Our effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by changes\nin the mix of earnings between jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, and by changes\nin tax rules and regulations. We continually monitor our deferred tax assets and when it becomes more likely than not that a tax benefit\nwill not be recognized, a valuation allowance is recorded against those assets. In addition, we are subject to examination of our income\ntax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and various other tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We\nregularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for\nincome taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Additionally, we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance\nand recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax\nassets will be recognized. As such, we may release a portion of the valuation allowance or establish a new valuation allowance based\non operations in the jurisdictions in which these assets arose. Management continues to evaluate all evidence including historical\noperating results, the existence of losses in the most recent year, forecasted earnings, future taxable income and tax planning strategies.\nShould management determine that a valuation allowance is needed in the future due to not being able to absorb deferred tax assets, it\nwould have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, which made a number of changes to the Internal Revenue Code,\nincluding adding a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks by publicly traded corporations and a 15% corporate minimum tax on adjusted\nfinancial statement income of certain large companies. The impact of these provisions on our effective tax rate will also depend on\nadditional guidance to be issued by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. We are currently evaluating the impact of\nthese provisions on our effective tax rate. Further, the Tax Act amended the Internal Revenue Code to require that specific research and\nexperimental (“R&E”) expenditures be capitalized and amortized over five years (U.S. R&E) or fifteen years (non-U.S. R&E) beginning\nin the Company’s fiscal 2023. Although the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would defer, modify, or repeal the\ncapitalization and amortization requirement, there is no assurance that the provision will be deferred, repealed, or otherwise modified.\nIf the requirement is not repealed or otherwise modified, it may increase our effective tax rate. Additionally, the Organization for\nEconomic Co-operation and Development (the “OECD”), an international association comprised of 38 countries, including the U.S.,\nhas issued proposals that change long-standing tax principles including on a global minimum tax initiative. On December 12, 2022 the\nEU member states agreed to implement the OECD’s Pillar 2 global corporate minimum tax rate of 15% on companies with revenues of\nat least EUR 750 million, which would go into effect in 2024. Other countries including the U.K., Switzerland, Canada, Australia and\nSouth Korea are also actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD’s proposals.\nCentral Banks' monetary policy actions could increase our costs of borrowing money and negatively impact our financial condition\nand future operations.\nMarket interest rates are rising and are expected to continue to rise across the yield curve. Depending on future inflation levels, the rise\nof nominal interest rates may produce a rise in real interest rates. Higher interest rates resulting from tightening monetary policy are\nexpected to increase credit costs and decrease credit availability. Increases in interest rates could increase our costs of borrowing money\nunder certain of our debt facilities with variable interest rates, which would negatively impact our financial condition and future\noperations.\nRising inflation could negatively impact our revenues and profitability if increases in the prices of our products and services or a\ndecrease in customer spending result in lower sales.\nRecent significant increases in inflation may result in decreased demand for our products and services, increased manufacturing and\noperating costs (including our labor costs), reduced liquidity, and limitations on our ability to access credit or otherwise raise debt and\nequity capital. In an inflationary environment, because certain of our customer contracts provide for fixed pricing and/or due to our\ncompetitor’s pricing strategies, we may be unable to raise the sales prices of our products and services at or above the rate at which our\ncosts increase, which would reduce our profit and operating margins and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe also may experience lower than expected sales and potential adverse impacts on our competitive position if there is a decrease in\ncustomer spending or a negative reaction to any price increases we are able to implement. A reduction in our revenue would be\ndetrimental to our profitability and financial condition and could also have an adverse impact on our future growth.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased\ncosts, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\n54 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental,\nsocial and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil\nrights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, we may make statements about our environmental, social and governance goals\nand initiatives through our website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and\ngovernance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and\ndepends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside of our control. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our\ntargets, further our initiatives, adhere to our public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and\ngovernance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory\nproceedings against us and materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nFinancial Information 55\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur global headquarters and certain administrative, engineering and manufacturing facilities are located on an 82-acre campus in\nCummings Research Park in Huntsville, Alabama. Two office buildings in Huntsville, Alabama serve both our Network Solutions and\nour Services & Support segments. We lease a facility for our European headquarters in Munich, Germany. We lease engineering facilities\nin the U.S., EMEA and APAC that are used to develop products sold by our Network Solutions segment. In addition, we lease office\nspace in North America, Latin America, EMEA and APAC, which provide sales and service support for both of our segments. These\ncancelable and non-cancelable leases expire at various times through 2032. For more information, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nWe also have numerous sales and support staff operating from home-based offices serving both our Network Solutions and our Services\n& Support segments, which are located within the U.S. and abroad.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time we are subject to or otherwise involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and legal proceedings that arise out\nof or are incidental to the conduct of our business (collectively, “Legal Matters”), including those relating to employment matters, patent\nrights, regulatory compliance matters, stockholder claims, and contractual and other commercial disputes. Such Legal Matters, even if\nnot meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Additionally, an unfavorable outcome\nin a legal matter, including in a patent dispute, could require us to pay damages, entitle claimants to other relief, such as royalties, or\ncould prevent us from selling some of our products in certain jurisdictions. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of or\nestimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these legal matters.\nITEM 4.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included\nin Part II, Item 8 of this report. We have omitted discussion of the earliest of the three years of financial condition and results of\noperations and this information can be found in Part I, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February\n25, 2022, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov and on our website at www.adtran.com.\nThis discussion is designed to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial\nstatements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, and the primary factors that accounted\nfor those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles affect our consolidated financial statements. See “Cautionary Note\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements” on page 2 of this report for a description of important factors that could cause actual results\nto differ from expected results. See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K.\nUnless the context otherwise indicates or requires, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to \"ADTRAN\", the “Company,”\n“we,” “us” and “our” refer to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries for periods subsequent to the Merger and to\nADTRAN, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries for periods prior to the Merger. The prior period results do not include the results of\nADVA prior to the Merger.\nOverview\nThe Company is a leading global provider of networking and communications platforms, software, systems and services focused on the\nbroadband access market, serving a diverse domestic and international customer base in multiple countries that includes Tier-1, -2 and\n-3 service providers, alternative service providers, such as utilities, municipalities and fiber overbuilders, cable/MSOs, SMBs and\ndistributed enterprises. Our innovative solutions and services enable voice, data, video and internet-communications across a variety of\nnetwork infrastructures and are currently in use by millions worldwide. We support our customers through our direct global sales\norganization and our distribution networks. Our success depends upon our ability to increase unit volume and market share through the\nintroduction of new products and succeeding generations of products having optimal selling prices and increased functionality as\ncompared to both the prior generation of a product and to the products of competitors in order to gain market share. To service our\ncustomers and grow revenue, we are continually conducting research and developing new products addressing customer needs and\ntesting those products for the specific requirements of the particular customers. We offer a broad portfolio of flexible software and\nhardware network solutions and services that enable service providers to meet today’s service demands, while enabling them to transition\nto the fully converged, scalable, highly-automated, cloud-controlled voice, data, internet and video network of the future. In addition to\nour global headquarters in Huntsville, Alabama, and our European headquarters in Munich, Germany, we have sales, administrative and\nresearch and development facilities in strategic global locations.\nADTRAN Holdings, Inc. solely owns ADTRAN, Inc. and is the majority shareholder of ADVA Optical Networking SE (\"ADVA\").\nADTRAN is a leading global provider of open, disaggregated networking and communications solutions. ADVA is a global provider\nof network solutions for data, storage, voice and video services. The combined technology portfolio can best address current and future\nrequirements, especially regarding the convergence of solutions at the network edge.\nIn addition to the Company's reportable segments, revenue is also reported for the following three categories – Subscriber Solutions,\nAccess & Aggregation Solutions, and Optical Networking Solutions.\nPrior to the Business Combination with ADVA on July 15, 2022, ADTRAN reported revenue across the following three categories: (1)\nAccess & Aggregation, (2) Subscriber Solutions & Experience and (3) Traditional & Other Products. Following the Business\nCombination with ADVA, we have recast these revenues such that ADTRAN’s former Access & Aggregation revenue is combined\nwith a portion of the applicable ADVA solutions to create Access & Aggregation Solutions, ADTRAN’s former Subscriber Solutions\n& Experience revenue is combined with a portion of the applicable ADVA solutions to create Subscriber Solutions and the revenue\nfrom Traditional & Other products is now included in the applicable Access & Aggregation Solutions or Subscriber Solutions category.\nOptical Networking Solutions is a new revenue category added to represent a meaningful portion of ADVA’s portfolio.\nOur Subscriber Solutions portfolio is used by service providers to terminate their access services infrastructure at the customer premises\nwhile providing an immersive and interactive experience for residential, business and wholesale subscribers. This revenue category\nincludes hardware- and software-based products and services. These solutions include fiber termination solutions for residential,\nbusiness and wholesale subscribers, Wi-Fi access solutions for residential and business subscribers, Ethernet switching and network\nedge virtualization solutions for business subscribers and cloud software solutions covering a mix of subscriber types.\nOur Access & Aggregation Solutions are solutions that are used by communications service providers to connect residential subscribers,\nbusiness subscribers and mobile radio networks to the service providers’ metro network, primarily through fiber-based connectivity.\nThis revenue category includes hardware- and software-based products and services. Our solutions within this category are a mix of\nfiber access and aggregation platforms, precision network synchronization and timing solutions and access orchestration solutions that\nensure highly reliable and efficient network performance.\n60 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nOur Optical Networking Solutions are used by communications service providers, internet content providers and large-scale enterprises\nto securely interconnect metro and regional networks over fiber. This revenue category includes hardware- and software-based products\nand services. Our solutions within this category include open optical terminals, open line systems, optical subsystems and modules,\nnetwork infrastructure assurance systems and automation platforms that are used to build high-scale, secure and assured optical\nnetworks.\nADVA Domination and Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement\nThe DPLTA between the Company, as the controlling company, and ADVA Optical Networking SE, as the controlled company, which\nwas executed on December 1, 2022, became effective on January 16, 2023, as a result of its registration with the commercial register\n(Handelsregister) of the local court (Amtsgericht) at the registered seat of ADVA (Jena).\nUnder the DPLTA, subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, (i) the Company is\nentitled to issue binding instructions to the management board of ADVA, (ii) ADVA will transfer its annual profit to the Company,\nsubject to, among other things, the creation or dissolution of certain reserves, and (iii) the Company will generally absorb the annual net\nloss incurred by ADVA. The obligation of ADVA to transfer its annual profit to the Company applies for the first time to the profit, if\nany, generated in the ADVA fiscal year 2023. The obligation of the Company to absorb ADVA’s annual net loss applies for the first\ntime to the loss, if any, generated in the ADVA fiscal year 2023.\nAdditionally, and subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, the DPLTA provides\nthat ADVA shareholders (other than us) be offered, at their election, (i) to put their ADVA shares to the Company in exchange for a\ncompensation in cash of EUR 17.21 per share (the “Exit Compensation”), or (ii) to remain ADVA shareholders and receive a recurring\ncompensation in cash of EUR 0.59 (EUR 0.52 net under the current tax regime) per share for each full fiscal year of ADVA (the “Annual\nRecurring Compensation”). The Annual Recurring Compensation is due on the third banking day following the ordinary general\nshareholders’ meeting of ADVA for the respective preceding fiscal year (but in any event within eight months following expiration of\nthe fiscal year) and is first granted for the 2023 fiscal year, payable for the first time after the ordinary general shareholders’ meeting of\nADVA in 2024. The adequacy of both forms of compensation have been challenged by minority shareholders of ADVA via court-led\nappraisal proceedings under German law, and it is possible that the courts in such appraisal proceedings may adjudicate a higher Exit\nCompensation or Annual Recurring Compensation (in each case, including interest thereon) than agreed upon in the DPLTA.\nThe opportunity for outside ADVA shareholders to tender ADVA shares in exchange for Exit Compensation had been scheduled to\nexpire on March 16, 2023. However, due to the appraisal proceedings that have been initiated in accordance with applicable German\nlaw, this time period for tendering shares has been extended pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and will end\ntwo months after the date on which a final decision in such appraisal proceedings has been published in the Federal Gazette\n(Bundesanzeiger).\nWe currently hold 33,961,170 no-par value bearer shares of ADVA, representing 65.30% of ADVA’s outstanding shares as of February\n14, 2023.\nThe foregoing description of the DPLTA does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the DPLTA, a\nnon-binding English translation of which is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $14.2 million of transaction costs relating to the Business Combination. We\nexpect to incur integration costs and costs associated with the implementation of the DPLTA during 2023 and such costs are expected\nto be material.\nMulti-Year Integration Program\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company initiated a multi-year integration program designed to optimize the assets, business\nprocesses, and information technology systems of the Company.\nThe program has identified several potential cost synergies, including:\n realizing operational scale;\n combined sales channels;\n streamlining corporate and general and administrative functions; and\n combined sourcing and production costs.\nWe have and will continue to invest significant dollars to restructure the workforce, optimize legacy systems, streamline legal entities\nand consolidate real estate holdings. By executing these integration activities, we expect to deliver greater innovation for customers,\ncareer enrichment opportunities for employees, and enhanced value for shareholders. See Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nFinancial Information 61\nFinancial Performance and Trends\nWe ended 2022 with a year-over-year revenue increase of 82.2% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, driven by increased\nvolume of sales activity due to the Business Combination with ADVA and to service provider customers. During 2022, we had one 10%\nrevenue customer which was a domestic service provider customer and our five largest customers comprised 38.3% of our revenue. Our\nyear-over-year domestic revenue increased by 38.1%, driven by increased sales volume due to the Business Combination with ADVA\nand an increased sales volume of residential gateways and optical network terminals in our Network Solutions segment. Internationally,\nour revenue increased by 169.7% compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by increased volume of sales activity due to the\nBusiness Combination with ADVA and increased shipments to a Tier-1 network operator in Europe. We experienced strong demand\nfor our solutions during 2022 and achieved significant year-over-year bookings growth. Bookings are defined as orders received for a\nproduct or service during a fiscal period that will be delivered or performed sometime in the future and is a forward looking metric that\nwe utilize to help us understand future revenue growth for the Company. Bookings are generally subject to modification and or\ncancellation per the terms of the order. Our increase in demand comes from service providers planning to deploy our fiber access\nplatforms, in-home service delivery platforms and SaaS applications. We expect this growth to accelerate. During 2021 and 2022, we\nsecured several Tier-1 next-generation fiber customers, and previously announced Tier-1 fiber customers significantly increased their\nbookings for our fiber access platforms. Although we expect our revenue growth and profitability in the near-term to continue to be\nnegatively impacted by supply chain issues, our outlook continues to strengthen given the increased demand for our products and our\nexpectation of an improving supply chain over the longer term.\nA substantial portion of our shipments of inventory in any fiscal period relate to orders received and shipped within that fiscal period\nfor customers under agreements containing non-binding purchase commitments. Further, a significant percentage of orders require\ndelivery within a few days. However, with the current global supply chain and transportation constraints, and limited availability of\nsemiconductor chips and other components of our products, we have experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times,\nincreased logistics intervals and costs, and lower volume of products deliveries, which have had and may continue to have a material\nadverse effect on our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our customer relations and our financial condition.\nThe extent of the impact of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic on our business remains uncertain and difficult to predict\nbecause of the dynamic and evolving nature of the situation. Despite the widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines and related\ntreatments, the global impact of the outbreak continues to adversely affect many industries, and different geographies continue to reflect\nthe effects of public health restrictions in various ways. The economic recovery following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is\nonly partially underway and has been gradual, uneven and characterized by meaningful dispersion across sectors and regions with\nuncertainty regarding its ultimate length and trajectory. The COVID-19 pandemic and related countermeasures have previously impacted\nour operations. During 2022, notwithstanding improvement in many markets in which we operate due to a return to more normalized\nbusiness operations, certain markets continued to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 or as a result of policies relating to COVID-19.\nAdditionally, due to the pandemic and a global semiconductor chip shortage, we experienced disruption and delays in our supply chain\nand significant price increases with certain of our manufacturing partners, and those disruptions, delays and price increases may continue.\nFor example, in the second half of 2021 and throughout 2022, our results of operations were negatively impacted by increased expenses\nresulting from supply chain disruptions. With the current global supply chain and transportation constraints, including delays in supply\nchain deliveries and the related global semi-conductor chip shortage may continue to have a material adverse effect on our operating\nresults and could have a material adverse effect on customer relations and our financial condition. We believe these supply chain\nchallenges and their adverse impact on our industry will continue to ease during 2023. However, there can be no assurance that the\nongoing disruptions due to COVID-19, the related global semiconductor chip shortage or other supply chain constraints or price\nincreases will be resolved in the near term, which could continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business.\nOur operating results have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, on a quarterly basis due to several factors, including customer\norder activity, supply chain constraints, component availability, the Company's consolidation, purchase accounting, and integration with\nADVA. A substantial portion of our shipments in any fiscal period relates to orders received and shipped within that fiscal period for\ncustomers under agreements containing non-binding purchase commitments. Further, a significant percentage of orders require delivery\nwithin a few days requiring us to maintain higher inventory levels. These factors may result in limited order flow visibility. However,\nwith the current global supply chain and transportation constraints, and limited availability of semiconductor chips and other components\nof our products, we have experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times, increased logistics intervals and costs, and\nlower volume of products deliveries, which have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our operating results and\ncould have a material adverse effect on customer relations and our financial condition. We believe these supply chain challenges and\ntheir adverse impact on our industry will continue at least through fiscal 2023 and expect that the extended lead times and elevated\nsupply chain costs experienced by our industry will persist for the reasonably foreseeable future. It is unclear when the supply\nenvironment will become less volatile and what impacts the supply environment will have on the industry in future periods. Operating\nexpenses are relatively fixed in the short term; therefore, a shortfall in quarterly revenues could significantly impact our financial results\nin a given quarter.\n62 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nOur operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors, including a decline in general economic and market\nconditions, specifically the decline that initially resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic and that may recur and foreign currency\nexchange rate movements, inflation, regional conflicts, increased competition, customer order patterns, changes in product and services\nmix, timing differences between price decreases and product cost reductions, product warranty returns, expediting costs, tariffs and\nannouncements of new products by us or our competitors. Specifically, we expect inflationary pressures on input costs, such as raw\nmaterials and labor, and distribution costs to increase. We continue to support our customer demand for our products by working with\nour suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, and customers to address and to limit the disruption to our operations and order\nfulfillment. Our attempts to offset these cost pressures, such as through increases in the selling prices of some of our products and\nservices, may not be successful and could negatively affect our operating results. Additionally, maintaining sufficient inventory levels\nto assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory that may become obsolete and increases the risk that the\nobsolescence of this inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. Also, not maintaining sufficient\ninventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products may cause us to incur expediting costs to meet customer delivery requirements,\nwhich may negatively impact our operating results.\nWe are exposed to changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-\nexchanges rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial\nreporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period’s\ncurrency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements\nare with the Euro and the British pound sterling. As a result of our global operations, our revenue, gross margins, operating expense and\noperating income in some international markets have been and may continue to be affected by foreign currency fluctuations.\nOur historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results, and, in general, management expects\nthat our financial results may vary from period to period. For a discussion of risks associated with our operating results, see Part I, Item\n1A, Risk Factors of this report.\nFinancial Information 63\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents selected financial information derived from our Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income expressed as a\npercentage of revenue for the years indicated.

The emphasis of the discussion is a comparison of the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. For a discussion of a comparison of the years ended December 31, 2021 and December\n31, 2020, please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021\nRevenue\nOur revenue increased 82.2% from $563.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $1,026 million for the year ended December\n31, 2022. The increase in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 is primarily attributable to a $365.9 million increase in volume\nof sales activity due to the Business Combination with ADVA and a $96.6 million increase in volume of sales activity related to our\nADTRAN, Inc. operations. The increase in revenue by category for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to a\n$261.1 million increase in Optical Networking Solutions products due to the Business Combination with ADVA and a $184.2 million\nincrease in Subscriber Solutions products. Although our revenue increased, supply of semiconductor chips and other components of our\nproducts has become constrained resulting in extended lead times and increased costs. Transportation constraints, including shortages\nfor both air and surface freight, as well as labor shortages in the transportation industry, have also affected the timing and the cost of\nobtaining raw materials and production supplies. Although our revenue growth and profitability in the near-term may be impacted by\nthese global supply chain issues, our longer term outlook continues to strengthen given our progress with new customer opportunities\nand the increased customer demand.\nNetwork Solutions segment revenue increased 83.8% from $498.8 million in 2021 to $916.8 million in 2022, due primarily to the\nincrease of $320.3 million in volume of sales activity due to the Business Combination with ADVA and the increase in revenue for\nSubscriber Solutions products of $107.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in Access & Aggregation Solutions products of $9.3\nmillion revenue in our ADTRAN, Inc. operations.\nServices & Support revenue increased by 69.5% from $64.2 million in 2021 to $108.7 million in 2022. The increase in revenue for 2022\nwas primarily attributable to the increase of $45.6 million in volume of sales activity from the Business Combination with ADVA\npartially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in revenue for Access & Aggregation Solutions products in our ADTRAN, Inc. operations.\n64 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nDomestic revenue increased by 38.1% from $374.6 million in 2021 to $517.4 million in 2022, driven by increased volume of network\ntermination and fiber CPE in our Network Solutions segment. In addition, such growth was a result of increased revenue to Tier-2 and\nTier-3 customers with diversified business among our fiber access and CPE, service provider CPE and services.\nInternational revenue, which is defined as revenue generated from the Network Solutions and Services & Support segments provided to\na customer outside of the U.S., increased by 169.7% from $188.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $508.1 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022. International revenue, as a percentage of total revenue, increased from 33.5% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 to 49.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in international revenue for 2022 was primarily\nattributable to the increase in volume of $263.8 million in sales activity from the Business Combination with ADVA and increased\nshipments to a Tier-1 network operator and multiple alternative network operators in Europe. While international revenue has increased\nto approximately 49.5% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, the mix of our Network Solutions and Services &\nSupport segments as a percentage of total international revenue remains relatively linear. For the year ended December 31, 2022 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2021, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S dollar decreased our net sales by\napproximately $41.5 million.\nOur ADTRAN, Inc. international revenue is largely focused on broadband infrastructure and is consequently affected by the decisions\nof our customers as to timing for installation of new technologies, expansion of their networks and/or network upgrades. Our\ninternational customers must make these decisions in the regulatory and political environment in which they operate – both nationally\nand in some instances, regionally – whether of a multi-country region or a more local region within a country. Consequently, while we\nexpect the global trend towards deployment of more robust broadband speeds and access to continue creating additional market\nopportunities for us, the factors described above may result in pressure on revenue and operating income. Our ADVA international\nrevenue is largely focused on the manufacture and selling of networking solutions that are based on three core areas of expertise: fiber-\noptic transmission technology (cloud interconnect), cloud access technology for rapid creation of innovative services around the network\nedge and solutions for precise timing and synchronization of networks. In addition, ADVA's international operations offers a\ncomprehensive portfolio of network design, implementation and maintenance services to assist operators in the deployment of market-\nleading networks while reducing their cost to maintain these networks.\nCost of Revenue\nAs a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue increased from 61.2% for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 68.1% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to acquisition related expenses, adjustments consisting of intangible\namortization of backlog, developed technology and fair value adjustments to inventory costs that flow through to cost of revenue as a\nresult of the Business Combination with ADVA, as well as supply chain constraint related expenses and to a lesser extent changes in\ncustomer and product mix and a regional revenue shift in our ADTRAN, Inc. operations. As our current inventory that was acquired in\nthe Business Combination with ADVA is sold, we expect that our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue will return to more\nnormalized levels. For the year ended December 31, 2022, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar decreased our cost\nof revenue by approximately $9.6 million.\nNetwork Solutions cost of revenue, as a percentage of that segment’s revenue, increased from 61.7% of revenue in 2021 to 70.6% of\nrevenue in 2022. The increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to acquisition related expenses,\namortizations and adjustments consisting of intangible amortization of backlog, developed technology and fair value adjustments to\ninventory costs that flow through to cost of revenue as a result of the Business Combination with ADVA, as well as supply chain\nconstraint related expenses and to a lesser extent changes in customer and product mix and a regional revenue shift in our ADTRAN,\nInc. operations.\nServices & Support cost of revenue, as a percentage of that segment’s revenue, decreased from 57.3% of revenue in 2021 to 47.1% of\nrevenue in 2022. The decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to customer mix and changes in\nServices & Support mix as a result of the Business Combination with ADVA.\nServices & Support revenue is comprised of network planning and implementation, maintenance, support and cloud-based management\nservices, with network planning and implementation being the largest and fastest growing component in the long-term. Compared to\nour other services, such as maintenance, support and cloud-based management services, our network planning and implementation\nservices typically utilize a higher percentage of internal and subcontracted engineers, professionals and contractors to perform the work\nfor customers. The additional costs incurred to perform these infrastructure and labor-intensive services inherently result in lower\naverage gross margins as compared to maintenance and support services. Within the Services & Support segment, we do expect\nvariability in gross margins from quarter-to-quarter based on the mix of the services recognized.\nFinancial Information 65\nGross Profit\nAs a percentage of revenue, gross profit decreased from 38.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 31.9% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to increases in cost of revenue related to acquisition related expenses,\nadjustments consisting of intangible amortization of backlog, developed technology and fair value adjustments to inventory costs that\nflow through to cost of revenue as a result of the Business Combination with ADVA, as well as supply chain constraint related expenses\nand to a lesser extent changes in customer and product mix and a regional revenue shift in our ADTRAN, Inc. operations partially offset\nby an increase in volume of sales activity due to the Business Combination with ADVA and an increase in volume of sales activity\nrelated to our ADTRAN, Inc. operations.\nAs a percentage of that segment's revenue, Network Solutions gross profit decreased from 38.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021\nto 29.4% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to increases in cost of revenue related to\nacquisition related expenses, adjustments consisting of intangible amortization of backlog, developed technology and fair value\nadjustments to inventory costs that flow through to cost of revenue as a result of the Business Combination with ADVA, as well as\nsupply chain constraint related expenses and to a lesser extent changes in customer and product mix and a regional revenue shift in our\nADTRAN, Inc. operations partially offset by an increase in volume of sales activity due to the Business Combination with ADVA and\nan increase in volume of sales activity related to our ADTRAN, Inc. operations.\nAs a percentage of that segment's revenue, Services & Support gross profit increased from 42.7% for the year ended December 31, 2021\nto 52.9% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in volume of sales activity due\nto the Business Combination with ADVA, an increase in volume of sales activity related to our ADTRAN, Inc. and a decrease in cost\nof revenue attributable to customer mix and changes in Services & Support mix as a result of the Business Combination with ADVA.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 22.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021\nto 20.4% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will generally\nfluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenue for the periods being compared as these costs are relatively fixed in the\nshort term.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by 67.9% from $124.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $208.9\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022. Selling, general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for management,\naccounting, information technology, human resources, sales and marketing, as well as independent auditor, tax and other professional\nfees, contract services and legal and litigation related costs. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily\nattributable to increased expenses related to the Business Combination with ADVA such as employee-related costs due to an increase\nin the number of employees, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and transactions costs. For\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S\ndollar decreased our selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $4.4 million.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 19.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 16.9%\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate whenever there\nare incremental product development activities or significant fluctuations in revenue for the periods being compared as these costs are\nrelatively fixed in the short term.\nResearch and development expenses increased by 59.9% from $108.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $173.8 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to increased\nexpenses related to the Business Combination with ADVA such as employee-related costs due to an increase in the number of employees\nand expenses related to our multi-year integration program, amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of property, plant and\nequipment. For the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, changes in foreign currencies\nrelative to the U.S. dollar decreased our research and development expenses by approximately $5.2 million.\nADVA has arrangements with governmental entities for the purposes of obtaining funding for research and development activities. The\nCompany classifies government grants received under these arrangements as a reduction to research and development expense incurred.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized $1.1 million as a reduction of research and development expense.\nWe expect to continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with our new and existing products. We continually\nevaluate new product opportunities and engage in significant research and product development efforts, which provides for new product\ndevelopment, enhancement of existing products and product cost reductions. We may incur significant research and development\nexpenses prior to the receipt of revenue from a major new product group.\n66 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nAsset Impairments\nIn connection with the planned integration of information technology following the Business Combination, we determined that certain\nprojects no longer fit our needs. As a result, the Company recognized impairment charges of $17.4 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, primarily attributable to capitalized implementation costs for a cloud computing arrangement. There were no asset\nimpairments recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nInterest and Dividend Income\nInterest and dividend income decreased by 25.4% from $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $2.1 million for the year\nended December 31, 2022. The decrease in interest and dividend income was primarily attributable to a decrease in the investment\nbalance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Our investments decreased from $71.0 million as of December 31, 2021 to\n$33.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and was primarily attributable to the sale of certain equity and fixed income investments for\nworking capital and other purposes.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased from less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $3.4 million for the year ended December\n31, 2022. The increase in interest expense was primarily related to an increase in assumed debt associated with the Business Combination\nwith ADVA and the new Wells Fargo Credit Agreement. See Note 13 and Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this report and “Financing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.\nNet Investment (Loss) Gain\nWe recognized a net investment gain of $1.8 million and a loss of $11.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022,\nrespectively. The fluctuations in our net investments were primarily attributable to changes in the fair value of our securities recognized\nduring the period. We expect that any future market volatility could result in continued fluctuations in our investment portfolio. See\n“Investing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” of this report and Note 1 and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net, increased from income of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to income of $14.5 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, other income (expense), net, is comprised\nprimarily of unrealized gains on foreign exchange contracts, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and income from excess\nmaterial sales. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of the report for additional\ninformation on foreign exchange contracts.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nOur effective tax rate changed from an expense of 37.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 to a benefit of 87.5% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The change in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022, was driven primarily by the release of\nthe majority of our valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of 2022, that was partially\noffset by increased international tax expense primarily as a result of our closing of the Business Combination with ADVA during the\nthird quarter of 2022. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for\nadditional information.\nNet (Loss) Income Attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc.\nAs a result of the above factors, our net loss attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. decreased from $8.6 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 to a net loss of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. As a percentage of revenue, net loss was 1.5%\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 and net loss was 0.2% for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nWe have historically financed, our ongoing business with existing cash, investments and cash flow from operations. In the current supply\nenvironment we also expect to utilize our credit arrangements to manage our working capital needs. We have used, and expect to\ncontinue to use, existing cash, investments, credit arrangements and cash generated from operations for working capital, business\nacquisitions, shareholder dividends and other general corporate purposes, including product development activities to enhance our\nexisting products and develop new products, expand our sales and marketing activities and fund capital expenditures. As of December\n31, 2022, the Company has incurred a total of $26.1 million of transaction costs related to the Business Combination. We will also be\nobligated to compensate any annual net loss of ADVA under the DPLTA. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the DPLTA, each\nADVA shareholder (other than the Company) has received an offer to elect either (1) to remain an ADVA shareholder and receive from\nus an Annual Recurring Compensation payment, or (2) to receive Exit Compensation. Assuming all of the minority holders of currently\noutstanding ADVA shares were to elect the second option, we would be obligated to make aggregate Exit Compensation payments of\nFinancial Information 67\napproximately EUR 310.6 million or approximately $333.2 million, based on an exchange rate as of December 31, 2022. Shareholders\nelecting the first option of Annual Recurring Compensation may later elect the second option. The opportunity for outside ADVA\nshareholders to tender ADVA shares in exchange for Exit Compensation expires on March 16, 2023 (subject to appraisal proceedings).\nOur obligation to pay Annual Recurring Compensation under the DPLTA would lead to a continuing payment obligation, which would\namount to approximately EUR 10.6 million or $11.4 million (based on the current exchange rate), per year assuming none of the minority\nADVA shareholders were to elect Exit Compensation. The foregoing amounts do not reflect any potential increase in payment\nobligations that we may have depending on the outcome of ongoing appraisal proceedings in Germany.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations and access to funds under the new Wells\nFargo credit facility (described below) will be adequate to meet our operating and capital needs and our obligations under the Business\nCombination and the DPLTA for at least the next 12 months.\nAs of December 31, 2022, cash on hand was $108.6 million and short-term investments were $0.3 million, which resulted in available\nshort-term liquidity of $108.9 million, of which $86.3 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2021, cash on\nhand was $56.6 million and short-term investments were $0.4 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $57.0 million,\nof which $47.7 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Generally, we intend to permanently reinvest funds held outside the U.S.,\nexcept to the extent that any of these funds can be repatriated without withholding tax. The decrease in short-term liquidity from\nDecember 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to the sale of certain equity and fixed income investments for\nworking capital and other purposes.\nIn addition to our cash and cash equivalents and the credit facility, we may fund a portion or all of the Exit Compensation through the\nsale of securities. There can be no assurances that we would be successful in effecting these actions on commercially reasonable terms\nor at all.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities of $44.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $47.2 million compared\nto $3.0 million of net cash provided during the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to net cash outflows\nfrom working capital, specifically, an inventory build related to component availability, an increase in accounts receivables and\ntransaction costs related to the Business Combination partially offset by an increase in the average number of days payable to our trade\nsuppliers. Additional details related to our working capital and its drivers are discussed below.\nNet accounts receivable increased 76.0% from $158.7 million as of December 31, 2021 to $279.4 million as of December 31, 2022.\nThere was an allowance for credit losses of less than $0.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and no allowance for credit losses as of\nDecember 31, 2021. The increase in net accounts receivable was due primarily to the increase in sales volume related to the Business\nCombination with ADVA and an increase in sales volume in our ADTRAN, Inc. operations. Quarterly accounts receivable DSO\ndecreased from 95 days as of December 31, 2021 to 72 days as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in DSO was due to customer and\ngeographical mix associated with the Business Combination with ADVA and timing of sales within the quarter.\nOther receivables increased 192.4% from $11.2 million as of December 31, 2021 to $32.8 million as of December 31, 2022. The increase\nin other receivables was primarily attributable to an increase in prepaid taxes associated with Business Combination with ADVA and\ncontract assets partially offset by a decrease in our receivables for sales of raw materials and reclaimed duty drawbacks.\nAnnual inventory turnover decreased from 2.60 turns as of December 31, 2021 to 2.46 turns as of December 31, 2022. Inventory\nincreased 205.6% from $139.9 million as of December 31, 2021 to $427.5 million as of December 31, 2022. The increase in inventory\nwas due to Business Combination with ADVA and strategic inventory buffer purchases given extended component lead times and\navailability constraints as well as new product ramp ups to ensure supply continuity. We expect inventory levels to fluctuate as we\nattempt to maintain sufficient inventory in response to supply chain uncertainties.\nAccounts payable increased 131.9% from $102.5 million as of December 31, 2021 to $237.7 million as of December 31, 2022. The\nincrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the increase in volume of operating costs associated with the Business Combination\nwith ADVA, additional purchases of raw material inventory and extended payment terms. Accounts payable will fluctuate due to\nvariations in the timing of the receipt of inventory, supplies and services and our subsequent payments for these purchases.\nInvesting Activities\nCapital expenditures totaled approximately $17.1 million and $5.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. These expenditures were primarily used to purchase manufacturing and test equipment, software, computer hardware and\nbuilding improvements.\nOur combined short-term and long-term investments decreased $38.0 million from $71.0 million as of December 31, 2021 to $33.0\nmillion as of December 31, 2022. This decrease reflects the impact of the sale of portions of our equity and fixed income investments\nand the net unrealized and realized gains and losses on our investments.\nWe typically invest all available cash not required for immediate use in operations, primarily in securities that we believe bear minimal\nrisk of loss. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\n68 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nAs of December 31, 2022, our corporate bonds, municipal bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency bonds, U.S. government bonds\nand other government bonds were classified as available-for-sale and had a combined duration of 1.74 years with an average Standard\n& Poor’s credit rating of AA-. Because our investment portfolio has a high-quality rating and contractual maturities of short duration,\nwe are able to obtain prices for these bonds derived from observable market inputs, or for similar securities traded in an active market,\non a daily basis.\nOur long-term investments decreased 53.7% from $70.6 million as of December 31, 2021 to $32.7 million as of December 31, 2022.\nOur investments include various marketable equity securities classified as long-term investments with a fair market value of $0.8 million\nand $12.6 million, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Long-term investments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 also\nincluded $22.9 million and $26.9 million, respectively, related to our deferred compensation plan.\nFinancing Activities\nDividends\nDuring 2022 and 2021, we paid shareholder dividends totaling $22.9 million and $17.5 million, respectively. The continued payment of\ndividends is at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and is subject to general business conditions and ongoing financial\nresults of the Company. The following table shows dividends per common share paid to our shareholders in each quarter of 2022 and\n2021:\nDividends per Common Share\n2022 2021\nFirst Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nSecond Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nThird Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nFourth Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nOn February 20, 2023, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common\nshare to be paid to the Company’s stockholders of record at the close of business on March 7, 2023. The dividends will be paid on March\n21, 2023 in the aggregate amount of approximately $7.0 million.\nStock Repurchase Program\nThere were no stock repurchases during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and there currently is no authorized stock\nrepurchase plan.\nStock Option Exercises\nTo accommodate employee stock option exercises, the Company issued 0.5 million and 0.4 million shares of common stock and treasury\nstock which resulted in proceeds of $6.9 million and $6.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAdditionally, to accommodate ADVA Optical Networking SE stock option exercises, ADVA Optical Networking SE issued 0.1 million\nof ADVA Optical Networking SE common stock which resulted in proceeds of $0.8 million, during the period July 15, 2022 to\nDecember 31, 2022. ADVA Optical Networking SE stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2022 totaled 81 thousand\n(representing less than 0.2% of ADVA's outstanding shares), of which 27 thousand were exercisable.\nEmployee Pension Plan\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries. Pension benefit plan obligations are based\non various assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, compensation rate\nincreases, expected return on plan assets, retirement rates and mortality rates. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes\nin assumptions could affect future expenses and obligations.\nIn connection with the Business Combination, we acquired $29.6 million of additional obligations and $22.3 million of assets related to\npostemployment benefit plans for certain groups of employees at our new operations outside of the U.S. Plans vary depending on the\nlegal, economic, and tax environments of the respective country. For defined benefit plans, accruals for pensions and similar\ncommitments have been included in the results for this year. The new defined benefit plans are for employees in Switzerland, Italy,\nIsrael and India:\n In Switzerland, there are two defined benefit pension plans. Both plans provide benefits in the event of retirement, death or\ndisability. The plan's benefits are based on age, years of service, salary and on a participants old age account. The plans are\nfinanced by contributions paid by the participants and by the Company.\n In Italy, the post-employment benefit plan is required due to statutory provisions. The plan is financed directly by the\nCompany on a pay-as-you-go basis. Employees receive their pension payments as a function of salary, inflation and a\nnotional account.\n In Israel, there is a defined benefit plan that provides benefits in the event of a participant being dismissed involuntarily,\nretirement or death. The plan's benefits are based on the higher of the severance benefit required by law or the cash surrender\nFinancial Information 69\nvalue of the severance benefit component of any qualifying insurance policy or long-term employee benefit fund that is\nregistered in the participants name. The plan is financed by contributions paid by the Company.\n In India, the post-employment benefit plan is required due to statutory provisions. The plan is financed directly by the\nCompany on a pay-as-you-go basis.\nOur defined benefit plan assets consist of a balanced portfolio of equity funds, bond funds, emerging market funds, real estate funds and\nbalanced funds. Our investment policy includes various guidelines and procedures designed to ensure assets are invested in a manner\nnecessary to meet expected future benefits earned by participants and consider a broad range of economic conditions. The objectives of\nour investment policy are to maintain investment portfolios that diversify risk through prudent asset allocation parameters, achieve asset\nreturns that meet or exceed the plans’ actuarial assumptions and achieve asset returns that are competitive with like institutions\nemploying similar investment strategies. The investment policy is periodically reviewed by us and a designated third-party fiduciary for\ninvestment matters. At December 31, 2022, the estimated fair market value of our defined benefit pension plans' assets increased to\n$48.7 million from $32.7 million at December 31, 2021.\nThe defined benefit pension plan is accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the use of various assumptions, including an\nexpected rate of return on plan assets and a discount rate. The expected return on our German plan assets that is utilized in determining\nthe benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies,\nanticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among\nthe asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and\nhistorical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return. The discount rate has been derived from the\nreturns of high-quality, corporate bonds denominated in Euro currency with durations close to the duration of our pension obligations.\nThe projected benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was $59.3 million and $44.2 million as of December 31, 2022\nand 2021, respectively.\nThe components of net periodic pension cost, other than the service cost component, are included in other income (expense), net in the\nConsolidated Statements of (Loss) Income. The components of net periodic pension cost and amounts recognized in other\ncomprehensive (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were ($5.8) million and ($5.0) million, respectively.\nActuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. To the extent unamortized gains and losses\nexceed 10% of the higher of the market-related value of assets or the projected benefit obligation, the excess is amortized as a component\nof net periodic pension cost over the remaining service period of active participants. We estimate that less than $0.1 million will be\namortized from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income into net periodic pension cost in 2023 for the net actuarial loss. The net\nactuarial loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $1.1 million and $7.7 million,\nrespectively. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional\ninformation.\n70 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with\nunconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for\ncapital resources.\nCash Requirements\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s material short- and long-term cash requirements from known obligations pursuant to\ncertain contracts and commitments as of December 31, 2022, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations and payments\nare expected to be satisfied (but excluding payments that may be made pursuant to the DPLTA and currency hedging arrangements,\nwhich are discussed below).\n(In thousands) Total 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 After 2027\nWells Fargo credit agreement(1) $ 60,000 $ 60,000 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nNord/LB revolving line of credit(2) 16,091 16,091 — — — — —\nSyndicated credit agreement\nworking capital line of credit(3) 10,727 10,727 — — — — —\nDZ Bank revolving line of credit (4) 9,118 9,118 — — — — —\nSyndicated credit agreement note\npayable(5) 24,598 24,598 — — — — —\nPurchase obligations(6) 552,440 527,562 24,141 309 167 261 —\nOperating lease obligations(7) 34,976 8,992 8,076 6,740 3,825 2,865 4,478\nTotals $ 707,950 $ 657,088 $ 32,217 $ 7,049 $ 3,992 $ 3,126 $ 4,478\n(1) See description below.\n(2) See description below.\n(3) See description below.\n(4) See description below.\n(5) See description below.\n(6) We have purchase obligations related to open purchase orders to our contract manufacturers, ODMs, component suppliers, service partners and other vendors. The settlement of our purchase obligations\nwill occur at various dates beginning in 2023 and going through 2027. See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for more information.\n(7) We have operating leases for office space, automobiles and various other equipment in the U.S. and in certain international locations. Our operating leases had remaining lease terms ranging from one month\nto 119 months as of December 31, 2022.\nNew Wells Fargo Credit Agreement\nOn July 18, 2022, ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. and ADTRAN, Inc., as the borrower, entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of\nbanks, including Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (“Administrative Agent”), and the other lenders\nnamed therein (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement allows for borrowings of up to $100 million in aggregate principal\namount, subject to being increased to up to $400 million in aggregate principal amount upon the Company or Borrower’s execution of\na DPLTA with ADVA or a parent of ADVA, among other conditions (the “Senior Credit Facilities Increase”). The DPLTA as executed\non December 1, 2022, became effective on January 16, 2023, as a result of its registration with the commercial register (Handelsregister)\nof the local court (Amtsgericht) at the registered seat of ADVA (Jena). See Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nfor further information.\nFinancial Information 71\nAs of December 31, 2022, ADTRAN, Inc.’s borrowings under the revolving line of credit were $60.0 million in tranches that mature\nduring the first quarter of 2023 and can either be repaid or borrowed again for a one month, three month or six month period. In addition,\nwe may issue up to $25 million in letters of credit against the first $100 million in our total facility. As of December 31, 2022, we had\na total of $21.3 million in letters of credit with ADTRAN, Inc. outstanding against our eligible borrowings, leaving a net amount of\n$18.7 million available for future borrowings. Upon the DPLTA becoming effective on January 16, 2023, the available total borrowings\nunder the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement increased from $100 million to $400 million. On January 31, 2023, the Company increased its\nborrowings under the Credit Agreement from $60.0 million to $187.5 million. In February 2023, the borrowings under the Credit\nAgreement were paid down by $7.5 million, leaving $180.0 million of borrowings as of February 28, 2023. After considering our\noutstanding letters of credit, this leaves the Company approximately $198.7 million available for future borrowings as of February 28,\n2023. The Company used approximately $51.4 million of the proceeds from the borrowings under the Credit Agreement to retire the\noutstanding borrowings under ADVA's syndicated credit agreement note payable, syndicated credit agreement working capital line of\ncredit and the Nord/LB revolving line of credit. ADVA's $9.1 million of borrowings under its revolving line of credit with DZ Bank\nremain outstanding. Any future credit extensions under the Credit Agreement are subject to customary conditions precedent. The\nproceeds of any loans are expected to be used for general corporate purposes and to pay a portion of the Exchange Offer consideration.\nAll U.S. borrowings under the Credit Agreement (other than swingline loans, which will bear interest at the Base Rate (as defined\nbelow)) will bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a rate per annum equal to (A)(i) the highest of (a) the federal funds rate (i.e., for\nany day, the rate per annum equal to the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions with members of the\nFederal Reserve System, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the business day next succeeding such day) plus ½\nof 1%, (b) the prime commercial lending rate of the Administrative Agent, as established from time to time at its principal U.S. office\n(which such rate is an index or base rate and will not necessarily be its lowest or best rate charged to its customers or other banks), and\n(c) the daily Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for a one-month tenor plus 1%, plus (ii) the applicable rate,\nranging from 0.5% to 1.25% (the “Base Rate”), or (B) the sum of the Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus\nthe applicable rate, ranging from 1.4% to 2.15%, provided that such sum is subject to a 0.0% floor (such loans utilizing this interest rate,\n“SOFR Loans”). All EU borrowings under the Credit Agreement (other than swingline loans) will bear interest at a rate per annum equal\nto the sum of the Euro Interbank Offered Rate as administered by the European Money Markets Institute (or a comparable or successor\nadministrator approved by the Administrative Agent) plus the applicable rate, ranging from 1.5% to 2.25%, provided that such sum is\nsubject to a 0.0% floor (such loans utilizing this interest rate, “EURIBOR Loans”). The applicable rate is based on the consolidated net\nleverage ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries as determined pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. Default interest is 2.00%\nper annum in excess of the rate otherwise applicable in the case of any overdue principal or any other overdue amount.\nIn addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee\nto the lenders under the Credit Agreement in respect of unutilized revolving loan commitments and an additional commitment ticking\nfee at a rate of 0.25% on the commitment amounts of each lender until the earliest of (i) the date of the Senior Credit Facilities Increase,\n(ii) the Company’s voluntary termination of the credit facility commitment, and (iii) December 31, 2023. The Company is also required\nto pay a participation fee to the Administrative Agent for the account of each lender with respect to the Company’s participations in\nletters of credit at the then applicable rate for SOFR Loans.\nThe Credit Agreement permits the Company to prepay any or all of the outstanding loans or to reduce the commitments under the Credit\nAgreement without incurring premiums or penalties (except breakage costs with respect to SOFR Loans and EURIBOR Loans). The\nCredit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including incurrence covenants and certain other limitations\non the ability of the Company and the Company’s subsidiaries to incur additional debt, guarantee other obligations, grant liens on assets,\nmake investments, dispose of assets, pay dividends or other payments on capital stock, make restricted payments, engage in mergers or\nconsolidations, engage in transactions with affiliates, modify its organizational documents, and enter into certain restrictive agreements.\nIt also contains customary events of default (subject to customary cure periods and materiality thresholds). Furthermore, the Credit\nAgreement requires that the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries tested on the last day of each fiscal quarter not exceed 3.25 to 1.0 through September 30, 2024 and 2.75 to 1.00 from\nDecember 31, 2024 and thereafter, subject to certain exceptions. The Credit Agreement also requires that the Consolidated Interest\nCoverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Company and its subsidiaries tested on the last day of each fiscal quarter\nnot fall below 3.00 to 1.00. The Credit Agreement matures in July 2027 but provides the Company with an option to request extensions\nsubject to customary conditions.\nFinally, pursuant to a Collateral Agreement, dated as of July 18, 2022, among the Company, ADTRAN, Inc. and the Administrative\nAgent, ADTRAN, Inc.’s obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of ADTRAN, Inc. and the\nCompany. In addition, the Company has guaranteed ADTRAN, Inc.’s obligations under the Credit Agreement pursuant to a Guaranty\nAgreement, dated as of July 18, 2022, by ADTRAN, Inc. and the Company in favor of the Administrative Agent.\n72 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nNord/LB Revolving Line of Credit\nOn August 8, 2022, ADVA entered into a $16.1 million revolving line of credit with Norddeutsche Landesbark - Girozentrale (Nord/LB)\nthat bears interest of Euro Short Term Rate plus 1.4% and which matures in August 2023. During the term of the loan, ADVA is\nobligated to maintain an adjusted net debt to cover ratio that is equal to or less than 2.75. As of December 31, 2022, ADVA’s borrowings\nunder the revolving line of credit were $16.1 million. On January 31, 2023, the Company increased its borrowings under the Wells\nFargo Credit Agreement. A portion of the proceeds from the borrowings were used to retire the outstanding borrowings under the\nNord/LB revolving line of credit.\nSyndicated Credit Agreement Working Capital Line of Credit\nIn September 2018, ADVA entered into a syndicated credit agreement with Bayerische Landesbank and Deutsche Bank AG Branch\nGerman Business to borrow up to $10.7 million as part of a working capital line of credit. The interest rate for the working capital line\nof credit is adjusted periodically based on a defined leverage ratio and is currently EURIBOR plus 1.35% as of December 31, 2022. The\nworking capital line of credit matures in September 2023. As of December 31, 2022, borrowings under the working capital line of credit\ntotaled $10.7 million. On January 31, 2023, the Company increased its borrowings under the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement. A portion\nof the proceeds from the borrowings were used to retire the outstanding borrowings under the syndicated credit agreement working\ncapital line of credit.\nDZ Bank Money Market Facility\nAs of December 31, 2022, ADVA’s borrowings under its revolving line of credit with DZ Bank totaled $9.1 million, with no amounts\navailable for future borrowings. The interest rate is currently a fixed rate of 2.85%, which resets monthly based on renewal of the loan.\nFinancial Information 73\nSyndicated Credit Agreement Note Payable\nIn September 2018, ADVA entered into a syndicated credit agreement with Bayerische Landesbank and Deutsche Bank AG Branch\nGerman Business to borrow $63.7 million. As of December 31, 2022, the amount outstanding under the note payable is $24.6 million.\nThe interest rate for the note payable is adjusted periodically based on a defined leverage ratio and is currently EURIBOR plus 1.35%\nas of December 31, 2022. The note payable matures in September 2023. On January 31, 2023, the Company increased its borrowings\nunder the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement. A portion of the proceeds from the borrowings were used to retire the outstanding borrowings\nunder the syndicated credit agreement note payable.\nCurrency Hedging Arrangements\nOn November 3, 2022, the Company entered into a Euro/U.S. dollar cross-currency swap arrangement (the “Swap”) with Wells Fargo\nBank, N.A. (the “Hedge Counterparty”). The Swap, which is governed by the provisions of an ISDA Master Agreement (including\nschedules thereto and transaction confirmations that supplement such agreement) entered into between the Company and the Hedge\nCounterparty, enable the Company to convert a portion of its Euro denominated payment obligations under the DPLTA into U.S. Dollars.\nUnder the Swap, the Company will exchange an aggregate notional amount of $160.0 million U.S. dollars for Euros at a daily fixed\nforward rate ranging from $0.98286 to $1.03290. The aggregate amount of $160.0 million will be divided into eight quarterly tranches\nof $20.0 million. The Company, at its sole discretion, may exchange all or part of each tranche on any given day within the applicable\nquarter; provided, however, that it must exchange the full tranche by the end of such quarter. The Swap may be accelerated or terminated\nearly for a number of reasons, including but not limited to (i) non-payment by the Company or the Hedge Counterparty, (ii) breach of\nrepresentation or warranty or covenant by either party or (iii) insolvency or bankruptcy of either party.\nADVA Domination and Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement\nOn December 1, 2022, we, as the controlling company, entered into the DPLTA with ADVA, as the controlled company (the “DPLTA”).\nThe DPLTA, which was executed on December 1, 2022, became effective on January 16, 2023, as a result of its registration with the\ncommercial register (Handelsregister) of the local court (Amtsgericht) at the registered seat of ADVA (Jena).\nUnder the DPLTA, subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law, (i) we are entitled to issue binding instructions to the\nmanagement board of ADVA, (ii) ADVA will transfer all of its annual profits to us, subject to, among other things, the creation or\ndissolution of certain reserves, and (iii) we will generally absorb all annual losses incurred by ADVA. The obligation of ADVA to\ntransfer its annual profit to us, as well as our obligation to absorb ADVA’s annual net loss, applies for the first time to the profits or\nlosses generated in the ADVA fiscal year 2023.\nAdditionally, and subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, the DPLTA provides\nthat ADVA shareholders (other than us) be offered, at their election, (i) to put their ADVA shares to the Company in exchange for a\ncompensation in cash of EUR 17.21 per share (the “Exit Compensation”), or (ii) to remain ADVA shareholders and receive a recurring\ncompensation in cash of EUR 0.59 (EUR 0.52 net under the current tax regime) per share for each full fiscal year of ADVA (the “Annual\nRecurring Compensation”). The Annual Recurring Compensation is due on the third banking day following the ordinary general\nshareholders’ meeting of ADVA for the respective preceding fiscal year (but in any event within eight months following expiration of\nthe fiscal year) and is first granted for the 2023 fiscal year, payable for the first time after the ordinary general shareholders’ meeting of\nADVA in 2024. The adequacy of both forms of compensation have been challenged by minority shareholders of ADVA via court-led\nappraisal proceedings under German law, and it is possible that the courts in such appraisal proceedings may adjudicate a higher Exit\nCompensation or Annual Recurring Compensation (in each case, including interest thereon) than agreed upon in the DPLTA. Our\naggregate potential payment obligations under the DPLTA are discussed above under \"Liquidity\".\nThe opportunity for outside ADVA shareholders to tender ADVA shares in exchange for Exit Compensation had been scheduled to\nexpire on March 16, 2023. However, due to the appraisal proceedings that have been initiated in accordance with applicable German\nlaw, this time period for tendering shares has been extended pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and will end\ntwo months after the date on which a final decision in such appraisal proceedings has been published in the Federal Gazette\n(Bundesanzeiger).\nWe currently hold 33,961,170 no-par value bearer shares of ADVA, representing 65.30% of ADVA’s outstanding shares as of February\n14, 2023.\nThe foregoing description of the DPLTA does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the DPLTA, a\nnon-binding English translation of which incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $14.2 million of transaction costs relating to the Business Combination. We\nexpect to incur integration costs and costs associated with the implementation of the DPLTA during 2023 and such costs are expected\nto be material.\n74 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nPerformance Bonds\nCertain contracts, customers and jurisdictions in which we do business require us to provide various guarantees of performance such as\nbid bonds, performance bonds and customs bonds. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had commitments related to these bonds\ntotaling $21.1 million and $22.9 million, respectively, which expire at various dates through April 2031. In general, we would only be\nliable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default under each contract; the probability of which we believe is remote.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that\nare highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the\naccounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the results of financial operations. Several accounting\npolicies, as described in Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report, require\nmaterial subjective or complex judgment and have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as applicable.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our\nConsolidated Financial Statements:\nRevenue\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a\ncustomer and as performance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied. Generally, this occurs with the transfer of control\nof a product to the customer. Review of contracts with customers, for both direct customers and distributors, are performed and assessed\nfor principal versus agent considerations to determine primary responsibility for delivery of performance obligation, presumed inventory\nrisk, and discretion in establishing pricing, when applicable. For transactions where there are multiple performance obligations,\nindividual products and services are accounted for separately if they are distinct (if a product or service is separately identifiable from\nother items and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer). The\nconsideration, including any discounts, is allocated between separate products and services based on their stand-alone selling prices.\nStand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the separate products and services are sold and are allocated\nbased on each item’s relative value to the total value of the products and services in the arrangement. For items that are not sold\nseparately, we estimate stand-alone selling prices primarily using the “expected cost plus a margin” approach. Payment terms are\ngenerally 30 days in the U.S. and typically longer in many geographic markets outside the U.S. Shipping fees are recorded as revenue\nand the related cost which we have elected to account for as a cost of fulfilling the related contract is included in cost of revenue.\nRevenue, value-added and other taxes collected concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Costs of\nobtaining a contract, if material, are capitalized and amortized over the period that the related revenue is recognized if greater than one\nyear. We have also elected to apply the practical expedient related to the incremental costs of obtaining contracts and recognize those\ncosts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets is one year or less. These costs are included in selling, general\nand administrative expenses. Capitalized costs with an amortization period greater than one year were immaterial.\nRevenue is generated by two reportable segments: Network Solutions and Services & Support.\nNetwork Solutions Segment - Includes hardware products and software defined next-generation virtualized solutions used in service\nprovider or business networks, as well as prior generation products. The majority of the revenue from this segment is from hardware\nrevenue.\nFinancial Information 75\nHardware and Software Revenue\nRevenue from hardware sales is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally when the products are\nshipped. Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point. Revenue from software license sales is recognized at delivery and transfer\nof control to the customer. Revenue is recorded net of estimated discounts and rebates using historical trends. Customers are typically\ninvoiced when control is transferred and revenue is recognized. Our products generally include assurance-based warranties of 90 days\nto five years for product defects, which are accrued at the time products are delivered.\nServices & Support Segment - Includes a complete portfolio of maintenance, network implementation and solutions integration and\nmanaged services, which include hosted cloud services and subscription services to complement our Network Solutions segment.\nMaintenance Revenue\nOur maintenance service periods range from one month to five years. Customers are typically invoiced and pay for maintenance services\nat the beginning of the maintenance period. We recognize revenue for maintenance services on a straight-line basis over the maintenance\nperiod as our customers benefit evenly throughout the contract term and deferred revenue, when applicable, is recorded in unearned\nrevenue and non-current unearned revenue. The total balance of our unearned revenue was $60.4 million and $27.0 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNetwork Implementation Revenue\nWe recognize revenue for network implementation, which primarily consists of engineering, execution and enablement services at a\npoint in time when each performance obligation is complete. If we have recognized revenue but have not billed the customer, the right\nto consideration is recognized as a contract asset that is included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The contract\nasset is transferred to accounts receivable when the completed performance obligation is invoiced to the customer.\nAccounts Receivable Factoring\nThe Company has entered into a factoring agreement to sell certain receivables to an unrelated third-party financial institution on a non-\nrecourse basis. These transactions are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 860,\nTransfers and Servicing, and result in a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreements transfer effective control over and risk\nrelated to the receivables to the buyers. Trade accounts receivables balances sold are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nand cash received is reflected as cash provided by (used in) operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Factoring\nrelated interest expense is recorded to interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income. On each sale date, the financial\ninstitution retains from the sale price a default reserve, up to a required balance, which is held by the financial institution in a reserve\naccount and pledged to the Company. The financial institution is entitled to withdraw from the reserve account the sale price of a\ndefaulted receivable. The balance in the reserve account is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInventory\nWe carry our inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost being determined using the first-in, first-out method.\nStandard costs for material, labor, and manufacturing overhead are used to value inventory and are updated at least quarterly. Most\nvariances are expensed in the current period; therefore, our inventory costs approximate actual costs at the end of each reporting period.\nWe establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the\nestimated net realizable value of the inventory based on estimated reserve percentages, which consider historical usage, known trends,\ninventory age and market conditions. If actual trends and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, we\nmay be required to make additional inventory write-downs. Our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $51.8 million and $44.6\nmillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Inventory disposals charged against the reserve were $2.9 million and $1.0 million\nfor the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\n76 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nStock-Based Compensation\nFor purposes of determining the estimated fair value of market-based PSU awards on the date of grant, the Monte Carlo Simulation\nvaluation method is used. These PSUs are subject to a market condition based on the relative total shareholder return of ADTRAN\nagainst all of the companies in the NASDAQ Telecommunications Index and vest at the end of a three-year performance period. The\nfair value of performance-based PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the business day\nimmediately preceding the grant date. Compensation expense related to unvested performance-based PSUs is recognized over the\nrequisite service period of two to three years as the achievement of the performance obligation becomes probable. For purposes of\ndetermining the estimated fair value of our stock option awards on the date of grant, we use the Black-Scholes Model. This model\nrequires the input of certain assumptions that require subjective judgment. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, expected\nstock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. Because our stock\noption awards have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the input assumptions\ncan materially affect the fair value estimate, the existing model may not provide a reliable, single measure of the fair value of our stock\noption awards. Management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of\nstock-based compensation. Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in\nchanges to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact our fair value determination. If factors change in future\nperiods, the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the non-vested portion of market-based PSUs, RSUs and\nrestricted stock was approximately $15.8 million.\nPursuant to the Business Combination, which closed on July 15, 2022, ADVA stock option holders were entitled to have their ADVA\nstock options assumed by ADTRAN Holdings (applying the exchange ratio in the Business Combination Agreement), thereafter\nrepresenting options to acquire stock of ADTRAN Holdings. The maximum number of shares of ADTRAN Holdings stock potentially\nissuable upon such assumption was 2.3 million shares. The period in which such options could be assumed ended July 22, 2022. A total\nof 2.1 million shares of ADTRAN Holdings stock are subject to assumed ADVA options. The determination of the fair value of stock\noptions assumed by ADTRAN Holdings was estimated using the Monte Carlo method and is affected by its stock price, as well as\nassumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables that may have a significant impact on the fair value estimate. The\nstock option pricing model requires the use of several assumptions that impact the fair value estimate. These variables include, but are\nnot limited to, the volatility of the Company's stock price and employee exercise behaviors. As of December 31, 2022, total unrecognized\ncompensation expense related to the non-vested portion of stock options was approximately $8.3 million.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. The carrying value of goodwill is tested for\nimpairment in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired. The quantitative\ngoodwill impairment test is performed at the level of the reporting unit. The identification of our reporting units begins at the operating\nsegment level and considers whether components one level below the operating segment levels should be identified as reporting units\nfor the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment. For goodwill impairment testing purposes, we determined the Company's reporting\nunits are generally the same as its operating segments, which are identified in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur general policy is to qualitatively assess the carrying value of goodwill each reporting period for events or changes in circumstances\nthat would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. In connection with the Business\nCombination with ADVA the Company recognized $350.5 million of goodwill upon the closing of the exchange offer on July 15, 2022.\nTherefore, we decided to proceed directly to the quantitative test of goodwill and forego the qualitative assessment. We estimate the fair\nvalue of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present\nvalue of estimated future cash flows. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about future\nsales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates, which are based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections,\nanticipated future cash flows and market participants. We also estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on a peer group\nanalysis, whereby companies in the telecommunications industry or with a comparable product and market structure are used to calculate\na fair enterprise value using revenue, EBITDA and debt multiples of trading value. Based on our analysis, management concluded that\nthere was no impairment of goodwill as of December 31, 2022. No goodwill impairment charges were recognized during the years\nended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The balance of our goodwill was $381.7 million and $7.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and\n2021, respectively.\nIntangible Assets\nPurchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded over the\nestimated useful lives of the respective assets.\nFinancial Information 77\nAs part of the purchase price allocation related to the Business Combination with ADVA, the Company recognized $403.8 million of\nintangible assets on July 15, 2022. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate\nimpairment may have occurred. The Company assessed impairment triggers related to intangible assets during the fourth quarter of\n2022, 2021 and 2020. As a result, no quantitative impairment test of long-lived assets was performed as of December 31, 2022, 2021\nand 2020, and no impairment losses of intangible assets were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The\nbalance of our intangible assets was $401.2 million and $19.3 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe estimate our income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including estimating exposures related\nto examinations by taxing authorities. We also make judgments regarding the realization of deferred tax assets and establish valuation\nallowances where we believe it is more likely than not that future taxable income in certain jurisdictions will be insufficient to realize\nthese deferred tax assets. Our estimates regarding future taxable income and income tax provision or benefit may vary due to changes\nin market conditions, changes in tax laws, or other factors. If our assumptions, and consequently our estimates, change in the future, the\nvaluation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased, impacting future income tax expense. We continually review\nthe adequacy of our valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that it is\nmore likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. During the fourth quarter\nof 2022, after considering all quantitative and qualitative evidence, including our cumulative income position, historical operating\nperformance and future income projections, we have determined that the positive evidence overcame the negative evidence and have\nconcluded that it is more likely than not that a substantial portion of our U.S. federal and certain other state deferred tax assets were\nrealizable. As a result we have released the majority of our valuation allowance against those assets. However, the amount of deferred\ntax assets considered realizable could be adjusted in future periods in the event that sufficient evidence is no longer present to support a\nconclusion that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our domestic deferred tax assets will be realized.\nWe establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions\nbecome uncertain. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, as facts and circumstances\nchange.\nLiability for Warranty\nOur products generally include warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the time of\nproduct shipment based on our historical return rate and an estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products. We engage\nin extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component\nsuppliers. Our products continue to become more complex in both size and functionality as many of our product offerings migrate from\nline card applications to total systems. The increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences, when they arise, to be\nmore costly. Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage, and other\nrework costs incurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if\nunforeseen problems arise. Should our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to\nrecord additional warranty expense. The liability for warranty obligations totaled $7.2 million and $5.4 million at December 31, 2022\nand 2021, respectively. These liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nPension Benefit Plan Obligations\nPension benefit plan obligations are based on various assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions\ninclude discount rates, compensation rate increases, expected return on plan assets, retirement rates and mortality rates. Actual results\nthat differ from the assumptions and changes in assumptions could affect future expenses and obligations. Our net pension liability\ntotaled $10.6 million and $11.4 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. This liability is included in pension\nliability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n78 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nLease Obligations\nWe have operating leases for office space, automobiles and various other equipment in the U.S. and in certain international locations.\nOther contracts, such as manufacturing agreements and service agreements, are reviewed to determine if they contain potential embedded\nleases. These other contracts are specifically reviewed to determine whether we have the right to substantially all of the economic benefit\nfrom the use of any specified assets or the right to direct the use of any specified assets, either of which would indicate the existence of\na lease. Some of our leases include options to renew. For those leases that are reasonably assured to be renewed, we have included the\noption to extend as part of our right of use asset and lease liability. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. The\ndepreciable life of leased assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12\nmonths or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nlease term. For lease agreements entered into or reassessed after the adoption of Topic 842, we elected to not separate lease and non-\nlease components. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company records assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, when applicable, and intangible assets recognized\nas part of business combinations based on their fair values on the date of acquisition subject to purchase accounting adjustments. The\nexcess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed or acquired is\nrecorded as goodwill. If the estimated fair values of net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceed the\npurchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recorded. The Company’s estimates of fair value are based on historical experience, industry\nknowledge, certain information obtained from the management of the acquired company and, in some cases, valuations performed by\nindependent third-party firms. The results of operations of acquired companies are included in the accompanying Consolidated\nStatements of (Loss) Income since their dates of acquisition. Costs incurred to complete the Business Combination, such as legal,\naccounting or other professional fees, are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in\nPart II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nFinancial Information 79\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The primary objective\nof the large majority of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time achieve appropriate yields without\nsignificantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, a majority of our marketable securities are investment grade, fixed-rate bonds\nand municipal money market instruments denominated in U.S. dollars. Our investment policy provides limitations for issuer\nconcentration, which limits, at the time of purchase, the concentration in any one issuer to 5% of the market value of our total investment\nportfolio.\nWe maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions. As of December 31, 2022, $100.1 million of our cash and cash\nequivalents, primarily certain domestic money market funds and foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government provided\ninsured depository limits. Although these depository investments exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the\ncredit-worthiness of these financial institutions and determined the risk of material financial loss due to exposure of such credit risk to\nbe minimal.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately $10.6 million of our cash and investments may be directly affected by changes in interest\nrates. As of December 31, 2022, we held $1.5 million of cash and variable-rate investments where a change in interest rates would\nimpact our interest income. A hypothetical 50 basis point decline in interest rates as of December 31, 2022, assuming all other variables\nremain constant, would reduce annualized interest income on our cash and investments by less than $0.1 million. In addition, we held\n$9.1 million of fixed-rate bonds whose fair values may be directly affected by a change in interest rates. A hypothetical 50 basis point\nincrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2022, assuming all other variables remain constant, would reduce the fair value of our\nfixed-rate bonds by approximately $0.1 million. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying amounts of our revolving credit agreements and\nnotes payable totaled $95.9 million and $24.6 million, respectively, where a change in interest rates would impact our interest expense.\nA hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2022, assuming all other variables remain constant, would\nincrease our interest expense by $0.6 million. The analyses cover our debt and investments. The analyses use actual or approximate\nmaturities for the debt and investments. The discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at December 31, 2022.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent that such changes affect our revenue and gross margin on\nrevenue derived from some international customers, expenses, and assets and liabilities held in non-functional currencies related to our\nforeign subsidiaries. Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements are with the Euro and the British pound\nsterling. Our revenue is primarily denominated in the respective functional currency of the subsidiary and paid in that subsidiary's\nfunctional currency or certain other local currency. The majority of our global supply chain predominately makes payments in U.S.\ndollars and some of our operating expenses are paid in certain local currencies (approximately 28.5% of total operating expense for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022, respectively). Therefore, our revenue, gross margins, operating expenses and operating income (loss)\nare all subject to foreign currency fluctuations. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates could cause variations in our operating\nincome (loss).\nWe have certain customers and suppliers who are invoiced or pay in a non-functional currency. Changes in the monetary exchange rates\nused to invoice such customers versus the functional currency of the entity billing such customers may adversely affect our results of\noperations and financial condition. To manage the volatility relating to these typical business exposures, we may enter into various\nderivative transactions, when appropriate. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. All\nnon-functional currencies billed would result in a combined hypothetical gain or loss of $8.0 million if the U.S. dollar weakened or\nstrengthened 10% against the billing currencies. All non-functional currencies invoiced by suppliers would result in a combined\nhypothetical gain or loss of $10.4 million if the U.S. dollar weakened or strengthened 10% against the billing currencies. This change\nrepresents an increase in the amount of hypothetical gain or loss compared to prior periods and is mainly due to an increase in U.S.\ndollar denominated billings in a non-U.S. dollar denominated subsidiary.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had certain material contracts subject to currency revaluation, including accounts receivable, accounts\npayable and lease liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2022, we had 47 forward contracts outstanding with\na fair value of $11.9 million. The objective of these foreign currency forward contracts is to reduce the impact of currency exchange\nrate movements on our operating results by offsetting gains and losses on the forward contracts with increases or decreases in foreign\ncurrency transactions. We do not use foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes. Hedging of our currency exposures\nmay not always be effective to protect us against currency exchange rate fluctuations. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nIn addition, on November 3, 2022, the Company entered into the Swap with the Hedge Counterparty, which enables the Company to\nconvert a portion of its Euro denominated payment obligations under the DPLTA into U.S. Dollars. Under the Swap, the Company will\nexchange an aggregate notional amount of $160.0 million U.S. dollars for Euros at a daily fixed forward rate ranging from $0.98286 to\n$1.03290. The aggregate amount of $160.0 million will be divided into eight quarterly tranches of $20.0 million.

We also have\naudited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control\n- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\nthe Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in\nour opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s\nReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We\nare a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required\nto be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits\nalso included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded ADVA Optical\nNetworking SE from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, because it was acquired by the\nCompany in a purchase business combination during 2022.We have also excluded ADVA Optical Networking SE from our audit of\ninternal control over financial reporting. ADVA Optical Networking SE is a subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded\nfrom management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 41.42% and 35.68%, respectively, of\nthe related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFinancial Information 83\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect\non the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements\nthat was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are\nmaterial to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole,\nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAcquisition of ADVA Optical Networking SE – Valuation of Developed Technology, Customer Relationships, and Backlog Intangible\nAssets\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of ADVA Optical Networking\nSE for total purchase consideration of $578.3 million on July 15, 2022. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at their\nrespective fair values as of July 15, 2022, which resulted in the recognition of $403.8 million of identifiable intangible assets. The fair\nvalue of the identifiable intangible assets acquired as of the acquisition date primarily consisted of developed technology of $291.9\nmillion, customer relationships of $32.7 million, and backlog of $52.2 million. In determining the fair value, management utilized\nvarious methods of the income approach depending on the asset. The estimation of fair value required significant judgment by\nmanagement related to net cash flows reflecting the risk inherent in each cash flow stream, competitive trends, market comparables and\nother factors. Inputs were generally determined by taking into account historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, and\ngrowth rates. Developed technology and customer relationships were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method. Backlog\nwas valued using the distributor method. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis for (i) developed technology\nwere the revenue growth rates, long-term revenue growth rate, discount rate, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and\namortization (EBITDA) margins, obsolescence factors, income tax rate, tax depreciation, and economic depreciation; (ii) customer\nrelationships were earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margins, contributory asset charges, and customer attrition rate; and (iii)\nbacklog were EBIT margins, adjusted EBIT margins, and contributory asset charges.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the developed technology,\ncustomer relationships, and backlog intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of ADVA Optical Networking SE is a critical audit\nmatter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates of the identifiable intangible assets\nacquired; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s\nsignificant assumptions related to the revenue growth rates, long-term revenue growth rate, discount rate, EBITDA margins,\nobsolescence factors, income tax rate, tax depreciation, and economic depreciation used in the valuation of the developed technology;\nEBIT margins, contributory asset charges, and customer attrition rate used in the valuation of the customer relationships; and EBIT\nmargins, adjusted EBIT margins, and contributory asset charges used in the valuation of the backlog; and (iii) the audit effort involved\nthe use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n84 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion\non the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition\naccounting, including controls over the valuation of the identifiable intangible assets acquired. These procedures also included, among\nothers (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimates of the developed\ntechnology, customer relationships, and backlog intangible assets; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings\nand distributor methods; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used by management in the valuation methods;\nand (v) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management related to the revenue growth rates, long-term\nrevenue growth rate, discount rate, EBITDA margins, obsolescence factors, income tax rate, tax depreciation, and economic depreciation\nused in the valuation of the developed technology; EBIT margins, contributory asset charges, and customer attrition rate used in the\nvaluation of the customer relationships; and EBIT margins, adjusted EBIT margins, and contributory asset charges used in the valuation\nof the backlog. Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions related to the revenue growth rates, long-term\nrevenue growth rate, EBITDA margins, obsolescence factors, income tax rate, tax depreciation, and economic depreciation related to\nthe developed technology; the EBIT margins, contributory asset charges, and customer attrition rate related to the customer relationships;\nand EBIT margins, adjusted EBIT margins, and contributory asset charges related to backlog involved considering (i) the past\nperformance of the acquired business; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions\nwere consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist\nin evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the valuation methods used and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate significant assumption.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nBirmingham, Alabama\nMarch 1, 2023\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1986.\nFinancial Information 85\nFinancial Statements\nADTRAN Holdings,

To service our customers and grow revenue, we are continually conducting research and developing new products\naddressing customer needs and testing those products for the specific requirements of the particular customers. We offer a broad portfolio\nof flexible software and hardware network solutions and services that enable service providers to meet today’s service demands, while\nenabling them to transition to the fully converged, scalable, highly-automated, cloud-controlled voice, data, internet and video network\nof the future. In addition to our global headquarters in Huntsville, Alabama, and our European headquarters in Munich, Germany, we\nhave sales and research and development facilities in strategic global locations.\nIn 2022, following the business combination (the “Business Combination”) with ADVA Optical Networking SE (“ADVA”), which\nincluded the Merger, we became the sole owner of and successor to ADTRAN, Inc. and the majority shareholder of ADVA. ADTRAN,\nInc. is a leading global provider of open, disaggregated networking and communications solutions that enable voice, data, video, and\ninternet communications across any network infrastructure. Its award-winning end-to-end fiber broadband solutions portfolio spans\nfrom OLTs to in-home services and intelligent SaaS solutions. ADVA is a global provider of open networking solutions with over 25\nyears of experience in optical networking, carrier Ethernet access and network synchronization. ADVA has led the industry for over\ntwo decades with open and secure networking solutions that carefully balance space, power and cost. Together, we serve customers in\na broad range of industries in over 100 countries.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted\nin the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, changes in equity and\ncash flows of ADTRAN and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in\nconsolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Significant estimates include allowance for\ncredit losses on accounts receivable and contract assets, excess and obsolete inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates,\ndetermination and accrual of the deferred revenue related to performance obligations under contracts with customers, estimated costs to\ncomplete obligations associated with deferred and accrued revenues and network installations, estimated income tax provision and\nincome tax contingencies, fair value of stock-based compensation, assessment of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment,\nestimated lives of intangible assets, estimates of intangible assets upon measurement, estimated pension liability and fair value of\ninvestments. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates.\nWe assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the\ninformation reasonably available to us and the unknown future impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus/COVID-19 global pandemic\n(or variants of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus), supply chain constraints, inflationary pressures, the energy crisis, currency fluctuations\nand political tensions as of December 31, 2022 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were\nnot limited to, the allowance for credit losses, stock-based compensation, carrying value of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived\nassets, financial assets, valuation allowances for tax assets, revenue recognition and costs of revenue. Future conditions related to the\nmagnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors, including supply chain constraints and inflationary\npressures could result in further impacts to the Company's consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\nCorrection of Immaterial Misstatements\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, it was determined that certain investments held in the Company’s stock for a deferred compensation\nplan accounted for as a Rabbi trust were incorrectly classified as long-term investments with the fair value of such investments\nincorrectly marked to market at each period end rather than classified as treasury stock held at historical cost. This plan has been in\nexistence since 2011. The Company corrected this misstatement as an out-of-period adjustment in the three months ended March 31,\n2020 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, by remeasuring the investment assets to their historical cost basis through the\nrecording of a net investment gain of $1.5 million in the Consolidated Statement of (Loss) Income and then correcting the classification\nby decreasing the long-term investment balance at its remeasured cost basis of $2.8 million to treasury stock in the Consolidated 2020\nFinancial Information 91\nBalance Sheet. Management has determined that this misstatement was not material to any of its previously issued financial statements\nand that correction of the misstatement was not material to the 2020 annual financial results on either a quantitative or qualitative basis.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents represent demand deposits, money market funds and short-term investments classified as available-for-sale\nwith original maturities of three months or less. We maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, $100.1 million of our cash and cash equivalents, primarily certain domestic money market funds and foreign\ndepository accounts, were in excess of government provided insured depository limits. Although these depository investments may\nexceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit worthiness of these applicable financial institutions and\ndetermined the risk of material financial loss due to the exposure of such credit risk to be minimal.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived\nfrom such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models may be applied. Assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the\ninputs used to measure their fair values.\nThe carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts\npayable approximate fair value due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.\nThe fair value measurements of our derivative instruments are determined using models that maximize the use of the observable market\ninputs including interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for currencies, and are classified as Level II under the fair value\nhierarchy. The fair values of our derivatives are included in Note 12.\nThe estimated fair value of our notes payable, approximates the carrying value and is classified as Level II under the fair value hierarchy.\nThe carrying value of our notes payable is included in Note 14.\nInvestments with contractual maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because\nsuch marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Despite the long-term nature of their\nstated contractual maturities, we routinely buy and sell these securities and we believe we have the ability to quickly sell them to the\nremarketing agent, tender agent or issuer at par value plus accrued interest in the event we decide to liquidate our investment in a\nparticular variable rate demand note. All income generated from these investments is recorded as interest income. We have not recorded\nany losses relating to variable rate demand notes.\nLong-term investments is comprised of deferred compensation plan assets, corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed\nbonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, U.S. and foreign government bonds, marketable equity securities and other equity investments.\nMarketable equity securities are reported at fair value as determined by the most recently traded price of the securities at the balance\nsheet date, although the securities may not be readily marketable due to the size of the available market. Any changes in fair value are\nrecognized in net investment (loss) gain. Realized gains and losses on sales of debt securities are computed under the specific\nidentification method and are included in other income (expense). See Note 6 for additional information.\nFor financing receivables, the Company does not measure the allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables, as the\nuncollectable accrued interest receivable is written off by reversing any previously recorded interest income in a timely manner (as soon\nas these amounts are determined to be uncollectable).\nAccounts Receivable\nWe record accounts receivable at amortized cost. Prior to establishing payment terms for a new customer, we evaluate the credit risk of\nthe customer. Credit limits and payment terms established for new customers are re-evaluated periodically based on customer collection\nexperience and other financial factors. As of December 31, 2022, single customers comprising more than 10% of our total accounts\nreceivable balance included three customers, which accounted for 33.1% of our total accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2022,\nthese three customers individually accounted for 11.4%, 11.1% and 10.6%, respectively, of our total accounts receivable. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, single customers comprising more than 10% of our total accounts receivable balance included three customers,\nwhich accounted for 59.9% of our total accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2021, these three customers individually accounted\nfor 35.8%, 12.1% and 12.0%, respectively, of our total accounts receivable.\nWe regularly review the need for an allowance for credit losses related to our outstanding accounts receivable balances using the\nhistorical loss-rate method as well as assessing asset-specific risks. The assessment of asset-specific risks included the evaluation of\nrelevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to current conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to\npay, such as the customer’s current financial condition or credit rating by geographic location, as provided by a third party and/or by\ncustomer, if needed, and overall macro-economic conditions in which the customer operates. Based on this assessment, an allowance\nfor credit losses would be recorded if the Company determined that, based on our historical write-offs, which have been immaterial, and\nsuch asset specific risks, there was risk in collectability of the full amount of any accounts receivable.\n92 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nAccounts Receivable Factoring\nThe Company has entered into a factoring agreement to sell certain receivables to an unrelated third-party financial institution on a non-\nrecourse basis. These transactions are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 860,\nTransfers and Servicing, and result in a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreements transfer effective control over and risk\nrelated to the receivables to the buyers. Trade accounts receivables balances sold are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nand cash received is reflected as cash provided by (used in) operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Factoring\nrelated interest expense is recorded to interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Loss. On each sale date, the financial institution\nretains from the sale price a default reserve, up to a required balance, which are held by the financial institution in a reserve account and\npledged to the Company. The financial institution is entitled to withdraw from the reserve account the sale price of a defaulted receivable.\nThe balance in the reserve account is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInventory\nInventory is carried at the lower of cost and estimated net realizable value, with cost being determined using the first-in, first-out method.\nStandard costs for material, labor and manufacturing overhead are used to value inventory and are updated at least quarterly. We establish\nreserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net\nrealizable value of the inventory based on estimated reserve percentages, which consider historical usage, known trends, inventory age\nand market conditions. When we dispose of excess and obsolete inventories, the related disposals are charged against the inventory\nreserve. See Note 7 for additional information.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment, which is stated at cost, is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of\nthe assets. We depreciate building and land improvements from five to 39 years, office machinery and equipment from three to seven\nyears, engineering machinery and equipment from three to seven years, and computer software from three to five years. Expenditures\nfor repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Major improvements that materially prolong the lives of the assets are\ncapitalized. Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are recorded in operating loss. See Note 8 for additional\ninformation.\nIntangible Assets\nPurchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded over the\nestimated useful lives of the respective assets. See Note 11 for additional information.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles\nLong-lived assets used in operations are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount of an asset may not be recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset are less than the\nasset’s carrying value. In connection with the planned integration of information technology following the Business Combination, we\ndetermined that certain projects no longer fit our needs. As a result the Company recognized impairment charges of $17.4 million during\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 related to capitalized implementation costs for a cloud computing arrangement. The impairment\ncharges were determined based on actual costs incurred. There were no impairment losses for long-lived assets during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, or for intangible assets recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020.\nFinancial Information 93\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. The carrying value of goodwill is tested for\nimpairment in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired. The quantitative\ngoodwill impairment test is performed at the level of the reporting unit. The identification of our reporting units begins at the operating\nsegment level and considers whether components one level below the operating segment levels should be identified as reporting units\nfor purpose of testing goodwill for impairment. For goodwill impairment testing purposes, the Company determined the Company's\nreporting units are generally the same as its operating segments, which are identified in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur general policy is to qualitatively assess the carrying value of goodwill each reporting period for events or changes in circumstances\nthat would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Related to the Business Combination\nwith ADVA the Company recognized $350.5 million of goodwill upon the merger on July 15, 2022. Therefore, we decided to proceed\ndirectly to the quantitative test of goodwill and forego the qualitative assessment. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based\non an income approach, whereby we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.\nA discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about future sales, operating margins, growth rates\nand discount rates, which are based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and market\nparticipants. We also estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on a peer group analysis, whereby companies in the\ntelecommunications industry or with a comparable product and market structure are used to calculate a fair enterprise value using\nrevenue, EBITDA and debt multiples of trading value. Based on our analysis, management concluded that there was no impairment of\ngoodwill as of December 31, 2022. No impairment charges on goodwill were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2021\nand 2020.\nOther Non-Current Assets\nImplementation costs incurred for hosting arrangements that are related to service contracts are capitalized and amortized over the term\nof the arrangement. Capitalized implementation costs totaled $6.2 million and $21.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively and are included in other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In connection with the planned integration\nof information technology following the Business Combination, we determined that certain projects no longer fit our needs. As a result\nthe Company recognized impairment charges of $16.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 related to capitalized\nimplementation costs for a cloud computing arrangement. The impairment charges were determined based on actual costs incurred.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, no impairment charges were recognized. We depreciate capitalized implementation\ncosts on a straight-line basis over ten years. Amortization expense was $3.9 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively, which is recorded almost entirely in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated\nStatements of (Loss) Income. No amortization expense was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nLiability for Warranty\nOur products generally include warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the time of\nproduct shipment based on our historical return rate and estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products. We engage in\nextensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers.\nThe increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences, when they arise, to be more costly. Our estimates regarding\nfuture warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage and other rework costs incurred in correcting a\nproduct failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise. Should our\nactual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to record additional warranty expense. Our\nliability for warranty returns totaled $7.2 million and $5.4 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nPension Benefit Plan Obligations\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries. Pension benefit plan obligations are based\non various assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, compensation rate\nincreases, expected return on plan assets, retirement rates and mortality rates. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes\nin assumptions could affect future expenses and obligations. Our net pension liability totaled $10.6 million and $11.4 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n94 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nLease Obligations\nWe have operating leases for office space, automobiles and various other equipment in the U.S. and in certain international locations.\nOther contracts, such as manufacturing agreements and service agreements, are reviewed to determine if they contain potential embedded\nleases. These other contracts are specifically reviewed to determine whether we have the right to substantially all of the economic benefit\nfrom the use of any specified assets or the right to direct the use of any specified assets, either of which would indicate the existence of\na lease. Some of our leases include options to renew, with renewal terms of up to five years. For those leases that are reasonably assured\nto be renewed, we have included the option to extend as part of our right of use asset and lease liability. The exercise of lease renewal\noptions is at our sole discretion. The depreciable life of leased assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term.\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and lease expense for these leases is recognized\non a straight-line basis over the lease term. For lease agreements entered into or reassessed after the adoption of Topic 842, we elected\nto not separate lease and non-lease components. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material\nrestrictive covenants.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have two stock incentive plans from which stock options, performance stock units (“PSUs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and\nrestricted stock are available for grant to employees and directors. Costs related to these awards are recognized over their vesting periods.\nStock-based compensation expense recognized for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $28.3 million,\n$7.5 million, and $6.8 million, respectively. See Note 5 for additional information.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs include compensation for engineers and support personnel, contracted services, depreciation and\nmaterial costs associated with new product development, enhancement of current products and product cost reductions. We continually\nevaluate new product opportunities and engage in intensive research for product and software development efforts. Research and\ndevelopment costs totaled $173.8 million, $108.7 million and $113.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\nADVA has arrangements with governmental entities for the purposes of obtaining funding for research and development activities. The\nCompany classifies government grants received under these arrangements as a reduction to research and development expense incurred.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized $1.1 million as a reduction of research and development expense.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this\napproach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are\nrecovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred\ntaxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from the difference between financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and are\nadjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when such changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax\nassets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.\nWe establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions\nbecome uncertain. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, as facts and circumstances\nchange.\nFinancial Information 95\nForeign Currency\nTransactions with customers that are denominated in foreign currencies are recorded using the appropriate exchange rates from\nthroughout the year. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the balance sheet dates using the closing\nrates of exchange between those foreign currencies and the functional currency with any transaction gains or losses reported in other\nincome (expense). Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements are with our German subsidiary, whose\nfunctional currency is the Euro and our Australian subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Australian dollar. Adjustments resulting\nfrom translating financial statements of international subsidiaries are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive\n(loss) income.\nRevenue\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a\ncustomer and as performance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied. Generally, this occurs with the transfer of control\nof a product to the customer. Review of contracts with customers, for both direct customers and distributors, are performed and\nassessment made regarding principal versus agent considerations to determine primary responsibility for delivery of performance\nobligation, presumed inventory risk, and discretion in establishing pricing, when applicable. For transactions where there are multiple\nperformance obligations, individual products and services are accounted for separately if they are distinct (if a product or service is\nseparately identifiable from other items and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available\nto the customer). The consideration, including any discounts, is allocated between separate products and services based on their stand-\nalone selling prices. Stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the separate products and services are sold\nand are allocated based on each item’s relative value to the total value of the products and services in the arrangement. For items that\nare not sold separately, we estimate stand-alone selling prices primarily using the “expected cost plus a margin” approach. Payment\nterms are generally 30 days in the U.S. and typically longer in many geographic markets outside the U.S. Shipping fees are recorded as\nrevenue and the related cost is included in cost of revenue. Revenue, value-added and other taxes collected concurrently with revenue-\nproducing activities are excluded from revenue. Costs of obtaining a contract, if material, are capitalized and amortized over the period\nthat the related revenue is recognized if greater than one year. We have elected to account for shipping fees as a cost of fulfilling the\nrelated contract. We have also elected to apply the practical expedient related to the incremental costs of obtaining contracts and\nrecognize those costs as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets is one year or less. These costs are included\nin selling, general and administrative expenses. Capitalized costs with an amortization period greater than one year were immaterial.\nRevenue is generated by two reportable segments: Network Solutions and Services & Support.\nNetwork Solutions Segment - Includes hardware products and software defined next-generation virtualized solutions used in service\nprovider or business networks, as well as prior generation products. The majority of the revenue from this segment is from hardware\nrevenue.\nHardware and Software Revenue\nRevenue from hardware sales is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally when the products are\nshipped. Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point. Revenue from software license sales is recognized at delivery and transfer\nof control to the customer. Revenue is recorded net of estimated discounts and rebates using historical trends. Customers are typically\ninvoiced when control is transferred and revenue is recognized. Our products generally include assurance-based warranties of 90 days\nto five years for product defects, which are accrued at the time products are delivered.\nServices & Support Segment - Includes a complete portfolio of maintenance, network implementation and solutions integration and\nmanaged services, which include hosted cloud services and subscription services to complement our Network Solutions segment.\nMaintenance Revenue\nOur maintenance service periods range from one month to five years. Customers are typically invoiced and pay for maintenance services\nat the beginning of the maintenance period. We recognize revenue for maintenance services on a straight-line basis over the maintenance\nperiod as our customers benefit evenly throughout the contract term and deferred revenue, when applicable, are recorded in current and\nnon-current unearned revenue.\n96 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nNetwork Implementation Revenue\nWe recognize revenue for network implementation, which primarily consists of engineering, execution and enablement services at a\npoint in time when each performance obligation is complete. If we have recognized revenue but have not billed the customer, the right\nto consideration is recognized as a contract asset that is included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The contract\nasset is transferred to accounts receivable when the completed performance obligation is invoiced to the customer.\nSee Notes 4 and 18 for additional information on reportable segments.\nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue primarily represents customer billings on maintenance service programs and unearned revenue related to multiple\nelement contracts where we still have contractual obligations to our customers. We currently offer maintenance contracts ranging from\none month to five years. Revenue attributable to maintenance contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over the related contract\nterm. In addition, we provide software maintenance and a variety of hardware maintenance services to customers under contracts with\nterms up to ten years. When we defer revenue related to multiple performance obligations where we still have contractual obligations,\nwe also defer the related costs. Current deferred costs are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the accompanying\nConsolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $1.5 million and $0.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Non-current\ndeferred costs are included in other non-current assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and less than $0.1 million as\nof December 31, 2022 and $0.1 million as of December 31, 2021.\n(Loss) Earnings per Share\n(Loss) earnings per common share and (loss) earnings per common share assuming dilution are based on the weighted average number\nof common shares and, when dilutive, common equivalent shares outstanding during the year. See Note 22 for additional information.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company records assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, when applicable, and intangible assets recognized\nas part of business combinations based on their fair values on the date of acquisition subject to purchase accounting adjustments. The\nexcess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed or acquired is\nrecorded as goodwill. If the estimated fair values of net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceed the\npurchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recorded. The Company’s estimates of fair value are based on historical experience, industry\nknowledge, certain information obtained from the management of the acquired company and, in some cases, valuations performed by\nindependent third-party firms. The results of operations of acquired companies are included in the accompanying Consolidated\nStatements of (Loss) Income since their dates of acquisition. Costs incurred to complete the Business Combination, such as legal,\naccounting or other professional fees are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred.\nNon-Controlling Interest\nNon-controlling interest represents the equity interest in ADVA held by holders other than the Company. On July 15, 2022, upon the\nclose of the Business Combination, the ADVA stockholders’ equity ownership percentage in ADVA was approximately 36%. The\nCompany has consolidated the financial position and results of operations of ADVA and reflected the proportionate interest held by the\nADVA stockholders as non-controlling interest in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022,\nthe ADVA stockholders’ equity ownership percentage in ADVA was approximately 34.7%.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nThere are currently no recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted which would have a material effect on the Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2021-08, Business\nCombinations (Topic 805) Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which would require\nan acquirer to recognize and measure acquired contract assets and contract liabilities in a manner consistent with how the acquiree\nrecognized and measured them in its pre-acquisition financial statements in accordance with Topic 606, Revenue Recognition. The\nCompany early adopted ASU 2021-08 on July 1, 2022 and the standard was applied retrospectively beginning with January 1, 2022.\nNote 2 – Business Combination Agreement\nADVA Optical Networking SE\nOn August 30, 2021, ADTRAN and ADVA, entered into a Business Combination Agreement, pursuant to which both companies agreed\nto combine their respective businesses and each become subsidiaries of a new holding company, ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. (formerly\nknown as Acorn HoldCo, Inc.) which was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ADTRAN in order to consummate the transactions\nunder the Business Combination Agreement. Under the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, on July 8, 2022, Acorn\nFinancial Information 97\nMergeCo, Inc, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the Company, merged with and into ADTRAN Holdings,\nInc. leaving ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. surviving the Business Combination as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the Company.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, on July 15, 2022, the Company made a public offer to exchange each\nissued and outstanding no-par value bearer share of ADVA for 0.8244 shares of Company Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share of\nthe Company. The Exchange Offer was settled on Exchange Offer Settlement Date, on which date the Company acquired 33,957,538\nbearer shares of ADVA, or 65.43% of ADVA’s outstanding bearer shares as of the Exchange Offer Settlement Date, in exchange for\nthe issuance of an aggregate of 27,994,595 shares of Company Common Stock. Additionally, pursuant to the Business Combination\nAgreement, ADVA stock option holders were entitled to have their ADVA stock options assumed by ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. (applying\nthe exchange ratio in the Business Combination Agreement), thereafter representing options to acquire stock of ADTRAN, Inc. The fair\nvalue of the ADVA stock options assumed by ADTRAN, Inc. was $12.8 million, estimated using the Monte Carlo method.\nADTRAN, Inc. and ADVA became subsidiaries of ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. as a result of the Business Combination. ADTRAN was\ndetermined to be the accounting acquirer of ADVA based on ADTRAN shareholders’ majority equity stake in the combined company,\nthe composition of the board of directors and senior management of the combined company, among other factors. The Business\nCombination of ADVA has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting as per the provisions of Accounting Standards\nCodification 805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”). The Business Combination Agreement used a fixed exchange ratio of\nCompany Common Stock for ADVA shares of common stock, which resulted in a 36% equity stake for ADVA stockholders and 64%\nequity stake for ADTRAN stockholders in the post-closing combined company (calculated on a fully diluted basis and utilizing the\ntender of 65.43% of ADVA’s current issued and outstanding share capital). Therefore, ADTRAN shareholders continue to hold a\nmajority interest in the combined company after the Business Combination was completed. Additionally, the Board of Directors is\ncomprised of six members from ADTRAN and three members from ADVA; the current ADTRAN chief executive officer acts as the\nchairman of the Board of Directors and the former ADVA chief executive officer as the vice chairman of the Board of Directors.\nAdditionally, the current ADTRAN chief executive officer and ADTRAN chief financial officer hold these positions within the\ncombined company. Based upon these and other considerations as outlined in ASC 805, ADTRAN represents the accounting acquirer.\nThe following table summarizes the purchase price for the ADVA business combination:\n(In thousands, except shares, share price and exchange ratio) Purchase Price\nADVA shares exchanged 33,957,538\nExchange ratio 0.8244\nADTRAN Holdings, Inc. shares issued 27,994,595\nADTRAN Holdings, Inc. share price on July 15, 2022 $ 20.20\nPurchase price paid for ADVA shares $ 565,491\nEquity compensation (1) $ 12,769\nTotal purchase price $ 578,260\n(1) Represents the portion of replacement share-based payment awards that relates to pre-combination vesting.\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at their respective fair values as of July 15, 2022. In determining the fair value,\nthe Company utilized various methods of the income, cost and market approaches depending on the asset or liability being fair valued.\nThe estimation of fair value required significant judgment related to future net cash flows reflecting the risk inherent in each cash flow\nstream, competitive trends, market comparables and other factors. Inputs were generally determined by taking into account historical\ndata, current and anticipated market conditions, and growth rates.\nDeveloped technology and customer relationships were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method. Backlog was valued\nusing the distributor method. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis for (i) developed technology were the\nrevenue growth rates, long-term revenue growth rate, discount rate, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\n(“EBITDA”) margins, obsolescence factors, income tax rate, tax depreciation, and economic depreciation; (ii) customer relationships\nwere earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”) margins, contributory asset charges, and customer attrition rate; and (iii) backlog were\nEBIT margins, adjusted EBIT margins, and contributory asset charges.\nThe allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was subject to adjustment within the measurement\nperiod (up to one year from the acquisition date). The measurement period adjustments since initial preliminary estimates resulted from\nchanges to the fair value estimates of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on finalizing the valuations of inventory, prepaid\nexpenses and other current assets, property plant and equipment, intangible assets, other non-current assets and deferred tax assets and\nliabilities. The cumulative effect of all measurement period adjustments resulted in a decrease to recognized goodwill of $8.7 million.\n98 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation for each major class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nin the acquisition of ADVA (in thousands):\n(In thousands)\nTotal purchase price $ 578,260\nNon-controlling interest $ 316,415\nNet Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 44,003\nAccounts receivable 114,659\nOther receivables 1,457\nInventory 200,331\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 28,208\nProperty plant and equipment 55,480\nDeferred tax assets 1,759\nIdentifiable intangible assets 403,780\nOther non-current assets 31,074\nAccounts payable (98,587)\nCurrent unearned revenue (26,047)\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities (59,600)\nIncome tax payable, net (4,898)\nCurrent portion of notes payable (25,254)\nTax liabilities (1,400)\nNon-current unearned revenue (11,498)\nPension liability (6,820)\nOther non-current liabilities (6,094)\nNon-current portion of revolving credit agreements and notes payable (15,250)\nNon-current lease obligations (20,046)\nDeferred tax liabilities (61,040)\nTotal net assets acquired $ 544,217\nGoodwill $ 350,458\nThe allocation of the purchase price and fair value assessment of goodwill, deferred tax assets, and deferred tax liabilities continues to\nbe preliminary. The acquisition accounting is subject to revision once the Company receives final information. It is possible that the\nfinal assessment of fair value may differ materially from the preliminary assessment. If the final assessment differs from this preliminary\nassessment, the measurement period adjustments will be recorded in the period in which they are determined as if they had been\ncompleted at the acquisition date.\nThe preliminary fair value of the assets acquired include accounts receivable of $114.7 million and other receivables of $1.5 million.\nThe unpaid principal balance under these receivables is $118.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The difference between the fair\nvalue and the unpaid principal balance primarily represents amounts expected to be uncollectible.\nThe fair value of the identifiable intangible assets acquired as of the acquisition date:\nEstimated-average useful\n(In thousands) life (in years) (1) Fair value Income Statement Amortization Classification\nDeveloped technology 8.5 $ 291,925 Cost of revenue - Network Solutions\nBacklog 1.4 52,165 Cost of revenue - Network Solutions and Services & Support\nCustomer relationships 10.5 32,704 Selling, general and administrative expenses\nTrade name 2.8 26,986 Selling, general and administrative expenses\nTotal $ 403,780\n(1) Determination of the weighted average period of the individual categories of intangible assets was based on the nature of the applicable\nintangible asset and the expected future cash flows to be derived from the intangible asset. Amortization of intangible assets with definite\nlives is recognized over the period of time the assets are expected to contribute to future cash flows.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Based on\npreliminary estimates, the ADVA acquisition resulted in the recognition of goodwill of $350.5 million, which the Company believes is\nattributable to the value driven by the Company’s expected growth of the business, synergies, and expanded market and product\nopportunities. Goodwill created as a result of the ADVA acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.\nAfter the Business Combination, the chief operating decision maker assessed and will continue to assess the Company’s performance\nand allocate resources to its two segments (1) Network Solutions and (2) Services & Support. Based on preliminary estimates, the\ngoodwill resulting from the Business Combination of $272.8 million was allocated to the Network Solutions segment, and $77.7 million\nwas allocated to the Services & Support segment. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this report\nfor more information about the Company’s segments.\nFinancial Information 99\nAs of the acquisition date, the fair value of the non-controlling interest was approximately $316.4 million and determined using a market\napproach. As a portion of ADVA shares will remain trading after the Business Combination, the non-controlling interest was calculated\nusing 17,941,496 ADVA shares held by non-controlling interest multiplied by the ADVA closing share price of €17.58 ($17.64 using\nthe July 15, 2022 EUR to USD conversion rate of $1.00318) on July 15, 2022.\nThe Company included the financial results of ADVA in its consolidated financial statements since July 15, 2022, the acquisition date.\nThe net revenue and net loss from the ADVA business since July 15, 2022, were $365.9 million and $12.9 million, respectively, which\nare included in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Loss. The net loss attributable to non-controlling interest from the ADVA\nbusiness for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $6.9 million.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has incurred $26.1 million of transaction costs related to the Business Combination, of which\n$14.2 million and $11.9 million were incurred during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These transaction\ncosts are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Loss.\nSupplemental Pro Forma Information (Unaudited)\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations for ADTRAN and\nADVA as though the Business Combination had occurred on January 1, 2021.

No additional awards will be granted under the Company’s previous stock incentive plans, the ADTRAN, Inc. 2015\nEmployee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2015 Employee Plan”) or the 2010 Directors Stock Plan (the “2010 Directors Plan”) subsequent\nto the stockholders’ approval of these new stock plans. Outstanding awards granted under the 2015 Employee Plan and the 2010\nDirectors Plan will remain subject to the terms of such plans, and shares underlying awards granted under such plans that are cancelled\nor forfeited will be available for issuance under the 2020 Employee Plan or the 2020 Directors Plan, as applicable.\n102 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nUnder the 2020 Employee Plan, the Company is authorized to issue 2.8 million shares of common stock to certain employees, key\nservice providers and advisors through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs and\nrestricted stock, any of which may be subject to performance-based conditions. RSUs and restricted stock granted under the 2020\nEmployee Plan will typically vest pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. Stock\noptions granted under the 2020 Employee Plan will typically become exercisable beginning after one year of continued employment,\nnormally pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and have a ten-year contractual\nterm. Stock options, RSUs and restricted stock granted under the 2020 Employee Plan reduce the shares authorized for issuance under\nthe 2020 Employee Plan by one share of common stock for each share underlying the award. Forfeitures, cancellations or expirations of\nawards granted under the 2015 Employee Plan increase the shares authorized for issuance under the 2020 Employee Plan, with\nforfeitures, cancellations or expirations of RSUs and restricted stock increasing the shares authorized for issuance by 2.5 shares of\ncommon stock for each share underlying the award. Forfeitures, cancellations or expirations of stock options from the 2015 Employee\nPlan increase the shares authorized for issuance under the 2020 Employee Plan by one share of common stock for each share underlying\nthe award.\nUnder the 2020 Directors Plan, the Company is authorized to issue 0.4 million shares of common stock through stock options, restricted\nstock and RSUs to non-employee directors. Stock awards issued under the 2020 Directors Plan typically will become vested in full on\nthe first anniversary of the grant date. Stock options issued under the 2020 Directors Plan will have a ten-year contractual term. Stock\noptions, restricted stock and RSUs granted under the 2020 Directors Plan reduce the shares authorized for issuance under the 2020\nDirectors Plan by one share of common stock for each share underlying the award. Forfeitures, cancellations and expirations of awards\ngranted under the 2010 Directors Stock Plan increase the shares authorized for issuance under the 2020 Directors Plan by one share of\ncommon stock for each share underlying the award.\nPrevious Stock Incentive Plans\nIn January 2015, the Board of Directors adopted the 2015 Employee Plan, which authorized 7.7 million shares of common stock for\nissuance to certain employees and officers through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock. The 2015 Employee Plan was adopted by stockholder approval at our annual meeting of stockholders\nheld in May 2015. PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock granted under the 2015 Plan reduce the shares authorized for issuance under the\n2015 Employee Plan by 2.5 shares of common stock for each share underlying the award. Options granted under the 2015 Employee\nPlan typically become exercisable beginning after one year of continued employment, normally pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule\nbeginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and have a ten-year contractual term. Expiration dates of options outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2022 under the 2015 Employee Plan range from 2025 to 2026.\nIn January 2006, the Board of Directors adopted the ADTRAN, Inc. 2006 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”), which\nauthorized 13.0 million shares of common stock for issuance to officers and certain employees through incentive stock options and non-\nqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs and restricted stock. Options granted under the 2006 Plan typically become\nexercisable beginning after one year of continued employment, normally pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning on the first\nanniversary of the grant date and had a ten-year contractual term. The 2006 Plan was replaced in May 2015 by the 2015 Employee Plan.\nExpiration dates of options outstanding as of December 31, 2022 under the 2006 Plan range from 2022 to 2024.\nIn May 2010, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2010 Directors Plan, under which 0.5 million shares of common stock have\nbeen reserved for issuance. This plan replaced the 2005 Directors Stock Option Plan. Under the 2010 Directors Plan, the Company may\nissue stock options, restricted stock and RSUs to our non-employee directors. Stock awards issued under the 2010 Directors Plan become\nvested in full on the first anniversary of the grant date. Options issued under the 2010 Directors Plan had a ten-year contractual term.\nAll remaining options under the 2010 Directors Plan expired in 2019.\nFinancial Information 103\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock - ADTRAN Holdings, Inc.\nThe following table is a summary of our PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 and the\nchanges that occurred during 2022:\nNumber of Weighted\nshares (In Average Grant\nthousands) Date Fair Value\nUnvested PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding, December 31, 2021 1,930 $ 14.11\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock granted 645 $ 20.56\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock vested (1,440) $ 12.81\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock forfeited (49) $ 14.22\nUnvested PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding, December 31, 2022 1,086 $ 17.54\nThe following table details the significant assumptions that impact the fair value estimate of the market-based PSUs:\n2022 2021 2020\nEstimated fair value per share $ 24.01 $ 26.07 $ 14.43\nExpected volatility 45.77% 53.27% 51.88%\nRisk-free interest rate 4.28% 0.85% 0.24%\nExpected dividend yield 1.76% 1.63% 2.85%\n104 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nFor market-based PSUs, the number of shares of common stock earned by a recipient is subject to a market condition based on\nADTRAN’s relative total shareholder return against all companies in the NASDAQ Telecommunications Index at the end of a three-\nyear performance period. Depending on the relative total shareholder return over the performance period, the recipient may earn from\n0% to 150% of the shares underlying the PSUs, with the shares earned distributed upon the vesting. The fair value of the award is based\non the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the expected outcome of the impact of market conditions\nusing a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method. A portion of the granted PSUs vests and the underlying shares become deliverable\nupon the death or disability of the recipient or upon a change of control of ADTRAN, as defined by the 2020 Employee Plan. The\nrecipients of the PSUs receive dividend credits based on the shares of common stock underlying the PSUs. The dividend credits vest\nand are earned in the same manner as the PSUs and are paid in cash upon the issuance of common stock for the PSUs.\nDuring each of the years ended December, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company granted 0.3 million performance-based PSUs to its\nexecutive officers and certain employees. The grant-date fair value of these performance-based awards was based on the closing price\nof the Company’s stock on the date of grant. These awards vest over one-year, two-year and three-year periods, respectively, subject to\nthe grantee’s continued employment, with the ability to earn shares in a range of 0% to 142.8% of the awarded number of PSUs based\non the achievement of defined performance targets. Equity-based compensation expense with respect to these awards may be adjusted\nover the vesting period to reflect the probability of achievement of performance targets defined in the award agreements. Pursuant to\nthe Business Combination, the unearned performance-based PSUs converted to time-based RSUs which were treated as an award\nmodification during the third quarter of 2022. This resulted in incremental compensation expense totaling $17.8 million being recognized\nduring the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. These awards were fully vested as of December 31, 2022.\nPursuant to the Business Combination, 0.3 million shares of market-based PSU awards converted to time-based RSU's awards which\nwere treated as an award modification during the third quarter of 2022. Given that the fair value of these awards after the modification\nwas less than the fair value of the awards immediately before the modification, no incremental compensation expense was recognized.\nThe Company continued to recognize compensation expense based on the award's original grant date fair value. As of December 31,\n2022, there was $1.4 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to these awards which will be recognized over the weighted\naverage remaining service period of 1.57 years.\nThe fair value of RSUs and restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the grant date. RSUs and restricted stock vest\nratably over four-year and one-year periods, respectively.\nWe will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation.\nIf circumstances change, and additional data becomes available over time, we may change our assumptions and methodologies, which\nmay materially impact our fair value determination.\nAs of December 31, 2022, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the non-vested portion of market-based PSUs, RSUs and\nrestricted stock was approximately $15.8 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of\n2.25 years and will be adjusted for actual forfeitures as they occur.\nAs of December 31, 2022, 3.3 million shares were available for issuance under shareholder-approved equity plans in connection with\nthe grant and exercise of stock options, PSU’s, RSU’s or restricted stock.\nStock Options - ADTRAN Holdings, Inc.\nThe following table is a summary of stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the changes that occurred during\n2022:\nWeighted\nNumber of Average Weighted Avg.\nOptions Exercise Remaining Aggregate\n(In Price Contractual Life Intrinsic Value\nthousands) (Per share) in Years (In thousands)\nStock options outstanding, December 31, 2021 1,721 $ 19.37 2.39 $ 6,669\nADVA stock options replaced by ADTRAN Holdings stock options(1) 2,094 $ 11.12\nStock options exercised (519) $ 15.70\nStock options forfeited (10) $ 10.28\nStock options expired (138) $ 22.73\nStock options outstanding, December 31, 2022 3,148 $ 14.37 3.42 $ 16,251\nStock options exercisable, December 31, 2022 1,711 $ 15.95 1.95 $ 7,104\n(1) Each ADVA stock option surrendered was exchanged for 0.8244 ADTRAN Holdings stock options.\nFinancial Information 105\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $8.3 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options which will be\nrecognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 2.4 years.\nPursuant to the Business Combination, which closed on July 15, 2022, ADVA stock option holders were entitled to have their ADVA\nstock options assumed by ADTRAN Holdings (applying the exchange ratio in the Business Combination Agreement), thereafter\nrepresenting options to acquire stock of ADTRAN Holdings. The maximum number of shares of ADTRAN Holdings stock potentially\nissuable upon such assumption was 2.3 million shares. The period in which such options could be assumed ended July 22, 2022. A total\nof 2.1 million shares of ADTRAN Holdings stock are subject to assumed ADVA options. The determination of the fair value of stock\noptions assumed by ADTRAN Holdings was estimated using the Monte Carlo method and is affected by its stock price, as well as\nassumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables that may have a significant impact on the fair value estimate.

Related to the Business Combination\nwith ADVA the Company recognized $350.5 million of goodwill upon the merger on July 15, 2022. Therefore, we decided to proceed\ndirectly to the quantitative test of goodwill and forego the qualitative assessment. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based\non an income approach, whereby we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.\nA discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about future sales, operating margins, growth rates\nand discount rates, which are based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and market\nparticipants. We also estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on a peer group analysis, whereby companies in the\ntelecommunications industry or with a comparable product and market structure are used to calculate a fair enterprise value using\nrevenue, EBITDA and debt multiples of trading value. Based on our analysis, management concluded that there was no impairment of\ngoodwill as of December 31, 2022.

Subsequently,\nthe Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) released its final GILTI regulations on July 9, 2020. The passage of the CARES Act and subsequent\nissuance of the GILTI final regulations together resulted in the Company’s recognition of a tax benefit in the amount of $10.8 million\nduring 2020, $7.9 million of which related to the utilization of deferred tax assets which had previously been offset with a valuation\nallowance and $2.9 million primarily related to the tax rate differential on carrying back losses from 2018 and 2019 tax years to prior\nyears in which the U.S. Corporate tax rate was 35% versus the current 21% federal tax rate.\nOn February 12, 2021, the Alabama Business Tax Competitiveness Act (the \"Act\") was signed into law. As a result of the Act, we\nrecognized an expense of $1.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021 related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets,\nwhich was offset by changes in our valuation allowance previously recorded against our domestic deferred tax assets.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2021, Management decided to pursue a claim for refund related to the revocation of our\nIRC Section 59(e) election that was made on our originally filed 2018 U.S. federal tax return. The Company filed a related carryback\nclaim of net operating losses generated in 2018 to prior years as allowed under the CARES Act that was passed in 2020. An IRS Section\n59(e) election is generally non-revocable except in cases for which IRS Commissioner’s approval is given. Approval is granted only in\nrare and unusual circumstances. We filed a private letter ruling (“PLR”) request to revoke our election. During the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2021, a response to our PLR was published denying our request to revoke the previously made 59(e). As a result of these\nfilings, and Management’s position to pursue them through appeals, we have established a receivable in the amount of $15.2 million\nand a deferred tax asset related to additional research and development credit carryforward in the amount of $1.8 million that would be\navailable if our revocation request is successful, offset with an uncertain tax liability of $17.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, non-current deferred taxes reflected deferred taxes on net unrealized gains and losses on available-\nfor-sale investments and deferred taxes on unrealized losses in our pension plan. The net change in non-current deferred taxes associated\nwith these items, which resulted in a deferred tax expense of $2.0 million and $1.6 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, was recorded\nas an adjustment to other comprehensive (loss) income, presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income.\nThe Company continually reviews the adequacy of its valuation allowance and recognizes the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the\nreassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recognized in accordance with ASC 740, Income\nTaxes. Our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets includes the evaluation of evidence, some of which requires\nsignificant judgment, including historical operating results, the evaluation of a three-year cumulative income position, future taxable\nincome projections and tax planning strategies. Should management’s conclusion change in the future and additional valuation\nallowance or a partial or full release of the valuation allowance become necessary, it could have a material effect on our consolidated\nfinancial statements. During the fourth quarter of 2022, after considering all quantitative and qualitative evidence, including our\ncumulative income position, historical operating performance and future income projections, we have determined that the positive\nevidence overcame the negative evidence and have concluded that it is more likely than not that a substantial portion of our U.S. federal\nand certain other state deferred tax assets were realizable. As a result we have released the majority of our valuation allowance against\nthose assets.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had gross deferred tax assets totaling $11.4 million offset by a valuation allowance\ntotaling $5.2 million and gross deferred tax assets totaling $59.6 million offset by a valuation allowance of $50.6 million, respectively.\nOf the current valuation allowance, $3.2 million was established against our domestic deferred tax assets and the remaining $2.0 million\nis related to foreign net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards where we lacked sufficient activity to realize\nthose deferred tax assets. The change in our valuation allowance for the year ending December 31, 2022 was a decrease of $45.4 million.\nThe change in the valuation allowance was primarily related to the previously mentioned release of the valuation allowance in the fourth\nquarter of 2022. The large increase during the year in our international deferred tax liabilities was primarily related to purchase price\naccounting, partially offset with acquired deferred tax assets as a result of the ADVA acquisition, that was completed in the third quarter\nof 2022.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2022\nDeferred Tax Assets\n(In thousands) Deferred Tax Assets (Liabilities) Valuation Allowance (Liabilities), net\nDomestic $ 61,726 $ (3,177) $ 58,549\nInternational (50,315) (2,024) (52,339)\nTotal $ 11,411 $ (5,201) $ 6,210\nDecember 31, 2021\n(In thousands) Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance Deferred Tax Assets, net\nDomestic $ 48,265 $ (48,265) $ —\nInternational 11,378 (2,299) 9,079\nTotal $ 59,643 $ (50,564) $ 9,079\nFinancial Information 119\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the deferred tax assets for foreign and domestic loss carry-forwards, research and development tax\ncredits, unamortized research and development costs and state credit carry-forwards totaled $104.5 million and $39.7 million,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2022, $21.8 million of these deferred tax assets will expire at various times between 2023 and 2038.\nThe remaining deferred tax assets will either amortize through 2038 or carryforward indefinitely.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, our cash and cash equivalents were $108.6 million and $56.6 million and short-term\ninvestments were $0.3 million and $0.4 million, which provided available short-term liquidity of $108.9 million and 57.0 million. Of\nthese amounts, our foreign subsidiaries held cash of $86.3 million and $47.7 million, respectively, representing approximately 79% and\n84% of available short-term liquidity, which is used to fund ongoing liquidity needs of these subsidiaries. As part of our restructuring\nplan, the Company’s assertion on being indefinitely reinvested changed in a particular jurisdiction in a previous year. The Company has\na withholding tax liability of $0.4 million and $0.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company maintains\nits assertion in all other jurisdictions that it is indefinitely reinvesting its funds held in foreign jurisdictions outside of the U.S., except\nto the extent any of these funds can be repatriated without withholding tax. However, if all of these funds were repatriated to the U.S.,\nor used for U.S. operations, certain amounts could be subject to tax. Due to the timing and circumstances of repatriation of such earnings,\nif any, it is not practicable to determine the amount of funds subject to unrecognized deferred tax liability.\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, no income tax benefit or expense was recorded for stock options exercised as an adjustment to equity.\nThe change in the unrecognized income tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2022 2021 2020\nBalance at beginning of period $ 17,836 $ 1,078 $ 1,487\nIncreases for tax position related to:\nPrior years — 17,025 4\nCurrent year 123 136 165\nDecreases for tax positions related to:\nPrior years (13 ) (27) —\nExpiration of applicable statute of limitations (61 ) (376) (578)\nBalance at end of period $ 17,885 $ 17,836 $ 1,078\nAs of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our total liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $17.9 million, $17.8 million and $1.1\nmillion, respectively, of which $17.9 million, $17.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively, would reduce our effective tax rate if we\nwere successful in upholding all of the uncertain positions and recognized the amounts recorded. We classify interest and penalties\nrecognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the balances\nof accrued interest and penalties were $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively.\nWe do not anticipate a single tax position generating a significant increase or decrease in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits\nwithin 12 months of this reporting date, unless a resolution is reached regarding the appeal of our PLR denial noted above. We file\nincome tax returns in the U.S. for federal and various state jurisdictions and several foreign jurisdictions. We are not currently under\naudit by the Internal Revenue Service. Generally, we are not subject to changes in income taxes by any taxing jurisdiction for the years\nprior to 2018.\nNote 16 – Employee Benefit Plans\nPension Benefit Plan\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries.\nIn connection with the Business Combination, we acquired $29.6 million of additional obligations and $22.3 million of assets related to\npostemployment benefit plans for certain groups of employees at our new operations outside of the U.S. Plans vary depending on the\nlegal, economic, and tax environments of the respective country. For defined benefit plans, accruals for pensions and similar\ncommitments have been included in the results for this year. The new defined benefit plans are for employees in Switzerland, Italy,\nIsrael and India:\n In Switzerland, there are two defined benefit pension plans. Both plans provide benefits in the event of retirement, death or\ndisability. The plan's benefits are based on age, years of service, salary and on a participants old age account. The plans are\nfinanced by contributions paid by the participants and by the Company.\n In Italy, the post-employment benefit plan is required due to statutory provisions. The plan is financed directly by the\nCompany on a pay as you go basis. Employees receive their pension payments as a function of salary, inflation and a\nnotional account.\n In Israel, there is a defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits in the event of a participant being dismissed\ninvoluntarily, retirement or death.

The expected return on our plans assets is utilized in determining the benefit\nobligation and net periodic benefit cost is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated\nfuture long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset\nclasses that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical\nreturns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return. The discount rate has been derived from the returns of\nhigh-quality, corporate bonds denominated in Euro currency with durations close to the duration of our pension obligations.\nThe weighted-average assumptions that were used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 2022,\n2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n2022 2021 2020\nDiscount rate 3.24% 1.16 % 1.00%\nRate of compensation increase 2.17% 2.00 % 2.00%\nExpected long-term rates of return 4.65% 5.90 % 5.90%\nThe weighted-average assumptions that were used to determine the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n2022 2021 2020\nDiscount rate 3.10% 1.16% 0.69%\nRate of compensation increase 2.17% 2.00% 2.00%\nActuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. To the extent unamortized gains and losses\nexceed 10% of the higher of the market-related value of assets or the projected benefit obligation, the excess is amortized as a component\nof net periodic pension cost over the remaining service period of active participants.\n122 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nThe Company anticipates making approximately $1.8 million in contributions to the pension plans in 2023\nThe following pension benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid to participants:\n(In thousands)\n2023 $ 2,377\n2024 2,303\n2025 3,331\n2026 3,092\n2027 3,710\n2028 - 2032 18,287\nTotal $ 33,100\nU.S. GAAP establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy based upon observable and unobservable inputs for fair value measurement of\nfinancial instruments:\n Level 1 – Observable outputs; values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market;\n Level 2 – Significant inputs that are observable; values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs\nthat are observable either directly or indirectly;\n Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs; values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both\nunobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.

The Savings Plan allows employees to save for retirement by\ncontributing part of their compensation to the plan on a tax-deferred basis. The Savings Plan also requires us to contribute a “safe harbor”\namount each year. We match up to 4% of employee contributions (100% of an employee’s first 3% of contributions and 50% of their\nnext 2% of contributions), beginning on the employee’s one-year anniversary date. In calculating our matching contribution,\ncompensation up to the statutory maximum under the Code is used ($305,000 for 2022). All matching contributions under the Savings\nPlan vest immediately.

Such Legal\nMatters, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Additionally, an\nunfavorable outcome in a legal matter, including in a patent dispute, could require the Company to pay damages, entitle claimants to\nother relief, such as royalties, or could prevent the Company from selling some of its products in certain jurisdictions. At this time, the\nCompany is unable to predict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with such legal matters.\nPerformance Bonds\nCertain contracts, customers and jurisdictions in which the Company do business require us to provide various guarantees of performance\nsuch as bid bonds, performance bonds and customs bonds. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had\ncommitments related to these bonds totaling $22.0 million and $22.9 million, respectively, which expire at various dates through April\n2031.

As of December 31, 2022,\npurchase commitments totaled $552.4 million.\nNote 21 – Current Expected Credit Losses\nUnder ASC 326 – Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, the Company estimates credit losses for the contractual life of assets that are\nmeasured at amortized cost and are within the scope of this guidance, which includes accounts receivable, net investment in sales-type\nleases, contract assets under the revenue recognition model and outstanding notes receivable. Where appropriate, the Company pools\nassets if similar risk characteristics exist. Additionally, the Company analyzes its available-for-sale debt securities for impairment and\nrecords a credit loss allowance as needed.\nAssets Measured at Amortized Cost\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company records accounts receivable in the normal course of business as products are shipped or services are performed and\ninvoiced, but payment has not yet been remitted by the customer. Accounts receivable balances are considered past due when payment\nhas not been received by the date indicated on the relevant invoice or based on agreed upon terms between the customer and the\nCompany.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s net outstanding accounts receivable balance was $279.4 million and $158.7 million,\nrespectively. The Company assessed the need for an allowance for credit losses related to its outstanding accounts receivable using the\nhistorical loss-rate method as well as assessing asset-specific risks. The Company’s historical losses related to accounts receivable have\nbeen immaterial as evidenced by its historical allowance and write-offs due to collectability. The assessment of asset-specific risks\nincluded the evaluation of relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to current conditions that may\naffect a customer’s ability to pay, such as the customer’s current financial condition, credit rating by geographic location, as provided\nby a third party and/or by customer, if needed, and the overall macro-economic conditions in which the customer operates. The Company\npooled assets by geographic location to determine if an allowance should be applied to its accounts receivable balance, assessing the\nspecific country risk rating and overall economics of that particular country. If elevated risk existed, or customer specific risk indicated\nthe accounts receivable balance was at risk, the Company further analyzed the need for an allowance related to specific accounts\nreceivable balances. Additionally, the Company determined that significant changes to customer country risk rating from period-to-\nperiod and from the end of the prior year to the end of the current quarter would require further review and analysis by the Company.\nCredit losses totaling less than $0.1 million were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022, related to accounts receivable. No\ncredit losses were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 related to accounts receivable. The Company's allowance\nfor credit losses related to accounts receivable was less than $0.1 as of December 31, 2022. The Company had no allowance for credit\nlosses related to accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021.\nContract Assets\nThe Company records contract assets when it has recognized revenue but has not yet billed the customer. As of December 31, 2022 and\n2021, the Company’s outstanding contract asset balance was $1.9 million and $0.5 million, respectively, which is included in other\nreceivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company assessed the need for an allowance for credit losses related to its\noutstanding contract assets using the historical loss-rate method as well as asset-specific risks. The Company’s historical losses related\nto contract assets receivable have been immaterial as evidenced by historical write-offs due to collectability. Asset-specific risk included\nthe evaluation of relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to current conditions that may affect a\ncustomer’s ability to pay once invoiced, such as the customer’s financial condition, credit rating by geographic location as provided by\na third party and/or by customer, if needed, and the overall macro-economic conditions in which the customer operates. The Company\npooled assets by geographic location to determine if an allowance should be applied to its contract asset balance, assessing the specific\ncountry risk rating and the overall economics of that particular country. If elevated risk existed, or customer specific risk indicated the\ncontract balance was at risk, the Company further analyzed the need for an allowance related to specific customer balances. Additionally,\nthe Company determined that significant changes to customer country risk rating from period-to-period and from the end of the prior\nyear to the end of the current quarter would be subject to further review and analysis by the Company.\nNo allowance for credit losses was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 related to contract assets.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022, 2021 or January 1, 2021.\nFinancial Information 131\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021 the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities totaled $9.3 million and $30.1 million, respectively.\nThese securities were analyzed at the individual investment level, by Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures\n(“CUSIP”), to limit credit losses, if applicable, to reflect only the amount by which the fair value of the security was less than its\namortized cost. The Company noted that, as of December 31, 2022 and, 2021, there was no intent to sell any of its available-for-sale\ndebt securities before maturity, and, therefore, the Company assessed the need for an allowance for each of its available-for-sale debt\nsecurities in which the fair value was less than its amortized cost as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Accrued interest receivable on\navailable-for-sale debt securities, which is included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022\nand 2021, which totaled less than $0.1 million and was excluded from the estimate of credit losses for both periods based on the\nCompany’s accounting policy election. Income generated from available-for-sale debt securities was recorded as interest and dividend\nincome in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income.\nThe Company had 99 positions in available-for-sale debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2022.\nSee Note 6 for additional information.\nFor those available-for-sale debt securities whose fair value was less than its amortized cost basis, the Company analyzed additional\ncriteria such as adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry or geographic area, failure of the issuer of the security\nto make scheduled interest or principal payments, if applicable, and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency to\ndetermine if a credit loss existed. The Company used information provided by its investment manager to determine if any scheduled\ninterest or principal payments had not been received and used a third party to determine if any changes to credit ratings had occurred.\nPrincipal and interest payments are considered past due when payment has not been received based on scheduled terms of each debt\nsecurity. The Company ceases to accrue interest on debt securities on a case by case basis. As of December 31, 2022, the Company\nnoted that all principal and interest payments had been received as scheduled and that there had been no changes in credit ratings year-\nover-year or period-over-period that warranted further review.\nNo allowance for credit losses was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 related to the Company’s available-for-\nsale debt securities.\nNote 22 – (Loss) Earnings per Share\nThe calculations of basic and diluted (loss) earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\n(In thousands, except for per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020\nNumerator\nNet (Loss) Income attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. $ (2,037 ) $ (8,635) $ 2,378\nDenominator\nWeighted average number of shares – basic 62,346 48,582 47,996\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock — — 292\nWeighted average number of shares – diluted 62,346 48,582 48,288\n(Loss) earnings per share attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. – basic $ (0.03 ) $ (0.18) $ 0.05\n(Loss) earnings per share attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. – diluted $ (0.03 ) $ (0.18) $ 0.05\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, less than 0.1 million, 0.1 million and 0.1 million shares of unvested or\nunearned, as applicable, PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted (loss) earnings per share due to\ntheir anti-dilutive effect.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, 0.2 million, 0.3 million and 3.6 million stock options, respectively, were\noutstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted (loss) earnings per share due to their exercise prices being greater than\nthe average market price of the common shares during the quarter, making them anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.\n132 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nNote 23 – Restructuring\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company initiated a multi-year integration program designed to optimize the assets, business\nprocesses, and information technology systems of the Company in relation to the Business Combination with ADVA. The integration\nprogram is expected to maximize cost synergies by realizing operation scale, combining sales channels, streamlining corporate and\ngeneral and administrative functions and combining sourcing and production costs.\nDuring the second half of 2019, the Company initiated a restructuring plan to realign its expense structure with the reduction in revenue\nexperienced in recent years and overall Company objectives. As part of this restructuring plan, the Company announced plans to reduce\nits overall operating expenses, both in the U.S. and internationally. This plan was completed and all amounts paid in 2021.\nIn February 2019, the Company announced the restructuring of a certain portion of its workforce predominantly in Germany, which\nincluded the closure of the Company’s office location in Munich, Germany accompanied by relocation or severance benefits for the\naffected employees.

The payment date will be March\n21, 2023 in the aggregate amount of approximately $7.0 million.\nEffectiveness of the Domination and Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement\nThe DPLTA between the Company, as the controlling company, and ADVA Optical Networking SE, as the controlled company as\nexecuted on December 1, 2022, became effective on January 16, 2023, as a result of its registration with the commercial register\n(Handelsregister) of the local court (Amtsgericht) at the registered seat of ADVA (Jena).\nUnder the DPLTA, subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, (i) the Company is\nentitled to issue binding instructions to the management board of ADVA, (ii) ADVA will transfer its annual profit to the Company,\nsubject to, among other things, the creation or dissolution of certain reserves, and (iii) the Company will generally absorb the annual net\nloss incurred by ADVA. The obligation of ADVA to transfer its annual profit to the Company applies for the first time to the profit\ngenerated in the ADVA fiscal year 2023. The obligation of the Company to absorb ADVA’s annual net loss applies for the first time to\nthe loss generated in the ADVA fiscal year 2023.\nExpansion of Wells Fargo Line of Credit & Payoff of ADVA Loans.\nUpon the DPLTA becoming effective on January 16, 2023, the available total borrowings under the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement\nincreased from $100 million to $400 million.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL\nDISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be\ndisclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the SEC, and\nthat such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief\nFinancial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because of the inherent limitations to the\neffectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide\nabsolute assurance that all control issues, if any, with a company have been prevented or detected on a timely basis. Even disclosure\ncontrols and procedures determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance that their objectives are achieved.\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out by management, including our Chief Executive Officer\nand our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-\n15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, which excluded the impact of the acquisition of a controlling\nequity stake in ADVA discussed below, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement of ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. ADTRAN’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. ADTRAN’s internal control\nover financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of\nthe assets of ADTRAN;\n provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of ADTRAN are being made only\nin accordance with authorizations of management and directors of ADTRAN; and\n provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of\nADTRAN’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of ADTRAN’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making\nthis assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(\"COSO\") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).\nAs permitted by SEC guidance, we currently exclude ADVA in our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting and related\ndisclosure controls and procedures for the first year after the Business Combination. See “Changes in Internal Control over Financial\nReporting” for additional discussion.\nBased on our assessment and those criteria, management has concluded that ADTRAN maintained effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2022.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Item 8.\nFinancial Information 135\nAuditor Attestation Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe attestation report of our registered public accounting firm on our internal control over financial reporting is included in Part II, Item\n8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this report.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nOn July 15, 2022, the Company acquired 33,957,538 bearer shares of ADVA, or 65.43% of ADVA’s outstanding bearer shares as of\nsuch date, as further described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2022,\nADVA’s assets represented approximately 41.4% of our consolidated assets. For the year ended December 31, 2022, ADVA’s revenues\nrepresented approximately 35.7% of our consolidated revenues and loss before income taxes represented approximately 43.8% of our\nconsolidated loss before income taxes. As permitted by SEC guidance, we currently exclude ADVA in our evaluation of internal control\nover financial reporting and related disclosure controls and procedures for the first year after the Business Combination. However, we\nare in the process of extending our oversight and monitoring processes that support our internal control over financial reporting and\ndisclosure controls and procedures to include ADVA’s operations. There were no other changes in the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.\n136 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nOn March 1, 2023, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company established an “Integration Bonus Plan”\nconsisting of a combination of performance-based performance stock units (“PSUs”) and cash bonus award amounts (together with the\nPSUs, the “Integration Awards”). Under the Integration Bonus Plan, certain key employees of the Company, including the Company’s\nnamed executive officers as disclosed in the most recent proxy statement filed by the Company with the SEC (the “Participants”), are\neligible to earn the Integration Awards over a performance period beginning upon the date of the grant, March 1, 2023, and ending on\nDecember 31, 2024 based on the achievement of cost savings targets related to the Business Combination during such period. The\nCompensation Committee chose the performance measure of “Company Synergy Achievement” in order to incentivize the Participants\nto drive cost savings and expected synergies following the closing of the Business Combination, and it approved a target level of\nsynergies against which the Company’s non-GAAP expenses will be measured. For purposes of measuring performance, the Company’s\nGAAP expenses will be adjusted for restructuring expenses; acquisition-related expenses, amortizations and adjustments; stock-based\ncompensation expense; amortization of actuarial pension losses and the impact of equity market changes on deferred compensation\nexpenses; non-operating income; and any other exclusions adopted by the Company.\nIf the Company Synergy Achievement over the performance period reaches the performance levels noted below, the Participants will\nbe entitled to a corresponding number of shares of the Company’s common stock under the PSUs:\n If Company Synergy Achievement is less than the threshold amount, the Participants will not earn any shares under the\nperformance-based PSUs.\n If Company Synergy Achievement is greater than or equal to the threshold amount but less than the target amount, the\nParticipants will earn shares under the performance-based PSUs equal to 33% of their base salary (as of the date of grant).\n If the Company Synergy Achievement is greater than or equal to the target amount, the Participants will earn shares under\nthe performance-based PSUs equal to 66% of their base salary.\nIf the threshold level of Company Synergy Achievement is reached, the Participants are also eligible to receive a cash award up to 66%\nof their base salary (as of the date of grant) based on the percentage of individual objectives related to cost savings achieved by each\nParticipant, as determined by the Compensation Committee. If the target level of Company Synergy Achievement is achieved and all of\nthe individual objectives are achieved, the Participants will earn a maximum amount under the Integration Bonus Plan equal to 132%\nof their base salary, as reflected below:\nValue of\nThreshold PSU Value of Target Target Cash Max Total Value of\nBase Salary (as of Award (33% of PSU Award (66% Award (66% of Integration Bonus\nNamed Executive Officer March 1, 2023) Base Salary) of Base Salary) Base Salary) Award\nThomas R.

Company\nSynergy Achievement will be compared to the Company’s projected cost savings due to the Business Combination over the\nPerformance Period (the “Synergy Budget Target”). If necessary, the Synergy Budget Target will be updated by the\nCompany’s Finance department during the Performance Period in the case of organizational changes, M&A activity, and\nother modifications to the organization and business. The final performance of the Company Synergy Achievement\ncompared to the Synergy Budget Target will be audited and approved by the Company’s Internal Audit department.\nCalculation of Earned PSUs\nThe Participant is eligible to earn a percentage of Base Salary (as defined below) in PSUs based on the chart below:\nCompany Synergy Achievement Earned PSUs as % of Base Salary\n[___] 0%\n[___] 33%\n[___] 66%\n“Base Salary” is determined as of the Date of Grant but may be adjusted for certain individuals with changing\nresponsibilities due to the Business Combination.\nNote that $[__] is considered the “threshold” level of Company Synergy Achievement, and such level must be achieved for\nany PSUs to be issued, and $[___] is considered the “target” level of Company Synergy Achievement. The number of PSUs\nissued will be based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock, as defined in Section 2.18(a) of the Plan, on the date\nthat the Compensation Committee certifies the level of Company Synergy Achievement.\nCalculation of Earned Cash Award\nIf the threshold level of Company Synergy Achievement is reached, the Participant is also eligible to earn between 0% and\n66% of base salary (as of the Date of Grant) based on the percentage of individual objectives related to cost savings achieved\nby the Participant, as determined by the Compensation Committee. For the sale of clarity, if the target level of Company\nSynergy Achievement is achieved and all the individual objectives are achieved, the Participant will earn the maximum\nIntegration Award equal to 132% of the Participant’s Base Salary.\nExample Calculations\nCompany Synergy Earned PSUs as % of Individual Objectives Earned Cash Award as %\nAchievement Base Salary Achievement of Base Salary\n$[___]M 0% 100% 0%\n$[___]M 33% 50% 33%\n$[___]M 33% 100% 66%\n$[___]M 66% 100% 66%\nFinancial Information 147\nExhibit 10.1(t)\nADTRAN HOLDINGS, INC.\n2020 EMPLOYEE STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN\nOriginally effective May 13, 2020\nAmended and Restated Effective July 8, 2022\n148 Adtran 2022 Annual Report\nADTRAN HOLDINGS, INC.\nAMENDED AND RESTATED\n2020 EMPLOYEE STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN\nARTICLE I\nPLAN INFORMATION\n1.1 Background. ADTRAN, Inc. (the “ADTRAN, Inc.”), predecessor to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc.\n(the “Company”), initially adopted this equity incentive plan for the benefit of its employees to replace certain\nPrior Plans; provided, however, that notwithstanding that replacement, the Prior Plans shall remain in effect with\nrespect to outstanding awards as long as the awards thereunder are outstanding. This plan was assumed by the\nCompany, as the successor to ADTRAN, Inc., at the closing of the Merger for the benefit of the Company’s\nemployees and was amended and restated effective July 8, 2022. This plan shall be known as the ADTRAN\nHoldings, Inc. 2020 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the “Plan”).\n1.2 General Purpose.

Restricted Stock Units are subject to\ntaxation when the underlying shares of Common Stock are issued to the Participant.\n1.5 Effective Date of the Plan.

The operation and administration of the Plan are\nsubject to the provisions of this Plan document. Capitalized terms used in the Plan are defined in Article II below\nor may be defined within the Plan.\n1.8 Legal Compliance.

We have omitted discussion of the earliest of the three years of financial condition\nand results of operations and this information can be found in Part I, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2019, which is available free of charge on the\nSEC’s website at sec.gov and on our website at www.adtran.com.\nOverview\nADTRAN is a leading global provider of networking and communications equipment, serving a diverse domestic\nand international customer base in multiple countries that includes Tier-1, -2 and -3 service providers, cable/\nMSOs and distributed enterprises. Our innovative solutions and services enable voice, data, video and internet\ncommunications across a variety of network infrastructures and are currently in use by millions worldwide. We\nsupport our customers through our direct global sales organization and our distribution networks. Our success\ndepends upon our ability to increase unit volume and market share through the introduction of new products\nand succeeding generations of products having lower selling prices and increased functionality as compared to\nboth the prior generation of a product and to the products of competitors. In order to service our customers and\ngrow revenue, we are constantly conducting research and development of new products addressing customer\nneeds and testing those products for the particular specifications of the particular customers. We are focused\non being a top global supplier of access infrastructure and related value-added solutions from the cloud edge\nto the subscriber edge. We offer a broad portfolio of flexible software and hardware network solutions and\nservices that enable service providers to meet today’s service demands, while enabling them to transition to\nthe fully-converged, scalable, highly-automated, cloud-controlled voice, data, internet and video network of the\nfuture. In addition to our corporate headquarters in Huntsville, Alabama, we have research and development\nfacilities in strategic global locations.\nAn important part of our strategy is to reduce the cost of each succeeding product generation and then lower\nthe product’s selling price based on the cost savings achieved in order to gain market share and/or improve\ngross margins. As a part of this strategy, we seek to be a high-quality, and in most instances the low-cost,\nprovider of products in our markets. Our success to date is attributable in large measure to our ability to\ndesign our products initially with a view to their subsequent redesign, allowing both increased functionality\nand reduced manufacturing costs in each succeeding product generation. This strategy enables us to sell\nsucceeding generations of products to existing customers, while increasing our market share by selling these\nenhanced products to new customers.\nWe ended the first half of 2019 with 20.6% year-over-year revenue growth and good geographical diversity\nwith 50.8% of our revenue coming from international markets. During the third quarter of 2019, we experienced\na slowdown in capital spending by a Tier-1 customer in Europe and an unforeseen pause in spending from a\nLATAM Tier-1 customer. While shipments to the LATAM customer resumed in the fourth quarter, these delays,\ncombined with seasonality, resulted in a softer than expected second half of the year. During 2019, we had\nthree 10% revenue customers geographically diversified with one each in the U.S., Europe and LATAM. Our\ndomestic revenue growth of 4.2% year-over-year was driven by an increase in sales to RSPs and additional\nfiber deployments across all customers. In addition, we saw an increase in sales to a Tier-1 customer with\ndiversified business among our fiber access and CPE, service provider CPE and services as well as sales\nto a Tier-2 customer. Our LATAM Tier-1 customer expanded their FTTx deployments in 2019 with ADTRAN\nsolutions. In Europe, a Tier-1 customer continued expansion of their vectoring and super-vectoring VDSL2\nsolutions. We also experienced increases in our service provider CPE business in 2019. Among our customers,\n14 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report\nwe made progress with our fiber and fiber-extension solutions, including Gfast and PON, while also continuing\nto engage various Services & Support opportunities that we expect will contribute in 2020 and beyond. In\naddition, we believe we are at the beginning of a significant investment cycle for fiber deployment driven\nby technology advancements, regulatory influences and vendor disruption. The transition to next-generation\nnetwork architectures is beginning, and we are seeing demand for our next-generation SD-Access solutions. In\nthe latter part of 2020, we anticipate that payments to service providers under government funding programs\nsuch as the FCC Rural Digital Opportunity Fund will begin and continue into 2021.\nWe made two acquisitions in 2018, strengthening our position in both the cable/MSOs and connected home\nmarkets. In the first quarter of 2018, we acquired Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s North American EPON\nbusiness and certain assets for North America and entered into a technology license and original equipment\nmanufacturer supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. These solutions, combined with our\norganic fiber access product portfolio and our distributed access expertise, present new opportunities in the\ncable/MSO market. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired U.S.-based SmartRG, an industry-leading\nprovider of carrier-class, connected-home software platforms and cloud services for broadband service\nproviders. With this acquisition, ADTRAN now offers a complete cloud-to-consumer portfolio of virtualized\nmanagement, data analytics, Wi-Fi-enabled residential gateways and software platforms.\nIn addition to classifying our operations into two reportable segments, we report revenue across three\ncategories of products and services – (1) Access & Aggregation, (2) Subscriber Solutions & Experience (formerly\nCustomer Devices) and (3) Traditional & Other Products.\nOur Access & Aggregation solutions are used by CSPs to connect their network infrastructure to subscribers.\nThis revenue category includes hardware- and software-based products and services that aggregate and/or\noriginate access technologies. ADTRAN solutions within this category include a wide array of modular or fixed\nplatforms designed to deliver the best technology and economy based on subscriber density and environmental\nconditions.\nOur Subscriber Solutions & Experience portfolio is used by service providers to terminate their infrastructure\nat the customers premises while providing an immersive and interactive experience for the subscriber. These\nsolutions include copper and fiber WAN termination, LAN switching, Wi-Fi access, and cloud software services,\nfor both residential and business markets.\nIn alignment with our increased focus on enhancing the customer experience for both business and consumer\nbroadband customers as well as the addition of SmartRG during 2018, what was previously known as our\nCustomer Devices category became our Subscriber Solutions & Experience category, as this more accurately\nrepresents this revenue category and our vision moving forward.\nOur Traditional & Other Products category generally includes a mix of prior-generation technologies’ products\nand services, as well as other products and services that do not fit within the other revenue categories.\nOur operating results have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, on a quarterly basis due to a number of\nfactors, including customer order activity and backlog. A substantial portion of our shipments in any fiscal period\nrelates to orders received and shipped within that fiscal period for customers under agreements containing\nnon-binding purchase commitments. Further, a significant percentage of orders require delivery within a few\ndays. These factors normally result in a varying order backlog and limited order flow visibility. Additionally,\nbacklog levels may vary because of seasonal trends, the timing of customer projects, and other factors that\naffect customer order lead times. Because many of our customers require prompt delivery of products, we are\nrequired to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand. If near-term demand\nfor our products declines, or if potential sales in any quarter do not occur as anticipated, our financial results\ncould be adversely affected. Operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term; therefore, a shortfall in\nquarterly revenues could significantly impact our financial results in a given quarter.\nOur operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors, including a decline in general\neconomic and market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate movements, increased competition, customer\norder patterns, changes in product and services mix, timing differences between price decreases and product\nFinancial Results 15\ncost reductions, product warranty returns, expediting costs, tariffs and announcements of new products by us or\nour competitors. Additionally, maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products\nincreases the amount of inventory that may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of\nthis inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. Also, not maintaining sufficient\ninventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products may cause us to incur expediting costs to meet\ncustomer delivery requirements, which may negatively impact our operating results in a given quarter. During\n2019, the Company implemented restructuring plans to realign its expense structure with the reduction in\nrevenue experienced in recent years and with overall Company objectives. Management assessed the efficiency\nof our operations and consolidated locations and personnel, among other things, and has implemented certain\ncost savings initiatives, where possible. We expect to see a reduction in our operating expenses, both in the\nU.S. and internationally, as a result of our implementation of these restructuring plans.\nOur historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results, and, in\ngeneral, management expects that our financial results may vary from period to period. See Note 19 of Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report, for additional information on\nquarterly results for 2018 and 2019. For a discussion of risks associated with our operating results, see Part I,\nItem 1A of this report.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents selected financial information derived from our Consolidated Statements of Income\n(Loss) expressed as a percentage of sales for the years indicated.

Our Services & Support sales increased $3.8 million compared to 2018 and our\nNetwork Solutions sales decreased $3.0 million versus the prior year. The increase in our 2019 sales was primarily\nattributable to an increase in Subscriber Solutions & Experience sales of $18.5 million, partially offset by decreases\nin Access & Aggregation sales of $10.0 million and Traditional & Other Products sales of $7.7 million.\nNetwork Solutions sales decreased by 0.7% from $458.2 million in 2018 to $455.2 million in 2019, due primarily\nto a decrease in sales of our Access & Aggregation products and Traditional & Other Products. The decrease\nin sales of 3.9% of our Access & Aggregation products for 2019 was primarily attributable to decreased FTTN\nproducts, offset by an increase in sales of Gfast DPUs. The increase of 12.1% in 2019 for sales of our Subscriber\nSolutions & Experience products was primarily attributable to increased residential CPE and fiber CPE sales,\npartially offset by a decrease in sales of SP Business CPE and WiFi access points and infrastructure. While\nwe expect that revenues from Traditional & Other Products will continue to decline over time, these revenues\nmay fluctuate and continue for years because of the time required for our customers to transition to newer\ntechnologies.\nServices & Support sales increased by 5.3% from $71.0 million in 2018 to $74.8 million in 2019. The increase\nin sales for 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in network installation and maintenance services for\nAccess & Aggregation products and Subscriber Solutions & Experience.\nDomestic sales increased 4.2% from $288.8 million in 2018 to $300.9 million in 2019. Our domestic growth\nwas driven by an increase in sales to the RSP market segment and additional fiber deployments across all\ncustomers. In addition, such growth was driven by an increase in sales to a Tier-1 customer with diversified\nbusiness among our fiber access and CPE, service provider CPE and services, as well as increased sales to a\nTier-2 customer.\nInternational sales, which are included in the amounts for the Network Solutions and Services & Support\nsegments amounts discussed above, decreased 4.7% from $240.4 million for the year ended December 31,\n2018 to $229.2 for the year ended December 31, 2019. International sales, as a percentage of total sales,\ndecreased from 45.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 43.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe decrease in international sales for 2019 was primarily attributable to the slowdown in shipments to two\ninternational Tier-1 customers.\nOur international revenue is largely focused on broadband infrastructure and is affected by the decisions of\nour customers as to timing for installation of new technologies, expansion of their networks and/or network\nupgrades. Our international customers must make these decisions in the regulatory and political environment\nin which they operate – both nationally and in some instances, regionally – whether of a multi-country region or\na more local region within a country. The competitive landscape in certain international markets is also affected\nby the increased presence of Asian manufacturers that seek to compete aggressively on price. Our revenue\nand operating income in some international markets can be negatively impacted by a strengthening U.S. dollar.\nConsequently, while we expect the global trend towards deployment of more robust broadband speeds and\naccess to continue creating additional market opportunities for us, the factors described above may result in\nnegative pressure on revenue and operating income.\nFinancial Results 17\nCost of Sales\nAs a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased from 61.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 58.7%\nfor the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to regional revenue shifts,\nchanges in customer and product mix, changes in services and support mix and a decrease in labor expense as\na result of restructuring programs which were initiated in 2018 and continued throughout 2019.\nNetwork Solutions cost of sales, as a percent of that segment’s sales, decreased from 60.9% of sales in 2018\nto 57.9% of sales in 2019. The decrease in Network Solutions cost of sales as a percentage of that segment’s\nsales was primarily attributable to regional revenue shifts, changes in customer and product mix and a decrease\nin labor expense due to restructuring programs which were initiated in 2018 and continued throughout 2019,\noffset by an increase in freight and shipping charges.\nAn important part of our strategy is to reduce the cost of each succeeding generation of product and then lower\nthe product’s selling price based on the cost savings achieved in order to gain market share and/or improve\ngross margins. This may cause variations in our gross profit percentage due to timing differences between the\nrecognition of cost reductions and the lowering of product selling prices.\nServices & Support cost of sales, as a percent of that segment’s sales, decreased from 65.8% of sales in 2018\nto 63.1% of sales in 2019. The decrease in Services & Support cost of sales as a percentage of that segment’s\nsales in 2019 was primarily attributable to lower fixed personnel costs due to restructuring programs which\nwere initiated in 2018 and continued throughout 2019, changes in customer mix, changes in services support\nmix and an increase in volume.\nOur Services & Support revenue is comprised of network planning and implementation, maintenance, support\nand cloud-based management services, with network planning and implementation being the largest and\nfastest growing component in the long-term. Compared to our other services, such as maintenance, support\nand cloud-based management services, our network planning and implementation services typically utilize\na higher percentage of internal and subcontracted engineers, professionals and contractors to perform the\nwork for customers. The additional costs incurred to perform these infrastructure and labor-intensive services\ninherently result in lower average gross margins as compared to maintenance and support services.\nAs our network planning and implementation revenue grew to become the largest component of our Services\n& Support segment business, our Services & Support segment gross margins decreased versus those reported\nwhen maintenance and support comprised the majority of the business. Further, because the growth in our\nnetwork planning and implementation services has resulted in our Services & Support segment revenue\ncomprising a larger percentage of our overall revenue, and because our Services & Support segment gross\nmargins are generally below those of the Network Solutions segment, our overall corporate gross margins may\ndecline as that business continues to grow. Within the Services & Support segment, we do expect variability in\ngross margins from quarter-to-quarter based on the mix of the services recognized.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased from 23.5% for the year\nended December 31, 2018 to 24.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Selling, general and administrative\nexpenses as a percentage of sales will generally fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenues\nfor the periods being compared as these costs are relatively fixed in the short term.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by 4.7% from $124.4 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2018 to $130.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Selling, general and administrative\nexpenses include personnel costs for administration, finance, information technology, human resources, sales\nand marketing and general management, as well as rent, utilities, legal and accounting expenses, advertising,\npromotional material, trade show expenses and related travel costs. The increase in selling, general and\nadministrative expenses was primarily attributable to deferred compensation related costs, incremental\nexpenses as a result of the SmartRG acquisition, IP litigation and other legal related costs, partially offset by\ndecreases in labor expense and use tax expense.\n18 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of sales increased from 23.5% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2018 to 23.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Research and development expenses as a\npercentage of sales will fluctuate whenever there are incremental product development activities or significant\nfluctuations in revenues for the periods being compared.\nResearch and development expenses increased by 1.3% from $124.5 million for the year ended December\n31, 2018 to $126.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in research and development\nexpenses was primarily attributable to increases in incremental expenses as a result of the SmartRG acquisition\nand lease expense offset by a decrease in labor expense, certain material engineering costs and contract\nservices.\nWe expect to continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with our new and existing\nproducts and our expansion into international markets. We continually evaluate new product and market\nopportunities and engage in significant research and development efforts which provide for new product\ndevelopment, enhancement of existing products and product cost reductions. We may incur significant research\nand development expenses prior to the receipt of revenues from a major new product group.\nAsset Impairments\nAsset impairments, which were $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, relate to the abandonment of\ncertain information technology implementation projects which we had previously capitalized costs for these projects.\nThere were no asset impairments recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 1 and Note 8 of\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nGain on Contingency\nGain on contingency, which was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, relates to the reversal of\ncontingent liabilities which were initially recognized upon the acquisition of SmartRG in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional\ninformation. There was no gain on contingency recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInterest and Dividend Income\nInterest and dividend income decreased by 31.3% from $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to\n$2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in interest and dividend income was primarily\nattributable to a decrease in interest income. Our investments increased from $112.1 million as of December 31,\n2018 to $127.7 million as of December 31, 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense, which is primarily related to our taxable revenue bond, remained constant at $0.5 million for\nthe years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, as we had no substantial change in our fixed-rate borrowing.\nSee “Financing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional information on our taxable\nrevenue bond.\nNet Investment Gain (Loss)\nWe recognized a net investment loss of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and a net investment\ngain of $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The fluctuation in our net investment gain was\nprimarily attributable to changes in fair value of equity securities recognized during the period. We expect that\nany future equity market volatility will result in continued volatility in gains or losses from our equity investment\nportfolios. See “Investing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and Note 1 and Note 5 of Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nFinancial Results 19\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net, which is comprised primarily of miscellaneous income, gains and losses on\nforeign currency transactions, net periodic pension costs, investment account management fees and gains and\nlosses on foreign exchange forward contracts, increased 16.5% from income of $1.3 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2018 to income of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was primarily\nattributable to a gain on a life insurance recovery recognized in 2019 partially offset by losses on foreign\nexchange contracts and transactions in 2019 as compared to foreign exchange gains in 2018.\nGain on Bargain Purchase of a Business\nGain on bargain purchase of a business is related to our acquisition of Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s\nNorth American EPON business and entry into a technology license and supply agreement with Sumitomo\nElectric Industries, Ltd. in March 2018. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in\nPart II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit\nOur effective tax rate increased from a benefit of 42.0%, excluding the tax effect of the bargain purchase\ngain, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to an expense of (113.9%) for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe increase in the effective tax rate between the two periods was primarily driven by the establishment of a\nvaluation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets in the amount of $42.8 million during the year\nended December 31, 2019, offset by a 15.5% rate reduction related to the generation of federal research and\ndevelopment credits, and a 16.7% rate reduction for the generation of foreign tax credits. See Note 13 of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the above factors, our net loss increased from $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018\nto a net loss of $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a percentage of sales, net loss increased\nfrom 3.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 10.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nWe have historically and we currently expect to finance our ongoing business with existing cash and cash\nflow from operations. We have used, and expect to continue to use, existing cash and cash generated from\noperations for working capital, business acquisitions, purchases of treasury stock, shareholder dividends and\nother general corporate purposes, including product development activities to enhance our existing products\nand develop new products, expansion of our sales and marketing activities and capital expenditures. We believe\nour cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations to be adequate to meet our\noperating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.\nAs of December 31, 2019, cash on hand was $73.8 million and short-term investments were $33.2 million,\nwhich resulted in available short-term liquidity of $107.0 million, of which $52.3 million was held by our foreign\nsubsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, cash on hand was $105.5 million and short-term investments were\n$3.2 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $108.7 million, of which $87.1 million was held by\nour foreign subsidiaries. The decrease in short-term liquidity from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019\nwas primarily attributable to the use of cash for operating, investing and financing activities and income tax\npayments, offset by the reclassification of our certificate of deposit from long-term to short-term investments.\nOperating Activities\nOur working capital, which consists of current assets less current liabilities, decreased 12.6% from $237.4 million\nas of December 31, 2018 to $207.6 million as of December 31, 2019. The current ratio, defined as current assets\ndivided by current liabilities, decreased from 3.01 as of December 31, 2018 to 2.84 as of December 31, 2019.\nThe decrease in our working capital and current ratio was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash and cash\n20 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report\nequivalents, net accounts receivable and other receivables as described below. The quick ratio, defined as\ncash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and net accounts receivable, divided by current liabilities,\ndecreased from 1.76 as of December 31, 2018 to 1.75 as of December 31, 2019. The decrease in the quick\nratio was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and net accounts receivable. This\ndecrease was offset by an increase in short-term investments.\nNet accounts receivable decreased 8.91% from $99.4 million as of December 31, 2018 to $90.5 million as of\nDecember 31, 2019. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.1 million as of December 31, 2018 and $38\nthousand as of December 31, 2019. Quarterly accounts receivable DSO increased from 65 days as of December\n31, 2018 to 72 days as of December 31, 2019. The decrease in net accounts receivable and increase in DSO was\nattributable to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter, customer specific payment terms and other collections\nduring the quarter.\nOther receivables decreased 54.9% from $36.7 million as of December 31, 2018 to $16.6 million as of December\n31, 2019. The decrease in other receivables was primarily attributable to a decrease in current lease payments\nreceivable related to our sales-type leases, income tax receivables and purchasing shipments.\nAnnual inventory turnover increased from 2.93 turns as of December 31, 2018 to 3.14 turns as of December 31,\n2019. Inventory decreased 1.6% from $99.8 million as of December 31, 2018 to $98.3 million as of December\n31, 2019. We expect inventory levels to fluctuate as we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory in response to\nseasonal cycles of our business ensuring competitive lead times while managing the risk of excess inventory.\nAccounts payable decreased 25.3% from $60.1 million as of December 31, 2018 to $44.9 million as of December\n31, 2019. Accounts payable will fluctuate due to variations in the timing of the receipt of supplies, inventory and\nservices and our subsequent payments for these purchases.\nInvesting Activities\nCapital expenditures totaled approximately $9.5 million, $8.1 million and $14.7 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These expenditures were primarily used to purchase computer\nhardware, software, manufacturing and test equipment and for building improvements.\nOur combined short-term and long-term investments increased $15.7 million from $112.1 million as of December\n31, 2018 to $127.7 million as of December 31, 2019. This increase reflects the increase in fair market value of our\nequity investments.\nWe invest all available cash not required for immediate use in operations primarily in securities that we believe\nbear minimal risk of loss. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of\nthis report for additional information. As of December 31, 2019, our corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds,\nasset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, U.S. government bonds, and foreign government bonds\nwere classified as available-for-sale and had a combined duration of 1.71 years with an average credit rating of\nAA. Because our bond portfolio has a high-quality rating and contractual maturities of short duration, we are\nable to obtain prices for these bonds derived from observable market inputs, or for similar securities traded in\nan active market, on a daily basis.\nOur long-term investments decreased 16.5% from $108.8 million as of December 31, 2018 to $94.5 million as\nof December 31, 2019. Long-term investments as of December 31, 2018 included an investment in a certificate\nof deposit of $25.6 million, which served as collateral for our revenue bonds. This certificate of deposit was\nincluded in short-term investments as of December 31, 2019, as these bonds matured on January 1, 2020,\nand were repaid in full on January 2, 2020. We also have investments in various marketable equity securities\nclassified as long-term investments with a fair market value of $35.8 million and $27.0 million, as of December\n31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Long-term investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 also\nincluded $21.7 million and $18.3 million, respectively, related to our deferred compensation plan, and $0.3\nmillion and $0.4 million, respectively, of other investments, consisting of interests in two private equity funds.\nNo businesses were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2019. Acquisition of businesses, net of cash\nacquired, totaled $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nFinancial Results 21\nFinancing Activities\nIn conjunction with the 1995 expansion of our Huntsville, Alabama, facility, we were approved for participation\nin an incentive program offered by the State of Alabama Industrial Development Authority (“the Authority”).\nPursuant to the program, on January 13, 1995, the Authority issued $20.0 million of its taxable revenue bonds\n(the “Taxable Revenue Bonds”) and loaned the proceeds from the sale of the Taxable Revenue Bonds to\nADTRAN. Further advances on the Taxable Revenue Bonds were made by the Authority, bringing the total\namount outstanding to $50.0 million. The bonds matured on January 1, 2020, and the current outstanding\nbalance of $24.6 million was repaid in full on January 2, 2020. We were required to make payments to the\nAuthority in amounts necessary to pay the interest on the Taxable Revenue Bonds which totaled $1.0 million,\n$1.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. See Note 12 of\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nDividends\nDuring 2019, 2018 and 2017, we paid shareholder dividends totaling $17.2 million, $17.3 million and $17.4 million,\nrespectively. The Board of Directors presently anticipates that it will declare a regular quarterly dividend so long\nas the present tax treatment of dividends exists and adequate levels of liquidity are maintained. The following\ntable shows dividends per common share paid to our shareholders in each quarter of 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nDIVIDENDS PER COMMON SHARE\nFirst Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter\n2019 $0.09 $0.09 $0.09 $0.09\n2018 $0.09 $0.09 $0.09 $0.09\n2017 $0.09 $0.09 $0.09 $0.09\nStock Repurchase Program\nSince 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized\nopen market repurchase transactions of our common stock, which are implemented through open market or\nprivate purchases from time to time as conditions warrant. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018\nand 2017, we repurchased 13 thousand shares, 1.0 million shares and 0.9 million shares, respectively, for $0.2\nmillion, $15.5 million and $17.3 million, respectively, at an average price of $14.06, $15.52 and $20.27 per share,\nrespectively. We currently have authorization to repurchase an additional 2.5 million shares of our common\nstock under the current authorization of up to 5.0 million shares.\nStock Option Exercises\nTo accommodate employee stock option exercises, we issued 34 thousand shares of treasury stock for $0.5\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2019, 0.1 million shares of treasury stock for $1.5 million during the\nyear ended December 31, 2018 and 0.7 million shares of treasury stock for $13.4 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2017.\nEmployee Pension Plan\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan, covering employees in certain foreign countries. Pension benefit\nplan obligations are based on various assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating these amounts. These\nassumptions include discount rates, compensation rate increases, expected return on plan assets, retirement\nrates and mortality rates. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in assumptions could\naffect future expenses and obligations.\n22 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report\nOur defined benefit plan assets consist of a balanced portfolio of equity funds, bond funds, real estate funds and\nmanaged futures. Our investment policy includes various guidelines and procedures designed to ensure assets\nare invested in a manner necessary to meet expected future benefits earned by participants and consider a\nbroad range of economic conditions. Central to the policy are target allocation ranges by asset class, which\nis currently 50% for bond funds, 40% for equity funds and 10% cash, real estate and managed futures. The\nobjectives of the target allocations are to maintain investment portfolios that diversify risk through prudent\nasset allocation parameters, achieve asset returns that meet or exceed the plans’ actuarial assumptions and\nachieve asset returns that are competitive with like institutions employing similar investment strategies. The\ninvestment policy is periodically reviewed by us and a designated third-party fiduciary for investment matters.\nThe policy is established and administered in a manner that is compliant at all times with applicable government\nregulations. At December 31, 2019, the estimated fair market value of our defined benefit pension plans assets\nincreased to $28.0 million from $24.2 million at December 31, 2018.\nThe defined benefit pension plan is accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the use of various\nassumptions, including an expected rate of return on plan assets and a discount rate. The expected return on\nour German plan assets that is utilized in determining the benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost is\nderived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term\nperformance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations, and correlations of returns among the\nasset classes that comprise the plans’ asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan\nperformance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return. The\ndiscount rate has been derived from the returns of high-quality, corporate bonds denominated in Euro currency\nwith durations close to the duration of our pension obligations. The projected benefit obligation for our defined\nbenefit pension plans was $43.9 million and $37.2 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe components of net periodic pension cost, other than the service cost component, are included in other\nincome (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). The components of net periodic\npension cost and amounts recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31,\n2019, 2018 and 2017 was $3.2 million, $6.1 million and $(0.2) million, respectively.\nActuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). To the extent\nunamortized gains and losses exceed 10% of the higher of the market-related value of assets or the projected\nbenefit obligation, the excess is amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost over the remaining\nservice period of active participants. We estimate that $0.8 million will be amortized from accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) into net periodic pension cost in 2020 for the net actuarial loss. The net actuarial\nloss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 2019 and 2018 was $(13.0)\nmillion and $(11.3) million, respectively.\nSee Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional\ninformation.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nWe do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not engaged in any related party transactions\nor arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect\nliquidity or the availability of, or requirements for, capital resources.\nFinancial Results 23\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nWe have various contractual obligations and commercial commitments. The following table sets forth the annual\npayments we are required to make under contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as\nof December 31, 2019:\nAfter\n(In thousands) Total 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2024\nBonds payable (1) $24,600 $24,600 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nPurchase obligations (2) 99,210 98,324 759 83 28 16 —\nOperating lease obligations (3) 8,879 2,856 2,412 1,705 1,160 482 264\nTotals $132,689 $125,780 $3,171 $1,788 $1,188 $498 $264\n(1) As of December 31, 2019, we were required to make payments necessary to pay the interest on the Taxable\nRevenue Bonds, which were outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $24.6 million as of December 31,\n2019. The bonds had an interest rate of 2% per annum and matured on January 1, 2020. Included in short-term\ninvestments as of December 31, 2019 was a certificate of deposit of $25.6 million, which served a collateral deposit\nagainst the principal amount of the bonds. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in\nPart II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\n(2) Primarily relates to open purchase orders to our contract manufacturers, component suppliers, service partners\nand other vendors.\n(3) Primarily relates to future minimum rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases, including renewals\ndetermined to be reasonably assured, with original maturities of greater than 12 months.\nWe have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, of which $7.7 million\nhas been applied to these commitments. The additional $0.2 million commitment has been excluded from the\ntable above due to the uncertainty of when it will be applied.\nCertain contracts, customers and/or jurisdictions in which we do business require us to provide various\nguarantees of performance such as bid bonds, performance bonds and customs bonds. As of December 31,\n2019, we had commitments related to these bonds totaling $9.3 million, which expire at various dates through\nAugust 2024. Although the triggering events vary from contract to contract, in general we would only be\nliable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in our performance under each contract, the\nprobability of which we believe is remote.\nWe also have obligations related to uncertain income tax positions that have been excluded from the table above\ndue to the uncertainty of when the related expense will be recognized. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on\nassumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates\nreasonably could have been used or if changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to\noccur could materially impact the results of financial operations. Several accounting policies, as described\nin Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report, require\nmaterial subjective or complex judgment and have a significant impact on our financial condition and results\nof operations, as applicable. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant\njudgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:\n24 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or\nproviding services to a customer and as performance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied.\nGenerally, this occurs with the transfer of control of a product or service to the customer. For transactions where\nthere are multiple performance obligations, we account for individual products and services separately if they\nare distinct (if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items and if a customer can benefit from\nit on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer). The consideration, including\nany discounts, is allocated between separate products and services based on their stand-alone selling prices.\nThe stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which we sell the separate products\nand services and are allocated based on each item’s relative value to the total value of the products and\nservices in the arrangement. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate stand-alone selling prices\nprimarily using the “expected cost plus a margin” approach. Payment terms are generally 30 days in the U.S.\nand typically longer in many geographic markets outside the U.S. Shipping fees are recorded as revenue and\nthe related cost is included in cost of sales. Sales, value-added and other taxes collected concurrently with\nrevenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Costs of obtaining a contract are capitalized and\namortized over the period that the related revenue is recognized if greater than one year. We have elected\nto apply the practical expedient related to the incremental costs of obtaining contracts and recognize those\ncosts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets is one year or less. These costs are\nincluded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Capitalized costs with an amortization period greater\nthan one year were immaterial.\nThe following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate our revenue by reportable\nsegment.\nNetwork Solutions Segment\nNetwork Solutions includes software and hardware products and software defined next-generation virtualized\nsolutions used in service provider or business networks, as well as prior generation products. The majority of\nthe revenue from this segment is from hardware sales.\nHardware and Software Revenue\nRevenue from hardware sales is recognized when control is transferred to our customers, which is generally\nwhen we ship the products. Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point. This segment also includes\nrevenues from software license sales which is recognized at delivery and transfer of control to the customer.\nRevenue is recorded net of estimated discounts and rebates using historical trends. Customers are typically\ninvoiced when control is transferred and revenue is recognized. Our products generally include assurance-\nbased warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects, which are accrued at the time revenue is\nrecognized.\nIn certain transactions, we are also the lessor in sales-type lease arrangements for network equipment that\nhave terms of 18 months to five years. These arrangements typically include network equipment, network\nimplementation services and maintenance services. Product revenue for these leases is generally recorded\nwhen we transfer control of the product to our customers. Revenue for network implementation and maintenance\nservices is recognized as described below. Customers are typically invoiced and pay in equal installments over\nthe lease term. In relation to these lease agreements, during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and\n2017 we recognized revenue of $1.7 million, $13.7 million and $16.5 million, respectively.\nServices & Support Segment\nTo complement our Network Solutions segment, we offer a complete portfolio of maintenance, network\nimplementation, and solutions integration and managed services, which include hosted cloud services and\nsubscription services.\nFinancial Results 25\nMaintenance Revenue\nOur maintenance service periods range from one month to five years. Customers are typically invoiced and pay\nfor maintenance services at the beginning of the maintenance period. We recognize revenue for maintenance\nservices on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period in services revenue as our customers benefit\nevenly throughout the contract term and deferred revenues are recorded in current and non-current unearned\nrevenue.\nNetwork Implementation Revenue\nWe recognize revenue for network implementation, which primarily consists of engineering, execution and\nenablement services, at a point in time when each performance obligation is complete. If we have recognized\nrevenue, but have not billed the customer, the right to consideration is recognized as a contract asset that is\nincluded in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The contract asset is transferred to accounts\nreceivable when the completed performance obligation is invoiced to the customer.\nInventory\nWe carry our inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost being determined using the first-\nin, first-out method. Standard costs for material, labor, and manufacturing overhead are used to value inventory\nand are updated at least a quarterly. Any variances are expensed in the current period, therefore, our inventory\ncosts approximate actual costs at the end of each reporting period. We establish reserves for estimated\nexcess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated\nnet realizable value of the inventory based on estimated reserve percentages, which consider historical usage,\nknown trends, inventory age and marketing conditions. If actual trends and market conditions are less favorable\nthan those projected by management, we may be required to make additional inventory write-downs. Our\nreserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $34.1 million and $30.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018,\nrespectively. Inventory disposals charged against the reserve were $1.8 million, $0.4 million and $8.3 million for\nthe years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nFor purposes of determining the estimated fair value of our stock option awards on the date of grant, we\nuse the Black-Scholes Model. This model requires the input of certain assumptions that require subjective\njudgment. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, expected stock price volatility over the term of the\nawards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. Because our stock option awards\nhave characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the input\nassumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the existing model may not provide a reliable, single\nmeasure of the fair value of our stock option awards. For purposes of determining the estimated fair value of\nour market-based performance stock unit (PSU) awards on the date of grant, we use a Monte Carlo Simulation\nvaluation method. These PSUs are subject to a market condition based on the relative total shareholder return\nof ADTRAN against all of the companies in the NASDAQ Telecommunications Index and vest at the end of\na three-year performance period. The fair value of performance-based PSUs, restricted stock units (RSUs)\nand restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the business day immediately preceding the\ngrant date. Compensation expense related to unvested performance-based PSUs will be recognized over the\nrequisite service period of three years as the achievement of the performance obligation becomes probable.\nManagement will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair\nvalue of stock-based compensation. Circumstances may change and additional data may become available\nover time, which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially\nimpact our fair value determination. If factors change in future periods, the compensation expense that we\nrecord may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period.\n26 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company records assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, when applicable,\nand intangible assets recognized as part of business combinations based on their fair values on the date of\nacquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible\nassets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the estimated fair values of net tangible and intangible assets acquired\nexceed the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recorded. The Company’s estimates of fair value are\nbased on historical experience, industry knowledge, certain information obtained from the management of the\nacquired company and, in some cases, valuations performed by independent third-party firms. The results of\noperations of acquired companies are included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations\nsince their dates of acquisition. Costs incurred to complete the business combination, such as legal, accounting,\nor other professional fees, are charged to general and administrative expenses as they are incurred.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We evaluate the\ncarrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events\noccur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below\nits carrying amount. We have elected to by-pass a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely\nthan not that the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned is less than its carrying amount\nand, in turn, performed a step-1 analysis of goodwill. Based on the results of our step-1 analysis, no impairment\ncharges on goodwill were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nWe estimate our income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including\nestimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. We also make judgments regarding the\nrealization of deferred tax assets and establish valuation allowances where we believe it is more likely than\nnot that future taxable income in certain jurisdictions will be insufficient to realize these deferred tax assets.\nOur estimates regarding future taxable income and income tax provision or benefit may vary due to changes\nin market conditions, changes in tax laws, or other factors. If our assumptions, and consequently our estimates,\nchange in the future, the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased, impacting\nfuture income tax expense. We continually review the adequacy of our valuation allowance and recognize the\nbenefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred\ntax assets will be realized in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Due to our recent decrease\nin revenue and profitability for 2019, and all other positive and negative objective evidence considered as part\nof our analysis, our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as projections for future growth is limited\nwhen evaluating whether our deferred tax assets will be realized. As such, the Company is no longer able to\nconclude that it is more likely than not that our domestic deferred tax assets will be realized and a valuation\nallowance against our Domestic deferred tax assets was established in the third quarter of 2019. The amount\nof the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted in future periods in the event\nsufficient evidence is present to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our\ndomestic deferred tax assets will be realized.\nWe establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we\ndetermine that the positions become uncertain. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related\ninterest and penalties, as facts and circumstances change.\nFinancial Results 27\nLiability for Warranty\nOur products generally include warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects. We accrue for warranty\nreturns at the time revenue is recognized based on our historical return rate and an estimate of the cost to repair\nor replace the defective products. We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including\nactively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. Our products continue to become\nmore complex in both size and functionality as many of our product offerings migrate from line card applications\nto total systems. The increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences, when they arise,\nto be more costly. Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure\nrates, material usage, and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to\ntime, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise. Should our actual experience\nrelative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to record additional warranty expense.\nAlternatively, if we provide for more reserves than we require, we will reverse a portion of such provisions in\nfuture periods. The liability for warranty obligations totaled $8.4 million and $8.6 million at December 31, 2019\nand 2018, respectively. These liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nPension Benefit Obligations\nPension benefit plan obligations are based on various assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating these\namounts. These assumptions include discount rates, compensation rate increases, expected return on plan\nassets, retirement rates and mortality rates. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in\nassumptions could affect future expenses and obligations. Our net pension liability totaled $15.9 million and\n$13.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This liability is included in pension liability in the\naccompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nSubsequent Events\nOn January 2, 2020, we paid off the outstanding balance of $24.6 million of the Taxable Revenue Bonds upon\ntheir maturity. We used a certificate of deposit which was held as collateral to repay the outstanding balance.\nOn February 5, 2020, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common share to be paid\nto shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2020. The quarterly dividend payment will\nbe paid on March 5, 2020 in the aggregate amount of approximately $4.3 million. In July 2003, our Board of\nDirectors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of\ndividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity.\n28 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report\nQuantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates and prices\nof marketable equity and fixed-income securities. The primary objective of the large majority of our investment\nactivities is to preserve principal while at the same time achieving appropriate yields without significantly\nincreasing risk. To achieve this objective, a majority of our marketable securities are investment grade, fixed-rate\nbonds and municipal money market instruments denominated in U.S. dollars. Our investment policy provides\nlimitations for issuer concentration, which limits, at the time of purchase, the concentration in any one issuer to\n5% of the market value of our total investment portfolio.\nWe maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions. Although these depository investments\nmay exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit-worthiness of these financial\ninstitutions and determined the risk of material financial loss due to exposure of such credit risk to be minimal. As\nof December 31, 2019, $71.6 million of our cash and cash equivalents, primarily certain domestic money market\nfunds and foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government provided insured depository limits.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately $39.0 million of our cash and investments may be directly affected by\nchanges in interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, we held $3.7 million of cash and variable-rate investments\nwhere a change in interest rates would impact our interest income. A hypothetical 50 basis points (“bps”)\ndecline in interest rates, assuming all other variables remain constant, as of December 31, 2019 would reduce\nannualized interest income on our cash and investments by approximately $19 thousand. In addition, we held\n$35.3 million of fixed-rate bonds whose fair values may be directly affected by a change in interest rates. A\nhypothetical 50 bps increase in interest rates, assuming all other variables remain constant, as of December 31,\n2019 would reduce the fair value of our fixed-rate bonds by approximately $0.3 million.\nWe are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent that such changes affect our\nrevenue and gross margin on revenue derived from some international customers, expenses and assets\nand liabilities held in non-functional currencies related to our foreign subsidiaries. Our primary exposures to\nforeign currency exchange rate movements are with our German subsidiary, whose functional currency is the\nEuro, and our Australian subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Australian dollar. Our revenue is primarily\ndenominated in the respective functional currency of the subsidiary and paid in that subsidiary’s functional\ncurrency or certain other local currency, our global supply chain predominately invoices us in the respective\nfunctional currency of the subsidiary and is paid in U.S. dollars and some of our operating expenses are invoiced\nand paid in certain local currencies (approximately 13% of total operating expense for the year ended December\n31, 2019). Therefore, our revenues, gross margins, operating expense and operating income are all subject to\nforeign currency fluctuations. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates could cause variations in our\noperating income.\nWe have certain international customers who are invoiced or pay in a non-functional currency. Changes in\nthe monetary exchange rates used to invoice such customers versus the functional currency of the entity\nbilling such customers may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. To manage\nthe volatility relating to these typical business exposures, we may enter into various derivative transactions,\nwhen appropriate. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.\nAll non-functional currencies billed would result in a combined hypothetical gain or loss of $1.2 million if the\nU.S. dollar weakened or strengthened 10% against the billing currencies. This change represents a decrease\nin the amount of hypothetical gain or loss compared to prior periods and is mainly due to a decrease in U.S.\ndollar-denominated billings in a non-U.S. dollar denominated subsidiary. Although we do not currently hold any\nderivative instruments, any gain or loss would be partially mitigated by any derivative instruments held.\nFinancial Results 29\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had certain material contracts subject to currency revaluation, including accounts\nreceivable, accounts payable and lease liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2019,\nwe did not have any forward contracts outstanding.\nFor further information about the fair value of our available-for-sale investments and our derivative and hedging\nactivities as of December 31, 2019, see Notes 5 and 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included\nin Part II, Item 8 of this report.\n30 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report\nReport of Independent Registered\nPublic Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of ADTRAN, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements\nand Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ADTRAN, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the\n“Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income (loss),\ncomprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in\nthe period ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the\naccompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established\nin Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and\nits cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company did not maintain,\nin all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO because a material\nweakness in internal control over financial reporting existed as of that date related to ineffective controls over\nthe Company’s determination of its estimated reserve for excess and obsolete inventory.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,\nsuch that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial\nstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness referred to above\nis described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.\nWe considered this material weakness in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied\nin our audit of the 2019 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining\neffective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control\nover financial reporting, included in management’s report referred to above. Our responsibility is to express\nopinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nFinancial Results 31\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan\nand perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements\nare free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding\nthe amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting\nincluded obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on\nthe assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in\nthe circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company\nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that\n(i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved\nour especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does\nnot alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nExcess and Obsolete Inventory Reserve\nAs described in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated net inventory\nand inventory reserves as of December 31, 2019 were $98.3 million and $34.1 million, respectively. Management\nestablishes reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of\nthe inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on estimated reserve percentages,\nwhich consider historical usage, known trends, inventory age, and market conditions.\n32 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the excess and obsolete\ninventory reserve is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management in estimating the\nexcess and obsolete inventory reserve, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity\nand effort in performing procedures and evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used\nin developing the reserve, including the estimated reserve percentages. As described in the “Opinions on the\nFinancial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting” section, a material weakness was identified\nas of December 31, 2019 related to ineffective controls over the Company’s determination of its estimated\nreserve for excess and obsolete inventory.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among\nothers, testing management’s process for developing the excess and obsolete inventory reserve; evaluating\nthe appropriateness of the approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the\napproach, including historical usage and inventory age; and evaluating the reasonableness of the estimated\nreserve percentages used by management to determine the excess and obsolete inventory reserve. Evaluating\nthe reasonableness of the estimated reserve percentages involved assessing whether they were consistent\nwith the historical data and evidence obtained in other areas of the

Report\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 – Nature of Business\nADTRAN, Inc. (“ADTRAN” or the “Company”) is a leading global provider of networking and communications\nsolutions. Our vision is to enable a fully connected world where the power to communicate is available to\neveryone, everywhere. Our unique approach, unmatched industry expertise and innovative solutions enable\nus to address almost any customer need. Our products and services are utilized by a diverse global customer\nbase of network operators that range from those having national or regional reach, operating as telephone or\ncable television network operators, to alternative network providers such as municipalities or utilities, as well as\nmanaged service providers who serve small- and medium-sized businesses and distributed enterprises.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the financial position, results of operations,\ncomprehensive income (loss), changes in equity and cash flows of ADTRAN and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nAll intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets\nand liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during\nthe reporting period. Our more significant estimates include excess and obsolete inventory reserves, warranty\nreserves, customer rebates, determination and accrual of the deferred revenue components of multiple\nelement sales agreements, estimated costs to complete obligations associated with deferred revenues and\nnetwork installations, estimated income tax provision and income tax contingencies, fair value of stock-based\ncompensation, assessment of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment, estimated lives of intangible\nassets, estimated pension liability, fair value of investments and evaluation of other-than-temporary declines in\nthe value of investments. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates.\nCorrection of Immaterial Misstatement\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company determined that there was an immaterial misstatement\nof its excess and obsolete inventory reserves in its previously issued annual and interim financial statements. The\nCompany corrected this misstatement by recognizing a $0.8 million out-of-period adjustment during the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2019, which increased its excess and obsolete inventory reserves and cost of goods\nsold for the period. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, the out-of-period adjustment was a cumulative $0.2\nmillion reduction in the Company’s excess and obsolete inventory reserves and cost of goods sold.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents represent demand deposits, money market funds and short-term investments\nclassified as available-for-sale with original maturities of three months or less. We maintain depository\ninvestments with certain financial institutions. Although these depository investments may exceed government\ninsured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit worthiness of these applicable financial institutions\nand determined the risk of material financial loss due to the exposure of such credit risk to be minimal. As of\nDecember 31, 2019, $71.6 million of our cash and cash equivalents, primarily certain domestic money market\nfunds and foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government provided insured depository limits.\nFinancial Results 39\nFinancial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts\nreceivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the immediate or short-term maturity of\nthese financial instruments. The carrying amount reported for bonds payable was $24.6 million, which\nwas its fair value as of December 31, 2019.\nInvestments with contractual maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly\nliquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for\ncurrent operations. Despite the long-term nature of their stated contractual maturities, we routinely buy and sell\nthese securities and we believe we have the ability to quickly sell them to the remarketing agent, tender agent\nor issuer at par value plus accrued interest in the event we decide to liquidate our investment in a particular\nvariable rate demand note. All income generated from these investments was recorded as interest income. We\nhave not recorded any losses relating to variable rate demand notes.\nLong-term investments is comprised of deferred compensation plan assets, corporate bonds, municipal\nfixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, U.S. and foreign government bonds,\nmarketable equity securities and other equity investments. Marketable equity securities are reported at fair\nvalue as determined by the most recently traded price of the securities at the balance sheet date, although the\nsecurities may not be readily marketable due to the size of the available market. Any changes in fair value are\nrecognized in net investment gain (loss). Realized gains and losses on sales of debt securities are computed\nunder the specific identification method and are included in other income (expense). See Note 5 for additional\ninformation.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe record accounts receivable at net realizable value. Prior to establishing payment terms for a new customer,\nwe evaluate the credit risk of the customer. Credit limits and payment terms established for new customers\nare re-evaluated periodically based on customer collection experience and other financial factors. As of\nDecember 31, 2019, single customers comprising more than 10% of our total accounts receivable balance\nincluded four customers, which accounted for 53.2% of our total accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2018,\nsingle customers comprising more than 10% of our total accounts receivable balance included two customers,\nwhich accounted for 36.9% of our total accounts receivable.\nWe regularly review the need to maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and consider factors such as the\nage of accounts receivable balances, the current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay,\nsignificant one-time events impacting these customers and our historical experience. If the financial condition\nof a customer deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, we may be required\nto record an allowance for doubtful accounts. If circumstances change with regard to individual receivable\nbalances that have previously been determined to be uncollectible, and for which a specific reserve has been\nestablished, a reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts may be required. Our allowance for doubtful\naccounts was $38 thousand and $0.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nInventory\nInventory is carried at the lower of cost and estimated net realizable value, with cost being determined using\nthe first-in, first-out method. Standard costs for material, labor and manufacturing overhead are used to value\ninventory and are updated at least quarterly. We establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory\nequal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory\nbased on estimated reserve percentages, which consider historical usage, known trends, inventory age and\nmarket conditions. When we dispose of excess and obsolete inventories, the related disposals are charged\nagainst the inventory reserve. See Note 7 for additional information.\n40 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment, which is stated at cost, is depreciated using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful lives of the assets. We depreciate building and land improvements from five to 39 years, office\nmachinery and equipment from three to seven years, engineering machinery and equipment from three to seven\nyears, and computer software from three to five years. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to\nexpense as incurred. Major improvements that materially prolong the lives of the assets are capitalized. Gains\nand losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are recorded in operating income (loss). See Note\n8 for additional information.\nIntangible Assets\nPurchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization\nis recorded over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which is two to 14 years. See Note 11 for\nadditional information.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles\nLong-lived assets used in operations and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events\nor changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and the\nundiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value.\nAn impairment loss would be recognized in the amount by which the recorded value of the asset exceeds\nthe fair value of the asset, measured by the quoted market price of an asset or an estimate based on the\nbest information available in the circumstances. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized an\nimpairment loss of approximately $3.9 million related to the abandonment of certain information technology\nimplementation projects which we had previously capitalized expenses related to these projects. There were\nno impairment losses for long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017, or for intangible\nassets recognized during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We evaluate the\ncarrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events\noccur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below\nits carrying amount. We have elected to by-pass a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely\nthan not that the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned is less than its carrying amount\nand, in turn, performed a step-1 analysis of goodwill. Based on the results of our step-1 analysis, no impairment\ncharges on goodwill were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nLiability for Warranty\nOur products generally include warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects. We accrue for\nwarranty returns at the time revenue is recognized based on our historical return rate and estimate of the\ncost to repair or replace the defective products. We engage in extensive product quality programs and\nprocesses, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. The increasing\ncomplexity of our products will cause warranty incidences, when they arise, to be more costly. Our estimates\nregarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage and other\nrework costs incurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals\nmay be recorded if unforeseen problems arise. Should our actual experience relative to these factors be\nworse than our estimates, we will be required to record additional warranty expense. Alternatively, if we\nprovide for more reserves than we require, we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods.\nThe liability for warranty obligations totaled $8.4 million and $8.6 million as of December 31, 2019 and\n2018, respectively. These liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. During 2017, we recorded a reduction in warranty expense related to a settlement with a\nthird-party supplier for a defective component, the impact of which is reflected in the following table.\nFinancial Results 41\nA summary of warranty expense and write-off activity for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017\nis as follows:\n(In thousands)\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017\nBalance at beginning of period $8,623 $9,724 $8,548\nPlus: Amounts charged to cost and expenses 4,569 7,392 6,951\nLess: Deductions (4,798) (8,493) (5,775)\nBalance at end of period $8,394 $8,623 $9,724\nPension Benefit Plan Obligations\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries. Pension benefit\nplan obligations are based on various assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating these amounts. These\nassumptions include discount rates, compensation rate increases, expected return on plan assets, retirement\nrates and mortality rates. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in assumptions could\naffect future expenses and obligations. Our net pension liability totaled $15.9 million and $13.1 million as of\nDecember 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have two stock incentive plans from which stock options, performance stock units (“PSUs”), restricted stock\nunits (“RSUs”) and restricted stock are available for grant to employees and directors. Costs related to these\nawards are recognized over their vesting periods. All employee and director stock options granted under our\nstock option plans have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the award, as defined in the plan,\nof the underlying common stock on the grant date. All of our outstanding stock option awards are classified as\nequity awards and therefore are measured at fair value on their grant date.\nStock-based compensation expense recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017\nwas approximately $7.0 million, $7.2 million and $7.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, total\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options, PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock was\napproximately $17.2 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period\nof 3.0 years.

Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur\nwhen the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes\nrepresents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the\nyear. Deferred taxes result from the difference between financial and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and\nare adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when such changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are\nrecorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.\nWe establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we\ndetermine that the positions become uncertain. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related\ninterest and penalties, as facts and circumstances change.\nForeign Currency\nWe record transactions denominated in foreign currencies using appropriate exchange rates from throughout\nthe year. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the balance sheet dates\nusing the closing rates of exchange between those foreign currencies and the functional currency with any\ntransaction gains or losses reported in other income (expense). Our primary exposures to foreign currency\nexchange rate movements are with our German subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Euro, our\nAustralian subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Australian dollar and our Mexican subsidiary, whose\nfunctional currency is the U.S. dollar as most invoices are paid in Mexican Pesos. Adjustments resulting from\ntranslating financial statements of international subsidiaries are recorded as a component of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss).\nRevenue\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which\nsupersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.\nAccounting Policy under Topic 606\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or\nproviding services to a customer and as performance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied.\nGenerally, this occurs with the transfer of control of a product to the customer. Review of contracts with customers,\nfor both direct customers and distributors, are performed and assessment made regarding principal versus\nagent considerations to determine primary responsibility for delivery of performance obligation, presumed\ninventory risk, and discretion in establishing pricing. For transactions where there are multiple performance\nobligations, we account for individual products and services separately if they are distinct (if a product or\nservice is separately identifiable from other items and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other\nresources that are readily available to the customer). The consideration, including any discounts, is allocated\nbetween separate products and services based on their stand-alone selling prices. Stand-alone selling prices\nare determined based on the prices at which we sell the separate products and services and are allocated\nbased on each item’s relative value to the total value of the products and services in the arrangement. For items\nthat are not sold separately, we estimate stand-alone selling prices primarily using the “expected cost plus a\nmargin” approach. Payment terms are generally 30 days in the U.S. and typically longer in many geographic\nmarkets outside the U.S. Shipping fees are recorded as revenue and the related cost is included in cost of sales.\nSales, value-added and other taxes collected concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from\nrevenue. Costs of obtaining a contract, if material, are capitalized and amortized over the period that the related\nrevenue is recognized if greater than one year. We have elected to account for shipping fees as a cost of\nfulfilling the related contract. We have also elected to apply the practical expedient related to the incremental\ncosts of obtaining contracts and recognize those costs as an expense when incurred if the amortization period\nof the assets is one year or less. These costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nCapitalized costs with an amortization period greater than one year were immaterial.\n46 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report\nThe following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate our revenue by reportable segment.\nQ\u0003Network Solutions Segment\nNetwork Solutions includes hardware products and software defined next-generation virtualized solutions\nused in service provider or business networks, as well as prior generation products. The majority of the\nrevenue from this segment is from hardware sales.\nQ\u0003Hardware and Software Revenue\nRevenue from hardware sales is recognized when control is transferred to our customers, which is\ngenerally when we ship the products. Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point. This segment\nalso includes revenues from software license sales which is recognized at delivery and transfer\nof control to the customer. Revenue is recorded net of estimated discounts and rebates using\nhistorical trends. Customers are typically invoiced when control is transferred and revenue is\nrecognized. Our products generally include assurance-based warranties of 90 days to five years for\nproduct defects, which are accrued at the time revenue is recognized.\nIn certain transactions, we are also the lessor in sales-type lease arrangements for network equipment\nthat have terms of 18 months to five years. These arrangements typically include network equipment,\nnetwork implementation services and maintenance services.\nQ\u0003Services & Support Segment\nTo complement our Network Solutions segment, we offer a complete portfolio of maintenance, network\nimplementation and solutions integration and managed services, which include hosted cloud services and\nsubscription services.\nQ\u0003Maintenance Revenue\nOur maintenance service periods range from one month to five years. Customers are typically invoiced\nand pay for maintenance services at the beginning of the maintenance period. We recognize revenue\nfor maintenance services on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period as our customers\nbenefit evenly throughout the contract term and deferred revenues, when applicable, are recorded\nin current and non-current unearned revenue.\nQ\u0003Network Implementation Revenue\nWe recognize revenue for network implementation, which primarily consists of engineering, execution\nand enablement services at a point in time when each performance obligation is complete. If we have\nrecognized revenue but have not billed the customer, the right to consideration is recognized as a\ncontract asset that is included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The contract\nasset is transferred to accounts receivable when the completed performance obligation is invoiced\nto the customer.\nAccounting Policy under Topic 605\nRevenue was generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred,\nthe product price was fixed or determinable, collection of the resulting receivable was reasonably assured,\nand product returns were reasonably estimable. For product sales, revenue was generally recognized upon\nshipment of the product to our customer in accordance with the title transfer terms of the sales agreement,\ngenerally Ex Works, per International Commercial Terms. In the case of consigned inventory, revenue was\nrecognized when the end customer assumes ownership of the product. Contracts that contained multiple\ndeliverables were evaluated to determine the units of accounting, and the consideration from the arrangement\nwas allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price and corresponding terms of the\ncontract. When this was not available, we were generally not able to determine third-party evidence of selling\nprice because of the extent of customization among competing products or services from other companies.\nFinancial Results 47\nIn these instances, we used best estimates to allocate consideration to each respective unit of accounting.\nThese estimates included analysis of respective bills of material and review and analysis of similar product\nand service offerings. We recorded revenue associated with installation services when respective contractual\nobligations are complete. In instances where customer acceptance was required, revenue was deferred until\nrespective acceptance criteria were met. Contracts that included both installation services and product sales\nwere evaluated for revenue recognition in accordance with contract terms. As a result, installation services\nmay have been considered a separate deliverable or may have been considered a combined single unit of\naccounting with the delivered product. Generally, either the purchaser, ADTRAN, or a third party would perform\nthe installation of our products. Shipping fees were recorded as revenue and the related costs were included\nin cost of sales. Sales taxes invoiced to customers were included in revenues and represented less than one\npercent of total revenues. The corresponding sales taxes paid were included in cost of goods sold. Value-\nadded taxes collected from customers in international jurisdictions were recorded in accrued expenses as a\nliability. Revenue was recorded net of discounts. Sales returns were recorded as a reduction of revenue and\naccrued based on historical sales return experience, which we believed provided a reasonable estimate of\nfuture returns.\nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue primarily represents customer billings on our maintenance service programs and unearned\nrevenues related to multiple element contracts where we still have contractual obligations to our customers.\nWe currently offer maintenance contracts ranging from one month to five years. Revenue attributable to\nmaintenance contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over the related contract term. In addition, we\nprovide software maintenance and a variety of hardware maintenance services to customers under contracts\nwith terms up to ten years. When we defer revenue related to multiple performance obligations where we still\nhave contractual obligations, we also defer the related costs. Current deferred costs are included in prepaid\nexpenses and other current assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $1.6 million\nand $2.4 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Non-current deferred costs are included in\nother assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $0.1 million and $0.8 million as of\nDecember 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nEarnings (Loss) per Share\nEarnings (loss) per common share and earnings (loss) per common share assuming dilution, are based on\nthe weighted average number of common shares and, when dilutive, common equivalent shares outstanding\nduring the year. See Note 17 for additional information.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company records assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, when applicable,\nand intangible assets recognized as part of business combinations based on their fair values on the date of\nacquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible\nassets and liabilities assumed acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the estimated fair values of net tangible\nand intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceed the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain\nis recorded. The Company’s estimates of fair value are based on historical experience, industry knowledge,\ncertain information obtained from the management of the acquired company and, in some cases, valuations\nperformed by independent third-party firms. The results of operations of acquired companies are included in\nthe accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations since their dates of acquisition. Costs incurred to\ncomplete the business combination, such as legal, accounting or other professional fees are charged to selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses as incurred.\n48 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nHistorically, we have participated in foreign exchange forward contracts in connection with the management of\nexposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as outlined below.\nCash Flow Hedges\nOur cash flow hedging activities utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements\nin exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the planned purchase of products from\nforeign suppliers. Purchases of U.S. denominated inventory by our European subsidiary represent our primary\nexposure. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated\nother comprehensive income. Amounts related to cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other\ncomprehensive income to earnings when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings. This reclassification is\nrecorded in the same line item of the consolidated statements of income as where the effects of the hedged\nitem are recorded, which is cost of sales.\nUndesignated Hedges\nWe have certain customers and suppliers who are invoiced or pay in a non-functional currency. Changes in the\nmonetary exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, as outstanding\nnon-functional balances are revalued to the functional currency through earnings. When appropriate, we utilize\nforeign exchange forward contracts to help manage the volatility relating to these valuation exposures. All changes\nin the fair value of our derivative instruments that do not qualify for, or are not designated for, hedged accounting\ntransactions are recognized in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Our derivative\ninstruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. Our derivative instruments\nare not subject to master netting arrangements and are not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial\nInstruments. ASU 2016-13 requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial\ninstruments held at amortized cost. In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements\nto Topic 326 Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, that clarifies receivables arising from operating leases are\nnot within the scope of the credit losses standard, but rather should be accounted for in accordance with\nthe leases standard. In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326,\nFinancial Instruments–Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments,\nwhich clarifies the accounting for transfers between classifications of debt securities and clarifies that entities\nshould include expected recoveries on financial assets in the calculation of the current expected credit loss\nallowance. In addition, renewal options that are not unconditionally cancelable should be considered in the\ndetermination of expected credit losses. In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments\n– Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief, which amends ASU 2016-13 to allow companies, upon\nadoption, to elect the fair value option on financial instruments that were previously recorded at amortized cost\nif they meet certain criteria. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-11, Codification improvements to\nTopic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, which makes various narrow-scope amendments to the new\ncredit losses standard, such as, providing disclosure relief for accrued interest receivables. All of these ASUs\nare effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019,\nwith early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect these ASUs will have on our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying\nthe Test for Goodwill Impairment. ASU 2017-04 simplifies the measurement of goodwill by eliminating step\n2 of the goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2017-04, entities will be required to compare the fair value of a\nreporting unit to its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying\namount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or interim impairment tests\nFinancial Results 49\nperformed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for annual or\ninterim impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The amendments should be applied\nprospectively. We are currently evaluating ASU 2017-04, but do not expect it will have a material effect on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-\nChanges to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which changes the fair value measurement\ndisclosure requirements of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. The amendments in this ASU are the result of\na broader disclosure project, Concepts Statement No. 8 — Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting —\nChapter 8 — Notes to Financial Statements, which the FASB finalized on August 28, 2018. The FASB used the\nguidance in the Concepts Statement to improve the effectiveness of ASC 820’s disclosure requirements. ASU\n2018-13 provides users of financial statements with information about assets and liabilities measured at fair value\nin the statement of financial position or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. More specifically, ASU\n2018-13 requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs that are used to arrive at measures of fair\nvalue, including judgments and assumptions that are made in determining fair value. In addition, ASU 2018-13\nrequires disclosures regarding the uncertainty in the fair value measurements as of the reporting date and how\nchanges in fair value measurements affect performance and cash flows. ASU 2018-13 is effective for fiscal years,\nand interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the\neffect of ASU 2018-13, but do not expect it will have a material effect on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General\n(Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans,\nwhich makes changes to and clarifies the disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other\npostretirement plans. ASU 2018-14 requires additional disclosures related to the reasons for significant gains and\nlosses affecting the benefit obligation and an explanation of any other significant changes in the benefit obligation\nor plan assets that are not otherwise apparent in other disclosures required by ASC 715. ASU 2018-14 also clarifies\nthe guidance in ASC 715 to require disclosure of the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) and fair value of plan\nassets for pension plans with PBOs in excess of plan assets and the accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) and\nfair value of plan assets for pension plans with ABOs in excess of plan assets. ASU 2018-14 is effective for public\nbusiness entities for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020. We are currently evaluating the effect of ASU\n2018-14, but do not expect it will have a material effect on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic\n350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That\nIs a Service Contract. ASU 2018-15 clarifies certain aspects of ASU 2015-05, Customer’s Accounting for Fees\nPaid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. Specifically, ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing\nimplementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for\ncapitalizing implementations costs incurred to develop or obtain internal use software. ASU 2018-15 is effective\nfor fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early\nadoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of ASU 2018-15, but do not expect it will have a\nmaterial effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for\nIncome Taxes. The amendments in this update simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing various\nexceptions, such as, the exception to the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation when there is a\nloss from continuing operations and income or a gain from other items. The amendments in this update, also\nsimplify the accounting for income taxes related to income-based franchise taxes and requiring that an entity\n50 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report\nreflect enacted tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes\nthe enactment date. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,\nbeginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of\nASU 2019-12, but do not expect it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nDuring 2019, we adopted the following accounting standards, which had the following impacts on our\nconsolidated financial statements:\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires an entity to recognize\nright-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity’s\nleasing arrangements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842,\nLeases, which clarified certain aspects of ASU 2016-02, as well as ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted\nImprovements, which provided for an optional transition method allowing for the application of the legacy lease\nguidance, Leases (Topic 840), including its disclosure requirements, for the comparative periods presented\nin the year of adoption, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new lease standard recognized as\nan adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01,\nLeases (Topic 842) Codification Improvements, which removed the requirement for an entity to disclose in the\ninterim periods after adoption, the effect of the change on income from continuing operations, net income, any\nother affected financial statement line item and any affected per share amount. For lessors, the new leasing\nstandard requires leases to be classified as sales-type, direct financing or operating leases. These criteria focus\non the transfer of control of the underlying lease asset. This standard, and its related updates, were effective for\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.\nThe Company adopted the new standard on January 1, 2019, the effective date of our initial application,\nusing the optional transition method. At that time, the Company elected to carry forward the legacy ASC 840\ndisclosures for comparative periods and, therefore, did not adjust the comparative period financial information\nprior to January 1, 2019. In addition, the Company elected the package of practical expedients which allows\nfor companies to not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, not reassess\nhistorical lease classifications for expired or existing contracts and not reassess initial direct costs for existing\nleases. Additionally, the Company elected the practical expedients which allow the use of hindsight when\ndetermining the lease term, the short-term lease recognition exemption and the option to not separate lease\nand nonlease components. The adoption of this standard resulted in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and\ncorresponding right-of-use liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets of $10.3 million as of January 1, 2019,\nprimarily related to our operating leases for office space, automobiles and other equipment.\nAs a lessee, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Statement of\nIncome or Statement of Cash Flows. See Note 9 for additional information.\nAs a lessor, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheet,\nConsolidated Statement of Income or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Prior to and after adoption, all of\nour leases in which we are the lessor were classified as sales-type leases.\nFinancial Results 51\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-08, Receivables – Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic\n310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities, which shortened the amortization\nperiod for the premium on certain purchased callable debt securities to the earliest call date. ASU 2017-08 was\neffective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The\namendments were required to be applied through a modified-retrospective transition approach that required\na cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The\nCompany adopted ASU 2017-08 on January 1, 2019, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material\neffect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to\nAccounting for Hedging Activities. ASU 2017-12 expanded and refined hedge accounting for both financial and\nnon-financial risk components, aligned the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments\nand hedge items in the financial statements, and included certain targeted improvements to ease the application\nof current guidance related to the assessment of hedge effectiveness. In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU\n2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)\nOvernight Index Swap (“OIS”) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting, which permits the OIS\nrate based on SOFR as a U.S. benchmark interest rate. Both ASU 2017-12 and ASU 2018-16 were effective for\nfiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company\nadopted ASU 2017-12 on January 1, 2019, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on\nour consolidated financial statements as we did not have any hedging instruments as of the date of adoption.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income\n(Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Comprehensive Income. ASU 2018-02\nallowed for an optional reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for\nstranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. ASU 2018-02 was effective for fiscal years,\nand interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted ASU\n2018-02 on January 1, 2019, and upon adoption reclassified $0.4 million of stranded tax effects created by rate\nchanges related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to retained earnings.\nNote 2 – Business Combinations\nIn November 2018, we acquired SmartRG, Inc., a provider of carrier-class, open-source connected home\nplatforms and cloud services for broadband service providers for cash consideration. This transaction was\naccounted for as a business combination. We have included the financial results of this acquisition in our\nconsolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. These revenues are included in the Subscriber\nSolutions & Experience category within the Network Solutions and Services & Support reportable segments.\nContingent liabilities with a fair value totaling $1.2 million were recognized at the acquisition date, the payments\nof which were dependent upon SmartRG achieving future revenue, EBIT or customer purchase order milestones\nduring the first half of 2019. The required milestones were not achieved and therefore, we recognized a gain of\n$1.2 million upon the reversal of these liabilities during the second quarter of 2019.\nAn escrow in the amount of $2.8 million was set up at the acquisition date to fund post-closing working capital\nsettlements and to satisfy indemnity obligations to the Company arising from any inaccuracy or breach of\nrepresentations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the sellers. The escrow is subject to\narbitration. In December 2019, $1.3 million of the $2.8 million was released from the escrow account pursuant\nto the agreement, with the final settlement of the remaining balance expected during the fourth quarter of\n2020. The remaining minimum and maximum potential release of funds to the seller ranges from no payment\nto $1.5 million.\n52 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report\nWe recorded goodwill of $3.5 million as a result of this acquisition, which represents the excess of the purchase\nprice over the fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We assessed the recognition and\nmeasurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on historical and forecasted data for future\nperiods and concluded that our valuation procedures and resulting measures were appropriate.\nOn March 19, 2018, we acquired Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s (SEL) North American EPON business\nand entered into a technology license and OEM supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd.\n(SEI). This acquisition establishes ADTRAN as the North American market leader for EPON solutions for the\ncable MSO industry and it will accelerate the MSO market’s adoption of our open, programmable and scalable\narchitectures. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination. We have included the financial\nresults of this acquisition in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. These revenues\nare included in the Access & Aggregation and Subscriber Solutions & Experience categories within the Network\nSolutions reportable segment.\nWe recorded a bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, net of income taxes, which\nis subject to customary working capital adjustments between the parties. The bargain purchase gain of $11.3\nmillion represents the difference between the fair-value of the net assets acquired over the cash paid. SEI, an\nOEM supplier based in Japan, is the global market leader in EPON. SEI’s Broadband Networks Division, through\nits SEL subsidiary, operated a North American EPON business that included sales, marketing, support, and\nregion-specific engineering development. The North American EPON market is primarily driven by the Tier 1\ncable MSO operators and has developed more slowly than anticipated. Through the transaction, SEI divested\nits North American EPON assets and established a relationship with ADTRAN. The transfer of these assets to\nADTRAN, which included key customer relationships and a required assumption by ADTRAN of relatively low\nincremental expenses, along with the value of the technology license and OEM supply agreement, resulted in\nthe bargain purchase gain. We have assessed the recognition and measurement of the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed based on historical and forecasted data for future periods and we have concluded that our\nvaluation procedures and resulting measures were appropriate. The gain is included in the line item ”Gain on\nbargain purchase of a business” in the 2018 Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe final allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed at the acquisition date for SmartRG and the final allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair\nvalue of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date for Sumitomo are as follows:\n(In thousands) Sumitomo SmartRG\nAssets\nTangible assets aquired $1,006 $8,594\nIntangible assets 22,100 9,960\nGoodwill — 3,476\nTotal assets acquired 23,106 22,030\nLiabilities\nLiabilities Assumed (3,978) (6,001)\nTotal liabilities assumed (3,978) (6,001)\nTotal net assets 19,128 16,029\nGain on bargain purchase of a business, net of tax (11,322) —\nTotal purchase price $7,806 $16,029\nFinancial Results 53\nOur Consolidated Statements of Income include the following revenue and net loss attributable to SmartRG and\nSumitomo since the date of acquisition:\nMarch 19, 2018 to\n(In thousands) December 31, 2018\nRevenue $9,186\nNet Loss $(1,297)\nThe details of the acquired intangible assets from the SmartRG and Sumitomo acquisitions are as follows:\n(In thousands) Value Life (in years)\nCustomer relationships $15,190 3 – 12\nDeveloped technology 7,400 7\nLicensed technology 5,900 9\nSupplier relationship 2,800 2\nLicensing agreements 560 5 – 10\nTrade name 210 3\nTotal $32,060\nThe following unaudited supplemental pro forma information presents the financial results as if the acquisition\nof SmartRG and Sumitomo had occurred on January 1, 2017.

As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any\nsignificant performance obligations related to customer contracts that had an original expected duration of\none year or more, other than maintenance services, which are satisfied over time. As a practical expedient, for\ncertain contracts recognize revenue equal to the amounts we are entitled to invoice which correspond to the\nvalue of completed performance obligations to date. The amount related to these performance obligations was\n$13.3 million as of December 31, 2018. The amount related to these performance obligations was $13.6 million\nas of December 31, 2019, and the Company expects to recognize 64% of such revenue over the next 12 months\nwith the remainder thereafter.\nThe following table provides information about accounts receivables, contract assets and unearned revenue\nfrom contracts with customers:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n(In thousands) 2019 2018\nAccounts receivable $90,531 $99,385\nContract assets (1) $2,812 $3,766\nUnearned revenue $11,963 $17,940\nNon-current unearned revenue $6,012 $5,296\n(1) Included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nOf the outstanding unearned revenue balance as of December 31, 2018, $12.7 million was recognized as\nrevenue during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNote 4 – Stock-Based Compensation\nStock Incentive Program Descriptions\nIn January 2006, the Board of Directors adopted the ADTRAN, Inc. 2006 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the\n“2006 Plan”), which authorized 13.0 million shares of common stock for issuance to certain employees and\nofficers through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs and\nrestricted stock. The 2006 Plan was adopted by stockholder approval at our annual meeting of stockholders\nheld in May 2006. Options granted under the 2006 Plan typically become exercisable beginning after one\nyear of continued employment, normally pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning on the first\nanniversary of the grant date and had a ten-year contractual term. The 2006 Plan was replaced in May 2015 by\nthe ADTRAN, Inc. 2015 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”). Expiration dates of options outstanding\nas of December 31, 2019 under the 2006 Plan range from 2020 to 2024.\nFinancial Results 55\nIn January 2015, the Board of Directors adopted the 2015 Plan, which authorized 7.7 million shares of common\nstock for issuance to certain employees and officers through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock\noptions, stock appreciation rights, PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock. The 2015 Plan was adopted by stockholder\napproval at our annual meeting of stockholders held in May 2015. PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock granted under\nthe 2015 Plan reduce the shares authorized for issuance under the 2015 Plan by 2.5 shares of common stock for\neach share underlying the award. Options granted under the 2015 Plan typically become exercisable beginning\nafter one year of continued employment, normally pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning on the\nfirst anniversary of the grant date and have a ten-year contractual term. Expiration dates of options outstanding\nas of December 31, 2019 under the 2015 Plan range from 2025 to 2026.\nOur stockholders approved the 2010 Directors Stock Plan (the “2010 Directors Plan”) in May 2010, under which\n0.5 million shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance. This plan replaced the 2005 Directors\nStock Option Plan. Under the 2010 Directors Plan, the Company may issue stock options, restricted stock and\nRSUs to our non-employee directors. Stock awards issued under the 2010 Directors Plan become vested in\nfull on the first anniversary of the grant date. Options issued under the 2010 Directors Plan had a ten-year\ncontractual term. All remaining options under the 2010 Directors Plan expired in 2019.\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, PSUs, RSUs and\nrestricted stock for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, which was recognized as follows:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018 2017\nStock-based compensation expense included in cost of sales $369 $418 $379\nSelling, general and administrative expense 3,889 3,989 4,063\nResearch and development expense 2,704 2,748 2,991\nStock-based compensation expense included in operating\n6,593 6,737 7,054\nexpenses\nTotal stock-based compensation expense 6,962 7,155 7,433\nTax benefit for expense associated with non-qualified options,\n(1,659) (1,432) (1,699)\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock\nTotal stock-based compensation expense, net of tax $5,303 $5,723 $5,734\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock\nUnder the 2015 Plan, awards other than stock options, including PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock, may be\ngranted to certain employees and officers.\nUnder our market-based PSU program, the number of shares of common stock earned by a recipient is\nsubject to a market condition based on ADTRAN’s relative total shareholder return against all companies in the\nNASDAQ Telecommunications Index at the end of a three-year performance period. Depending on the relative\ntotal shareholder return over the performance period, the recipient may earn from 0% to 150% of the shares\nunderlying the PSUs, with the shares earned distributed upon the vesting. The fair value of the award is based\non the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the expected outcome of the impact\nof market conditions using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method. A portion of the granted PSUs vests\nand the underlying shares become deliverable upon the death or disability of the recipient or upon a change of\ncontrol of ADTRAN, as defined by the 2015 Plan. The recipients of the PSUs receive dividend credits based on\nthe shares of common stock underlying the PSUs. The dividend credits vest and are earned in the same manner\nas the PSUs and are paid in cash upon the issuance of common stock for the PSUs.\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a one-time\nPSU grant of 0.5 million shares that contained performance conditions and would have vested at the end of a\nthree-year period if such performance conditions were met. The fair value of these performance-based PSU\nawards was equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. These awards were forfeited during the\nfirst quarter of 2020 as the performance conditions were not achieved.\n56 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report\nThe fair value of RSUs and restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the business day\nimmediately preceding the grant date. RSUs and restricted stock vest ratably over four-year and one-year\nperiods, respectively.\nWe will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of\nstock-based compensation. If circumstances change, and additional data becomes available over time, we may\nchange our assumptions and methodologies, which may materially impact our fair value determination.\nThe following table is a summary of our PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018\nand 2019 and the changes that occurred during 2019:\nWeighted\nNumber Average Grant\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) of Shares Date Fair Value\nUnvested PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding, December 31, 2018 1,570 $18.52\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock granted 897 $9.63\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock vested (368) $17.23\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock forfeited (208) $18.24\nUnvested RSUs and restricted stock outstanding, December 31, 2019 1,891 $14.58\nAs of December 31, 2019, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the non-vested portion of market-\nbased PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock was approximately $17.2 million, which is expected to be recognized\nover an average remaining recognition period of 2.9 years and adjusted for actual forfeitures as they occur.\nThe following table details the significant assumptions that impact the fair value estimate of the market-based PSUs:\n2019 2018 2017\nEstimated fair value per share $9.53 to $18.05 $16.59 $24.17\nExpected volatility 32.7% to 38.9% 27.98% to 31.58% 27.03%\nRisk-free interest rate 1.6% to 2.46% 2.11% to 2.99% 1.78%\nExpected dividend yield 2.3% to 4.09% 1.83% to 2.49% 1.74%\nAs of December 31, 2019, 1.0 million shares were available for issuance under shareholder-approved equity\nplans in connection with the grant and exercise of stock options, PSU’s, RSU’s or restricted stock.\nStock Options\nThe following table is a summary of our stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the\nchanges that occurred during 2019:\nWeighted Average\nNumber Weighted Remaining Aggregate\nof Average Contractual Intrinsic\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) Options Exercise Price Life in Years Value\nStock options outstanding, December 31, 2018 4,382 $22.91 4.10 $ —\nStock options granted — $ —\nStock options exercised (34) $15.53\nStock options forfeited (32) $15.56\nStock options expired (744) $23.72\nStock options outstanding, December 31, 2019 3,572 $22.88 3.40 $ —\nStock options exercisable, December 31, 2019 3,570 $22.89 3.40 $ —\nFinancial Results 57\nAll of the options above were issued at exercise prices that approximated fair market value at the date of grant.\nAs of December 31, 2019, total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options was\napproximately $11 thousand, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period\nof one year and will be adjusted for actual forfeitures as they occur.\nThe aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represent the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference\nbetween ADTRAN’s closing stock price on the last trading day of 2019 and the exercise price, multiplied by the\nnumber of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders\nexercised their options on December 31, 2019. The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on\nthe fair market value of ADTRAN’s stock and was $0 as of December 31, 2019.\nThe total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $0.1 million, $0.2 million\nand $3.4 million, respectively. The fair value of options fully vesting during 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $0.9\nmillion, $2.5 million and $4.3 million, respectively.\nThe following table further describes our stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2019:\nOptions Outstanding Options Exercisable\nOptions Weighted Avg.

The Black-Scholes Model requires the input of certain\nassumptions that involve judgment. Because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from\nthose of traded options, and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value\nestimate, existing models may not provide reliable measures of fair value of our stock options. The stock option\npricing model requires the use of several assumptions that impact the fair value estimate. These variables\ninclude, but are not limited to, the volatility of our stock price and employee exercise behaviors.\nThere were no stock options granted in during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017.\n58 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report\nNote 5 – Investments\nDebt Securities and Other Investments\nAs of December 31, 2019, we held the following debt securities and other investments, recorded at fair value:\nGross Gross\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair\n(In thousands) Cost Gains Losses Value\nCorporate bonds $9,304 $80 $ — $9,384\nMunicipal fixed-rate bonds 930 — — 930\nAsset-backed bonds 6,867 26 (3) 6,890\nMortgage/Agency-backed bonds 6,944 26 (8) 6,962\nU.S. government bonds 12,311 21 (9) 12,323\nForeign government bonds 372 — (1) 371\nValuable rate demand notes 800 — — 800\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities held at fair value $37,528 $153 $(21) $37,660\nAs of December 31, 2018, we held the following debt securities and other investments, recorded at fair value:\nGross Gross\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair\n(In thousands) Cost Gains Losses Value\nCorporate bonds $20,777 $19 (112) $20,684\nMunicipal fixed-rate bonds 1,339 — (26) 1,313\nAsset-backed bonds 5,230 5 (14) 5,221\nMortgage/Agency-backed bonds 3,833 2 (44) 3,791\nU.S. government bonds 9,271 1 (66) 9,206\nForeign government bonds 592 — (8) 584\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities held at fair value $41,042 $27 $(270) $40,799\nAs of December 31, 2019, our debt securities had the following contractual maturities:\nMortgage/\nMunicipal Asset- Agency- U.S. Foreign\nCorporate Fixed-rate backed backed Government Government\n(In thousands) Bonds Bonds Bonds Bonds Bonds Bonds\nLess than one year $4,005 $ — $396 $ — $ — $ —\nOne to two years 4,120 930 760 213 1,347 —\nTwo to three years 967 — 1,632 1,424 9,344 —\nThree to five years 292 — 2,092 494 1,632 371\nFive to ten years — — 1,719 792 — —\nMore than ten years — — 291 4,039 — —\nTotal $9,384 $930 $6,890 $6,962 $12,323 $371\nActual maturities may differ from contractual maturities as some borrowers have the right to call or prepay\nobligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.\nFinancial Results 59\nRealized gains and losses on sales of securities are computed under the specific identification method.

Realized gains\nand losses on marketable equity securities were included in net investment gain (loss). Unrealized gains and\nlosses were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of deferred taxes, on the\nbalance sheet.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-01, which requires us to measure all equity investments that do not\nresult in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value, with any changes in fair\nvalue recognized in net investment gain (loss). Upon adoption, we reclassified $3.2 million of net unrealized\ngains related to marketable equity securities from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to opening\nretained earnings.\nASU 2016-01 also provides a measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have a readily\ndeterminable fair value in which investments can be recorded at cost less impairment, if any, adjusted for\nobservable price changes for an identical or similar investment. We elected to record our equity investment that\ndoes not have a readily determinable fair value using the measurement alternative method. As of December 31,\n2018, the Company had a note receivable of approximately $4.3 million, which was included in other receivables\non the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, this amount was repaid\nand reissued in the form of debt and equity. Approximately $3.4 million was issued as an equity investment,\nwhich represented a non-cash investing activity. The carrying value of this investment under the measurement\nalternative was $3.4 million as of December 31, 2019. The remaining amount, approximately $0.9 million, was\nconverted into a new note receivable, which is included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets and represents a non-cash operating activity.\nRealized and unrealized gains and losses for our marketable equity securities for the twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2019 were as follows:\n(in thousands) 2019 2018\nRealized gains (losses) on equity securities sold $(96) $1,306\nUnrealized gains (losses) on equity securities held (11,472) (4,821)\nTotal gain (loss) recognized, net $(11,376) $(3,515)\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, gross unrealized losses related to individual investments in a continuous\nloss position for twelve months or longer were not material.\nU.S. GAAP establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy based upon observable and unobservable inputs for\nfair value measurement of financial instruments:\nQ\u0003Level 1 – Observable outputs; values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities\nin an active market;\nQ\u0003Level 2 – Significant inputs that are observable; values based on quoted prices in markets that are not\nactive or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly;\nQ\u0003Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs; values based on prices or valuation techniques that require\ninputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.

During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019, the Company recognized impairment charges of $3.9 million related to the abandonment\nof certain information technology projects in which we had previously capitalized expenses related to these\nprojects. The impairment charges were determined based on actual costs incurred as part of the projects. No\nimpairment charges were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nNote 9 – Leases\nWe have operating leases for office space, automobiles and various other equipment in the U.S. and in certain\ninternational locations. We also reviewed other contracts, such as manufacturing agreements and service\nagreements, for potential embedded leases. We specifically reviewed these other contracts to determine\nwhether we have the right to substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of any specified assets or\nthe right to direct the use of any specified assets, either of which would indicate the existence of a lease.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our operating leases had remaining lease terms of one month to six years, some\nof which included options to extend the leases for up to nine years, and some of which included options to\nterminate the leases within three months. For those leases that are reasonably assured to be renewed, we\nhave included the option to extend as part of our right of use asset and lease liability. Leases with an initial\nterm of 12 months or less were not recorded on the balance sheet and lease expense for these leases is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense related to these short-term leases was\n$0.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, and is included in cost of sales, selling, general\nand administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. Lease expense related to variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate, such as real\nestate taxes and insurance reimbursements, was $0.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nFor lease agreements entered into or reassessed after the adoption of Topic 842, we elected to not separate\nlease and nonlease components. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees\nor material restrictive covenants.\n64 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases is as follows:\nDecember 31, January 1,\n(In thousands) Classification 2019 2019 (1)\nAssets\nRight of use lease assets Other Assets $8,452 $10,322\nTotal lease asset $8,452 $10,322\nLiabilities\nCurrent lease liability Accrued expenses $2,676 $2,948\nNon-current lease liability Other non-current liabilities 5,818 7,374\nTotal lease liability $8,494 $10,322\n(1) Reflects the adoption of the new lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019.\nThe components of lease expense included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the twelve months\nended December 31, 2019 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2019\nResearch and development expenses $2,417\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 1,400\nCost of sales 64\nTotal operating lease expense $3,881\nAs of December 31, 2019, operating lease liabilities included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet by future\nmaturity were as follows:\n(In thousands) Amount\n2020 $2,856\n2021 2,412\n2022 1,705\n2023 1,160\n2024 482\nThereafter 264\nTotal lease payments 8,879\nLess: Interest (385)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $8,494\nFuture operating lease payments include $0.7 million related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably\ncertain of being exercised.

We used the\nincremental borrowing rate on January 1, 2019, for operating leases that commenced on or prior to that date. The\nincremental borrowing rate was determined on a portfolio basis by grouping leases with similar terms as well as\ngrouping leases based on a U.S. dollar or Euro functional currency. The actual rate was then determined based\non a credit spread over LIBOR as well as the Bloomberg Curve Matrix for the U.S. Communications section.

Our sales-type lease arrangements contain either a provision whereby the network equipment\nreverts back to us upon the expiration of the lease or a provision that allows the lessee to purchase the network\nequipment at a bargain purchase amount at the end of the lease. In addition, our sales-type lease arrangements\ndo not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The allocation of the consideration\nbetween lease and nonlease components is determined by stand-alone selling price by component. The net\ninvestment in sales-type leases consists of lease receivables less unearned income. Collectability of sales-type\nleases is evaluated periodically at an individual customer level. The Company has elected to exclude taxes\nrelated to sales-type leases from revenue and the associated expense of such taxes. As of December 31, 2019\nand 2018, we did not have an allowance for credit losses for our net investment in sales-type leases.

Goodwill\nrelated to our SmartRG acquisition was reduced by $0.1 million during the twelve months ended December 31,\n2019 as a result of a measurement period adjustment.\nWe evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual\nevaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the\nreporting unit below its carrying amount. We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine\nwhether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned is less\nthan its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step impairment\ntest. If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-\nstep impairment test will be performed. Based on the results of our qualitative assessment for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, there were no events or circumstances that occurred that would more likely\nthan not reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying value.\nNote 11 – Intangible Assets\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our intangible assets were comprised of the following:\n2019 2018\nGross Accumulated Net Gross Accumulated Net\n(In thousands) Value Amortization Value Value Amortization Value\nCustomer relationships $22,356 $(7,233) $15,123 $22,455 $(5,380) $17,075\nDeveloped technology 10,170 (3,379) 6,791 12,801 (4,867) 7,934\nLicensed technology 5,900 (1,174) 4,726 5,900 (520) 5,380\nSupplier relationships 2,800 (2,508) 292 2,800 (1,108) 1,692\nIntellectual property — — — 930 (930) —\nLicensing agreements 560 (79) 481 560 (5) 555\nPatents 500 (226) 274 500 (157) 343\nTrade names 310 (176) 134 310 (106) 204\nNon-compete — — — 200 (200) —\nTotal $42,596 $(14,775) $27,821 $46,456 $(13,273) $33,183\nAmortization expense was $5.3 million, $2.3 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019,\n2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the estimated future amortization expense of intangible assets is as follows:\n(In thousands) Amount\n2020 $4,444\n2021 4,095\n2022 3,471\n2023 3,320\n2024 3,226\nThereafter 9,265\nTotal $27,821\n68 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report\nNote 12 – Alabama State Industrial Development Authority Financing\nand Economic Incentives\nIn conjunction with the 1995 expansion of our Huntsville, Alabama facility, we were approved for participation\nin an incentive program offered by the State of Alabama Industrial Development Authority (“the Authority”).\nPursuant to the program, on January 13, 1995, the Authority issued $20.0 million of its taxable revenue bonds\n(the “Taxable Revenue Bonds”) and loaned the proceeds from the sale of the Taxable Revenue Bonds to\nADTRAN. Further advances on the Taxable Revenue Bonds were made by the Authority, bringing the total\namount outstanding to $50.0 million. The Taxable Revenue Bonds bore interest, payable monthly with an\ninterest rate of 2% per annum. The Taxable Revenue Bond’s outstanding aggregate principal amount of $24.6\nmillion matured on January 1, 2020 and was repaid in full on January 2, 2020. The fair value of the bond as of\nDecember 31, 2019 was $24.6 million. We are required to make payments to the Authority in amounts necessary\nto pay the interest on the Taxable Revenue Bonds.

These funds serve as a collateral deposit against\nthe principal of this bond, and we have the right to set-off the balance of the Taxable Revenue Bonds with the\ncollateral deposit in order to reduce the balance of the indebtedness.\nIn conjunction with this program, we were eligible to receive certain economic incentives from the state of\nAlabama that reduce the amount of payroll withholdings that we were required to remit to the state for those\nemployment positions that qualify under the program. We realized economic incentives related to payroll\nwithholdings totaling $1.2 million, $1.4 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and\n2017, respectively.

As a result of the Act, we recognized\nan estimated expense of $11.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, of which $9.2 million related to the write-\ndown of deferred tax assets and $2.7 million related to tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings. We calculated\nour best estimate of the impact of the Act in our 2017 year-end income tax provision in accordance with Staff\nAccounting Bulletin No. 118, which was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a\nregistrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed to finalize the accounting\nfor certain income tax effects of the Act. Additional work to complete a more detailed analysis of historical\nforeign earnings, as well as the full impact relating to the write-down of deferred tax assets, was completed in\nthe third quarter of 2018 and resulted in a tax benefit of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, non-current deferred taxes related to our investments and our defined benefit\npension plan reflect deferred taxes on the net unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments\nand deferred taxes on unrealized losses in our pension plan. The net change in non-current deferred taxes\nassociated with these items, which resulted in a deferred tax benefit of $0.4 million and $2.8 million in 2019\nand 2018, respectively, was recorded as an adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), presented in the\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nFinancial Results 71\nThe Company continually reviews the adequacy of our valuation allowance and recognizes the benefits of\ndeferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax\nassets will be realized in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Due to our recent decrease in revenue and\nprofitability for 2019, and all other positive and negative objective evidence considered as part of our analysis,\nour ability to consider other subjective evidence such as projections for future growth is limited when evaluating\nwhether our deferred tax assets will be realized. As such, the Company was no longer able to conclude that\nit was more likely than not that our domestic deferred tax assets would be realized and a valuation allowance\nagainst our domestic deferred tax assets was established in the third quarter of 2019. The amount of the\ndeferred tax assets considered realizable may be adjusted in future periods in the event that sufficient evidence\nis present to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our domestic deferred tax\nassets will be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had gross deferred tax assets totaling $56.2 million offset by a valuation\nallowance totaling $48.6 million. Of the valuation allowance, $42.8 million was established in the current year\nprimarily related to our domestic deferred tax assets. The remaining $5.8 million established in prior periods\nrelated to state research and development credit carryforwards and foreign net operating loss and research\nand development credit carryforwards where we lack sufficient activity to realize those deferred tax assets. The\nremaining $7.6 million in deferred tax assets that were not offset by a valuation allowance are located in various\nforeign jurisdictions where the Company believes it is more likely than not we will realize these deferred tax\nassets.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to deferred tax assets is as follows:\nDecember 31, 2019\nDeferred Valuation Deferred Tax\n(In thousands) Tax Assets Allowance Assets, net\nDomestic $46,266 $(46,266) $ —\nInternational 9,911 (2,350) 7,561\nTotal $56,177 $(48,616) $7,561\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the deferred tax assets for foreign and domestic loss carry-forwards,\nresearch and development tax credits, unamortized research and development costs and state credit carry-\nforwards totaled $41.3 million and $28.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, $19.1 million of these\ndeferred tax assets will expire at various times between 2020 and 2039. The remaining deferred tax assets will\neither amortize through 2029 or carryforward indefinitely.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, our cash and cash equivalents were $73.8 million and $105.5\nmillion and short-term investments were $33.2 million and $3.2 million, which provided available short-term\nliquidity of $107.0 million and $108.7 million. Of these amounts, our foreign subsidiaries held cash of $52.3\nmillion and $87.1 million, respectively, representing approximately 48.9% and 80.1% of available short-term\nliquidity, which is used to fund on-going liquidity needs of these subsidiaries. We intend to permanently reinvest\nthese funds outside the U.S. except to the extent any of these funds can be repatriated without withholding tax\nand our current business plans do not indicate a need to repatriate to fund domestic operations. However, if all\nof these funds were repatriated to the U.S. or used for U.S. operations, certain amounts could be subject to tax.\nDue to the timing and circumstances of repatriation of such earnings, if any, it is not practical to determine the\namount of funds subject to unrecognized deferred tax liability.\nDuring 2019, 2018 and 2017, no income tax benefit or expense was recorded for stock options exercised as an\nadjustment to equity.\n72 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report\nThe change in the unrecognized income tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017\nis reconciled below:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018 2017\nBalance at beginning of period $1,868 $2,366 $2,226\nIncreases for tax position related to:\nPrior years — 3 465\nCurrent year 161 254 285\nDecreases for tax positions related to:\nPrior years (71) — (14)\nExpiration of applicable statute of limitations (471) (755) (596)\nBalance at end of period $1,487 $1,868 $2,366\nAs of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our total liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $1.5 million, $1.9\nmillion and $2.4 million, respectively, of which $1.4 million, $1.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively, would\nreduce our effective tax rate if we were successful in upholding all of the uncertain positions and recognized the\namounts recorded. We classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits\nas income tax expense. As of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the balances of accrued interest and penalties\nwere $0.5 million, $0.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively.\nWe do not anticipate a single tax position generating a significant increase or decrease in our liability for\nunrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of this reporting date. We file income tax returns in the U.S. for\nfederal and various state jurisdictions and several foreign jurisdictions. We are not currently under audit by the\nInternal Revenue Service. Generally, we are not subject to changes in income taxes by any taxing jurisdiction\nfor the years prior to 2016.\nNote 14 – Employee Benefit Plans\nPension Benefit Plan\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries.\nThe pension benefit plan obligations and funded status as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018\nChange in projected benefit obligation:\nProjected benefit obligation at beginning of period $37,245 $34,893\nService cost 1,471 1,193\nInterest cost 634 727\nActuarial loss - experience 453 38\nActuarial loss - assumptions 5,091 2,139\nBenefit payments (166) (138)\nEffects of foreign currency exchange rate changes (826) (1,607)\nProjected benefit obligation at end of period 43,902 37,245\nChange in plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of period 24,159 26,624\nActual gain (loss) on plan assets 4,392 (2,024)\nContributions — 688\nEffects of foreign currency exchange rate changes (535) (1,129)\nFair value of plan assets at end of period 28,016 24,159\nUnfunded status at end of period $(15,886) $(13,086)\nFinancial Results 73\nThe accumulated benefit obligation was $43.9 million and $37.2 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018,\nrespectively.

The expected return on\nour German plan assets that is utilized in determining the benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost is\nderived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term\nperformance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations, and correlations of returns among the\nasset classes that comprise the plans’ asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan\nperformance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return. The\ndiscount rate has been derived from the returns of high-quality, corporate bonds denominated in Euro currency\nwith durations close to the duration of our pension obligations.\n74 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report\nThe weighted-average assumptions that were used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the years\nended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:\n2019 2018 2017\nDiscount rate 1.75% 2.13% 1.90%\nRate of compensation increase 2.00% 2.00% 2.00%\nExpected long-term rates of return 5.90% 5.90% 5.90%\nThe weighted-average assumptions that were used to determine the benefit obligation as of December 31,\n2019 and 2018:\n2019 2018\nDiscount rate 1.00% 1.75%\nRate of compensation increase 2.00% 2.00%\nActuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). To the extent\nunamortized gains and losses exceed 10% of the higher of the market-related value of assets or the projected\nbenefit obligation, the excess is amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost over the remaining\nservice period of active participants. We estimate that $0.8 million will be amortized from accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) into net periodic pension cost in 2020 for the net actuarial loss.\nWe do not anticipate making any contributions to the pension plan in 2020.\nThe following pension benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to\nbe paid to participants:\n(In thousands)\n2020 $515\n2021 582\n2022 619\n2023 706\n2024 789\nThereafter 4,872\nTotal $8,083\nU.S. GAAP establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy based upon observable and unobservable inputs for\nfair value measurement of financial instruments:\nQ\u0003Level 1 – Observable outputs; values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities\nin an active market;\nQ\u0003Level 2 – Significant inputs that are observable; values based on quoted prices in markets that are not\nactive or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly;\nQ\u0003Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs; values based on prices or valuation techniques that require\ninputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.

Central to the policy are target allocation ranges by asset class, which is currently 50% for\nbond funds, 40% for equity funds and 10% cash, real estate and managed futures. The objectives of the target\nallocations are to maintain investment portfolios that diversify risk through prudent asset allocation parameters,\nachieve asset returns that meet or exceed the plans’ actuarial assumptions and achieve asset returns that are\ncompetitive with like institutions employing similar investment strategies.\nThe investment policy is periodically reviewed by us and a designated third-party fiduciary for investment\nmatters. The policy is established and administered in a manner that is compliant at all times with applicable\ngovernment regulations.\n401(k) Savings Plan\nWe maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. 401(k) Retirement Plan (the “Savings Plan”) for the benefit of our eligible\nemployees. The Savings Plan is intended to qualify under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and is intended to be a “safe harbor” 401(k) plan under Code Section\n401(k)(12). The Savings Plan allows employees to save for retirement by contributing part of their compensation\nto the plan on a tax-deferred basis. The Savings Plan also requires us to contribute a “safe harbor” amount each\nyear. We match up to 4% of employee contributions (100% of an employee’s first 3% of contributions and 50%\nof their next 2% of contributions), beginning on the employee’s one-year anniversary date. In calculating our\nmatching contribution, we only use compensation up to the statutory maximum under the Code ($280,000 for\n2019). All matching contributions under the Savings Plan vest immediately. Employer contribution expense and\nplan administration costs for the Savings Plan amounted to approximately $4.4 million, $4.4 million and $4.6\nmillion in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nDeferred Compensation Plans\nWe maintain four deferred compensation programs for certain executive management employees and our\nBoard of Directors.\nFor our executive management employees, the ADTRAN, Inc. Deferred Compensation Program for Employees\nis offered as a supplement to our tax-qualified 401(k) plan and is available to certain executive management\nemployees who have been designated by our Board of Directors. This deferred compensation plan allows\nparticipants to defer all or a portion of certain specified bonuses and up to 25% of remaining cash compensation\nand permits us to make matching contributions on a discretionary basis without the limitations that apply to\nthe 401(k) plan. To date, we have not made any matching contributions under this plan. We also maintain the\nADTRAN, Inc. Equity Deferral Program for Employees. Under this plan, participants may elect to defer all or a\nportion of their vested PSUs and RSUs to the plan. Such deferrals shall continue to be held and deemed to be\ninvested in shares of ADTRAN stock unless and until the amounts are distributed or such deferrals are moved\nto another deemed investment pursuant to an election made by the participant.\nFor our Board of Directors, we maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. Deferred Compensation Program for Directors. This\nprogram allows our Board of Directors to defer all or a portion of monetary remuneration paid to the Director,\nincluding, but not limited to, meeting fees and annual retainers. We also maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. Equity\nDeferral Program for Directors. Under this plan, participants may elect to defer all or a portion of their vested\nrestricted stock awards. Such deferrals shall continue to be held and deemed to be invested in shares of\nADTRAN stock unless and until the amounts are distributed or such deferrals are moved to another deemed\ninvestment pursuant to an election made by the director.\nFinancial Results 77\nWe have set aside the plan assets for all plans in a rabbi trust (the “Trust”) and all contributions are credited\nto bookkeeping accounts for the participants. The Trust assets are subject to the claims of our creditors in\nthe event of bankruptcy or insolvency. The assets of the Trust are deemed to be invested in pre-approved\nmutual funds as directed by each participant and the participant’s bookkeeping account is credited with the\nearnings and losses attributable to those investments. Benefits are scheduled to be distributed six months\nafter termination of employment in a single lump sum payment or annual installments paid over a three or ten-\nyear term based on the participant’s election. Distributions will be made on a pro-rata basis from each of the\nhypothetical investments of the participant’s account in cash. Any whole shares of ADTRAN, Inc. common stock\nthat are distributed will be distributed in-kind.\nAssets of the Trust are deemed invested in mutual funds that cover an investment spectrum ranging from\nequities to money market instruments. These mutual funds are publicly quoted and reported at fair value.

ADTRAN, Inc. et\nal., Docket No. 19-cv-09619, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork against the Company, two of its current executive officers and one of its former executive officers. The\ncomplaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages on behalf\nof purported purchasers of ADTRAN securities between February 28, 2019 and October 9, 2019. The lawsuit\nclaims that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding, and/or failed to disclose\nmaterial adverse facts about, the Company’s business, operations and prospects, specifically relating to the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting, excess and obsolete inventory reserves, financial results\nand shipments to a Latin American customer. Investors in ADTRAN securities had until December 16, 2019 to\nmove the court to serve as lead plaintiff in this action.\nOn December 16, 2019, two purported investors in ADTRAN securities filed motions seeking to be appointed\nlead plaintiff in the case. On January 6, 2020, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork granted Defendants’ unopposed request to transfer the case to the United States District Court for the\nNorthern District of Alabama, where the case is now pending as Burbridge v.

Such Legal\nMatters, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.\nAdditionally, an unfavorable outcome in a legal matter, including in a patent dispute, could require the Company\nto pay damages, entitle claimants to other relief, such as royalties, or could prevent the Company from selling\nsome of its products in certain jurisdictions. While the Company cannot predict with certainty the results of\nthe Legal Matters in which it is currently involved, the Company does not expect that the ultimate outcome of\nsuch Legal Matters will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its business, results of\noperations, financial condition or cash flows.\nInvestment Commitment\nWe have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, of which $7.7 million\nhas been applied to these commitments as of December 31, 2019.\nPerformance Bonds\nCertain contracts, customers and/or jurisdictions in which we do business require us to provide various\nguarantees of performance such as bid bonds, performance bonds and customs bonds. As of December 31,\n2019, we had commitments related to these bonds totaling $9.3 million which expire at various dates through\nAugust 2024. As of December 31, 2018, we had commitments related to these bonds totaling $6.5 million.\nAlthough the triggering events vary from contract to contract, in general we would only be liable for the amount\nof these guarantees in the event of default in our under each contract, the probability of which we believe is\nremote.\nNote 17 – Earnings (Loss) per Share\nA summary of the calculation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the years ended December 31,\n2019, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\n(In thousands, except for per share amounts) 2019 2018 2017\nNumerator\nNet Income (Loss) $(52,982) $(19,342) $23,840\nDenominator\nWeighted average number of shares—basic 47,836 47,880 48,153\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nStock options — — 406\nRestricted stock and restricted stock units — — 140\nWeighted average number of shares—diluted 47,836 47,880 48,699\nEarnings (loss) per share—basic $(1.11) $(0.40) $0.50\nEarnings (loss) per share—diluted $(1.11) $(0.40) $0.49\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, 5.7 million and 2.5 million, respectively, shares of\nunvested stock options, PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS due\nto their anti-dilutive effect.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, 3.2 million stock options were outstanding but were not included in\nthe computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because the options’ exercise prices were greater than\nthe average market price of the common shares, therefore making them anti-dilutive under the treasury stock\nmethod.\nFinancial Results 81\nNote 18 – Restructuring\nDuring the second half of 2019, the Company implemented a restructuring plan to realign its expense structure\nwith the reduction in revenue experienced in recent years and overall Company objectives. Management\nassessed the efficiency of our operations and consolidated locations and personnel, among other things,\nwhere possible. As part of this restructuring plan, the Company announced plans to reduce its overall operating\nexpenses, both in the U.S and internationally.\nIn February 2019, the Company announced the restructuring of certain of our workforce predominantly in\nGermany, which included the closure of our office location in Munich, Germany accompanied by relocation\nor severance benefits for the affected employees. We also offered voluntary early retirement to certain other\nemployees, which was announced in March 2019.\nIn January 2018, the Company announced an early retirement incentive program for employees that met certain\ndefined requirements. The cumulative amount incurred during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to this\nrestructuring program was $7.3 million. We did not incur any additional expenses related to this restructuring\nprogram during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending restructuring liability, which is included in accrued wages and\nbenefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, is as follows:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018\nBalance at beginning of period $185 $205\nPlus: Amounts charged to cost and expense 6,014 7,261\nLess: Amounts paid (4,631) (7,281)\nBalance at end of period $1,568 $185\nThe components of restructuring expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income are for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018 2017\nSelling, general and administrative expenses $2,360 $2,655 $152\nResearch and development expenses 2,869 1,831 122\nCost of sales 785 2,775 —\nTotal restructuring expenses $6,014 $7,261 $274\nThe following table represents the components of restructuring expense by geographic area for the years\nended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018 2017\nUnited States $3,336 $7,120 $274\nInternational 2,678 141 —\nTotal restructuring expenses $6,014 $7,261 $274\n82 ADTRAN 2019 Annual Report\nNote 19 – Summarized Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)\nThe following table presents unaudited quarterly operating results for each of our last eight fiscal quarters.\nThis information has been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited financial statements and includes\nall adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation\nof the data.\nUNAUDITED QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS\n(In thousands, except for per share amounts)\nMarch 31, June 30, September 30, December 31,\nThree Months Ended 2019 2019 2019 2019\nNet sales $143,791 $156,391 $114,092 $115,787\nGross profit $60,612 $65,015 $46,331 $47,209\nOperating income (loss) $(6,167) $562 $(20,288) $(14,070)\nNet income (loss) $770 $3,995 $(46,123) $(11,624)\nEarnings (loss) per common share - basic $0.02 $0.08 $(0.96) $(0.25)\nEarnings (loss) per common share - diluted $0.02(1) $0.08(1) $(0.96) $(0.25)\nMarch 31, June 30, September 30, December 31,\nThree Months Ended 2018 2018 2018 2018\nNet sales $120,806 $128,048 $140,335 $140,088\nGross profit $39,733 $49,996 $58,448 $55,388\nOperating income (loss) $(26,647) $(12,813) $(2,179) $(3,783)\nNet income (loss) $(10,814) $(7,670) $7,589 $(8,447)\nEarnings (loss) per common share - basic $(0.22) $(0.16) $0.16 $(0.18)\nEarnings (loss) per common share - diluted $(0.22) $(0.16) $0.16(1) $(0.18)\n(1) Assumes exercise of dilutive securities calculated under the treasury stock method.\nNote 20 – Subsequent Events\nOn January 2, 2020, we paid off the outstanding balance of $24.6 million of the Taxable Revenue Bonds upon\ntheir maturity.

Any statement that does not directly relate to a historical or current fact is a forward-looking statement. Generally, the\nwords “believe”, “expect”, “intend”, “estimate”, “anticipate”, “would”, “will”, “may”, “might”, “could”, “should”, “can”, “future”,\n“assume”, “plan”, “seek”, “predict”, “potential”, “objective”, “expect”, “target”, “project”, “outlook”, “forecast” and similar\nexpressions identify forward-looking statements. We caution you that any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are\nsubject to uncertainties and other factors that could affect the accuracy of such statements. Forward-looking statements are based on\nmanagement’s current expectations, as well as certain assumptions and estimates made by, and information available to, management\nat the time the statements are made. Those statements are based on general assumptions and are subject to various risks, and because\nthey also relate to the future, they are likewise subject to inherent uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from the views, beliefs and projections expressed in such statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include,\nbut are not limited to, the risks identified in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this report and those described below:\nRisks related to our financial results and Company success\n• We are obligated to comply with covenants related to our Wells Fargo Credit Agreement that could restrict our operating\nactivities, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerates our debt.\n• We have experienced significant fluctuations in revenue and such fluctuations may continue. Fluctuations in revenue can\ncause our operating results in a given reporting period to be higher or lower than expected.\n• The lengthy sales and approval process required by Service Providers for new products has resulted in fluctuations in our\nrevenue and may result in future revenue fluctuations.\n• We depend heavily on sales to certain customers; the loss of any of these customers or a significant project would\nsignificantly reduce our revenue and net income.\n• Our exposure to the credit risks of our customers and distributors may make it difficult to collect accounts receivable and\ncould adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n• We expect gross margins to continue to vary over time, and our levels of product and services gross margins may not be\nsustainable.\n• Our dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products,\ncombined with supply shortages, has prevented and may continue to prevent us from delivering our products on a timely\nbasis, which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on operating results and could have a material\nadverse effect on customer relations.\n• We compete in markets that have become increasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and\nmarket share.\n• Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, installation and shipment\nvolumes, field service repair obligations and other rework costs incurred in correcting product failures. If our estimates\nchange, our liability for warranty obligations may increase or decrease, impacting future cost of revenue.\n• Managing our inventory is complex and has included and may continue to include write downs of excess or obsolete\ninventory.\n• The continuing growth of our international operations has and may continue to expose us to additional risks, increase our\ncosts and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n• Our success depends on attracting and retaining key personnel.\n• We are exposed to adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations in jurisdictions where we transact in local currency, which\ncould harm our financial results and cash flows.\n• We require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness, our payment obligations to Adtran Networks\nshareholders under the DPLTA, and other obligations.\n• We have recognized impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in the past and may be required to\ndo so in the future.\n3\n• We may be unable to successfully and effectively manage and integrate acquisitions, divestitures and other significant\ntransactions, which could harm our operating results, business and prospects.\n• Ongoing inflationary pressures could negatively impact our revenues and profitability if increases in the prices of our\nproducts and services or a decrease in customer spending result in lower sales.\nRisks related to our control environment\n• We have had to restate our previously issued consolidated financial statements and, as part of that process, have identified\nmaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to develop and maintain effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner,\nwhich may adversely affect investor confidence in us and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\n• We may face litigation and other risks as a result of the restatements of our previously issued consolidated financial\nstatements and material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\n• Breaches of our information systems and cyberattacks could compromise our intellectual property and cause significant\ndamage to our business and reputation.\nRisks related to the Business Combination and DPLTA\n• Our ability to realize anticipated strategic and financial benefits sought from the Business Combination has been and may\ncontinue to be affected by a number of factors.\n• We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in connection with the Business Combination and post-\nclosing integration and restructuring efforts.\n• We incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness in connection with the Business Combination and DPLTA. Our failure\nto meet our debt service obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\n• We have experienced operational challenges as a result of the Business Combination and may also experience negative\nsynergies and loss of customers.\n• The terms of the DPLTA may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition.\n• We are exposed to additional litigation risk and uncertainty with respect to the remaining minority shareholders of Adtran\nNetworks, which litigation may require us to pay a higher purchase price for additional Adtran Networks shares than the\namount provided for under the DPLTA.\n• We may be unable to successfully retain and motivate our personnel.\nRisks related to the telecommunications industry\n• We must continue to update and improve our products and develop new products to compete and to keep pace with\nimprovements in communications technology.\n• Our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable environmental regulations could\nadversely impact our results of operations.\n• If our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks, installations may be delayed or canceled, which could\nharm our business.\n• We engage in research and development activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application of\ndeveloped technologies, and as a consequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with\nsubstantially greater research and development efforts and which may focus on more leading-edge development.\n• Our strategy of outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing requirements to subcontractors located in various international\nregions may result in us not meeting our cost, quality or performance standards.\n• Our failure to maintain rights to intellectual property used in our business could adversely affect the development,\nfunctionality and commercial value of our products.\n4\n• Third party hardware or software that is used with our portfolios may not continue to be available or at commercially\nreasonable terms.\n• Our use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products.\n• We may incur liabilities or become subject to litigation that would have a material effect on our business.\n• If we are unable to successfully develop and maintain relationships with SIs, Service Providers and enterprise VARs, our\nrevenue may be negatively affected.\n• We depend on a third-party cloud platform provider to host our Mosaic One SaaS network operating platform, and if we\nwere to experience a disruption or interference in service, our business and reputation could suffer.\nRisks related to the Company's stock price\n• Our operating results and financial performance historically have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate in\nfuture periods. Such fluctuations can adversely affect our stock price.\n• The price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly.\nRisks related to the regulatory environments in which we do business\n• We are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and standards governing the conduct of our\nbusiness. Violations of these laws and regulations may harm our business, subject us to penalties and to other adverse\nconsequences.\n• Changes in trade policy in the U.S. and other countries, including the imposition of additional tariffs and the resulting\nconsequences, may adversely impact our gross profits, gross margins, results of operations and financial condition.\n• New or revised tax regulations, changes in our effective tax rate, recognition of a valuation allowance or assessments\narising from tax audits may have an adverse impact on our results.\n• Central banks’ monetary policy actions and instability in the financial services sector could increase our costs of\nborrowing money and negatively impact our financial condition and future operations.\n• Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose the Company to potential liabilities,\nincreased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\n• Further downgrades of the U.S. credit rating, impending automatic spending cuts or a government shutdown could\nnegatively impact our liquidity, financial condition and earnings.\nWe caution investors that other factors may prove to be important in the future in affecting our operating results. New factors emerge\nfrom time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of these factors, nor can we assess the impact each factor, or a combination\nof factors, may have on our business. You are further cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements\nbecause they speak only of our views as of the date that the statements were made.

Communications Service Providers' investment in their networks is being driven by the pursuit of growth in\nsubscriber acquisition, retention, and average revenue per user, as well as by the aims of streamlining operations, lowering energy\nconsumption and improving their overall ESG position. Drivers facilitating this network investment cycle include the evolution of\ngovernment funding programs, private equity infrastructure investment appetite, regulatory broadband policies, competition and ever-\nincreasing subscriber demand for higher-speed broadband.\nSubscriber demand for greater bandwidth continues to increase as connectivity is being woven ever more tightly into the fabric of\neveryone’s day-to-day lives. Specifically, subscriber demand for greater bandwidth is being driven by increasing numbers of\nconnected devices, shifting working arrangements, the transition of entertainment over to OTT video, and the evolution of gaming\nplatforms towards subscription models where new hybrids of download and streaming are emerging globally. This is further\ncompounded by the rapid adoption of AI, the prevalence of IoT and the increasing transition of applications over to cloud-based\nservices and internet applications where recurring revenues replace one-time sales. Performance and user satisfaction are directly\nrelated to bandwidth availability and service robustness. As the demand for high-definition video and game streaming services,\nsymmetric bandwidth for online collaboration, lower latency for interactive AI and cloud applications and smart home video\nsurveillance applications continue to increase, so too does the need increase for fiber-based broadband to be in every home and\nbusiness.\nIn order to satisfy these complex requirements and deliver on the efficiency improvements demanded by operators, communications\nService Providers are transitioning to full fiber access networks.\nWe aim to serve as a trusted partner to our customers. Working side-by-side with our customers, we assist them with maximizing the\nperformance of their networks by providing a flexible path for their networks to evolve cost-effectively over to full fiber while\navailing themselves of the benefits that web-scale architectures deliver and helping to further monetize their investments.\nOur Strategy\nOur strategy is to provide innovative and cost-effective solutions for our customers that enable them to address their increasing\nbroadband demand. Our solutions focus on technology transformations that are happening in broadband network infrastructure, home\nand business CPE and software platforms, and services needed to help our customers address increasing complexity while scaling to\nmeet increasing consumer demands.\nWe aspire to be one of the top communication technology players in the world and an innovation leader around the converged edge,\nenabling the intelligent, self-optimizing, fiber-everywhere future. We plan to achieve this goal through innovation in network, home\nand business technology paired with a customer-focused organizational structure that tailors solutions to meet the needs of our target\ncustomers. We have one of the most comprehensive solutions portfolios that empowers operators to build a converged infrastructure\nfrom the metro core to the customer premise, serving all networking applications for residential, business, wholesale and mobile users.\nWe take an approach to our portfolio in which we are focused in specific markets where we can offer competitive differentiation and\nscale while also having enough diversity and breadth in the portfolio to provide end-to-end connectivity solutions that offer value to\nour customers. More specifically, our corporate strategy consists of the following elements:\n• Leadership in fiber networking: Breadth of portfolio, open and advanced architecture, assured and secure connectivity.\n• Growth in focus markets: More turnkey solutions and in-region resources, especially North America and EMEA.\n• Investment in converged edge: Innovation in optics, security, AI-driven networking, virtualization, SaaS, etc.\n• Transformation through software: Open and cloud-centric systems, end-to-end programmability, simplification through\nsoftware, and innovative SaaS offerings.\n• Diversification of customers: Cross-selling current portfolio, acquisition of new customers and partners based on larger\nportfolio and trusted supplier status.\n• Focus on sustainability: Science-based emissions targets, process-based product eco-design, optimization of operations,\nlogistics and all packaging, circular-economy processes.\n13\nBusiness Efficiency Program\nOn November 6, 2023, due to the uncertainty around the current macroeconomic environment and its impact on customer spending\nlevels, the Company’s management decided to implement a business efficiency program (the “Business Efficiency Program”)\ntargeting the reduction of ongoing operating expenses and focusing on capital efficiency inclusive of certain salary reductions, an early\nretirement program, a site consolidation plan to include lease impairments and the partial sale of owned real estate (including the\npotential sale of portions of our headquarters), inventory write downs from product discontinuances, and the suspension of the\nquarterly dividend. The Business Efficiency Program expands upon other recently implemented restructuring efforts and synergy costs\nfollowing the Business Combination. For instance, on August 17, 2023, the Company’s management determined to discontinue its\ncopper-based Digital Subscriber Line broadband access technology products and its fixed wireless access products in its Network\nSolutions segment. Furthermore, on September 29, 2023, the Company’s management decided to exit the \"IoT\" gateway market\n(indoor and outdoor), a subset of the broader IoT market (together with the other product discontinuations, the “Discontinuations”).\nAdditionally, on October 25, 2023, all employees were informed of certain personnel measures, which included the reduction of salary\nfor select management, a reduction of approximately 5% of the workforce, an early retirement program and a hiring freeze. For\nadditional information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Business\nEfficiency Program” in Part II, Item 7 of this report.\nCustomers\nWe have a diverse global customer base that includes large, medium and small Service Providers, alternative Service Providers, such\nas utilities, municipalities and fiber overbuilders; cable/MSOs; SMBs and distributed enterprises.\nDuring 2023, we had one customer who comprised greater than 10.0% of our revenue, which was an international Service Provider\nand our five largest customers comprised 37.0% of our revenue. Additionally, our revenue in the U.S., U.K. and Germany comprised\nmore than 10% of our revenue in 2023. The revenue from this Service Provider and these countries is reported in both our Network\nSolutions and Services & Support segments.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with customers, Service Providers and approval processes, see “Risk Factors – The lengthy sales\nand approval process required by Service Providers for new products could result in fluctuations in our revenue,” “Risk Factors – We\ndepend heavily on sales to certain customers; the loss of any of these customers would significantly reduce our revenue and net\nincome,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nDistribution, Sales and Marketing\nWe sell our products through our direct sales organization and our distribution network. Our direct sales organization supports major\naccounts and has offices in global locations. Sales to most smaller and independent telephone companies are fulfilled through a\ncombination of direct sales and distributors. Our services offerings can be purchased directly from us or through one of our Service\nProviders, channel partners or distribution partners.\nBefore placing an order, Service Providers typically require lengthy product qualification and standardization processes that can\nextend for several months or even years. Once approved, product orders are typically placed under single or multi-year supply\nagreements that are generally not subject to minimum volume commitments. Service Providers generally prefer having two or more\nsuppliers for most products. Therefore, individual orders are usually subject to competitive combinations of total value, service, price,\ndelivery and other terms.\nOrders for end-user products are fulfilled through a combination of direct sales and distributors. This is supported by a direct sales\norganization for major accounts and a channel-based sales organization to facilitate sales to our partners. MSPs, VARs and SIs may be\naffiliated with us as channel partners, or they may purchase from a distributor in an unaffiliated fashion. Affiliated partners participate\nwith us at various program levels, based on sales volume and other factors, to receive benefits such as product discounts, market\ndevelopment funds, technical support and training.\nOutside of the U.S., most Service Provider products are sold through our direct sales organization and end-user products are sold\ndirect or through distribution arrangements customized for each region. Some regions are supported from a field office that offers sales\nand support functions, and in some cases, warehousing and manufacturing support. Our field sales organizations, distributors and\nService Provider customers receive support from regional-based marketing, sales and customer support groups.\nOur marketing organization promotes all brands associated with us to key stakeholders, including customers, partners and prospects\nthroughout the world. Marketing is complemented by product marketing and management teams that work with our engineering teams\nto develop and promote new products and services, as well as product enhancements.\n14\nResearch and Development\nRapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, supply constraints and continuing\ndevelopments in communications service offerings characterize the markets for our products. Our on-going ability to adapt to these\nchanges and to develop new and enhanced products that meet or anticipate market demand is the main factor influencing our\ncompetitive position and our ability to grow.\nOur product development activities are a central part of our strategy. We plan to maintain our emphasis on product development to\nenable us to respond to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. Our research and development and engineering\nfunctions are global. We maintain research and development functions at multiple sites in the U.S., Europe, Israel and Asia. During the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, research and development expenditures totaled $258.3 million, $173.8 million and\n$108.7 million, respectively.\nWhile we develop the majority of our products internally, we also leverage partners for some solutions. Additionally, we license\nintellectual property or acquire technologies. Internal development on advanced technology products gives us more control over\ndesign and manufacturing issues, while for traditional designs, ODM and/or licensed intellectual property provides us with the ability\nto leverage the economies of scale of our technology partners. This balanced approach ensures we provide best-in-class solutions for\nour customers.\nAs we continue to create more software-based intellectual property, such as our SDN/Edge Cloud portfolio, our use of lean agile\npractices in research and development ensures we remain responsive and customer-focused. This enables us to deliver products faster,\nat higher quality and more economically to our customers and the market on a continuous basis.\nOur ability to continually reduce product costs, while focusing on delivery and quality, are important parts of our overall business\nstrategy. Our product development efforts are often centered on entering a market with improved technology, enabling us to offer\nproducts at competitive prices and compete for market share. See Inventory included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional\ninformation regarding our supply chain disruptions.\nDevelopment activities focus on solutions that support both existing and emerging communications industry technologies in segments\nthat we consider viable revenue opportunities. We are actively engaged in developing and refining technologies to support data, voice\nand video transport primarily over IP/Ethernet and optical network architectures. This includes optical transport, packet demarcation\nand aggregation, synchronization and fiber-optic access, DSL, access routing, ethernet switching, wireless LANs, integrated access,\nconverged services, VoIP, network management and professional services. In addition, we focus on vertical optical technologies like\nSilicon Photonics, as well as microelectronics in order to differentiate and fully control the vertical value stack of our solutions. In\n2023, we released many market-leading products like additions to our SDX OLT range, new residential gateway and ONT families,\noutdoor packet demarcation devices, packet demarcation, encryption/security products, edge and core transport solutions. We\nenhanced our market leading synchronization & timing portfolio, as well as our SaaS delivery abilities and Mosaic One software.\nOur research function and advanced technology team is driving many specific research projects in the fields of sustainable optical\ntransmission, security, quantum communications, SDN and access technologies. This research fosters differentiated product concepts\nand guides our various product design and engineering teams in IPR creation, industry and network standards and technological\nforecasting.\nWe are an active participant in several SDOs and have assisted with the development of worldwide standards in many technologies.\nOur SDO activities are primarily in the areas of broadband access, optical networking and synchronization. This includes involvement\nwith the ITU-T, ATIS, ETSI, ONF and the BBF. We are involved in the evolution of optical access technologies on next-generation\nPON. We also continue to be involved in driving optical networking, synchronization and SDN standardization and participate in\nindustry-wide interoperability, performance-testing and system-level projects related to those standards in BBF and ONF. We are also\nmembers of MEF, TIA, CableLabs and TIP.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with our research and development activities, see “Risk Factors – We must continue to update and\nimprove our products and develop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology” and\n“Risk Factors – We engage in research and development activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application\nof developed technologies, and as a consequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with\nsubstantially greater research and development effort and which may focus on more leading edge development,” in Part I, Item 1A of\nthis report.\n15\nManufacturing and Operations\nThe principal steps in our manufacturing process include the purchase and management of materials, assembly, testing, final\ninspection, packing and shipping. We purchase parts and components for the assembly of some products from a large number of\nsuppliers through a worldwide sourcing program. Additionally, we manage a process that identifies the components that are best\npurchased directly by contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of our products to achieve manufacturing efficiency, quality and\ncost objectives. Certain key components used in our products are currently available from a single source, and other key components\nare available from only a limited number of sources. In the past, we have experienced delays in the receipt of certain key components,\nwhich has resulted in delays in related product deliveries. We attempt to manage these risks through developing alternative sources, by\nstaging inventories at strategic locations, through engineering efforts designed to prevent the necessity of certain components and by\nmaintaining close contact and building long-term relationships with our suppliers. See Inventory included in Part I, Item 1 of this\nreport for additional information.\nWe rely on subcontractors for the assembly and testing of certain printed circuit board assemblies, sub-assemblies, chassis, enclosures\nand equipment shelves, and to purchase some of the raw materials used in such assemblies. We typically manufacture our lower-\nvolume, higher-mix products and build and test product prototypes and many of our initial production units at our manufacturing site\nin Huntsville, Alabama. We later transfer the production of higher-volume, lower-mix assemblies to our subcontractors. Subcontract\nassembly operations can lengthen fulfillment cycle times, but we believe we can respond more rapidly to uncertainties in incoming\norder rates by selecting assembly subcontractors that have significant reserve capacity and flexibility. Our subcontractors have\ngenerally proven to be flexible and able to meet our quality requirements.\nWe ship the majority of products to our U.S. customers from our facilities in Huntsville, Alabama. The majority of international\ncustomers are being served from our logistics hubs in Meiningen, Germany and York, United Kingdom. We also ship directly from\nsubcontractors to a number of customers in the U.S. and international locations. Most of our facilities are certified pursuant to the most\ncurrent releases of ISO 9001, TL 9000, ISO 14001 and ISO 27001. Our Huntsville, Alabama facilities and many of our key suppliers\nare C-TPAT certified. Our products are also certified to certain other customers' industry and privacy standards, including those\nrelating to the emission of electromagnetic energy and safety specifications.\nOur dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products, has prevented and\nmay in the future prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which has had and may continue to have a material\nadverse effect on operating results and could have a material adverse effect on customer relations.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with manufacturing activities, see “Risk Factors – Our strategy of outsourcing a portion of our\nmanufacturing requirements to subcontractors located in various international regions may result in us not meeting our cost, quality\nor performance standards” and “Risk Factors – Our dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key\ncomponents and ODM products, combined with supply shortages, have prevented and may continue to prevent us from delivering our\nproducts on a timely basis, which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on operating results and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on customer relations,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nCompetition\nWe compete in markets for networking and communications services and solutions for Service Providers, businesses, government\nagencies and other organizations worldwide. Our products and services provide solutions supporting voice, data and video\ncommunications across fiber-, copper-, coaxial- and wireless-based infrastructure, as well as across wide area networks, local area\nnetworks and the internet.\nWe compete with a number of companies in the markets we serve. In the Subscriber Solutions & Experience category, our primary\ncompetitors include Calix, Cisco, CommScope, and Ribbon Communications. In our Access & Aggregation solutions category, key\ncompetitors include Calix, Casa Systems, Ciena, CommScope, DZS, Harmonic, Huawei, Nokia, Reliance/Radisys, Vecima Networks\nand ZTE. Main competitors of our Optical Networking solutions portfolio are Ciena, Cisco, Ekinops, Huawei, Infinera, Nokia, Ribbon\nCommunications and ZTE Corporation.\nAcross our markets and segments, the principal competitive factors can include, among others:\n• differentiated feature functionality of our products and solutions;\n• price performance of our solutions and lowest total cost of ownership for customers;\n• quality and reliability of our products;\n• financial stability and health of our company;\n• ability to manage supply chains and produce and deliver products in accordance with customer wish date;\n• ability to innovate and provide customers with differentiated solutions, advantageous to their business model;\n16\n• compelling technology roadmap and research and development power;\n• industry thought leadership and time to market with innovative solutions;\n• country of origin for products and solutions and trusted supplier status;\n• security of enterprise value chain, from design to product development, support processes, to products and solutions;\n• energy consumption of our products and commitment to sustainability, supporting customers in achieving their climate\ngoals;\n• customer relationship and incumbency;\n• ability to deliver comprehensive solutions with a high degree of automation and ease-of-use, including hardware, software\nand services; and\n• broad range of services and support capabilities.\nFor further discussion of risks associated with our competition, see “Risk Factors – We must continue to update and improve our\nproducts and develop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology” and “Risk\nFactors – We compete in markets that have become increasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and\nmarket share,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nSeasonality\nWe experience quarterly fluctuations in our revenue that occur due to many factors, including the varying budget cycles and seasonal\nbuying patterns of our customers. More specifically, our customers tend to spend less in the first fiscal quarter as they are finalizing\ntheir annual capital spending budgets. These seasonal effects may continue to vary and do not always correlate to our operating results.\nAccordingly, they should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or operating results. Additionally, the effects of\nthe dynamic supply and demand environment we have experienced in recent periods may impact the traditional seasonality in our\nbusiness. Due to the improved supply situation and the associated reduction in lead times, our customers began to optimize their\ninventories in the past fiscal year. This has led to a slowdown in ordering behavior. In addition, the current macroeconomic\nenvironment, related to continued elevated interest rates and ongoing inflationary pressures, has negatively impacted customer\nbehavior in the Large and Medium/Small Service Provider segment. We expect these trends to continue in 2024.\nForeign Currency\nTransactions with customers that are denominated in foreign currencies are recorded using the appropriate exchange rates from\nthroughout the year. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the balance sheet dates using the\nclosing rates of exchange between those foreign currencies and the functional currency with any transaction gains or losses reported in\nother income, net. Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements are with the euro and the British pound\nsterling. Adjustments resulting from translating financial statements of international subsidiaries are recorded as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive income.\nInventory\nA substantial portion of our shipments in any fiscal period relate to orders received and shipped within that fiscal period for customers\nunder agreements containing non-binding purchase commitments. Further, a significant percentage of orders require delivery within a\nfew days. However, with the current global supply chain and transportation constraints, and limited availability of semiconductor\nchips and other components of our products, we have experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times, increased\nlogistics intervals and costs, and lower volume of products deliveries, which have had and may continue to have a material adverse\neffect on our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our customer relations and our financial condition.\n17\nWe maintain substantial inventories of raw materials for long lead time components to support this demand and avoid expedite fees. In\nrecent years, inflationary pressures on input costs, such as raw materials and labor, and distribution costs negatively impacted our\noperating results. However, inflationary pressures on our supply chain have eased somewhat, which has led to reductions in cost\npremiums on raw material costs and freight. We continue to support our customer demand for our products by working with our\nsuppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, and customers to address and to limit the disruption to our operations and order\nfulfillment. Additionally, maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of\ninventory that may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of this inventory may have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness and operating results. Also, not maintaining sufficient inventory levels to ensure prompt delivery of our products may cause\nus to incur expediting costs to meet customer delivery requirements, which may negatively impact our operating results.\nFor further discussion of risks associated with managing our inventory, see “Risk Factors – Managing our inventory is complex and\nmay include write-downs of excess or obsolete inventory,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nGovernment Regulation\nTelecommunications Matters\nOur products that are incorporated into wireless communications systems must comply with various government regulations,\nincluding those of the FCC. We strive to deliver innovative network access solutions that lower the total cost and reduce the time of\ndeploying services, increase the level of performance achievable with established infrastructures, reduce operating and capital\nexpenses for our customers, increase network bandwidth and functionality, and extend network reach. Our development process is\nconducted in accordance with ISO 9001, TL 9000, ISO 14001, and ISO 27001, all of which are international standards for quality and\nenvironmental management systems.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur products must comply with various regulations and standards established by communications authorities in various countries, as\nwell as those of certain international bodies. Environmental legislation within the EU may increase our cost of doing business as we\namend our products to comply with these requirements. For example, the EU issued the RoHS directive, the WEEE directive and the\nREACH regulation. We are also subject to disclosure and related requirements that apply to the presence of conflict minerals in our\nproducts or supply chain. We continue to implement measures to comply with these and other similar directives and regulations from\nadditional countries.\nOther Regulations\nAs a company with global operations, we are subject to complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including trade regulations;\ntariffs; import and export regulations; anti-bribery and corruption laws; antitrust or competition laws; data privacy laws and\nregulations, such as the GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act; and cybersecurity laws and regulations, among others. We\nhave policies and procedures in place to promote compliance with these laws and regulations. To date, our compliance actions and\ncosts relating to these laws, rules and regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or\ncompetitive position. Government regulations are subject to change and, accordingly, we are unable to assess the possible effect of\ncompliance with future requirements or whether our compliance with such regulations will materially impact our business in the\nfuture.\nFor further discussion of risks associated with government regulation, see “Risk Factors – We are subject to complex and evolving\nU.S. and foreign laws, regulations and standards governing the conduct of our business. Violations of these laws and regulations may\nharm our business, subject us to penalties and to other adverse consequences,” in Part 1, Item 1A of this report.\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance\nWe believe that as we follow our corporate vision to enable a fully connected world, we must continue to be responsible corporate\ncitizens. As more people are connected, work and life can be accomplished using fewer resources. We have established ESG and\nsustainability programs and policies that encompass the elements of Environmental, Health & Safety, Ethics, Labor, and the related\nmanagement systems in alignment with the ISO 26000 Guidelines. We are committed to operating in full compliance with the laws,\nrules and regulations of all the countries in which we operate. The major aims of our program are reducing waste and emissions,\nmaximizing energy efficiency and productivity and minimizing practices that can adversely affect utilization of natural resources by\ncoming generations. Our ESG programs are important to us, consequently, ESG is a dedicated focus throughout the company. We have\nBoard oversight including an ESG Committee, strong management support and engagement from our employees.\nAreas of focus in our environmental sustainability program include:\n• established an ESG Committee of the Board of Directors;\n• maintained our mature environmental management system certified to ISO 14001 from 2015;\n18\n• advanced our Energy Management program with ISO 50001 readiness for the Huntsville site for 2024;\n• submitted our detailed Net Zero targets to SBTi in 2023;\n• continued purchase of Renewable Energy Credits, equaling ~20% of total Adtran energy consumption;\n• purchased certified carbon offsets to achieve Net Zero for our Scope 1 emissions;\n• continued using IntegrityNext, a platform to engage suppliers to obtain an ESG assessment aligned with international\nstandards, allowing us to monitor ESG risks in our supply chain;\n• established Eco-Design guidelines in the Technology organization;\n• continued with Life Cycle Assessments across the portfolio;\n• continued with packaging optimization to reduce related materials and waste;\n• increased visibility of our program internally and externally through customer engagement, joining peer sustainability\ngroups, offering training to team members and web site enhancements;\n• switched from the GRI reporting standard to the newer and more comprehensive ESRS standard; and\n• actively engaged our stakeholders with investor and supply chain assessments.\nWe will issue an ESG report for 2023 in order to fulfill the reporting obligations set forth in the German commercial code applicable\nto Adtran Networks. Within the report is information on our environmental, social and governance programs, including quantitative\nand qualitative data for both Adtran Networks and the Company. This information can also be found on our website at:\nwww.adtran.com/en/about-us/esg/environmental. The information found on our website is not incorporated by reference in this report\nor any other report that we file or furnish to the SEC.\nFor further discussion of risks associated with government regulation, see “Risk Factors – Expectations relating to environmental,\nsocial and governance considerations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other\nadverse effects on the Company’s business,” in Part 1, Item 1A of this report.\nHuman Capital\nWe believe that our most valuable asset is our people. To ensure we continue to succeed, our objective is to be able to recruit, hire and\nretain top talent. Our ability to attract and retain a high-quality workforce is dependent on our ability to maintain a diverse, equitable\nand inclusive workplace that provides opportunities for our employees to learn and grow in their careers. This is supported by\ncompetitive compensation and benefits, along with strong community service and other programs that enable employees to build\nconnections within the community.\nAs part of our Business Efficiency Program, on October 25, 2023, all employees were informed of certain personnel measures, which\nincluded the reduction of salary for select management, a reduction of approximately 5% of the workforce, an early retirement\nprogram and a hiring freeze. The Company provided the employees subject to the salary reductions with stock option awards for\nretention purposes. Our Chief Executive Officer voluntarily reduced his salary by 50% and did not receive any stock option awards\nunder the Business Efficiency Program. For additional information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations – Business Efficiency Program” in Part II, Item 7 of this report.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 3,227 full-time employees, with 1,249 in the U.S. and 1,978 in our international subsidiaries located\nin North America, Latin America, EMEA and APAC regions. 2,027 of these full-time employees are employees of Adtran Networks\nand its subsidiaries. We also utilized 192 contractors and 160 temporary employees domestically and internationally in various\nmanufacturing, engineering, sales and general and administrative capacities. We believe that our relationship with our employees is\ngood. We have a diverse employee base located in 36 countries. We pride ourselves on a highly educated workforce, and the majority\nof our employees serve in engineering, information technology and technical roles within the organization.\nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately 167 employees (75%) of ADTRAN GmbH were subject to collective bargaining agreements\nof either the Association of Metal and Electrical Industry in Berlin and Brandenburg e.V. or NORDMETALL Association of Metal and\nElectrical Industry e.V. Although these collective bargaining agreements will expire on September 30, 2024, negotiations with the\nemployees of ADTRAN GmbH for a new collective bargaining agreement are ongoing and we have not experienced any work\nstoppage. As of December 31, 2023, Adtran Networks had 91 employees in Switzerland, France, Italy, Finland and Spain that were\nsubject to collective bargaining agreements of different associations. None of our other employees are subject to collective bargaining\nagreements.\nAdditionally, we continually work to recruit technical talent in diverse communities through our cooperative education program. This\nprogram seeks to identify college students that major in relevant technological areas and expose them to our work environment on an\n19\nalternating semester basis. Our goal is to retain as many of these students as possible for full-time employment after graduation to\nbuild our organization's future.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe believe that maintaining a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to the success of our business. We encourage an environment\nwhere individuality is embraced regardless of age, gender, identity, race, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, ethnicity and\nperspective and where each employee is accepted and respected and can, therefore, bring their most authentic self to work.\nIn addition to diversity in our workforce, we seek to ensure diversity in our Board of Directors with respect to skills, experience,\ngender, race and ethnicity. Our Board of Directors is comprised of nine members, two of which are females and three of which are\nethnically diverse. Additionally, the Board of Directors has a diversity of skills and experience with respect to accounting and finance,\nmanagement and leadership, vision and strategy, business operations, business judgment, crisis management, risk assessment, industry\nknowledge, corporate governance and global markets.\nHealth, Safety and Wellness\nThe well-being of our employees is paramount to the continued success of our business. To this end, we are committed to each of our\nemployees' health, safety and wellness. We provide our employees with access to various health and wellness benefits designed to\nenable them and their family members to have affordable access to health, dental and vision insurance. Additionally, we offer access to\nmany programs that provide additional monetary support in the event of a qualifying incident, including accident insurance, life\ninsurance and hospital indemnity insurance, among others. We understand that mental health is an essential aspect of our employees’\nwellbeing and we offer an employee assistance program at no charge to employees and their family members. This program provides\naccess to qualified personnel to address various issues such as grief, financial stress, family and emotional issues.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe continually work to provide a competitive compensation and benefits program as this plays a key role in our ability to attract and\nretain a highly skilled workforce. In addition to salaries, these programs, which vary by country/region, include long-term equity\nincentive awards with certain vesting requirements, deferred compensation plans (which are offered to certain members of executive\nmanagement), a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, paid\nvolunteer time off, employee assistance program and tuition assistance. Additionally, at our global headquarters in Alabama, we offer\nour employees certain on-site services, including nurse practitioner care and a fitness center, among others.\nTalent Development\nWe invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain a market-leading global supplier of broadband infrastructure.\nWe offer numerous training opportunities on both technical and professional development topics. We utilize tools and processes to\nprovide performance feedback which helps develop high potential employees into becoming our future leaders.\nOur Career Development Program provides an opportunity for employees to shape their career journey. The program provides\nopportunities for employees to develop competencies in areas including technology, business acumen, emotional intelligence, design\nand systems thinking. As employees increase their competencies in these areas and master skills within their individual roles, this\nprogram offers a variety of career advancement paths. Employees also have access to the Learning module available in Workday. This\nplatform houses all required training, as well as optional training in a variety of areas.\nIntellectual Property\nWe develop and own a significant amount of intellectual property. We hold over 1,000 patents worldwide related to our products and\nover 50 additional pending patent applications. Our patents expire at various dates between 2024 and 2041. We continue to seek\nadditional patents related to our research and development activities. We do not derive any material amount of revenue from the\nlicensing of our patents.\nThe name \"ADTRAN\" is a registered trademark of ours, as is the name “SmartRG” and a number of our product identifiers and\nnames. We also claim rights to a number of unregistered trademarks.\nWe protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights in accordance with good legal and business practices. We believe, however,\nthat our competitive success will not fully depend on the ownership of intellectual property, but instead will depend primarily on the\ninnovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our personnel.\n20\nThe communications industry is characterized by the existence of an ever-increasing volume of patent litigation and licensing\nactivities. We have received, and may continue to receive, notices of claims alleging that we are infringing upon patents or other\nintellectual property. We cannot predict whether we will prevail in any claims or litigation over alleged infringements, or whether we\nwill be able to license any valid and infringed patents, or other intellectual property, on commercially reasonable terms. It is possible\nthat such litigation may result in significant legal costs and judgments and that intellectual property infringement claims, or related\nlitigation against or by us could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property and proprietary rights, see “Risk Factors – Our failure to maintain\nrights to intellectual property used in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality, and commercial value of our\nproducts” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\n21\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nSet forth below is certain information regarding our current executive officers.

RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves substantial risks. Any of the risk factors described below or elsewhere in this report could significantly and\nadversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The risks described below are not the only ones\nfacing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely\naffect us.\nRisks related to our financial results and Company success\nWe are obligated to comply with covenants related to our Wells Fargo Credit Agreement that could restrict our operating activities,\nand the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerates our debt.\nThe Wells Fargo Credit Agreement governing our indebtedness contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in\nactivities that may be in our long-term best interest. We are also obligated to add certain additional subsidiaries as guarantors of our\ndebt obligations under the credit facility. Our failure to comply with those covenants or to add such subsidiaries as guarantors could\nresult in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all its debt. Our Wells Fargo Credit\nAgreement along with the amendments thereto, contain various restrictive covenants which include, among others, provisions\nrestricting our ability to:\n• pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase capital stock;\n• incur or guarantee additional debt;\n• make certain distributions, investments and other restricted payments;\n• engage in transactions with affiliates;\n• engage in mergers or consolidations;\n• grant or incur liens on assets;\n• dispose of assets;\n• make loans and investments;\n• modify our organization documents; and\n• enter into certain restrictive agreements.\nIn addition, the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, such as misrepresentation and a default in the\nperformance or observance of any covenant (subject to customary cure periods and materiality thresholds).\nIn addition, certain covenants in the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement, including covenants set forth in the amendments thereto, require\nus, among other things, to:\n• maintain certain leverage ratios;\n• maintain certain fixed charge coverage ratios; and\n• maintain minimum amounts of cash and cash equivalents.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we have and may be:\n• limited in how we conduct our business;\n• unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; and\n• unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nOur failure to comply with the restrictive covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement could result in defaults that accelerate the\npayment under such debt which would likely have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In\naddition, an event of default under the Credit Agreement would permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further\ncredit under the applicable facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the Credit Agreement,\nthe lenders could proceed against the collateral granted them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders accelerate the\nrepayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. In addition, these\ndefaults could impair our ability to access debt and equity markets. For additional information on our debt covenants, see \"Liquidity\n& Capital Resources\" in Part II, Item 7 of this report.\n23\nWe have experienced significant fluctuations in revenue and such fluctuations may continue. Fluctuations in revenue can cause\nour operating results in a given reporting period to be higher or lower than expected.\nAs a result of the many factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict and will fluctuate\nfrom quarter to quarter. Typically, our customers request product delivery within a short period following our receipt of an order.\nConsequently, we do not typically carry a significant order backlog and are dependent upon obtaining orders and completing delivery\nin accordance with shipping terms that are predominantly within each quarter to achieve our targeted revenue. Our\ndeployment/installation cycle can also vary depending on the customer’s schedule, site readiness, network size and complexity and\nother factors, which can cause our revenue to fluctuate from period to period. Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be\naffected if the variable revenue patterns seen in prior quarters recur in future quarters. We have experienced periods of time during\nwhich manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading to variable shipping patterns. In addition, to the extent that\nmanufacturing issues and any related component shortages continue to result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in\nquarters in which we and our subcontractors are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be\nadversely affected, and we may not be able to remediate the conditions within the same quarter.\nIn the past, under certain market conditions, long manufacturing lead times have caused our customers to place the same order\nmultiple times. When multiple ordering occurs, along with other factors, it may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and, as a\nresult, could impair our ability to manage inventory effectively.\nWe plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. On November 6, 2023, we determined to\nimplement a business efficiency program, which includes a significant cost efficiency program targeting a reduction of ongoing\noperating expenses and a capital efficiency program inclusive of certain salary reductions, an early retirement program, a site\nconsolidation plan to include lease impairments and the partial sale of owned real estate (including the potential sale of portions of our\nheadquarters), inventory write downs from product discontinuances, and the suspension of the quarterly dividend. Our estimates of the\nexpenses necessary to achieve the cost savings we have identified may not prove accurate, and any increase in such expenses may\naffect our ability to achieve our anticipated cost savings within the period we have projected, or at all. In addition, our efforts to reduce\nour operating expenses may impact our ability to generate sufficient revenue. Furthermore, our expenses and the impact of long-term\ncommitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A shortfall in revenue has led and could again in the future lead to operating results\nbeing below expectations, partially due to an inability to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business\nchanges.\nOur customers in the subscriber solutions & experience technology category are increasingly focusing on working capital optimization\nand depletion of overstocked inventories, which has impacted and may continue to materially impact demand in that category.\nWe face risks arising from the ongoing restructuring of our operations under our business efficiency program and uncertainty\nwith respect to our ability to achieve any anticipated cost savings associated with that program.\nWe are continuing to implement a business efficiency program to improve productivity and drive cost efficiencies and fuel long-term\nprofitable growth. Future charges related to such actions may harm our profitability in the periods incurred.\nBusiness efficiency program actions have presented and may in the future present a number of significant risks that could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, or business reputation, including:\n• incurrence of additional costs in the short-term, including workforce reduction costs, training of employees or third-party\nresources, accounting charges for inventory and technology-related write-offs and charges relating to consolidation of\nexcess facilities;\n• failure to accurately assess market opportunities and the technology required to address such opportunities;\n• actual or perceived disruption of service or reduction in service levels to customers and consumers;\n• potential adverse effects on our internal control environment and inability to preserve adequate internal controls relating to\nour general and administrative functions;\n• actual or perceived disruption to customers, suppliers, distribution networks and other important operational relationships\nand the inability to resolve potential conflicts in a timely manner;\n• difficulty in obtaining timely delivery of products of acceptable quality from our contract manufacturers;\n• diversion of management attention from ongoing business activities and strategic objectives;\n• failure to maintain employee morale and retain key employees, damage to company culture and an increase in\nemployment claims; and\n• damage to our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult for us to hire new employees in the future.\n24\nBecause of these and other factors, some of which may not be entirely within our control, we may not fully realize the purpose and\nanticipated operational benefits, efficiencies or cost savings of any productivity actions in the expected timelines, or at all, and, if we\ndo not, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations – Business Efficiency Program” in Part II, Item 7 of this report.\nThe lengthy sales and approval process required by Service Providers for new products has resulted in fluctuations in our revenue\nand may result in fluctuations of future revenue and financial results.\nIn the industry in which we compete, sales and approval cycles are often lengthy. Selling efforts often involve a significant\ncommitment of time and resources by us and our customers that may include extensive product testing, laboratory or network\ncertification, or region-specific product certification and homologation requirements for deployment in networks. Additionally, a\nsupplier must first obtain product approval from a major or other Service Provider to sell its products to these Service Providers. This\nprocess can last from six to eighteen months, or longer, depending on the technology, the Service Provider and the demand for the\nproduct from the Service Provider’s subscribers. Consequently, we are involved in a constant process of submitting for approval\nsucceeding generations of products, as well as products that deploy new technology or respond to new technology demands from a\nmajor or other Service Provider. We have generally been successful in the past in obtaining these approvals; however, we cannot be\ncertain that we will obtain these approvals in the future or that sales of these products will continue to occur. Any attempt by a major\nor other Service Provider to seek out additional or alternative suppliers, or to undertake, as permitted under applicable regulations, the\nproduction of these products internally, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Furthermore, the delay in sales\nuntil the completion of the approval process, the length of which is difficult to predict, has and may continue to result in fluctuations\nof revenue and uneven operating results from quarter to quarter or year to year. For example, we have seen a decrease in volume of\nsales activity due to customers’ focus on reducing inventory levels in our domestic ADTRAN, Inc. operations, which has impacted and\nmay continue to materially impact demand in that category. Further, once customer approval or certifications are met, our supply chain\ncustomers typically do not guarantee us a minimum, or any, volume of sales.\nWe depend heavily on sales to certain customers; the loss of any of these customers or a significant project would significantly\nreduce our revenue and net income.\nHistorically, a large percentage of our revenue has been made to major Service Providers and larger independent communications\ncompanies. As long as the major and larger independent communications companies represent such a substantial percentage of our\ntotal revenue, our future success will significantly depend upon certain factors which are not within our control, including:\n• the timing and size of future purchase orders, if any, from these customers;\n• changes in strategic plans and capital budgets of these customers;\n• the product requirements of these customers;\n• the subscriber take rate, including subscriber loss or churn, of our customers;\n• the financial and operational success of these customers;\n• the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on these customers;\n• consolidation, acquisition of, or corporate reorganization among these customers;\n• the success of these customers' services deployed using our products; and\n• the impact of work stoppages at these customers.\nIn the past, revenue generated by our large customers has fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, and it may\ncontinue to fluctuate in the future. The loss of, or a significant reduction or delay in, revenue to any such customer or the occurrence of\nrevenue fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, any attempt by a major or\nother Service Provider to seek out additional or alternative suppliers or to undertake, as permitted under applicable regulations, the\nproduction of these products internally, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies\nattempt to strengthen or hold their market positions or are unable to continue operations. This could lead to variability in our operating\nresults and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flow. In addition,\nparticularly in the Service Provider market, rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers, with the effect that a loss of a major\ncustomer could have a material impact on our results that we would not have anticipated in a marketplace composed of more\nnumerous participants.\n25\nOur exposure to the credit risks of our customers and distributors may make it difficult to collect accounts receivable and could\nadversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nMost of our revenue is made on an open credit basis, generally with payment terms of 30 to 45 days in the U.S. and typically 45 to 60\ndays in many geographic markets outside the U.S. As our international revenue grows, our total accounts receivable balance has\nincreased and will likely continue to increase. Our DSO could also increase as a result of a greater mix of international revenue.\nAdditionally, international laws may not provide the same degree of protection against defaults on accounts receivable as provided\nunder U.S. laws governing domestic transactions; therefore, as our international business grows, we may be subject to higher bad debt\nexpense compared to historical trends. Overall, we monitor individual customer and distributor payment capability in granting such\nopen credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts that we believe customers and distributors can pay and maintain\nreserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for credit losses and other macroeconomic indicators. In the course of our sales to\ncustomers and distributors, we may encounter difficulty collecting accounts receivable and could be exposed to risks associated with\nuncollectible accounts receivable due to various reasons, including potential declining operating cash flows or bankruptcy filings.\nWhile we attempt to monitor these situations carefully and attempt to take appropriate measures to collect accounts receivable\nbalances, including through the recent $20.0 million expansion of a Receivables Purchase and Servicing Agreement with True Value\nS.A.R.L., there are no assurances we can avoid write-downs and/or write-offs of accounts receivable as a result of declining financial\nconditions for our customers, including bankruptcy. Such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results for\nthe period in which they occur and could potentially have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and\ncash flows.\nWe expect gross margins to continue to vary over time, and our levels of product and services gross margins may not be\nsustainable.\nOur level of gross margins may not be sustainable and has been and may continue to be adversely affected by numerous factors,\nincluding:\n• changes in customer, geographic or product or services mix, including software and the mix of configurations and\nprofessional services revenue within each product segment;\n• mix of domestic versus international revenue;\n• introduction of new products by competitors, including products with price-performance advantages;\n• our ability to reduce product cost;\n• increases in labor or material cost, including increases in material costs resulting from inflation or tariffs;\n• foreign currency exchange rate movements;\n• expediting costs incurred to meet customer delivery requirements;\n• excess inventory and inventory holding charges;\n• excess and obsolescence charges;\n• changes in shipment volume;\n• our ability to absorb fixed manufacturing costs during short-term fluctuations in customer demand;\n• loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts\nordering does not correctly anticipate product demand;\n• lower than expected benefits from value engineering;\n• increased price competition, including competitors from Asia, specifically China;\n• changes in distribution channels;\n• increased warranty cost or quality issues;\n• liquidated damages costs relating to customer contractual terms;\n• our ability to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations relating to our revenue or cost of revenue;\n• slowdowns, recessions, economic instability (such as the instability in the financial services sector), political unrest,\narmed conflicts (such as the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine and in Israel and surrounding regions), or outbreaks of\ndisease around the world; and\n• an extended government shutdown resulting from budgetary decisions or other potential delays or changes in the\ngovernment appropriations or other funding authorization processes.\n26\nOur dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products, combined with\nsupply shortages, have prevented and may continue to prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which has had\nand may continue to have a material adverse effect on operating results and could have a material adverse effect on customer\nrelations.\nThe fact that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our\nbusiness and operating results. The financial problems of our suppliers and industry consolidation occurring within one or more\ncomponent supplier markets, such as the semiconductor market, in each case, could either limit supply or increase costs.\nA reduction or interruption in supply, including disruptions on our global supply chain, caused in part by public health emergencies,\ngeopolitical tensions (including as a result of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and in Israel and surrounding regions, as well as China-\nTaiwan relations) or a significant natural disaster (including as a result of climate change); a significant increase in the price of one or\nmore components (including as a result of inflation); a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract\nmanufacturers; a failure to appropriately cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs; or a decrease in\ndemand for our products could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially\ndamage customer relationships. Furthermore, as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be\nobligated to purchase raw materials or components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market. In the event that\nwe become committed to purchasing raw materials or components at prices in excess of the current market price when the raw\nmaterials or components are actually used, our gross margins could decrease.\nIn addition, certain raw materials and key components used in our products are currently available from only one source, and others\nare available from only a limited number of sources. The availability of these raw materials and supplies may be subject to market\nforces beyond our control, such as inflation, merger and acquisition activity of our suppliers and consolidation in some segments of\nour supplier base. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased inflationary pressures on input costs, such as,\nraw materials, supplies, labor and distribution costs. Our attempts to offset these cost pressures, through increases in the selling prices\nof some of our products, may not be successful and could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, from time to time, there\nmay not be sufficient quantities of raw materials and supplies in the marketplace to meet customer demand. Many companies utilize\nthe same raw materials and supplies that we do in the production of their products. Suppliers may be under pressure to allocate product\nto certain customers for business, regulatory or political reasons, and/or demand changes in agreed pricing as a condition of supply. As\na result, companies with more resources than our own may have a competitive advantage in obtaining raw materials and supplies.\nThese factors have resulted in reduced supply, higher prices of raw materials and delays in the receipt of certain of our key\ncomponents, which in turn has generated increased costs, lower margins and delays in product delivery, with a corresponding adverse\neffect on revenue. Delays in product deliveries and corresponding product price increases may likewise have an adverse effect on\ncustomer relationships. We attempt to manage these risks through developing alternative sources, by staging inventories at strategic\nlocations, through engineering efforts designed to obviate the necessity of certain components and by building long-term relationships\nand close contact with each of our key suppliers; however, we cannot assure that delays in or failures of deliveries of key components,\neither to us or to our contract manufacturers, and consequent delays in product deliveries, will not continue to occur in the future.\nWe believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future: new markets in which we participate may grow quickly,\nwhich may make it difficult to quickly obtain significant raw materials and/or components; as we acquire companies and new\ntechnologies, we may be dependent on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners; and we face competition for\ncertain raw materials or components that are supply-constrained from existing competitors and companies in other markets.\n27\nWe compete in markets that have become increasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and market\nshare.\nThe markets for our products are intensely competitive. New manufacturers have entered the markets in recent years to offer products\nin competition with us. Additionally, certain companies have, in recent years, developed the ability to deliver competing products\nusing coaxial cable and cellular transmission, especially in high-density metropolitan areas. Competition will further increase if new\ncompanies enter the market or existing competitors expand their product lines. Some of these potential competitors may have greater\nfinancial, technological, manufacturing, sales and marketing, and personnel resources. As a result, these competitors may be able to\nrespond more rapidly or effectively to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, withstand significant\nprice decreases, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products.\nIn addition, our present and future competitors may be able to enter our existing or future markets with products or technologies\ncomparable or superior to those that we offer. An increase in competition could cause us to reduce prices, decrease our market share,\nrequire increased spending by us on product development and sales and marketing, or cause delays or cancellations in customer\norders, any one of which could reduce our gross profit margins and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, installation and shipment volumes,\nfield service repair obligations and other rework costs incurred in correcting product failures. If our estimates change, our liability\nfor warranty obligations may increase or decrease, impacting future cost of revenue.\nOur products are highly complex, and we cannot ensure that our extensive product development, manufacturing and integration testing\nwill be adequate to detect all defects, errors, failures and quality issues. Quality or performance problems for products covered under\nwarranty could adversely impact our reputation and negatively affect our operating results, financial position and cash flows. The\ndevelopment and production of new products with high complexity often involves problems with software, components and\nmanufacturing methods. If significant warranty obligations arise due to reliability or quality issues arising from defects in software,\nfaulty components or manufacturing methods, our operating results, financial position and cash flows could be negatively impacted\nby:\n• costs associated with fixing software or hardware defects;\n• costs associated with internal or third-party installation errors;\n• high service and warranty expenses;\n• costs associated with recalling and replacing products with software or hardware defects, including costs from writing-off\ndefective products recalled or recovering expenses from our suppliers;\n• high inventory obsolescence expense;\n• delays in collecting accounts receivable;\n• payment of liquidated damages for performance failures;\n• extended performance bond expenses; and\n• a decline in revenue from existing customers.\nManaging our inventory is complex and has included and may continue to include write downs of excess or obsolete inventory.\nManaging our inventory of components and finished products is complicated by a number of factors, including the need to maintain a\nsignificant inventory of certain components that are in short supply, that have been discontinued by the component manufacturer, that\nmust be purchased in bulk to obtain favorable pricing or that require long lead times. These issues have and may continue to result in\nour purchasing and maintaining significant amounts of inventory, which if not used or expected to be used based on anticipated\nproduction requirements, may become excess or obsolete. Any excess or obsolete inventory could also result in sales price reductions\nand/or inventory write- downs, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. During the year ended December\n31, 2023, we recognized a write down of inventory of $24.3 million due to a discontinuation of certain product lines within our\nNetwork Solutions segment in connection with our business efficiency program. Significant and unanticipated changes in our business\ncould require additional charges for inventory write downs in a future period. Any future charges relating to such inventory write-\ndowns could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the periods recognized. For\nadditional details regarding the business efficiency program, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations – Business Efficiency Program” in Part II, Item 7 of this report.\n28\nThe continuing growth of our international operations has and may continue to expose us to additional risks, increase our costs\nand adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are expanding our presence in international markets, which represented 59.8% and 49.5% of our net revenue for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, and as a result, we have experienced increased revenue and operating costs in these markets. This\ninternational expansion has increased and may continue to increase our operational risks and impact our results of operations,\nincluding:\n• foreign currency exchange rate volatility has had and may continue to have an unfavorable impact on our cash flows,\nfinancial condition and results of operations;\n• exposure to unfavorable commercial terms in certain countries;\n• the time and cost to staff and manage foreign operations, including the time and cost to maintain good relationships with\nemployee associations and work councils;\n• the time and cost to ensure adequate business interruption controls, processes and facilities;\n• the time and cost to manage and evolve financial reporting systems, maintain effective financial disclosure controls and\nprocedures, and comply with corporate governance requirements in multiple jurisdictions;\n• the cost to collect accounts receivable and extension of collection periods;\n• the cost and potential disruption of facilities transitions required in some business acquisitions;\n• risks as a result of less regulation of patents or other safeguards of intellectual property in certain countries;\n• the potential impact of adverse tax, customs regulations and transfer-pricing issues;\n• exposure to increased price competition from additional competitors in some countries;\n• exposure to global social, political and economic instability, changes in economic conditions and foreign currency\nexchange rate movements;\n• potential exposure to liability or damage of reputation resulting from a higher incidence of corruption or unethical\nbusiness practices in some countries;\n• potential regulations on data protection, regarding the collection, use, disclosure and security of data;\n• potential trade protection measures, export compliance issues, domestic preference procurement requirements,\nqualification to transact business and additional regulatory requirements;\n• potential exposure to natural disasters, epidemics and pandemics (and government regulations in response thereto) and\nacts of war or terrorism; and\n• potential exposure to ongoing military conflicts, including the conflict in Ukraine and in Israel and surrounding regions.\nThe U.S. and certain other countries-imposed sanctions on Russia in connection with the conflict in Ukraine and could\nimpose further sanctions against it, which could damage or disrupt international commerce and the global economy. Other\npotential consequences of such military conflicts include, but are not limited to, a heightened risk of cyber-warfare,\nbiological warfare or nuclear warfare, growth in the number of popular uprisings in the affected regions, increased\npolitical discontent, especially in the regions most affected by the conflicts or economic sanctions, continued displacement\nof persons to regions close to the areas of conflict and an increase in the number of refugees, among other unforeseen\nsocial and humanitarian effects which could impact our business, customers, and suppliers.\n29\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining key personnel.\nOur business has grown significantly since its inception. Our success is dependent in large part on the continued employment of our\nexecutive officers, including Thomas R. Stanton, our Chief Executive Officer, and other key management personnel. There have been,\nand may continue to be, changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of key personnel, and we have\nrecently made, and may continue to make, changes in compensation that may be viewed as disruptive by our key personnel. These\nchanges may result in increased attrition or reduced productivity of our key personnel as new reporting relationships are established,\nand as other companies may increasingly target our executives and other key personnel, particularly during the current highly\ncompetitive market for qualified personnel. Such changes have and may continue to result in a loss of institutional knowledge, and\nthey may cause disruptions to our business, impede our ability to achieve our objectives, or distract or result in diminished morale in,\nor the loss of, key personnel. In addition, for ADTRAN to continue as a successful entity we must also be able to attract and retain key\nengineers and software developers and architects whose expertise helps us maintain competitive advantages. We believe that our\nfuture success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to continue to attract, retain, train and motivate highly-skilled employees\nwho are in great demand. Stock awards are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions and to provide incentives\nfor them to remain with us. Changes to our overall compensation program, including changes in salaries and our stock incentive\nprogram, may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees. Properly managing our continued growth, avoiding the problems\noften resulting from such growth and expansion and continuing to operate in the manner which has proven successful to us to date\nremains critical to the future success of our business.\nWe are exposed to adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations in jurisdictions where we transact in local currency, which could\nharm our financial results and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the\nforeign-exchanges rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars\nfor financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the\ncurrent period’s currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange\nrate movements are the euro and the British pound sterling. As a result of our global operations, our revenue, gross margins, operating\nexpense and operating income in some international markets have been and may continue to be affected by foreign currency\nfluctuations.\nWe require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness, our potential payment obligations to Adtran Networks\nshareholders under the DPLTA, and other obligations.\nOur ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to service our outstanding indebtedness could\nharm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we have entered into a DPLTA with Adtran Networks.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the terms of the DPLTA, each Adtran Networks shareholder (other than the Company) has received an offer\nto elect either (1) to remain an Adtran Networks shareholder and receive from us an Annual Recurring Compensation payment, or (2)\nto receive Exit Compensation. Any failure to satisfy our payment obligations under the DPLTA could harm our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, to cover our payment obligations under the DPLTA, and to fund\nworking capital needs and planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent,\nis subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe refinanced a portion of our indebtedness during the third quarter of 2023 in order to ensure our ability to cover our potential\npayment obligations under the DPLTA, suspended our dividend during the fourth quarter of 2023, and we are currently reducing our\noperating expenses. Nevertheless, if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we do not sufficiently reduce\ncosts in a timely manner, or our future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us and our subsidiaries to\npay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to raise additional debt or equity capital, refinance all or a\nportion of our indebtedness, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, any of which could have a material adverse effect.\nIn addition, we may not be able to effect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to\nraise additional debt capital or to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our\nfinancial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more\nonerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments or preferred\nstock may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and\nprincipal on our outstanding indebtedness or dividend payments on any future outstanding shares of preferred stock would likely result\nin a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness or otherwise raise capital on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service, payment obligations\nto Adtran Networks shareholders under the DPLTA, and other obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\n30\nFurthermore, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or securities convertible into equity, or undertake certain\ntransactions intended to address our existing indebtedness, our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage\nownership of the Company, or our leverage and outstanding indebtedness could increase. Current capital market conditions, including\nthe impact of inflation, have increased borrowing rates and can be expected to significantly increase our cost of capital as compared to\nprior periods should we seek additional funding.\nWe have recognized impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in the past and may be required to do so in\nthe future.\nThe Business Combination added a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets to our consolidated balance sheets. In\naccordance with U.S. GAAP, management periodically assesses these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative\nindustry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, the inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, the under\nperformance of our business as compared to management’s initial expectations, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in\nuse of the assets, divestitures, and market capitalization declines may impair goodwill and other intangible assets. During the third\nquarter of 2023, qualitative factors such as a decrease in the Company's market capitalization and long-term projections, triggered a\nquantitative impairment assessment for our reporting units. The Company determined the fair value of each reporting unit using a\ncombination of an income approach and a market-based peer group analysis. It was determined that the decreases in projected future\ncash flows, discount rates, overall macroeconomic conditions, as well as the decrease in our market capitalization applied in the\nvaluation, were required to align with market-based assumptions and company-specific risk, which resulted in lower fair values of the\nServices & Support reporting unit. The Company determined upon its quantitative impairment assessment to recognize a $37.9 million\nnon-cash goodwill impairment charge for the Services & Support reporting unit. Any future charges relating to such impairments\ncould have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the periods recognized.\nWe may be unable to successfully and effectively manage and integrate acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions,\nwhich could harm our operating results, business and prospects.\nAs part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions,\nstrategic alliances, joint ventures, divestitures and outsourcing arrangements, and we enter into agreements relating to such\ntransactions in order to further our business objectives. In order to pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify suitable\ncandidates, successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the\nintegration of acquired companies or employees and the divestiture of combined businesses, operations and employees. Integration,\ndivestiture and other risks of these transactions can be more pronounced in larger and more complicated transactions, or if multiple\ntransactions are pursued simultaneously. If we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic\nobjectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally. This may put us at a competitive\ndisadvantage and we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on\nour revenue, gross margin and profitability.\nIntegration and divestiture issues are complex, time-consuming and expensive and, without proper planning and implementation,\ncould significantly disrupt our business. The challenges involved in integrating and divesting include:\n• combining service and product offerings and entering into new markets in which we are not experienced;\n• convincing customers and distributors that any such transaction will not diminish client service standards or business\nfocus, preventing customers and distributors from deferring purchasing decisions or switching to other suppliers or\nService Providers (which could result in additional obligations to address customer uncertainty), and coordinating service,\nsales, marketing and distribution efforts;\n• consolidating and rationalizing corporate information technology infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy\nsystems from various acquisitions and integrating software code;\n• minimizing the diversion of the Board of Directors and management's attention from ongoing business concerns;\n• persuading employees that business cultures are compatible, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees,\nintegrating employees into our company, correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring\nprograms;\n• coordinating and combining administrative, service, manufacturing, research and development and other operations,\nsubsidiaries, facilities and relationships with third parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while\nmaintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures;\n• increasing our responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire, some of which we may not anticipate,\nincluding costs of third-party advisors to resolve disputes;\n• achieving savings from supply chain and administration integration; and\n31\n• efficiently divesting combined business operations which may cause increased costs as divested businesses are de-\nintegrated from embedded systems and operations.\nWe evaluate and enter into these types of transactions on an ongoing basis. We may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of\nany transaction and the time frame for achieving benefits of a transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees,\nsuppliers or other third parties. In addition, the pricing and other terms of our contracts for these transactions require us to make\nestimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts, and, during the course of our due diligence, we may not identify\nall of the factors necessary to estimate costs accurately. Any increased or unexpected costs, unanticipated delays or failure to achieve\ncontractual obligations could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable.\nManaging these types of transactions require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other\nbusiness operations. These transactions could result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings, including those related\nto severance pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, asset impairment charges, charges from the elimination of duplicative\nfacilities and contracts, in-process research and development charges, inventory adjustments, assumed litigation, regulatory\ncompliance and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key\nemployees under retention plans. In the Business Combination with Adtran Networks, we have incurred significant restructuring and\nintegration costs and we expect to incur additional restructuring and integration costs and such costs are expected to be material.\nMoreover, we could incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in\nconnection with these transactions, and, to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a\ntransaction becomes impaired, we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. For\nexample, during the third quarter of 2023, we recognized a $37.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the Business\nCombination with Adtran Networks. In order to complete an acquisition, we may issue common shares, potentially creating dilution\nfor existing shareholders, or borrow funds, which could affect our financial condition, results of operations and potentially our credit\nratings. Any prior or future downgrades in our credit rating associated with a transaction could adversely affect our ability to borrow\nand our borrowing cost, and result in more restrictive borrowing terms. In addition, our effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is\nuncertain, and such transactions could impact our effective tax rate. We also may experience risks relating to the challenges and costs\nof closing a transaction and the risk that an announced transaction may not close. As a result, any completed, pending or future\ntransactions may contribute to financial results that differ materially from the investment community’s expectations.\nOngoing inflationary pressures have negatively impacted our revenues and profitability.\nOngoing inflationary pressures have resulted and may continue to result in decreased demand for our products and services, increased\nmanufacturing and operating costs (including our labor costs), reduced liquidity, and limitations on our ability to access credit or\notherwise raise debt and equity capital. In the current inflationary environment, because certain of our customer contracts provide for\nfixed pricing and/or due to our competitor’s pricing strategies, we are not always been able to raise the sales prices of our products and\nservices at or above the rate at which our costs increase, which has reduced our profit and operating margins and has and could\ncontinue to have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We also may experience lower than expected sales and potential\nadverse impacts on our competitive position if there is a decrease in customer spending or a negative reaction to any price increases\nwe are able to implement. A reduction in our revenue would be detrimental to our profitability and financial condition and could also\nhave an adverse impact on our future growth.\nRisks related to our control environment\nWe have had to restate our previously issued consolidated financial statements and, as part of that process, have identified material\nweaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to develop and maintain effective internal control\nover financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely\naffect investor confidence in us and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a\nreasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a\ntimely basis. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reporting and prevent\nfraud. We have had to restate our previously issued consolidated financial statements and, as part of that process, have identified\nmaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We have implemented new controls with respect to one material\nweakness, and we continue to evaluate steps to remediate the other material weaknesses. These remediation measures may be time\nconsuming and costly and there is no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. Any failure to maintain\neffective internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to report our financial position and results from\noperations on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete\nunderstanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis, we could be subject to sanctions\nor investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. In either case,\nthere could be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Ineffective internal control over\nfinancial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative\neffect on the trading price of our stock.\n32\nWe can provide no assurance that the measures that we have taken, are taking, and plan to take in the future will remediate the material\nweaknesses identified or that any additional material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a\nfailure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls. In addition,\nwhile we have strengthened our controls and procedures, in the future those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or\nidentify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements.\nFurthermore, as a public company, we are required to comply with U.S. GAAP, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"SOX\"), the Dodd-\nFrank Act and the rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.\nAs such, Adtran Networks, as a subsidiary of a public company, has established and is required to maintain effective disclosure\ncontrols, as well as internal control over financial reporting under U.S. GAAP. Current and ongoing compliance efforts have and may\ncontinue to be costly and require the attention of management. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures and\nfunctions that have been integrated, or enhanced at Adtran Networks, particularly those related to the implementation of internal\ncontrols for SOX compliance. The maintenance of these plans may lead to additional unanticipated costs and time delays. These\nincremental costs may exceed the savings we expect to achieve from the realization of efficiencies related to the combination of the\nbusinesses, particularly in the near term and in the event there are material unanticipated costs.\nWe may face litigation and other risks as a result of the restatements of our previously issued consolidated financial statements and\nmaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe had to restate our previously issued consolidated financial statements in August 2023 and March 2024 and, in connection with\nthose restatements, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, certain of which have continued\nas of the date hereof. As a result of such material weaknesses, the restatement and other matters raised or that may in the future be\nraised by the SEC, we face potential for litigation or other disputes which may include, among others, claims invoking the federal and\nstate securities laws, contractual claims or other claims arising from the restatements and the material weaknesses in our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements. As of the date of this report, we have no knowledge of\nany such litigation or dispute. However, we can provide no assurance that such litigation or dispute will not arise in the future. Any\nsuch litigation or dispute, whether successful or not, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBreaches of our information systems and cyberattacks could compromise our intellectual property and cause significant damage to\nour business and reputation.\nWe maintain sensitive data on our information systems and the networks of third-party providers, including intellectual property,\nfinancial data and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business, customers, suppliers, and business\npartners. We also produce networking equipment solutions and software used by network operators to ensure security and reliability in\ntheir management and transmission of data. Our customers, particularly those in regulated industries, are increasingly focused on the\nsecurity features of our technology solutions. Maintaining the security of information sensitive to us and our business partners is\ncritical to our business and reputation. We rely upon several internal business processes and information systems to support key\noperations and financial functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical. Companies are increasingly\nsubjected to cyberattacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. Specifically, our network and storage applications and those\nsystems and applications maintained by our third-party providers may be targeted by cyberattacks or potentially breached due to\noperator error, fraudulent activity, or other system disruptions. Furthermore, we, our employees and some of our third-party Service\nProviders have been, and anticipate continuing to be, the targets of various cybersecurity threats. These include hacking attacks, social\nengineering schemes such as \"phishing,\" and business email compromise attacks, wherein attackers impersonate company executives\nor colleagues in emails to trick employees into transferring funds or revealing sensitive information. Our information systems are\ndesigned to reflect industry standards and are engineered to reduce downtime in the event of power outages, weather or climate events\nand cybersecurity issues. To date, these threats have not had a significant effect on our financial condition or operational results;\nhowever, we cannot ensure that future cybersecurity threats might not have a material impact on our business. Unauthorized access to\nor disclosure of our information could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. These risks, as\nwell as the number and frequency of cybersecurity events globally, may also be heightened during times of geopolitical tension or\ninstability between countries. For example, a number of recent cybersecurity events have been alleged to have originated from the\nongoing military conflict in Ukraine and in the Israel/Hamas war. Further, continued increases in legislation and regulation from a\nvariety of international, federal and state authorities regarding cybersecurity incidents, including risk assessment, notification\nobligations, regulatory reporting and other requirements, could subject us to additional liability and reputational harm. We carry\ncybersecurity insurance policies meant to limit our risk and exposure should one of these cybersecurity issues occur. However, a\nsignificant failure or other compromise of our systems due to these issues could result in significant remediation costs, disrupt\nbusiness operations, and divert management attention, which could result in harm to our business reputation, operating results,\nfinancial condition, and cash flows.\nFor information on our cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance, see Part I, Item 1C of this report.\n33\nRisks related to the Business Combination and DPLTA\nOur ability to realize anticipated strategic and financial benefits sought from the Business Combination has been and may\ncontinue to be affected by a number of factors.\nOur ability to realize anticipated benefits of the Business Combination has been and may continue to be affected by a number of\nfactors, including: the need for greater than expected cash or other financial resources or management time in order to integrate Adtran\nNetworks; and increases in other expenses related to the Business Combination, including restructuring and other exit costs. In\naddition, our ability to realize anticipated benefits of the Business Combination may be affected by the following other factors in the\nfuture, including: the impact of appraisal proceedings in connection with the DPLTA, unanticipated liabilities associated with the\nBusiness Combination, difficulties in employee or management integration, the timing and impact of purchase accounting\nadjustments; and accounting for conversion of IFRS results to U.S. GAAP results.\nAny potential cost-saving opportunities may take several years following the Business Combination to implement, and any results of\nthese actions may not be realized for several years thereafter, if at all. For example, in response to a decrease in our revenue and\noperating margins during 2023 as a result of customers’ focus on reducing inventory levels and managing capital expense, we are\nrealizing reductions in our operating expenses through the implementation of a business efficiency program; however, we may not be\nsuccessful in fully realizing these reductions. If we are not able to effectively provide different solutions and successfully achieve the\ngrowth and cost savings objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination may not be realized fully, or at all, or may\ntake longer to realize than expected.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in connection with the Business Combination and post-closing\nintegration and restructuring efforts.\nWe have incurred significant non-recurring implementation and restructuring costs associated with combining the operations of\nADTRAN and Adtran Networks. In addition, we have incurred significant banking, legal, accounting and other transaction fees and\ncosts related to the Business Combination. As of December 31, 2023, we have incurred $26.2 million of transaction costs related to the\nBusiness Combination.\nIn addition, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized $21.5 million of restructuring costs specific to the Business\nCombination synergies under our multi-year integration program.\nFurthermore, we expect to incur costs associated with the implementation of the DPLTA and such costs are expected to be material.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized $4.9 million of integration costs related to the implementation of the\nDPLTA and the Business Combination.\nTo date, cost savings and other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses have not offset these transaction- and\ncombination-related costs, and we may not be able to offset such costs in the near term, or at all. Failure to realize these synergies and\ncost reductions and other efficiencies in a timely manner or at all has impacted and may in the future have a material adverse effect on\nour business and cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness in connection with the Business Combination and the DPLTA. Our failure to\nmeet our debt service obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nUpon the DPLTA becoming effective on January 16, 2023, the available total borrowings under the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement\nincreased from $100.0 million to $400.0 million. We further expanded our available borrowings under the credit facility to $450.0\nmillion effective August 9, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had incurred $195.0 million of indebtedness under the Wells\nFargo Credit Agreement. See \"Cash Requirements\" in Part II, Item 7 of this report for additional information. In addition, our new\nfactoring arrangement provides for borrowings of up to $40.0 million, secured by our accounts receivable.\nOur increased indebtedness has and may continue to adversely affect our operations and liquidity. Our level of indebtedness:\n• could make it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry\nconditions because we may not have sufficient cash flows to make its scheduled debt payments;\n• has caused us and may continue to cause us to use a larger portion of our cash flow to fund interest and principal\npayments, reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development and\nother business activities;\n• has contributed to our decision to suspend quarterly dividend payments to the Company's stockholders;\n• limits our ability to assume debt in a future acquisitions. Specifically, our Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo limits the\namount of debt we can assume in an acquisition. This could limit our ability to take advantage of significant business\nopportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions;\n• could cause us to be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n34\n• could cause us to be disadvantaged compared to competitors with less leverage; and\n• limits our ability to borrow additional money. Specifically, our Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo limits our ability to\nborrow additional money, which could limit our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and\ndevelopment and other general corporate needs in the future.\nOur ability to satisfy our debt obligations and renew the credit facility is dependent upon our future performance and other risk factors\ndiscussed in this section. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit\nus to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If we fail to pay interest on, or repay, our borrowings under\nthe Wells Fargo credit facility when required, we will be in default under the applicable loans, and may also suffer an event of default\nunder the terms of other borrowing arrangements that we may enter into from time to time. We are reducing our operating expenses in\norder to fund our obligations, and we may be forced to further reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek\nadditional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these\nactions, that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled obligations or that these actions would be\npermitted under the terms of our current or future debt agreements. If we fail to implement these reductions or are unable to achieve\nsufficient operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity challenges and might be required to dispose of material\nassets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or obtain\nsufficient proceeds from those dispositions to meet our debt service and other obligations when due. Any of these events could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may also incur additional long-term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would increase\nour total indebtedness. Although the terms of its existing and future credit agreements and of the indentures governing its debt contain\nrestrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, including secured debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of important\nexceptions and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If we or our restricted subsidiaries incur\nsignificant additional debt, the relative risks may intensify.\nWe have experienced operational challenges and may also experience negative synergies and loss of customers.\nIntegrating the operations and personnel of the ADTRAN and Adtran Networks businesses involves complex operational,\ntechnological and personnel-related challenges. This process has been and will continue to be time-consuming and expensive, and it\nhas and may continue to disrupt our business. Difficulties in the integration of the business, which have resulted and may in the future\nresult in significant costs and delays, include:\n• managing a significantly larger company;\n• integrating and unifying the offerings and services available to customers and coordinating distribution and marketing\nefforts;\n• coordinating corporate and administrative infrastructures and harmonizing insurance coverage;\n• unanticipated issues in coordinating accounting, information technology, communications, administration and other\nsystems;\n• difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n• challenges associated with converting Adtran Networks' financial reporting from international financial reporting\nstandards (IFRS) to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP) and compliance with the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules promulgated thereunder by the SEC;\n• legal and regulatory compliance;\n• dual market filing and publications obligations;\n• creating and implementing uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n• litigation relating to the transactions contemplated by a reorganization, including shareholder litigation;\n• diversion of management’s attention from other operations;\n• maintaining existing agreements and relationships with customers, distributors, providers and vendors and avoiding delays\nin entering into new agreements with prospective customers, distributors, providers and vendors;\n• realizing the benefits from our restructuring programs;\n• unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the Business Combination, including the risk that certain executive\nofficers may be subject to additional fiduciary duties and liability;\n35\n• identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming functions and assets;\n• effecting actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals; and\n• a deterioration of credit ratings.\nWe have and may continue to lose customers or our share of customers’ business as entities that were customers of both ADTRAN and\nAdtran Networks seek to diversify their suppliers of services and products.\nThe terms of the DPLTA may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition.\nThe DPLTA between the Company, as the controlling company, and Adtran Networks, as the controlled company, which was executed\non December 1, 2022, became effective on January 16, 2023, as a result of its registration with the commercial register\n(Handelsregister) of the local court (Amtsgericht) at the registered seat of Adtran Networks (Jena).\nUnder the DPLTA, subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, (i) the Company is\nentitled to issue binding instructions to the management board of Adtran Networks, (ii) Adtran Networks will transfer its annual profit\nto the Company, subject to, among other things, the creation or dissolution of certain reserves, and (iii) the Company will generally\nabsorb the annual net loss incurred by Adtran Networks. The obligation of the Company to absorb Adtran Networks annual net loss\napplied for the first time to the loss generated in 2023.\nAdditionally, and subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, the DPLTA provides\nthat Adtran Networks shareholders (other than the Company) be offered, at their election, (i) to put their Adtran Networks shares to the\nCompany in exchange for compensation in cash of €17.21 per share, plus guaranteed interest (the “Exit Compensation”), or (ii) to\nremain Adtran Networks shareholders and receive a recurring compensation in cash of €0.59 (€0.52 net under the current tax regime)\nper share for each full fiscal year of Adtran Networks (the “Annual Recurring Compensation”). The guaranteed interest under the Exit\nCompensation is calculated from the effective date of the DPLTA to the date the shares are tendered, less any Annual Recurring\nCompensation paid. The guaranteed interest rate is 5.0% plus a variable component, that is based on the interest rate according to the\nGerman Civil Code, which was 3.12% as of December 31, 2023. The Annual Recurring Compensation is due on the third banking day\nfollowing the ordinary general shareholders’ meeting of Adtran Networks for the respective preceding fiscal year (but in any event\nwithin eight months following expiration of the fiscal year) it will be payable for the first time after the ordinary general shareholders’\nmeeting of Adtran Networks in 2024 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The adequacy of both forms of compensation has\nbeen challenged by minority shareholders of Adtran Networks via court-led appraisal proceedings under German law and it is possible\nthat the courts in such appraisal proceedings may adjudicate a higher Exit Compensation or Annual Recurring Compensation (in each\ncase, including interest thereon) than agreed upon in the DPLTA. Our obligation to pay Annual Recurring Compensation under the\nDPLTA is a continuing payment obligation, which will amount to approximately €10.6 million or $11.7 million (based on the\nexchange rate as of December 31, 2023) per year assuming none of the minority Adtran Networks shareholders were to elect Exit\nCompensation. The foregoing amounts do not reflect any potential increase in payment obligations that we may have depending on the\noutcome of ongoing appraisal proceedings in Germany. For the year ended December 31, 2023, a total of 67 thousand shares of Adtran\nNetworks stock was tendered to the Company and Exit Compensation payments of approximately €1.2 million or approximately $1.3\nmillion based on an exchange rate as of December 31, 2023, were paid to Adtran Networks shareholders. Assuming all the minority\nholders of currently outstanding Adtran Networks shares were to elect the first option, we would be obligated to make aggregate Exit\nCompensation payments, including guaranteed interest, of approximately €310.3 million or approximately $342.5 million, based on an\nexchange rate as of December 31, 2023. In addition to our cash and cash equivalents and the credit facility, we may fund a portion or\nall of the Annual Recurring Compensation and Exit Compensation through the sale of securities or additional alternative funding\nsources, if available. There can be no assurances that we would be successful in effecting these actions at commercially reasonable\nterms or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds as needed, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and\nfinancial condition. Additionally, the payment of the Annual Recurring Compensation and Exit Compensation could have a material\nadverse impact on our financial results and financial condition. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Part II, Item 7 of this report\nfor additional information.\nThe opportunity for outside Adtran Networks shareholders to tender Adtran Networks shares in exchange for Exit Compensation had\nbeen scheduled to expire on March 16, 2023. However, due to the appraisal proceedings that have been initiated in accordance with\napplicable German law, this time period for tendering shares has been extended pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act\n(Aktiengesetz) and will end two months after the date on which a final decision in such appraisal proceedings has been published in the\nFederal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger).\nThe amount of this Annual Recurring Compensation payment obligation pursuant to the DPLTA could exceed the amount of dividends\nthat otherwise might be distributed by Adtran Networks to minority shareholders and would even have to be paid if Adtran Networks\nincurs losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and financial condition.\n36\nWe are exposed to additional litigation risk and uncertainty with respect to the remaining minority shareholders of Adtran\nNetworks, which litigation may require us to pay a higher purchase price for additional Adtran Networks shares than the amount\nprovided for under the DPLTA.\nAs a result of the Business Combination, we continue to be exposed to litigation risk and uncertainty associated with the remaining\nminority shareholders of Adtran Networks. The terms of the DPLTA, including the adequacy of compensation payments to minority\nAdtran Networks shareholders under the terms of the DPLTA, have been challenged by minority shareholders of Adtran Networks by\ninitiating court-led appraisal proceedings under German law. We cannot rule out that the competent court in these appraisal\nproceedings may adjudicate higher Exit Compensation or Annual Recurring Compensation payment obligations (in each case,\nincluding interest thereon) than agreed upon in the DPLTA, the financial impact and timing of which is uncertain.\nWe may be unable to successfully retain and motivate our personnel.\nThe success of the Business Combination and our post-closing integration efforts depends, in part, on our ability to retain the talents\nand dedication of key employees, including key decision-makers, currently employed by ADTRAN, Inc. and Adtran Networks. Some\nof our employees have decided and others may decide not to remain with us as a result of the Business Combination or our post-\nclosing integration and restructuring efforts. If key employees terminate their employment, or if an insufficient number of employees\nare retained to maintain effective operations, our business activities may be adversely affected and management’s attention may be\ndiverted from successfully integrating ADTRAN and Adtran Networks to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause our\nbusiness to deteriorate. We may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to\npotential replacements on reasonable terms. In addition, we may not be able to motivate certain key employees due to organizational\nchanges, reassignments of responsibilities, the perceived lack of appropriate opportunities for advancement or other reasons. If we fail\nto successfully retain and motivate our employees, relevant capabilities and expertise may be lost which may have an adverse effect on\nour cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and the business operations in general.\nRisks related to the telecommunications industry\nWe must continue to update and improve our products and develop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements\nin communications technology.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and continuing\nimprovements in the communications service offerings of Service Providers. If technologies or standards applicable to our products, or\nService Provider offerings based on our products, become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our existing\nproducts or products under development may become obsolete or unmarketable, which can result in the discontinuation of products\nand write off of related inventory. For example, during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, management determined that there\nwould be a discontinuation of product lines in the Network Solutions segment. For more information, see Note 6 of Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Moreover, the introduction of products embodying new\ntechnologies, the emergence of new industry standards, or changes in Service Provider offerings could adversely affect our ability to\nsell our products. For instance, we offer a large number of products that apply primarily to the delivery of high-speed digital\ncommunications over the local loop utilizing copper wire. We compete favorably with our competitors by developing a high-\nperformance line of these products. We market products that apply to fiber optic transport in the local loop. We expect, however, that\nuse of coaxial cable and fixed and mobile wireless access in place of local loop access will increase. Also, MSOs are increasing their\npresence in the local loop. To meet the requirements of these new delivery systems and to maintain our market position, we expect to\ncontinue to develop new products and/or modify existing products. We expect that the addition of fiber-based products focused on the\ncable MSO operators, using EPON and fixed wireless access solutions will better position us to benefit from spending in these\nadjacent markets.\nOur revenue and profitability in the past have, to a significant extent, resulted from our ability to anticipate changes in technology,\nindustry standards and Service Provider offerings, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products. Our continued ability to\nadapt will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and our prospects for growth. We cannot assure\nthat we will be able to respond effectively to changes in technology, industry standards, Service Provider offerings or new product\nannouncements by our competitors. We also cannot assure that we will be able to successfully develop and market new products or\nproduct enhancements, or that these products or enhancements will achieve market acceptance. Any failure by us to continue to\nanticipate or respond in a cost-effective and timely manner to changes in technology, industry standards, Service Provider offerings or\nnew product announcements by our competitors, or any significant delays in product development or introduction, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our ability to competitively market our products and on our revenue, results of operations, financial\ncondition and cash flows.\n37\nOur failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable environmental regulations could adversely\nimpact our results of operations.\nThe manufacture, assembly and testing of our products may require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to environmental,\nhealth and safety regulations. Our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with any of these applicable\nrequirements could result in regulatory penalties, legal claims or disruption of production. In addition, our failure or the failure of our\ncontract manufacturers to properly manage the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage, recycling or disposal of hazardous\nmaterials could subject us to increased costs or liabilities. Existing and future environmental regulations may restrict our use of certain\nmaterials to manufacture, assemble and test products. Any of these consequences could adversely impact our results of operations by\nincreasing our expenses and/or requiring us to alter our manufacturing processes.\nIf our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks, installations may be delayed or canceled, which could harm our\nbusiness.\nOur products must interface with existing networks, each of which may have different specifications, utilize multiple protocol\nstandards and incorporate products from other vendors. Many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products\nthat have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved. Our products may be required to interoperate with many or\nall of the products within these networks, as well as future products to meet our customers’ requirements. If we find errors in the\nexisting software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks, we may have to modify our software or hardware to fix\nor overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate with the existing software and hardware. Implementation of product\ncorrections involving interoperability issues could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations. Such issues may\naffect our ability to obtain product acceptance from other customers.\nWe engage in research and development activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application of developed\ntechnologies, and as a consequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially greater\nresearch and development efforts and which may focus on more leading edge development.\nA portion of our research and development activities are focused on the continued innovation of currently accepted access and edge\ntransmission technologies in order to deliver faster internet speeds, more capacity, better quality of service and operational efficiency.\nThese research and development efforts result in improved applications of technologies for which demand already exists or is latent.\nWe also focus our research and development efforts on developing software, solutions and platforms that enable Service Providers to\nincrease revenue-generating service velocity, reducing operational costs, increasing scale and providing service agility. We rarely\nengage in research projects that represent a vast departure from the current business practices of our key customers. While we believe\nour strategy provides a higher likelihood of producing nearer term or more sustainable revenue streams, this strategy could result in\nlost revenue opportunities and higher operating expenses should a new technology achieve rapid and widespread market acceptance.\nWhen we do engage in research and development activities for new, leading-edge technologies and market approaches, there is no\nguarantee that those technologies or market approaches will be successful or that they will be adopted and purchased by our\ncustomers.\nOur strategy of outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing requirements to subcontractors located in various international\nregions may result in us not meeting our cost, quality or performance standards.\nWe are heavily dependent on subcontractors for the assembly and testing of certain printed circuit board assemblies, subassemblies,\nchassis, enclosures and equipment shelves, and the purchase of some raw materials used in such assemblies. This reliance involves\nseveral risks, including the unavailability of, or interruptions in, access to certain process technologies and reduced control over\nproduct quality, delivery schedules, transportation, manufacturing yields and costs. We may not be able to provide product order\nvolumes to our subcontractors that are high enough to achieve sufficient cost savings. If shipments fall below forecasted levels, we\nmay incur increased costs or be required to take ownership of excess inventory. Changes in international tariff structures could\nadversely impact our product costs. We also have experienced and expect to continue to experience ongoing inflationary pressures on\ninput costs, such as, raw materials, labor and distribution costs. Our attempts to offset these cost pressures, such as through increases\nin the selling prices of some of our products and services, may not be successful and could negatively affect our operating results. In\naddition, a significant component of maintaining cost competitiveness is the ability of our subcontractors to adjust their costs to\ncompensate for possible adverse exchange rate movements. To the extent that the subcontractors are unable to do so, and we are\nunable to procure alternative product supplies, then our competitiveness and results of operations could be adversely impaired. These\nrisks may be exacerbated by economic, regulatory or political changes or uncertainties, terrorist actions, acts of war, the effects of\nclimate change, natural disasters or pandemics in the foreign countries in which our subcontractors are located.\nTo date, we believe that we have successfully managed the risks of our dependence on these subcontractors through a variety of\nefforts, which include seeking and developing alternative subcontractors while maintaining existing relationships; however, we cannot\nbe assured that delays in product deliveries will not occur in the future because of shortages resulting from this limited number of\nsubcontractors or from the financial or other difficulties of these parties. Our inability to identify and engage alternative subcontractors\nif and as required in the future, or the need to undertake required retraining and other activities related to establishing and developing a\n38\nnew subcontractor relationship, could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which, in turn, could have a negative effect\non our customer relationships and operating results.\nOur failure to maintain rights to intellectual property used in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality\nand commercial value of our products.\nOur future success depends in part upon our proprietary technology. Although we attempt to protect our proprietary technology by\ncontract, trademark, copyright and patent registration and internal security, including trade secret protection, these protections may not\nbe adequate. Furthermore, our competitors can develop similar technology independently without violating our proprietary rights.\nFrom time to time, we receive and may continue to receive notices of claims alleging that we are infringing upon patents or other\nintellectual property. Any of these claims, whether with or without merit, could result in significant legal fees, divert our\nmanagement’s time, attention and resources, delay our product shipments or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\nWe cannot predict whether we will prevail in any claims or litigation over alleged infringements, or whether we will be able to license\nany valid and infringed patents, or other intellectual property, on commercially reasonable terms. For example, on August 22, 2023,\nAdtran Networks and its subsidiary Adtran Networks North America, Inc. (formerly ADVA Optical Networking North America, Inc.)\nentered into a settlement agreement with Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. pursuant to which the parties agreed to, among other things,\ndismiss certain lawsuits between the parties relating to, claims of patent infringement, failure to negotiate in good faith, and other\nrelated matters. If further claims of intellectual property infringement against us are successful and we fail to obtain a license or\ndevelop or license non-infringing technology, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially\nadversely affected.\nThird party hardware or software that is used with our portfolios may not continue to be available or at commercially reasonable\nterms.\nWe integrate third-party software into certain of our products. Licenses for this technology may not be available or continue to be\navailable to us on commercially reasonable terms. Difficulties with third-party technology licensors could result in the termination of\nsuch licenses, which may result in increased costs or require us to purchase or develop a substitute technology. Difficulty obtaining\nand maintaining third-party technology licenses may disrupt the development of our products and increase our costs, which could\nharm our business.\nOur use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products.\nSeveral of our solutions utilize elements of open source or publicly available software. Although we closely monitor our use of open\nsource software, the terms of many open source software licenses have not been interpreted by the courts, and there is a risk that such\nlicenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to sell our products.\nIn such event, we could be required to make our proprietary software generally available to third parties, including competitors, at no\ncost, to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the\nsale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or at all, any of which could adversely affect\nour revenue and operating profitability.\nWe may incur liabilities or become subject to litigation that would have a material effect on our business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we accept purchase orders, and enter into sales and other related contracts, for the marketing, sale,\nmanufacture, distribution or use of our products and services. We may incur liabilities relating to our performance under such\nagreements, or which result from damage claims arising from certain events as outlined within the particular contract. While we\nattempt to include reasonable limitations of liability and other protective measures to all agreements, such agreements may not always\ncontain, or be subject to, maximum loss clauses and liabilities arising from them may result in significant adverse changes to our\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including employment disputes, patent\nclaims, disputes over contract agreements and other commercial disputes. In some cases, claimants seek monetary recovery, or other\nrelief, including damages such as royalty payments related to patents, lost profits or injunctive relief, which, if granted, could require\nsignificant expenditures. For example, on August 22, 2023, Adtran Networks and its subsidiary, Adtran Networks North America, Inc.\n(formerly ADVA Optical Networking North America, Inc.) entered into a settlement agreement with Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd\npursuant to which the parties agreed to, among other things, dismiss certain lawsuits between the parties relating to, claims of patent\ninfringement, failure to negotiate in good faith, and other related matters.\nAny such disputes may be resolved before trial, or if tried, may be resolved in our favor; however, the cost of claims sustained in\nlitigation, and costs associated with the litigation process, may not be covered by our insurance. Such costs, and the demands on\nmanagement time during such an event, could harm our business, reputation and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results\nof operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n39\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and maintain relationships with SIs, Service Providers and enterprise VARs, our revenue\nmay be negatively affected.\nAs part of our sales strategy, we are targeting SIs, Service Providers and enterprise VARs. In addition to specialized technical\nexpertise, SIs, Service Providers and VARs typically offer sophisticated service capabilities that are frequently desired by enterprise\ncustomers. To expand our distribution channel to include resellers with such capabilities, we must be able to provide effective support\nto these resellers. If our sales, marketing or service capabilities are not sufficient to provide effective support to such SIs, Service\nProviders and VARs, our revenue may be negatively affected, and current SI, Service Provider and VAR partners may terminate their\nrelationships with us, which would adversely impact our revenue and overall results of operations.\nWe depend on a third-party cloud platform provider to host our Mosaic One SaaS network operating platform, and if we were to\nexperience a disruption or interference in service, our business and reputation could suffer.\nOur continued growth depends in part on the ability of our existing and potential customers to use and access our Mosaic One SaaS\nnetwork operating platform. We use third-party service providers that we do not control for key components of our infrastructure,\nparticularly with respect to delivery of our SaaS products. The use of these service providers gives us greater flexibility in efficiently\ndelivering a more tailored, scalable customer experience, but also exposes us to additional risks and vulnerabilities. Third-party\nservice providers operate their own platforms that we access, and we are, therefore, vulnerable to their service interruptions. We may\nexperience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time as a result of problems with our third-party\nservice providers’ infrastructure. Lack of availability of this infrastructure could be due to a number of potential causes including\ntechnical failures, natural disasters, fraud or security attacks that we cannot predict or prevent. Such outages could adversely impact\nour business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to the Company’s stock price\nOur operating results historically have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate in future periods. Such fluctuations can\nadversely affect our stock price.\nOur operating results have been, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors.\nThese factors include, but are not limited to:\n• fluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially with respect to significant network expansion projects\nundertaken by Service Providers;\n• continued growth of communications network traffic and the adoption of communication services and applications by\nenterprise and consumer end users;\n• changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers’ spending plans and\nassociated revenue, especially should a slowdown in communications industry spending occur due to economic\ndownturns, tight capital markets, or declining liquidity trends;\n• reductions in demand for our traditional products as new technologies gain acceptance;\n• our ability, and that of our distributors, to maintain appropriate inventory levels and related purchase commitments;\n• price and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change rapidly due to\ntechnological innovation;\n• the overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers;\n• our dependence on sales of our products by channel partners and the timing of their replenishment orders. Specifically, our\nsales volume in 2023 has been negatively impacted due to our channel partners focus on reducing inventory levels;\n• the potential for conflicts and competition involving our channel partners and large end-user customers and the potential\nfor consolidation among our channel partners;\n• variations in sales channels, product cost or mix of products and services sold;\n• delays in receiving acceptance, as defined under contract, from certain customers for shipments or services performed\nnear the end of a reporting period;\n• our ability to maintain high levels of product support and professional services;\n• manufacturing and customer order lead times, and potential restrictions in the supply of key components;\n• fluctuations in our gross margin and the factors that contribute to this (as described above);\n40\n• our ability to achieve cost reductions;\n• the ability of our customers, channel partners and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures;\n• our ability to execute on our strategy and operating plans;\n• benefits anticipated from our investments in engineering, sales and marketing activities;\n• the effects of climate change and other natural events;\n• the effect of political or economic conditions, including the effect of tariffs or so-called “trade wars” on us and our supply\nchain, acts of war, terrorist attacks or other unrest in certain international markets;\n• the effect of escalating tensions resulting from the conflict in Israel and its surrounding regions, as well as the military\nconflict in Ukraine. The U.S. and certain other countries imposed sanctions on Russia and could impose further sanctions\nagainst it, which could damage or disrupt international commerce and the global economy; and\n• changes in tax laws and regulations or accounting pronouncements.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ADTN and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange\nunder the symbol QH9. Since our initial public offering in August 1994, there has been, and may continue to be, significant volatility\nin the market for our common stock, based on a variety of factors, including factors listed in this section, some of which are beyond\nour control.\nRisks related to the regulatory environments in which we do business\nWe are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and standards governing the conduct of our business.\nViolations of these laws and regulations may harm our business, subject us to penalties and to other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that govern conduct by our Company, our employees and agents and the manufacture, sale and\nuse of our products. Our inability to comply with current and evolving laws and regulations governing our business domestically and\ninternationally may adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. New and changing laws,\nregulations and industry practices could require us to modify our business, products or services offered, potentially in a material\nmanner, and may limit our ability to develop new products, services and features. If we violate these laws and regulations,\ngovernmental authorities in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions could seek to impose civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which\ncould have an adverse effect on our reputation, as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThese laws and regulations include, but are not limited to:\n• various regulations and regional standards established by communications authorities and import/export control\nauthorities that govern the manufacture, sale and use of our products. Changes in domestic or international\ncommunications regulations, tariffs, potential changes in trade policies by the U.S. and other nations, application\nrequirements, import/export controls or expansion of regulation to new areas, including access, communications or\ncommerce over the internet, may affect customer demand for our products or slow the adoption of new technologies\nwhich may affect our revenue. Further, the cost of complying with the evolving standards and regulations, including the\ncost of product re-design if necessary, or the failure to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or\ncertification such that we may not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply, may adversely\naffect our revenue, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n• compliance with a wide variety of provincial, state, national and international laws and regulations applicable to the\ncollection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of data, including personal data. Foreign\ndata protection, privacy and other laws and regulations, including GDPR, are often more restrictive than those in the U.S.\nThese data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are varied, evolving, can be subject to significant change,\nmay be augmented or replaced by new or additional laws and regulations and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and\npublic scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. For example, within the past three years, numerous\nstates have adopted or are in the process of adopting various privacy-related laws and regulations. In addition, on July 16,\n2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a decision that invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework\nas a basis for transfers of personal data from the EU to the U.S., resulting in uncertainty and potential additional\ncompliance obligations to ensure that a valid basis under the GDPR exists for these data transfers. Since that time, the\nE.U. and U.S. have developed the successor E.U.-U.S. Data Privacy Framework to address the 2020 decision, and on July\n10, 2023, the European Commission issued an adequacy decision for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which entered\nin force on July 11, 2023; however, there are indications there may be legal challenges to the decision. Additionally, the\nEuropean Commission published revised standard contractual clauses for data transfers from the European Economic Area\nin 2021,\n41\nwhich were required to go into effect by December 2022. Finally, the U.K. has enacted a version of the GDPR the\nimplementation of which occurred by way of the Data Protection Act 2018, collectively referred to as the \"U.K. GDPR.\"\nUncertainty remains, however, regarding how aspects of data protection in the U.K. will be handled in the medium to long\nterm. There is also a risk that we, directly or as the result of a third-party Service Provider we use, could be found to have\nfailed to comply with the laws and regulations applicable in a jurisdiction regarding the collection, consent, handling,\ntransfer or disposal of personal data.\n• the FCPA, which prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for\nthe purpose of directing, obtaining or keeping business, and requires companies to maintain reasonable books and records\nand a system of internal accounting controls. The FCPA applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees\nand agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by employees, strategic or\nlocal partners or other representatives. Because a significant portion of our total revenue is generated from revenue outside\nof the U.S., we have proactively implemented internally and externally focused measures and controls to address this risk.\nWe help ensure that our employees understand the key requirements of FCPA compliance and the consequences of non-\ncompliance through training courses and detective controls. ADTRAN senior management and employees whose\nresponsibilities include international activities are required to complete an online training program and pass an exam every\ntwo years. We have put processes in place to help detect non-compliance through providing our employees access to a\nworldwide reporting “hotline,” available by phone and online, that is maintained by a third-party provider. Finally, we\nperform annual reviews of our employees’ expense reports and corporate credit card activity to identify possible\ncorruption concerns. We have also implemented controls to help ensure our third-party partners and customers observe\nFCPA requirements. Prior to selling to new international distributors, resellers or agents, we review third-party data and\ncheck them against over 200 denied party lists from government institutions worldwide for potential FCPA concerns. We\nalso require international distributors, resellers and agents to complete an Anti-Corruption Due Diligence Questionnaire,\nwhich is reviewed and assessed by a cross-functional compliance committee and our export-compliance function.\n• environmental, health and safety regulations governing the manufacture, assembly and testing of our products, including\nwithout limitation regulations governing the use of hazardous materials. Our failure or the failure of our contract\nmanufacturers to properly manage the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage, recycling or disposal of hazardous\nmaterials could subject us to increased costs or liabilities. Existing and future environmental regulations may restrict our\nuse of certain materials to manufacture, assemble and test products.\n• requirements by the SEC governing the disclosure regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and adjoining countries (the “DRC”) and disclosure with respect to procedures regarding a\nmanufacturer’s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals from the DRC. Certain of these minerals are present in our\nproducts. SEC rules implementing these requirements may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers that can\nsupply “conflict free” components and parts, and we may not be able to obtain conflict free products or supplies in\nsufficient quantities for our operations. Because our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with\nour customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins for the conflict\nminerals used in our products and cannot assert that our products are “conflict free.” Environmental or similar social\ninitiatives may also make it difficult to obtain supply of compliant components or may require us to write off non-\ncompliant inventory, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n42\n• the insider trading prohibitions and the respective directors' dealing rules, as well as disclosure and reporting obligations\nunder the German Securities Trading Act (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz) and Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 of the European\nParliament and of the Council of April 16, 2014, and other applicable regulations.\nChanges in trade policy in the U.S. and other countries, specifically the U.K. and China, including the imposition of additional\ntariffs and the resulting consequences, may adversely impact our gross profits, gross margins, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nIn recent years, international market conditions and the international regulatory environment have been increasingly affected by\ncompetition among countries and geopolitical frictions. In particular, there have been a number of significant geopolitical events,\nincluding trade tensions and regulatory actions, involving the governments of the U.S. and China. The U.S. government has raised\ntariffs, and imposed new tariffs, on a wide range of imports of Chinese products, including component elements of our solutions and\ncertain finished goods products that we sell. U.S. tariff policy involving imports from China remains under review by the Office of the\nUnited States Trade Representative. The U.S. government has also introduced broad new restrictions on imports from China allegedly\nmanufactured with forced labor, and the EU has debated similar restrictions. In addition, other countries are debating or have\nintroduced similar restrictions on imports of goods produced in whole or in part with the use of forced labor. China has retaliated by\nraising tariffs, and imposing new tariffs, on certain exports of U.S. goods to China, as well as introducing blocking measures to restrict\nthe ability of domestic companies to comply with U.S. trade restrictions and could take further steps to retaliate against U.S. industries\nor companies. For instance, over the course of 2020, the U.S. introduced significant further restrictions limiting access to controlled\nU.S. technology to additional Chinese government and commercial entities. More recently, in October 2022, the U.S. Department of\nCommerce imposed additional export control restrictions targeting the provision of certain semiconductors and related technology to\nChina that could further disrupt supply chains that could adversely impact our business. In addition, the U.S. Federal Communications\nCommission in November 2022 prohibited communications equipment deemed to pose an unacceptable risk to national security from\nobtaining the equipment authorization that allows the products to be imported, marketed, or sold in the U.S. This prohibition currently\nincludes telecommunications equipment produced by Huawei and its affiliates and subsidiaries and four other Chinese companies, and\nadditional entities may be subsequently added to this list. The situation involving U.S.-China trade relations remains volatile and\nuncertain and there can be no assurance that further actions by either country will not have an adverse impact on our business,\noperations and access to technology, or components thereof, sourced from China. Furthermore, if global economic and market\nconditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or further deteriorate, we may experience material impacts on our\nbusiness and operating results. We may also be adversely affected in ways that we do not currently anticipate.\nNew or revised tax regulations, changes in our effective tax rate, recognition of a valuation allowance or assessments arising from\ntax audits may have an adverse impact on our results.\nWe are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions, both domestically and internationally, in which we conduct business. Significant\njudgment is required in the determination of our provision for income taxes, and this determination requires the interpretation and\napplication of complex and sometimes uncertain tax laws and regulations. Our effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by\nchanges in the mix of earnings between jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, and\nby changes in tax rules and regulations. We continually monitor our deferred tax assets and when it becomes more likely than not that\na tax benefit will not be recognized, a valuation allowance is recorded against those assets. In addition, we are subject to examination\nof our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and various other tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we conduct\nbusiness. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our\nprovision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse\neffect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Additionally, we continually review the adequacy of the\nvaluation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not\nthat the deferred tax assets will be recognized. As such, we may release a portion of the valuation allowance or establish a new\nvaluation allowance based on operations in the jurisdictions in which these assets arose. Management continues to evaluate all\nevidence including historical operating results, the existence of losses in the most recent year, forecasted earnings, future taxable\nincome and tax planning strategies. Should management determine that a valuation allowance is needed in the future due to not being\nable to absorb deferred tax assets, it would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, which made a number of changes to the Internal Revenue Code,\nincluding adding a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks by publicly traded corporations and a 15% corporate minimum tax on adjusted\nfinancial statement income of certain large companies. The impact of these provisions on our effective tax rate will also depend on\nadditional guidance to be issued by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. We are currently evaluating the impact of\nthese provisions on our effective tax rate. Further, the Tax Act amended the Internal Revenue Code to require that specific research\nand experimental (“R&E”) expenditures be capitalized and amortized over five years (U.S. R&E) or fifteen years (non-U.S. R&E)\nbeginning in the Company’s fiscal 2023. Although the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would defer, modify, or repeal the\ncapitalization and amortization requirement, there is no assurance that the provision will be deferred, repealed, or otherwise modified.\nIf the requirement is not repealed or otherwise modified, it may increase our effective tax rate. Additionally, the Organization for\nEconomic Co-operation and Development (the “OECD”), the G20, and other invited countries developed a global tax framework\n43\ninclusive of a 15% global minimum tax under the Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules (“Pillar Two”). On December 15, 2022,\nthe Council of the European Union (“EU”) formally adopted the OECD’s framework to achieve a coordinated implementation\namongst EU Member States consistent with EU law. The EU’s Pillar Two Directive effective dates are January 1, 2024, and January 1,\n2025, for different aspects of the directive. In 2023, other jurisdictions including the United Kingdom also formally adopted legislation\nconsistent with the OECD framework. Additional jurisdictions are actively considering and implementing changes to their tax laws to\nadopt certain parts of the OECD’s proposals. We have assessed the framework including OECD administrative guidance and expect,\nbased upon available guidance, that these changes will not have a material impact to our results of operations; however, any future\nchanges in OECD guidance or interpretations, could impact our initial assessment. Many aspects of the minimum tax directive will be\neffective beginning in fiscal 2025, with certain remaining impacts to be effective beginning in fiscal 2026. While it is uncertain\nwhether the U.S. will enact legislation to adopt the minimum tax directive, certain countries in which we operate have adopted\nlegislation, and other countries are in the process of introducing legislation to implement the minimum tax directive.\nCentral Banks' monetary policy actions could increase our costs of borrowing money and negatively impact our financial\ncondition and future operations.\nMonetary policy in response to ongoing inflationary pressures has led to continued elevated interest rates and an inversion of the yield\ncurve, which has and may continue to result in increased credit costs and decreased credit availability. Changes in interest rates have\nimpacted and may in the future further impact our costs of borrowing money under certain of our debt facilities with variable interest\nrates, which could negatively impact our financial condition and future operations.\nWe see an increased risk to our liquidity due to the current instability in the financial services industry which could negatively impact\nour financial condition and future operations. This includes risk relating to our liquidity balances and investments, as well as risk\nrelating to the financial stability of our customers and suppliers. We seek to only enter into transactions with creditworthy banks and\nfinancial institutions. To assess the creditworthiness of banks, we utilize current credit ratings from rating agencies, such as S&P,\nMoodyʼs and Fitch, as well as current default rates (credit default swaps). We are also in frequent dialogue with customers and\nsuppliers to assess counterparty risks. Nevertheless, many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of our\ncounterparty’s default. Any such losses could be material and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose the Company to potential liabilities,\nincreased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental,\nsocial and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil\nrights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, we may make statements about our environmental, social and governance goals\nand initiatives through our website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and\ngovernance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and\ndepends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside of our control. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our\ntargets, further our initiatives, adhere to our public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and\ngovernance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and\nregulatory proceedings against us and materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition\nand stock price.\nFurther downgrades of the U.S. credit rating, impending automatic spending cuts or a government shutdown could negatively\nimpact our liquidity, financial condition and earnings.\nU.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of additional credit-rating downgrades and economic\nslowdowns, or a recession in the United States. Although U.S. lawmakers passed legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling on\nmultiple occasions, including a suspension of the federal debt ceiling in June 2023, ratings agencies have lowered or threatened to\nlower the long-term sovereign credit rating on the United States.\nThe impact of this or any further downgrades to the U.S. government’s sovereign credit rating or its perceived creditworthiness could\nadversely affect the U.S. and global financial markets and economic conditions. Absent further quantitative easing by the Federal\nReserve, these developments could cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact our ability to access\nthe debt markets on favorable terms. In addition, although a limited budget deal was signed into law in early March, the federal\ngovernment continues to be at risk of a partial shutdown if legislation to provide funding for other areas of government is not passed\nby March 22, 2024 as a result of political divisions in Congress and an impasse on budgetary and spending matters. Continued adverse\npolitical and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n44\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nWe recognize the importance of establishing governance and oversight over cybersecurity risks, and we have implemented\nmechanisms, controls, technologies, and processes designed to help us assess, identify, and manage these risks.\nThe landscape of cyber threats is constantly evolving, making it increasingly challenging to effectively defend against them or\nimplement sufficient preventative measures. We have observed a rise in the volume, frequency, and sophistication of cyber-attacks. To\ndate, no risks from cybersecurity threats or previous cybersecurity incidents have materially affected our business strategy, results of\noperations, or financial condition. However, there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures in place to monitor and\nmitigate the risks of cyber threats, including the remediation of critical information security and software vulnerabilities, will be\nsufficient and/or timely and that we will not suffer material losses or consequences in the future. Additionally, while we have in place\ninsurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all insured\nlosses or all types of claims that may arise. For more information regarding the cybersecurity risks that we face, see “Risks Related to\nOur Control Environment – Breaches of our information systems and cyberattacks could compromise our intellectual property and\ncause significant damage to our business and reputation” included as part of our risk factor disclosures in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nWe have adopted and continue to maintain a cybersecurity risk management program that implements various controls, technology,\nand procedures for the evaluation, identification, and handling of significant cybersecurity risks that could impact the confidentiality,\nintegrity, or availability of our information systems.\nOur practices include, among others, providing ongoing security awareness training for our global workforce, conducting ransomware\nand phishing simulations, deploying tools for the detection and analysis of anomalous network activities, and implementing\ncontainment and incident response procedures. We are committed to staying abreast of the latest industry standards, and we actively\nparticipate in industry forums to exchange insights and stay ahead of emerging cybersecurity threats.\nA critical component of our cybersecurity strategy is the integration of a third-party Security Operations Center support, which\nmonitors our global network environment on a 24/7/365 basis, and is designed to rapidly identify and respond to threats. This program\nmonitors both internally detected and externally reported vulnerabilities that could impact our products, which are then evaluated for\ntheir cybersecurity implications according to Company protocols. We also utilize third-party service providers as part of our\ncybersecurity risk management program and maintain a framework for managing cybersecurity risks presented by our third-party\nService Providers. This framework governs the third party’s security management system and mandates that the program (i) adhere to\ncertain information handling and asset management protocols and (ii) promptly notify us of any cybersecurity incidents that impact its\nsystems.\nOur enterprise risk management (\"ERM\") framework is designed to systematically integrate the assessment, identification, and\nhandling of cybersecurity-related risks into our broader risk management strategy. This process involves an annual evaluation of the\nspectrum of risks facing the enterprise, including those related to cybersecurity. When elevated cybersecurity risks are detected,\ndesignated risk owners are tasked with formulating and overseeing the execution of targeted mitigation strategies.\nThis risk management approach informs decision-making processes related to the company's strategic priorities, the allocation of\nresources, and the establishment of oversight mechanisms. The governance of this program resides with our Board of Directors, which\nbears the ultimate responsibility for the oversight of cybersecurity risks. Supporting the Board, the Audit Committee plays a pivotal\nrole by engaging in regular reviews of our cybersecurity efforts in collaboration with management and providing periodic updates to\nthe Board. These assessments are conducted at least quarterly, with additional sessions convened as needed to address emerging issues\nor refine strategies.\nOur Chief Information Officer (\"CIO\")/Chief Information Security Officer (\"CISO\") leads our cybersecurity program and reports to\nour Chief Executive Officer. The CIO/CISO stays informed of prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation efforts through\nregular communication with professionals on our cybersecurity team, many of whom hold certifications such as Security+, Certified\nInformation Systems Security Professional or Certified Information Security Manager. The CIO/CISO also utilizes technological\ntools, software, and third-party audits to monitor our cybersecurity efforts. Our CIO/CISO joined the Company in November 2018 and\nbrings a wealth of experience from leading cybersecurity initiatives in previous roles. Our Chief Technology Officer (\"CTO\") joined\nthe company in January 2023 following the Business Combination and previously served as Adtran Networks' CTO, leading their\nproduct management and advanced technology teams. Our CTO helps oversee our product security programs. Both the CIO/CISO and\nCTO have extensive experience in assessing and managing cybersecurity programs and risks. Our CIO/CISO reports to the Audit\nCommittee and the Board of Directors on our cybersecurity program and efforts. Additionally, we have an escalation process in place\nto inform senior management and the Board of Directors of any material issues.\n45\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur global headquarters and certain administrative, engineering and manufacturing facilities are located on an 82-acre campus in\nCummings Research Park in Huntsville, Alabama. Two office buildings in Huntsville, Alabama serve both our Network Solutions and\nour Services & Support segments. We lease a facility for our European headquarters in Munich, Germany. We lease engineering\nfacilities in the U.S., EMEA and APAC that are used to develop products sold by our Network Solutions segment. In addition, we\nlease office space in North America, Latin America, EMEA and APAC, which provide sales and service support for both of our\nsegments. These cancelable and non-cancelable leases expire at various times through 2033. For more information, see Note 8 of\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nWe also have numerous sales and support staff operating from home-based offices serving both our Network Solutions and our\nServices & Support segments, which are located within the U.S. and abroad.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time we are subject to or otherwise involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and legal proceedings that arise\nout of or are incidental to the conduct of our business (collectively, “Legal Matters”), including those relating to employment matters,\npatent rights, regulatory compliance matters, stockholder claims, and contractual and other commercial disputes. Such Legal Matters,\neven if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Additionally, an unfavorable\noutcome in a Legal Matter could require us to pay damages, entitle claimants to other relief, such as royalties, or could prevent us\nfrom selling some of our products in certain jurisdictions. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of or estimate the possible\nloss or range of loss, if any, associated with these Legal Matters.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\n46\nPART II\nITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER\nPURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \"ADTN\" and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange\nunder the symbol \"QH9\". As of January 22, 2024, we had 47 stockholders of record and approximately 19,709 beneficial owners of\nshares held in street name.\nDividends\nWe declared a quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share of common stock to record holders during each of the quarters through September\n30, 2023. On November 6, 2023, the Board of Directors suspended the Company’s quarterly cash dividend in order to reduce debt and\ninterest expense and support the Company's capital efficiency program. The payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion\nof the Board of Directors and will depend on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and any\nother factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. In addition, the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement currently does not allow for\nthe payment of dividends to shareholders.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We have omitted discussion of the earliest of the three years of financial condition and results\nof operations and this information can be found in Part I, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, Part II, Item 7,\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, included\nin Amendment No. 1 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on August 14,\n2023 (the “2022 Form 10-K/A”), as well as Part I, Item 1, Business, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC\non March 1, 2023., which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov and on our website at\nwww.adtran.com.\nThis discussion is designed to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial\nstatements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, and the primary factors that\naccounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles affect our consolidated financial statements. See\n“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” on page 2 of this report for a description of important factors that could\ncause actual results to differ from expected results. See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K.\nUnless the context otherwise indicates or requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to \"ADTRAN\", the “Company,”\n“we,” “us” and “our” refer to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries for periods subsequent to the Merger and to\nADTRAN, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries for periods prior to the Merger. The prior period results do not include the results of\nAdtran Networks prior to the Business Combination which occurred on July 15, 2022.\nOverview\nThe Company is a leading global provider of networking and communications platforms, software, systems and services focused on\nthe broadband access market, serving a diverse domestic and international customer base in multiple countries that includes Large,\nMedium and Small Service Providers, alternative Service Providers, such as utilities, municipalities and fiber overbuilders;\ncable/MSOs; SMBs; distributed enterprises, including Fortune 500 companies with sophisticated business continuity applications; and\nfederal, state and local government agencies.\nOur innovative solutions and services enable voice, data, video and internet-communications across a variety of network\ninfrastructures and are currently in use by millions worldwide. We support our customers through our direct global sales organization\nand our distribution networks. Our success depends upon our ability to increase unit volume and market share through the introduction\nof new products and succeeding generations of products having optimal selling prices and increased functionality as compared to both\nthe prior generation of a product and the products of competitors in order to gain market share. To service our customers and grow\nrevenue, we are continually conducting research and developing new products addressing customer needs and testing those products\nfor the specific requirements of the particular customers. We offer a broad portfolio of flexible software and hardware network\nsolutions and services that enable Service Providers to meet today’s service demands while enabling them to transition to the fully\nconverged, scalable, highly-automated, cloud-controlled voice, data, internet and video network of the future. In addition to our global\nheadquarters in Huntsville, Alabama, and our European headquarters in Munich, Germany, we have sales and research and\ndevelopment facilities in strategic global locations.\nThe Company solely owns ADTRAN, Inc. and is the majority shareholder of Adtran Networks (formerly ADVA Optical Networking\nSE). ADTRAN is a leading global provider of open, disaggregated networking and communications solutions. Adtran Networks is a\nglobal provider of network solutions for data, storage, voice and video services. We believe that the combined technology portfolio\ncan best address current and future customer needs for high-speed connectivity from the network core to the end consumer, especially\nupon the convergence of solutions at the network edge.\nThe chief operating decision maker regularly reviews the Company’s financial performance based on two reportable segments: (1)\nNetwork Solutions and (2) Services & Support. In addition to operating under two reportable segments, the Company also reports\nrevenue across three categories – Subscriber Solutions, Access & Aggregation Solutions and Optical Networking Solutions.\nPrior to the Business Combination with Adtran Networks on July 15, 2022, ADTRAN, Inc. reported revenue across the following\nthree categories: (1) Access & Aggregation, (2) Subscriber Solutions & Experience and (3) Traditional & Other Products. Following\nthe Business Combination with Adtran Networks, we have recast these revenues such that ADTRAN, Inc's former Access &\nAggregation revenue is combined with a portion of the applicable Adtran Networks solutions to create Access & Aggregation\nSolutions, ADTRAN’s former Subscriber Solutions & Experience revenue is combined with a portion of the applicable Adtran\nNetworks solutions to create Subscriber Solutions and the revenue from Traditional & Other products is now included in the\napplicable Access & Aggregation Solutions or Subscriber Solutions category. Optical Networking Solutions was added as a new\nrevenue category to represent a meaningful portion of Adtran Networks portfolio.\n49\nOur Subscriber Solutions portfolio is used by Service Providers to terminate their access services infrastructure at customers' premises\nwhile providing an immersive and interactive experience for residential, business and wholesale subscribers. This revenue category\nincludes hardware- and software-based products and services. These solutions include our Mosaic One SaaS applications, fiber\ntermination solutions for residential, business and wholesale subscribers, Wi-Fi access solutions for residential and business\nsubscribers, Ethernet switching and network edge virtualization solutions for business subscribers and cloud software solutions\ncovering a mix of subscriber types.\nOur Access & Aggregation Solutions are solutions that are used by communications Service Providers to connect residential\nsubscribers, business subscribers and mobile radio networks to the Service Providers’ metro network, primarily through fiber-based\nconnectivity. This revenue category includes hardware- and software-based products and services. Our solutions within this category\nare a mix of fiber access and aggregation platforms, precision network synchronization and timing solutions and access orchestration\nsolutions that ensure highly reliable and efficient network performance.\nOur Optical Networking Solutions are used by communications Service Providers, internet content providers and large-scale\nenterprises to securely interconnect metro and regional networks over fiber. This revenue category includes hardware- and software-\nbased products and services. Our solutions within this category include open optical terminals, open line systems, optical subsystems\nand modules, network infrastructure assurance systems and automation platforms that are used to build high-scale, secure and assured\noptical networks.\nAdtran Networks Domination and Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement\nThe DPLTA between the Company, as the controlling company, and Adtran Networks, as the controlled company, which was executed\non December 1, 2022, became effective on January 16, 2023, as a result of its registration with the commercial register\n(Handelsregister) of the local court (Amtsgericht) at the registered seat of Adtran Networks (Jena).\nUnder the DPLTA, subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, (i) the Company is\nentitled to issue binding instructions to the management board of Adtran Networks, (ii) Adtran Networks will transfer its annual profit\nto the Company, subject to, among other things, the creation or dissolution of certain reserves, and (iii) the Company will generally\nabsorb the annual net loss incurred by Adtran Networks. The obligation of the Company to absorb Adtran Networks’ annual net loss\napplied for the first time to the loss generated in 2023.\nAdditionally, and subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, the DPLTA provides\nthat Adtran Networks shareholders (other than us) be offered, at their election, (i) to put their Adtran Networks shares to the Company\nin exchange for compensation in cash of €17.21 per share plus guaranteed interest (the \"Exit Compensation\"), or (ii) to remain Adtran\nNetworks shareholders and receive a recurring compensation in cash of €0.59 (€0.52 net under the current tax regime) per share for\neach full fiscal year of Adtran Networks (the “Annual Recurring Compensation”). The guaranteed interest component under the Exit\nCompensation is calculated from the effective date of the DPLTA to the date the shares are tendered, less any Annual Recurring\nCompensation paid. The guaranteed interest rate is 5.0% plus a variable component that was 3.12% as of December 31, 2023. The\nAnnual Recurring Compensation is due on the third banking day following the ordinary general shareholders’ meeting of Adtran\nNetworks for the respective preceding fiscal year (but in any event within eight months following expiration of the fiscal year), and it\nwill be payable for the first time after the ordinary general shareholders’ meeting of Adtran Networks in 2024 for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The adequacy of both forms of compensation has been challenged by minority shareholders of Adtran Networks\nvia court-led appraisal proceedings under German law, and it is possible that the courts in such appraisal proceedings may adjudicate a\nhigher Exit Compensation or Annual Recurring Compensation (in each case, including interest thereon) than agreed upon in the\nDPLTA.\nThe opportunity for outside Adtran Networks shareholders to tender Adtran Networks shares in exchange for Exit Compensation had\nbeen scheduled to expire on March 16, 2023. However, due to the appraisal proceedings that have been initiated in accordance with\napplicable German law, this time period for tendering shares has been extended pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act\n(Aktiengesetz) and will end two months after the date on which a final decision in such appraisal proceedings has been published in the\nFederal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger). For the year ended December 31, 2023, 67 thousand shares, respectively, of Adtran Networks stock\nwere tendered to the Company and Exit Compensation payments of approximately €1.2 million or approximately $1.3 million based\non an exchange rate as of December 31, 2023, were paid to Adtran Networks' shareholders.\nIn addition to our cash and cash equivalents and the credit facility, we may fund a portion or all of the Exit Compensation through the\nsale of securities or additional alternative funding sources, if available. There can be no assurances that we would be successful in\neffecting these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds as needed, it could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our financial results and financial condition.\nWe currently hold 33,957,538 no-par value bearer shares of Adtran Networks, representing 65.32% of Adtran Networks outstanding\nshares as of December 31, 2023.\n50\nThe foregoing description of the DPLTA does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the DPLTA, a\nnon-binding English translation of which is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.5 of the 2022 Form 10-K/A. As of December 31,\n2023, the Company has incurred $26.2 million of transaction costs related to the Business Combination. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, $0.1 million, $14.2 million and $11.9 million of transaction costs were incurred, respectively.\nThese transaction costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Loss.\nMulti -Year Integration Program\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company initiated a multi-year integration program designed to optimize the assets, business\nprocesses, and information technology systems of the Company. The program was designed to address several potential cost\nsynergies, including realizing operational scale, combining sales channels, streamlining corporate and general and administrative\nfunctions, and combined sourcing and production costs.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $21.5 million and $1.6 million of restructuring costs relating to\nthe Business Combination under the multi-year integration program and synergy realization, respectively, that are included in cost of\nrevenue, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the Condensed Consolidated\nStatement of Loss. The Company does not anticipate additional material expenses to be incurred in connection with this integration\nprogram.\nBusiness Efficiency Program\nOn November 6, 2023, due to the uncertainty around the current macroeconomic environment and its impact on customer spending\nlevels, the Company’s management decided to implement a business efficiency program (the “Business Efficiency Program”)\ntargeting the reduction of ongoing operating expenses and focusing on capital efficiency inclusive of certain salary reductions, an early\nretirement program, a site consolidation plan to include lease impairments and the partial sale of owned real estate (including the\npotential sale of portions of our headquarters), inventory write downs from product discontinuances, and the suspension of the\nquarterly dividend. The Business Efficiency Program expands upon other recently implemented restructuring efforts and synergy costs\nfollowing the Business Combination. For instance, on August 17, 2023, the Company’s management determined to discontinue its\ncopper-based Digital Subscriber Line broadband access technology products and its fixed wireless access products in its Network\nSolutions segment. Furthermore, on September 29, 2023, the Company’s management decided to exit the \"IoT\" gateway market\n(indoor and outdoor), a subset of the broader IoT market (together with the other product discontinuations, the “Discontinuations”).\nAdditionally, on October 25, 2023, all employees were informed of certain personnel measures, which included the reduction of salary\nfor select management, a reduction of approximately 5% of the workforce, an early retirement program and a hiring freeze.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized $25.1 million of costs relating to the Business Efficiency Program. We\nexpect costs in the first quarter 2024 and thereafter relating to the Business Efficiency Program to range between $22.2 million and\n$35.2 million. Management expects these planned costs to include severance costs ranging from $12.2 million to $18.9 million in\nconnection with an early retirement program and reductions in workforce, inventory write down of product discontinuances ranging\nfrom $7.6 million to $10.3 million, and site consolidation transaction expenses (primarily brokers fees) ranging from $2.4 million to\n$6.0 million. Future cash payments include: severance costs and outplacement fees that are anticipated to be in the range of $12.2\nmillion to $18.9 million, payments relating to the site consolidation transaction expenses that are anticipated to be in the range of $2.4\nmillion to $6.0 million, and potential cash payments in the range of $3.6 million to $6.3 million for anticipated product\ndiscontinuances. We may also incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a\nresult of, or associated with, the Business Efficiency Program, including potential impairment charges related to the discontinuance of\nadditional product lines, regulatory requirements related to personnel measures, and site closures. However, we are not able to\nestimate the amount or range of amounts of such potential incremental charges as of the date of this filing. If required, we will amend\nthis disclosure at such time as management is able in good faith to estimate the amount, or range of amounts, of these charges.\nThe Business Efficiency Program is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2024, with expected cash payments\ncontinuing into 2025.\nSee Note 23 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nFinancial Performance and Trends\nWe ended 2023 with a year-over-year revenue increase of 12.0%, driven by an increase in volume of sales activity during the first half\nof 2023 due to the Business Combination with Adtran Networks partially offset by decreased volume of sales activity in our domestic\nADTRAN, Inc. operations due to customers' focus on reducing inventory levels and customers readjusting their capital expenditure\nbudgets due to the uncertain macroeconomic environment related to continued elevated interest rates and ongoing inflationary\npressures. During 2023, we had one customer with revenues greater than 10.0% which was an international Service Provider customer\nand our five largest customers comprised 37.0% of our revenue. Our year-over-year domestic revenue decreased by 10.9%, driven by\nlower volume of sales of our residential solutions products as a result of customers focus on reducing inventory levels in our\nSubscriber\n51\n\nSolutions segment, partially offset by an increase in volume of sales activity in the first half of 2023 as a result of the Business\nCombination with Adtran Networks. Internationally, our year-over-year revenue increased by 35.4%, primarily driven by an increase\nin volume of sales activity in the first half of 2023 as a result of the Business Combination with Adtran Networks partially offset by\nthe unfavorable impact on revenue as a result of the strengthened U.S. dollar and decreased shipments to two large network operators\nand one alternative network operator in Europe.\nRevenues in 2023 were impacted by normalization subsequent to the supply chain disruptions we saw during the pandemic. This\nnormalization has led to a reduction in lead times as customer concerns over inventory stocking levels affected the Subscriber\nSolutions category due to over-supply situation of CPE products which the Company expects to continue into the first half of 2024. In\nthe second half of 2023, our Access & Aggregation and Optical Networking revenue categories experienced a general slowdown in\nrevenue as a result of reduced spending by our medium and large Service Provider customers as they continue to reduce inventory\nlevels and monitor uncertain macroeconomic conditions related to continued elevated interest rates and ongoing inflationary pressures.\nDespite these challenges, we have maintained our emphasis on product development to enable us to respond to rapidly changing\ntechnology and evolving industry standards. For example, we expect public funding through projects such as IPCEI ME/CT to further\nour research and development for new communication technologies. Additionally, public funding through the Broadband Equity,\nAccess and Deployment Program is expected to commence in late 2024 through 2026, which provides a positive outlook for the\nfuture. In Europe, we continue to see increased activity from high-risk vendor replacement and broadband subsidy programs.\nOur operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to several factors, including customer\norder activity, supply chain constraints, component availability, and the Company's consolidation and integration with Adtran\nNetworks. Further, a significant percentage of orders require delivery within a few days requiring us to maintain higher inventory\nlevels. These factors may result in limited order flow visibility. For example, although, expedite fees and lead times for semiconductor\nchips and other key components began to ease during 2023 following shortages in the industry, we continued to be negatively\nimpacted by price increases, which could continue to have a material adverse effect on customer relations and our financial condition.\nWe have taken decisive steps to transform our business into a leaner, more efficient and more profitable company, including through\nthe implementation of a Business Efficiency Program, which includes a significant cost efficiency program targeting a reduction of\nongoing operating expenses and a capital efficiency program inclusive of certain salary reductions, an early retirement program, a site\nconsolidation plan to include lease impairments and the partial sale of owned real estate (including the potential sale of portions of our\nheadquarters), inventory write downs from product discontinuances, and the suspension of the quarterly dividend. Nevertheless, our\noperating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term; therefore, a shortfall in quarterly revenues has and may again in the future\nsignificantly impact our financial results in a given quarter.\nOur operating results have significantly fluctuated and may do so in the future as a result of a number of other factors, including a\ndecline in general economic and market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate movements, inflation, regional conflicts, increased\ncompetition, customer order patterns, changes in product and services mix, timing differences between price decreases and product\ncost reductions, product warranty returns, expediting costs, tariffs and announcements of new products by us or our competitors. In\nrecent years, inflationary pressures on input costs, such as raw materials and labor, and distribution costs had a negative impact on our\noperating results. However, inflationary pressures on our supply chain have eased somewhat, which has led to reductions in cost\npremiums on raw material costs and freight. We continue to support our customer demand for our products by working with our\nsuppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, and customers to address and to limit the disruption to our operations and order\nfulfillment. Additionally, maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of\ninventory that may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of this inventory may have an additional adverse\neffect on our business and operating results beyond the effects of the most recent inventory write-downs. Also, not maintaining\nsufficient inventory levels to ensure prompt delivery of our products may cause us to incur expediting costs to meet customer delivery\nrequirements, which may negatively impact our operating results.\nWe are exposed to changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the\nforeign-exchanges rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars\nfor financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the\ncurrent period’s currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange\nrate movements are with the Euro and the British pound sterling. As a result of our global operations, our revenue, gross margins,\noperating expense and operating loss in some international markets have been and may continue to be affected by foreign currency\nfluctuations.\nThe Company’s policy is to assess the realizability of assets (long-lived assets, intangibles and goodwill) held within our reporting\nunits and to evaluate such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of\nsuch assets may not be recoverable. For impairment testing purposes, we determined the Company's reporting units are generally the\nsame as its operating segments, which are identified in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the third quarter of\n2023, the Company's market capitalization and long-term projections decreased which triggered a reassessment of our estimated future\nundiscounted cash flows within our two identified reporting units. The Company determined the fair value of each reporting unit using\na combination of an income approach and a market-based peer group analysis. It was determined that the decreases in projected future\n52\ncash flows, discount rates, overall macroeconomic conditions, as well as the decrease in our market capitalization applied in the\nvaluation, were required to align with market-based assumptions and company-specific risk, which resulted in lower fair values of the\nServices & Support reporting unit. Upon the conclusion of its quantitative impairment assessment, the Company recognized a $37.9\nmillion non-cash goodwill impairment charge for the Services & Support reporting unit. The Company did not recognize any\nimpairment charges for the Network Solutions reporting unit during the third quarter of 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the\nCompany qualitatively assessed the carrying value of each reporting unit for events or circumstance changes that would more likely\nthan not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company\ncompleted its annual impairment test of the carrying value of reporting unit assets. Based on our assessment of certain qualitative\nfactors such as macro-economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and overall financial performance,\nmanagement concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit was more likely than not greater than its carrying amount as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nOur historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results, and in general, management expects\nthat our financial results may vary from period to period. For a discussion of risks associated with our operating results, see Part I,\nItem 1A, Risk Factors of this report.\n53\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents selected financial information derived from our Consolidated Statements of Loss expressed as a\npercentage of revenue for the years indicated.

The emphasis of the discussion is a comparison of the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. For a discussion of a comparison of the years ended December 31, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on August 14, 2023.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\nRevenue\nOur revenue increased 12.0% from $1,025.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $1,149.1 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The increase in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 is primarily attributable to a $379.0 million\nincrease in volume of sales activity during the first half of 2023 due to the Business Combination with Adtran Networks partially\noffset by a $255.4 million decrease in volume of sales activity due to customers’ focus on reducing inventory levels in our domestic\nADTRAN, Inc. operations and customers readjusting their capital expenditure budgets due to the uncertain macroeconomic\nenvironment. The increase in revenue by category for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to a $231.9\nmillion increase in Optical Networking Solutions category due to the Business Combination with Adtran Networks partially offset by\na $92.7 million decrease in Subscriber Solutions products and a $15.6 million decrease in Access & Aggregation Solutions. Ongoing\ncustomer concerns over inventory stocking levels have affected our revenue in the Subscriber Solutions category. We believe that this\nover-supply of CPE products will continue into the first half of 2024.\nNetwork Solutions segment revenue increased 6.3% from $916.8 million in 2022 to $974.3 million in 2023, primarily due to an\nincrease of $326.8 million in volume of sales activity during the first half of 2023 due to the Business Combination with Adtran\nNetworks partially offset by a decrease of $159.7 million in Subscriber Solutions products, a decrease of $43.3 million in Access &\nAggregation Solutions and a decrease of $66.3 million in Optical Networking Solutions product. More specifically, for the year ended\nDecember 31,\n54\n\n2023, the decrease in revenue for our Subscriber Solutions products was primarily due to lower volume of sales of our residential\nsolutions products as a result of customers focus on reducing inventory levels.\nServices & Support revenue increased 60.7% from $108.7 million in 2022 to $174.7 million in 2023. The increase in revenue for 2023\nwas primarily attributable to the increase of $52.2 million in volume of sales activity during the first half of 2023 from the Business\nCombination with Adtran Networks, a $7.4 million increase in revenue for Optical Networking Solutions products, a $4.8 million\nincrease in revenue for Access & Aggregation Solutions revenue and a $1.6 million increase in revenue for Subscriber Solutions\nservices. More specifically, the increase in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 of our ADTRAN, Inc. operations was\nprimarily due to higher volume of sales of our software services and business solutions services.\nDomestic revenue decreased 10.9% from $517.4 million in 2022 to $461.0 million in 2023, driven by lower volume of sales of our\nresidential solutions products as a result of customers' focus on reducing inventory levels in our Subscriber Solutions segment,\npartially offset by an increase in volume of sales activity during the first half of 2023 from the Business Combination with Adtran\nNetworks.\nInternational revenue, which is defined as revenue generated from the Network Solutions and Services & Support segments provided\nto a customer outside of the U.S., increased 35.4% from $508.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $688.1 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023. International revenue, as a percentage of total revenue, increased from 49.5% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 to 59.8% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in international revenue for 2023 was primarily\nattributable to an increase in volume of sales activity during the first half of 2023 as a result of the Business Combination with Adtran\nNetworks and increased shipments partially offset by the unfavorable impact on revenue generated outside of the U.S. as a result of\nthe strengthened U.S. dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, changes in\nforeign currencies relative to the U.S dollar increased our net revenue by approximately $9.0 million.\nOur ADTRAN, Inc. international revenue is largely focused on broadband infrastructure and is consequently affected by the decisions\nof our customers as to timing for installation of new technologies, expansion of their networks and/or network upgrades. Our\ninternational customers must make these decisions in the regulatory and political environment in which they operate – both nationally\nand in some instances, regionally – whether of a multi-country region or a more local region within a country. Consequently, while we\nexpect the global trend towards deployment of more robust broadband speeds and access to continue creating additional market\nopportunities for us, the factors described above may result in pressure on revenue and operating income. Our Adtran Networks\ninternational revenue is largely focused on the manufacture and selling of networking solutions that are based on three core areas of\nexpertise: fiber-optic transmission technology (cloud interconnect), cloud access technology for rapid creation of innovative services\naround the network edge and solutions for precise timing and synchronization of networks. In addition, Adtran Networks' international\noperations offers a comprehensive portfolio of network design, implementation and maintenance services to assist operators in the\ndeployment of market-leading networks while reducing their cost to maintain these networks.\nCost of Revenue\nAs a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue increased from 68.1% for the year ended December 31, 2022 to 71.0% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to $89.6 million of adjustments consisting of intangible amortization of\nbacklog, developed technology and fair value adjustments to inventory costs that flow through to cost of revenue as a result of the\nBusiness Combination with Adtran Networks, acquisition related expenses, a $24.3 million write down of inventory due to a\nrestructuring discontinuation of certain product lines within our Network Solutions segment, and to a lesser extent changes in\ncustomer and product mix and a regional revenue shift in our ADTRAN, Inc. operations partially offset by supply chain cost\nimprovements. As the inventory that was acquired in the Business Combination with Adtran Networks is sold, our cost of revenue as a\npercentage of revenue will return to more normalized levels. For the year ended December 31, 2023, changes in foreign currencies\nrelative to the U.S. dollar increased our cost of revenue by approximately $1.5 million.\nNetwork Solutions cost of revenue, as a percentage of that segment’s revenue, increased from 70.6% of revenue in 2022 to 76.7% of\nrevenue in 2023. The increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to acquisition related expenses,\namortizations and adjustments consisting of intangible amortization of backlog, developed technology and fair value adjustments to\ninventory costs that flow through to cost of revenue as a result of the Business Combination with Adtran Networks, a write down of\ninventory due to a restructuring discontinuation of certain product lines and to a lesser extent changes in customer and product mix\nand a regional revenue shift in our ADTRAN, Inc. operations partially offset by supply chain cost improvements.\nServices & Support cost of revenue, as a percentage of that segment’s revenue, decreased from 47.1% of revenue in 2022 to 39.6% of\nrevenue in 2023. The decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to customer mix and changes in\nServices & Support mix as a result of the Business Combination with Adtran Networks.\nServices & Support revenue is comprised of network planning and implementation, maintenance, support and cloud-based\nmanagement services, with network planning and implementation being the largest and fastest growing component in the long-term.\nCompared to our other services, such as maintenance, support and cloud-based management services, our network planning and\nimplementation services typically utilize a higher percentage of internal and subcontracted engineers, professionals and contractors to\nperform the work\n55\n\nfor customers. The additional costs incurred to perform these infrastructure and labor-intensive services inherently result in lower\naverage gross margins as compared to maintenance and support services. Within the Services & Support segment, we do expect\nvariability in gross margins from quarter-to-quarter based on the mix of the services recognized.\nGross Profit\nAs a percentage of revenue, gross profit decreased from 31.9% for the year ended December 31, 2022 to 29.0% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to $89.6 million of adjustments consisting of intangible amortization of\nbacklog, developed technology and fair value adjustments to inventory costs that flow through to cost of revenue as a result of the\nBusiness Combination with Adtran Networks, acquisition related expenses, a decrease in volume of sales activity due to customers'\nfocus on reducing inventory levels in our domestic ADTRAN, Inc. operations, a decrease due to the unfavorable impact on revenue\ngenerated outside of the U.S. as a result of the strengthened U.S. dollar and a write down of inventory due to a restructuring\ndiscontinuation of certain product lines.\nAs a percentage of that segment's revenue, Network Solutions gross profit decreased from 29.4% for the year ended December 31,\n2022 to 23.3% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to increases in cost of revenue related\nto acquisition related expenses, adjustments consisting of intangible amortization of backlog, developed technology and fair value\nadjustments to inventory costs that flow through to cost of revenue as a result of the Business Combination with Adtran Networks and\na decrease in volume of sales activity related to our ADTRAN, Inc. operations, a decrease in volume of sales activity due to customers'\nfocus on reducing inventory levels in our domestic ADTRAN, Inc. operations and a write down of inventory due to a restructuring\ndiscontinuation of certain product lines partially offset by an increase in volume of sales activity in the first half of 2023 due to the\nBusiness Combination with Adtran Networks.\nAs a percentage of that segment's revenue, Services & Support gross profit increased from 52.9% for the year ended December 31,\n2022 to 60.4% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in volume of sales\nactivity in the first half of 2023 due to the Business Combination with Adtran Networks and a decrease in cost of revenue as a\npercentage of revenue attributable to customer mix and changes in Services & Support mix as a result of the Business Combination\nwith Adtran Networks.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 20.4% for the year ended December 31, 2022,\nto 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2023. While selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will\ngenerally fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenue for the periods being compared, in the year ended December\n31, 2023 we saw a more significant increase due to higher expenses related to the Business Combination with Adtran Networks and\nother items described below. Our restructuring, business efficiency and integration programs are in the process of consolidating,\nstreamlining and integrating the workforce, systems and processes of ADTRAN and Adtran Networks, which we expect will lower\nselling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue over time.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by 23.6% from $208.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, to\n$258.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for\nmanagement, accounting, information technology, human resources, sales and marketing, as well as independent auditor, tax and other\nprofessional fees, contract services and legal and litigation related costs. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses\nwas primarily attributable to increased expenses in the first half of 2023 related to the Business Combination with Adtran Networks\nsuch as employee-related costs due to an increase in the number of employees, costs related to our restructuring program, amortization\nof intangible assets, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, restructuring expenses and transactions costs partially offset by\ndecreased stock-based compensation expense. For the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31,\n2022, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S dollar increased our selling, general and administrative expenses by\napproximately $1.3 million.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 16.9% for the year ended December 31, 2022, to\n22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Although, research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate\nwhenever there are incremental product development activities or significant fluctuations in revenue for the periods being compared,\nin the first half of 2023, we saw a more significant increase in expenses related to the Business Combination with Adtran Networks\nand other items described below. Our restructuring, business efficiency and integration programs are in the process of consolidating,\nstreamlining and integrating the workforce, systems and processes of ADTRAN and Adtran Networks, which we expect will lower\nresearch and development expense as a percentage of revenue over time.\nResearch and development expenses increased by $84.5 million or 48.7% from $173.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022,\nto $258.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily\nattributable to increased expenses in the first half of 2023 related to the Business Combination with Adtran Networks such as\nemployee-related costs due to an increase in the number of employees of $70.5 million, depreciation of property, plant and equipment\nof $6.3 million and\n56\n\nrestructuring expenses of $6.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022,\nchanges in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased our research and development expenses by approximately $0.1\nmillion.\nAdtran Networks has arrangements with governmental entities for the purposes of obtaining funding for research and development\nactivities. The Company classifies government grants received under these arrangements as a reduction to research and development\nexpense incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $5.2 million and $1.1 million,\nrespectively, as a reduction of research and development expense.\nWe expect to continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with our new and existing products. We continually\nevaluate new product opportunities and engage in significant research and product development efforts, which provides for new\nproduct development, enhancement of existing products and product cost reductions. We may incur significant research and\ndevelopment expenses prior to the receipt of revenue from a major new product group.\nAsset Impairments\nIn connection with the planned integration of information technology following the Business Combination, we determined that certain\nprojects no longer fit our needs. As a result, the Company recognized impairment charges of $17.4 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, primarily attributable to capitalized implementation costs for a cloud computing arrangement. There were no\nasset impairments recognized during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2021. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nGoodwill Impairment\nThe Company recognized impairment charges of $37.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily attributable to\nlower fair values of the Services & Support reporting unit driven by decreases in projected future cash flows, discount rates, overall\nmacroeconomic conditions, as well as the decrease in our market capitalization. There were no goodwill impairments recognized\nduring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in\nPart II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nInterest and Dividend Income\nInterest and dividend income increased by 10.2% from $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $2.3 million for the year\nended December 31, 2023. Interest and dividend income was up due to increased income in the first half of 2023 as a result of the\nBusiness Combination with Adtran Networks and increased dividend income from the deferred compensation plan during the year\nended December 31, 2023. Our investments decreased from $33.0 million as of December 31, 2022 to $27.7 million as of December\n31, 2023 and was primarily attributable to the sale of certain equity and fixed income investments for working capital and other\npurposes.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased from $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $16.3 million for the year ended December 31,\n2023. The increase in interest expense was primarily related to increased borrowings under the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement and the\nassumed debt associated with the Business Combination with Adtran Networks. See Note 12 and Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report and “Financing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources”\nbelow.\nNet Investment Gain (Loss)\nWe recognized a net investment loss of $11.3 million and a gain of $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023,\nrespectively. The fluctuations in our net investments were primarily attributable to market driven changes in the fair value of our\nsecurities recognized during the period. We expect that any future market volatility could result in continued fluctuations in our\ninvestment portfolio. See “Investing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” of this report and Note 1 and Note 5 of Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net, decreased from income of $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to income of $1.3 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, other income, net, is comprised primarily of gains\nand losses on foreign currency transactions and income from excess material sales. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Part II, Item 8 of the report for additional information on foreign exchange contracts.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit\nOur effective tax rate changed from a benefit of 87.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 to an expense of 12.2% for the year\nended December 31, 2023. The change in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023, was driven primarily by the\nestablishment of our valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of 2023, along with an\nincrease in the global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") inclusion amount derived from the income of our controlled foreign\ncompanies. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional\ninformation.\n57\n\nNet Loss Attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc.\nAs a result of the above factors, our net loss attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. increased from $2.0 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 to a net loss of $267.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. As a percentage of revenue, net loss was\n0.2% for the year ended December 31, 2022 and net loss was 23.3% for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nWe have historically financed our ongoing business with existing cash, investments and cash flow from operations. We had a net\noperating cash outflow in 2023. We have used, and expect to continue to use, existing cash, investments, credit arrangements and cash\ngenerated from operations for working capital, business acquisitions, shareholder dividends and other general corporate purposes,\nincluding product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop new products, expand our sales and marketing\nactivities and fund capital expenditures. In addition, we have increasingly relied upon our credit arrangements to manage our working\ncapital needs.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our cash on hand was $87.2 million of which $73.0 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. The\nCompany had access to $202.7 million on its Credit Facility for future borrowings; however, as of December 31, 2023, the Company\nwas limited to additional borrowings of $38.8 million based on debt covenant compliance metrics. Generally, we intend to\npermanently reinvest funds held outside the U.S., except to the extent that any of these funds can be repatriated without withholding\ntax. As of December 31, 2022, our cash on hand was $108.6 million and our short-term investments were $0.3 million, which resulted\nin available short-term liquidity of $108.9 million, of which $86.3 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries.\nPursuant to the terms of the DPLTA, each Adtran Networks shareholder (other than the Company) has received an offer to elect either\n(1) to remain an Adtran Networks shareholder and receive from us an Annual Recurring Compensation payment, or (2) to receive Exit\nCompensation plus guaranteed interest. The guaranteed interest under the Exit Compensation is calculated from the effective date of\nthe DPLTA to the date the shares are tendered, less any Annual Recurring Compensation paid. The guaranteed interest rate is 5.0%\nplus a variable component (according to the German Civil Code) that was 3.12% as of December 31, 2023. Assuming all the minority\nholders of currently outstanding Adtran Networks shares were to elect the second option, we would be obligated to make aggregate\nExit Compensation payments, including guaranteed interest, of approximately €310.3 million or approximately $342.5 million, based\non an exchange rate as of December 31, 2023 and reflecting interest accrued through December 31, 2023 during the pendency of the\nappraisal proceedings discussed below. Shareholders electing the first option of Annual Recurring Compensation may later elect the\nsecond option. The opportunity for outside Adtran Networks shareholders to tender Adtran Networks shares in exchange for Exit\nCompensation had been scheduled to expire on March 16, 2023. However, due to the appraisal proceedings that have been initiated in\naccordance with applicable German law, this time period for tendering shares has been extended pursuant to the German Stock\nCorporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and will end two months after the date on which a final decision in such appraisal proceedings has\nbeen published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger).\nWe are also obligated to absorb any annual net loss of Adtran Networks under the DPLTA. Additionally, our obligation to pay Annual\nRecurring Compensation under the DPLTA is a continuing payment obligation, which will amount to approximately €10.6 million or\n$11.7 million (based on the current exchange rate) per year assuming none of the minority Adtran Networks shareholders were to elect\nExit Compensation. The foregoing amounts do not reflect any potential increase in payment obligations that we may have depending\non the outcome of ongoing appraisal proceedings in Germany. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we accrued $11.5 million in\nAnnual Recurring Compensation, which was reflected as an increase to retained deficit and shown as an other current liability in our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. With respect to the year ended December 31, 2023, we will be obligated to pay $11.5 million in Annual\nRecurring Compensation on the third banking day following the 2024 ordinary general shareholders’ meeting of Adtran Networks (but\nin any event within eight months following December 31, 2023).\nOn July 18, 2022, ADTRAN, Inc., as the borrower, and ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of\nbanks, including Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (“Administrative Agent”), and the other lenders\nnamed therein (the “Credit Agreement”), which has since been amended three times. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, as\namended, the Company, ADTRAN, Inc., and the subsidiary guarantors (together, the “Credit Parties”) are subject to a liquidity\ncovenant, which provides that, during the fourth quarter of 2023 through and including the third quarter of 2024 (the \"Covenant Relief\nPeriod\") or a Springing Covenant Period, (i.e., the period beginning upon the purchase by the Company of at least 60% of the\noutstanding shares of Adtran Networks not owned by the Company as of August 9, 2023 and the three consecutive quarterly test\nperiods after such date), as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, the cash and cash equivalents of the Credit Parties must be at least\n$50.0 million and the cash and cash equivalents of the Company and its subsidiaries must be at least $75.0 million, limiting our ability\nto pay the obligations under the DPLTA. See below, as well as Note 12 and Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Part II, Item, 8 for additional information regarding the terms of each amendment to the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement.\n58\nAs of December 31, 2023, and as of the date of issuance of these financial statements, the Company does not have sufficient liquidity\nto meet the substantial majority of its payment obligations under the DPLTA pertaining to Exit Compensation. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 67 thousand shares of Adtran Networks stock were tendered to the Company and Exit Compensation payments of\napproximately €1.2 million or approximately $1.3 million based on an exchange rate of December 31, 2023, were paid to Adtran\nNetworks shareholders. We believe the probability that more than a small minority of Adtran Networks shareholders elect to receive\nExit Compensation in the next twelve months is remote based on the diverse base of shareholders that must make this election on an\nindividual shareholder basis, the current ongoing appraisal proceedings involving a dispute on the value of the Exit Compensation\nwhich is expected to take 24-32 months to resolve, the current guaranteed Annual Recurring Compensation payment plus the interest\nearned on such shares during the ongoing appraisal proceedings, and the current trading value of Adtran Networks shares.\nThe Company experienced revenue declines in 2023. To the extent that the Company is further impacted by the uncertain\nmacroeconomic environment related to continued elevated interest rates and ongoing inflationary pressures, the Company has\nestablished plans to preserve cash liquidity and maintain compliance with the Company’s covenants. The Company has suspended\ndividend payments and is continuing to implement a Business Efficiency Program, which includes, but is not limited to, planned\nreductions in operating expenses and a site consolidation plan. In connection with the site consolidation plan, the Company is also\nexploring a potential sale of portions of our headquarters in Huntsville. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful\nin effecting this action on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We may need to further reduce capital expenditures and/or take\nother steps to preserve working capital in order to ensure that we can meet our needs and obligations and maintain compliance with\nour debt covenants.\nIn summary, the Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents, investments, working capital management initiatives and\navailability to access cash under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility (described below), including (i) the additional funding provided for\nunder the First Amendment to the Wells Fargo Credit Facility that was signed on August 9, 2023, (ii) the additional covenant\nheadroom during the Covenant Relief Period provided for under the Second Amendment to Wells Fargo Credit Facility, and (iii) the\nexclusion of the Factoring Agreement as debt for purposes of the Credit Facility’s financial covenants as provided for under the Third\nAmendment to Wells Fargo Credit Facility (each as described below), will be adequate to meet our business operating requirements,\nour capital expenditures and our expected obligations under the DPLTA, including anticipated levels of Exit Compensation and\ncontinue to comply with our debt covenants under the Second Amendment for at least the next twelve months, from the issuance of\nthese financial statements. See below, as well as Note 12 and Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part\nII, Item 8 for additional information regarding the terms of the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement and its amendments.\nWells Fargo Credit Facility\nOn July 18, 2022, ADTRAN, Inc., as the borrower, and ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. entered into the Credit Agreement with a syndicate\nof banks, including Administrative Agent, and the other lenders named therein (the “Credit Agreement”). As of the date of this filing,\nthe Credit Agreement allows for revolving credit borrowings of up to $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount, as well as the\n$50.0 million delayed draw term loan facility described below.\nOn August 9, 2023, (the \"First Amendment Effective Date\") the Company, its wholly-owned direct subsidiary, ADTRAN, Inc. and the\nAdministrative Agent entered into a First Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “First Amendment” and together with the Credit\nAgreement, the \"Credit Facility\").\nThe First Amendment, provided for, among other things, a new $50.0 million delayed draw term loan (“DDTL”), which (subject to\ncertain conditions) is available for borrowing in the event of the purchase by the Company of at least sixty percent (60.0%) of the\noutstanding shares of Adtran Networks SE that were not owned by the Company and its subsidiaries as of the First Amendment\nEffective Date (such event, a “Springing Covenant Event”). Proceeds of the DDTL may only be used to repurchase minority shares of\nAdtran Networks SE. The DDTL remains available for borrowing from the occurrence of a Springing Covenant Event through August\n9, 2024.\nThe First Amendment further added additional financial flexibility by permitting, subject to certain requirements, the incurrence of\nconvertible indebtedness by the Company in an aggregate principal amount of up to $172.5 million. Any such convertible\nindebtedness must, among other things, be incurred in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants in the Credit Agreement, be\nunsecured, and otherwise rank junior to borrowings under the Credit Agreement, and have a stated maturity date of at least 91 days\nafter the latest scheduled maturity date of loans and commitments under the Credit Agreement. Net cash proceeds from any incurrence\nof convertible indebtedness must be used to repurchase minority shares of Adtran Networks or repay revolver borrowings under the\nCredit Agreement.\nOn January 16, 2024, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement and First Amendment to the Collateral\nAgreement. The Second Amendment, among other things, provided the Company and its subsidiaries with additional covenant\nheadroom for the fourth quarter of 2023 through the third quarter of 2024 (the \"Covenant Relief Period\") and added certain other\nfinancial covenants which are described below.\n59\nOn March 12, 2024, the Company entered into a Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment, among other\nthings, amends the definition of “Consolidated Funded Indebtedness” (which is used in the calculation of the Consolidated Total Net\nLeverage Ratio and the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio) to exclude obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries\nunder certain factoring arrangements when calculated for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024. The Company\nis also currently in negotiations with the Administrative Agent regarding a potential further amendment to the Credit Agreement to\naddress the addition of certain foreign subsidiary guarantors.\nAs of December 31, 2023, ADTRAN, Inc.’s borrowings under the revolving line of credit were $195.0 million. As of December 31,\n2023, there were no borrowings under the DDTL. The Credit Facility matures in July 2027; however, the Company has an option to\nrequest extensions subject to customary conditions. In addition, we may issue up to $50.0 million in letters of credit against our $400.0\nmillion total facility. As of December 31, 2023, we had a total of $2.3 million in letters of credit under ADTRAN, Inc. outstanding\nagainst our eligible borrowings, leaving a net amount of $202.7 million available for future borrowings. Any future credit extensions\nunder the Credit Agreement are subject to customary conditions precedent. The proceeds of any loans are expected to be used for\ngeneral corporate purposes and to pay a portion of the Exchange Offer consideration. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was in\ncompliance with all material covenants.\nRevolving Line of Credit Interest Rate\nAll U.S. dollar borrowings under the revolving line of credit (other than swingline loans, which bear interest at the Base Rate (as\ndefined below plus the applicable margin) bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a rate per annum equal to either (A) the Base Rate\nplus an applicable margin ranging from 0.65% to 1.65% per annum based on the Company’s Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio\n(or, during the Covenant Relief Period, an applicable margin of 2.15% per annum), or (B) Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined below)\nplus an applicable margin ranging from 1.65% to 2.65% per annum based on the Company’s Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio\n(or, during the Covenant Relief Period, an applicable margin of 3.15% per annum).\n“Base Rate” means the highest of (a) the federal funds rate (i.e., for any day, the rate per annum equal to the weighted average of the\nrates on overnight federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank\nof New York on the business day next succeeding such day) plus ½ of 1.0%, (b) the prime commercial lending rate of the\nAdministrative Agent, as established from time to time at its principal U.S. office (which such rate is an index or base rate and will not\nnecessarily be its lowest or best rate charged to its customers or other banks), and (c) the daily Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the\nCredit Agreement) for a one-month tenor plus 1.0%.

required to pay a quarterly\ncommitment fee to the lenders under the Credit Agreement in respect of unutilized revolving loan commitments on the average daily\nunused portion of the revolving credit commitment of each lender, which commitment fee ranges from 0.20% to 0.25% per annum\nbased on the Company’s Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio (or, during the Covenant Relief Period, is equal to

at the then applicable rate for Adjusted Term SOFR Loans or EURIBOR Loans, and other\ncustomary fronting, issuance and administration fees with respect to letters of credit.\nThe increases in the commitment fee and margin rates during the Covenant Relief Period (referenced above) continue until the first\ndate when each of the following conditions have been met (the period during which such increases are in place is hereinafter referred\nto as the (“Applicable Margin Interest Period”): (a) the Covenant Relief Period has ended, (b) since the Second Amendment effective\ndate, the Company

Relief Period, an applicable margin of 3.40% per annum).\nIn addition, (x) if on or prior to December 31, 2024 we have not reduced the aggregate revolving credit commitment to $340.0 million\nor less, the applicable margin for all loans shall be increased by 1.00% per annum, and (y) if on or prior to June 30, 2025 we have not\nreduced the aggregate revolving credit commitment to $300.0 million or

required to add certain\nadditional domestic and international subsidiaries as guarantors under the Credit Agreement (such existing and new guarantors,\ncollectively, the “Guarantors”). In addition to the guarantees provided by the Guarantors, the Guarantors have granted (or will grant)\nsecurity interests in favor of the Administrative Agent over substantially all tangible and intangible assets, and the Borrower will grant\nmortgages in favor of the Administrative Agent over certain owned real estate assets. The Company is currently in negotiations with\nthe Administrative Agent regarding a potential further amendment to the Credit Agreement to address the addition of certain foreign\nsubsidiary guarantors.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for revolving borrowings of up to $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount, as well as an\nadditional $50.0 million delayed draw term loan tranche that would be available upon a Springing Covenant Event. It also continues to\npermit the Company to prepay any or all of the outstanding loans or to reduce the commitments under the Credit Agreement subject to\ncertain limitations and minimum payment thresholds.\nDuring the Covenant Relief Period, the Company is not permitted to make certain dividend payments to the Company's Stockholders\nor certain other Restricted Payments. However, the Company is permitted to make the Recurring Compensation Payment to each\nAdtran Networks shareholder (other than the Company), pursuant to the terms of the DPLTA. See Note 20 for additional information.\nFurthermore, the Credit Agreement, as amended, contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including incurrence\ncovenants and certain other limitations on the ability of the Company and the Company’s subsidiaries to incur additional debt,\nguarantee other obligations, grant liens on assets, make investments, dispose of assets, make restricted payments, engage in mergers or\nconsolidations, engage in transactions with affiliates, modify its organizational documents, and enter into certain restrictive\nagreements. The negative covenants are subject to various exceptions and carveouts; however, certain of the exceptions and carveouts\nare not permitted to be used during the Covenant Relief Period. It also contains customary events of default, such as misrepresentation\nand a default in the performance or observance of any covenant (subject to customary cure periods and materiality thresholds). Upon\nthe occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the Administrative Agent is entitled to take various actions, including\nthe acceleration of all amounts due under the Credit Agreement.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities of $45.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by $1.4 million compared to\n$44.2 million of net cash used in during the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase in net cash used was primarily due to the net\nloss for the period and net cash outflows from working capital, specifically, a decrease in the average number of days payable to our\ntrade suppliers.\nNet accounts receivable decreased 22.5% from $279.4 million as of December 31, 2022 to $216.4 million as of December 31, 2023.\nThere was an allowance for credit losses of $0.4 million and less than $0.1 as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively. The decrease in net accounts receivable was due primarily to sales volume and timing of sales. Quarterly accounts\nreceivable DSO increased from 72 days as of December 31, 2022 to 88 days as of December 31, 2023. The increase in DSO was\nprimarily driven by customer and geographical mix of commercial terms and the international expansion associated with the Business\nCombination with Adtran Networks and timing of sales within the quarter.\nOther receivables decreased 46.8% from $32.8 million as of December 31, 2022 to $17.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The\ndecrease in other receivables was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales of raw materials to our contract manufacturers.\nAnnual inventory turnover decreased from 2.46 turns as of December 31, 2022 to 2.07 turns as of December 31, 2023. Inventory\ndecreased 15.3% from $427.5 million as of December 31, 2022 to $362.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in inventory\nwas primarily due to a $24.3 million write down of inventory due to discontinuation of certain product lines within our Network\nSolutions segment and a reduction in component purchases due to improved lead times and utilization of buffer stock. We expect\ninventory levels to fluctuate as we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory for customer demand and improve working capital.\nAccounts payable decreased 31.5% from $237.7 million as of December 31, 2022 to $162.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The\ndecrease in accounts payable was primarily due to a decrease in the average number of days payable to our trade suppliers and reduced\npurchases with inventory depletion. Accounts payable fluctuate due to variations in the timing of the receipt of inventory, supplies and\nservices and our subsequent payments for these purchases.\nInvesting Activities\nCapital expenditures totaled approximately $43.1 million and $17.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. These expenditures were primarily used to purchase manufacturing and test equipment, software, computer hardware and\nbuilding improvements. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily attributable to an increase in expenditures due to the Business\nCombination with Adtran Networks and for expenditures related to the construction of a terafactory building in Europe.\n62\nOur combined short-term and long-term investments decreased $5.3 million from $33.0 million as of December 31, 2022 to $27.7\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. This decrease reflects the impact of the sale of portions of our equity and fixed income investments\nand the net unrealized and realized gains and losses on our investments.\nSee Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nOur long-term investments decreased 15.1% from $32.7 million as of December 31, 2022 to $27.7 million as of December 31, 2023.\nThis decrease was due to the sale of our fixed income investments. Our investments include various marketable equity securities\nclassified as long-term investments with a fair market value of $0.9 million and $0.8 million, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Long-term investments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 also included $26.8 million and $22.9 million, respectively,\nrelated to our deferred compensation plan.\n63\nFinancing Activities\nDividends\nDuring 2023 and 2022, we paid shareholder dividends totaling $21.2 million and $22.9 million, respectively. Beginning in the third\nquarter of 2022, the amount of dividends paid to shareholders increased from approximately $4.4 million per quarter to approximately\n$7.1 million per quarter which was due to the increased number of shareholders of the Company's stock as a result of the Business\nCombination with Adtran Networks. On November 6, 2023, the Board of Directors suspended the Company’s quarterly cash dividend\nin order to reduce debt and interest expense and support the Company's capital efficiency program. The payment of any future\ndividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the Company’s financial condition, results of\noperations, capital requirements, and any other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. In addition, the Wells Fargo Credit\nAgreement currently does not allow for the payment of dividends to shareholders. For addition information, see Note 20 of Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report and Liquidity & Capital Resources above. The following\ntable shows dividends per common share paid to our shareholders in each quarter of 2023 and 2022:\nDividends per Common Share\n2023 2022\nFirst Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nSecond Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nThird Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nFourth Quarter $ - $ 0.09\nStock Repurchase Program\nThe Company did not repurchase any stock during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and there currently is no authorized\nstock repurchase plan.\nStock Option Exercises\nTo accommodate employee stock option exercises, the Company issued 23 thousand and 0.5 million shares of common stock and\ntreasury stock which resulted in proceeds of $0.5 million and $6.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Additionally, to accommodate Adtran Networks stock option exercises, Adtran Networks issued 0.1 million of Adtran\nNetworks common stock which resulted in proceeds of $0.8 million, during the period July 15, 2022 to December 31, 2022. Adtran\nNetworks issued 0.1 million of Adtran Networks common stock which resulted in proceeds of $0.4 million, during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. Adtran Networks stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2023 totaled 18 thousand (representing less than\n0.1% of Adtran Networks' outstanding shares), of which none were exercisable.\nEmployee Pension Plan\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries. Pension benefit plan obligations are\nbased on various assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates,\ncompensation rate increases, expected return on plan assets, retirement rates and mortality rates. Actual results that differ from the\nassumptions and changes in assumptions could affect future expenses and obligations. Details regarding the pension plans are set forth\nbelow.\n• In Germany, there is one defined benefit pension plan and one defined contribution plan. Both plans provide benefits in\nthe event of retirement, death or disability. The plan's benefits are based on age, years of service and salary. The defined\nbenefit plan is financed by contributions paid by the Company and the defined contribution plan is financed by\ncontributions paid by the participants.\n• In Switzerland, there are two defined benefit pension plans. Both plans provide benefits in the event of retirement, death\nor disability. The plan's benefits are based on age, years of service, salary and on a participants old age account. The plans\nare financed by contributions paid by the participants and by the Company.\n• In Italy, the post-employment benefit plan is required due to statutory provisions. The plan is financed directly by the\nCompany on a pay-as-you-go basis. Employees receive their pension payments as a function of salary, inflation and a\nnotional account.\n• In Israel, there is a defined benefit plan that provides benefits in the event of a participant being dismissed involuntarily,\nretirement or death. The plan's benefits are based on the higher of the severance benefit required by law or the cash\nsurrender value of the severance benefit component of any qualifying insurance policy or long-term employee benefit\nfund that is registered in the participants name. The plan is financed by contributions paid by the Company.\n64\n• In India, the post-employment benefit plan is required due to statutory provisions. The plan is financed directly by the\nCompany on a pay-as-you-go basis.\nOur defined benefit plan assets consist of a balanced portfolio of equity funds, bond funds, emerging market funds, real estate funds\nand balanced funds. Our investment policy includes various guidelines and procedures designed to ensure assets are invested in a\nmanner necessary to meet expected future benefits earned by participants and consider a broad range of economic conditions. The\nobjectives of our investment policy are to maintain investment portfolios that diversify risk through prudent asset allocation\nparameters, achieve asset returns that meet or exceed the plans’ actuarial assumptions and achieve asset returns that are competitive\nwith like institutions employing similar investment strategies. The investment policy is periodically reviewed by us and a designated\nthird-party fiduciary for investment matters. At December 31, 2023, the estimated fair market value of our defined benefit pension\nplans' assets increased to $55.2 million from $48.7 million at December 31, 2022.\nThe defined benefit pension plan is accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the use of various assumptions, including an\nexpected rate of return on plan assets and a discount rate. The expected return on our German plan assets that is utilized in determining\nthe benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation\nstrategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of\nreturns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan\nperformance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return. The discount rate has been\nderived from the returns of high-quality, corporate bonds denominated in euro currency with durations close to the duration of our\npension obligations. The projected benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was $67.9 million and $59.3 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe components of net periodic pension cost, other than the service cost component, are included in other income, net in the\nConsolidated Statements of Loss. The components of net periodic pension cost and amounts recognized in other comprehensive\nincome (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $5.1 million and ($5.8) million, respectively.\nActuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. To the extent unamortized gains and losses\nexceed 10% of the higher of the market-related value of assets or the projected benefit obligation, the excess is amortized as a\ncomponent of net periodic pension cost over the remaining service period of active participants. We estimate that less than $0.1\nmillion will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost in 2024 for the net actuarial\nloss. The net actuarial loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $2.5 million\nand $1.1 million, respectively. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for\nadditional information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have exposure to credit losses from off-balance sheet exposures used to provide various guarantees of performance such as bid\nbonds, performance bonds and customs bonds, where we believe the risk of loss is immaterial to our financial statements as of\nDecember 31, 2023. Otherwise, we do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not engaged in any related party\ntransactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or\nthe availability of or requirements for capital resources. See Note 20 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\n65\nCash Requirements\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s material short- and long-term cash requirements from known obligations pursuant to\ncertain contracts and commitments as of December 31, 2023, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations and\npayments are expected to be satisfied (but excluding payments that may be made pursuant to the DPLTA and currency hedging\narrangements, which are discussed below). Other than operating lease obligations, the cash requirements table excludes interest\npayments.\n(In thousands) Total 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter\nWells Fargo credit agreement(1) $ 195,000 $ — $ — $ — $ 195,000 $ — $ —\nSecured borrowings related to\naccounts receivable(2) 14,099 14,099 — — — — —\nPurchase obligations(3) 252,516 237,358 9,792 5,312 54 — —\nOperating lease obligations(4) 47,720 9,639 8,423 6,608 4,923 4,723 13,404\nTotals $ 509,335 $ 261,096 $ 18,215 $ 11,920 $ 199,977 $ 4,723 $ 13,404\n(1) See description below.\n(2) Secured borrowings related to our accounts receivable factoring agreement that are expected to be repaid within 12 months..\n(3) We have purchase obligations related to open purchase orders to our contract manufacturers, ODMs, component suppliers, service partners and other vendors. The settlement of our purchase\nobligations will occur at various dates beginning in 2024 and going through 2027. See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for more\ninformation.\n(4) We have operating leases for office space, automobiles and various other equipment in the U.S. and in certain international locations. Our operating leases had remaining lease terms ranging from\ntwo months to 116 months as of December 31, 2023.\nStock Repurchase Program\nThere were no stock repurchases during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and there currently is no authorized stock\nrepurchase plan.\nWells Fargo Credit Agreement\nOn July 18, 2022, ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. and ADTRAN, Inc., as the borrower, entered into the Credit Agreement with the\nAdministrative Agent and the other lenders named therein. The Credit Agreement was subsequently amended on August 9, 2023,\nJanuary 16, 2024 and March 12, 2024. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving line of credit and a DDTL. As of December 31,\n2023, ADTRAN, Inc.’s borrowings under the revolving line of credit were $195.0 million. As of December 31, 2023, there were no\nborrowings under the DDTL. The Credit Facility matures in July 2027; however, the Company has an option to request extensions\nsubject to customary conditions. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this\nreport and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Part II, Item 7 of this report for additional information.\nNord/LB Revolving Line of Credit\nOn March 29, 2023, Adtran Networks entered into a $16.1million unsecured revolving line of credit with Norddeutsche Landesbark -\nGirozentrale (Nord/LB) that bore interest of Euro Short Term Rate plus 1.94%. The line of credit had a perpetual term that could be\nterminated by the Company or Nord/LB at any time. As of December 31, 2023, Adtran Networks repaid the outstanding borrowings\nand terminated the Nord/LB Revolving Line of Credit.\nPrior Nord/LB Revolving Line of Credit\nOn August 8, 2022, Adtran Networks entered into a $16.1 million revolving line of credit with Norddeutsche Landesbark -\nGirozentrale (Nord/LB) that bore interest of Euro Short Term Rate plus 1.4% and matured in August 2023.

On January 31, 2023, the Company repaid the outstanding borrowings and\nterminated the syndicated credit agreement note payable.\nCurrency Hedging Arrangements\nOn November 3, 2022, the Company entered into a euro/U.S. dollar forward contract arrangement (the \"Initial Forward\") with Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A. (the “Hedge Counterparty”). The Initial Forward, which is governed by the provisions of an ISDA Master\nAgreement (including schedules thereto and transaction confirmations that supplement such agreement) entered into between the\nCompany and the Hedge Counterparty, enable the Company to convert a portion of its euro denominated payment obligations under\nthe proposed DPLTA into U.S. Dollars. Under the Initial Forward, the Company agreed to exchange an aggregate notional amount of\n€160.0 million for U.S. dollars at a daily fixed forward rate ranging from $1.0141 to $1.0305. The aggregate amount of €160.0 million\nis divided into eight quarterly tranches of €20.0 million, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2022. During the twelve months\nended December 31, 2023, the Company settled four €20.0 million forward contract tranches and the remaining amount will be\ndivided into four quarterly tranches of €20.0 million. The Company, at its sole discretion, may exchange all or part of each tranche on\nany given day within the applicable quarter; provided, however, that it must exchange the full tranche by the end of such quarter. The\nInitial Forward may be accelerated or terminated early for a number of reasons, including but not limited to (i) non-payment by the\nCompany or the Hedge Counterparty, (ii) breach of representation or warranty or covenant by either party or (iii) insolvency or\nbankruptcy of either party.\nOn March 21, 2023, the Company entered into a euro/U.S. dollar forward contract arrangement (the “Forward”) with the Hedge\nCounterparty. Under the Forward, which is governed by the provisions of an ISDA Master Agreement (including schedules thereto and\ntransaction confirmations that supplement such agreement) entered into between the Company and the Hedge Counterparty, the\nCompany will exchange an aggregate notional amount of €160.0 million U.S. dollars for euros at a daily fixed forward rate ranging\nfrom $1.0882 to $1.0955 per €1.00. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company settled four $20.0 million\nforward contract tranches and the remaining amount will be divided into four quarterly tranches of $20.0 million. These forward\ncontracts were executed on March 21, 2023 (to sell EUR/buy USD) and were entered into for the purpose of unwinding the Initial\nForward (to buy EUR/sell USD). The drawdown dates of the Initial Forward are set to the same date as the maturity of the new\noffsetting Forward.\nReceivables Purchase Arrangements\nThe Company is party to a Receivables Purchase and Servicing Agreement with True Value S.A.R.L. (the “Factoring Agreement”),\nwhich accelerates receivable collection and helps to better manage cash flow. Total accounts receivables factored as of December 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, totaled $17.5 million and $14.9 million, respectively, of which $2.8 million and $1.2 million was\nretained pursuant to the Factoring Agreement in the reserve account, respectively. The balance in the reserve account is included in\nother assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cost of receivables purchase agreement is included in interest expense in the\nConsolidated Statements of Loss and totaled $0.9 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, respectively.\nDomination and Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement\nThe DPLTA between the Company, as the controlling company, and Adtran Networks SE, as the controlled company, as executed on\nDecember 1, 2022, became effective on January 16, 2023, as a result of its registration with the commercial register (Handelsregister)\nof the local court (Amtsgericht) at the registered seat of Adtran Networks (Jena).\nUnder the DPLTA, subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, (i) the Company is\nentitled to issue binding instructions to the management board of Adtran Networks, (ii) Adtran Networks will transfer its annual profit\nto the Company, subject to, among other things, the creation or dissolution of certain reserves, and (iii) the Company will generally\nabsorb the annual net loss incurred by Adtran Networks. The obligation of the Company to absorb Adtran Networks’ annual net loss\napplied for the first time to the loss generated in 2023.\nPursuant to the terms of the DPLTA, each Adtran Networks shareholder (other than the Company) has received an offer to elect either\n(1) to remain an Adtran Networks shareholder and receive from us an Annual Recurring Compensation payment, or (2) to receive Exit\nCompensation plus guaranteed interest. The guaranteed interest under the Exit Compensation is calculated from the effective date of\nthe DPLTA to the date the shares are tendered, less any Annual Recurring Compensation paid. The guaranteed interest rate is 5.0%\nplus a variable component (according to the German Civil Code) that was 3.12% as of December 31, 2023. Assuming all the minority\nholders of currently outstanding Adtran Networks shares were to elect the second option, we would be obligated to make aggregate\nExit Compensation payments, including guaranteed interest, of approximately €310.3 million or approximately $342.5 million, based\non an exchange rate as of December 31, 2023 and reflecting interest accrued through December 31, 2023 during the pendency of the\nappraisal proceedings discussed below. Shareholders electing the first option of Annual Recurring Compensation may later elect the\nsecond option. The opportunity for outside Adtran Networks shareholders to tender Adtran Networks shares in exchange for Exit\nCompensation\n67\n\nhad been scheduled to expire on March 16, 2023. However, due to the appraisal proceedings that have been initiated in accordance\nwith applicable German law, this time period for tendering shares has been extended pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act\n(Aktiengesetz) and will end two months after the date on which a final decision in such appraisal proceedings has been published in the\nFederal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger).\nWe are also obligated to absorb any annual net loss of Adtran Networks under the DPLTA. Additionally, our obligation to pay Annual\nRecurring Compensation under the DPLTA is a continuing payment obligation, which will amount to approximately €10.6 million or\n$11.7 million (based on the current exchange rate) per year assuming none of the minority Adtran Networks shareholders were to elect\nExit Compensation. The foregoing amounts do not reflect any potential increase in payment obligations that we may have depending\non the outcome of ongoing appraisal proceedings in Germany. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we accrued $11.5 million in\nAnnual Recurring Compensation, which was reflected as an increase to retained deficit.\nOn October 18, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase additional shares of Adtran Networks\nthrough open market purchases not to exceed 15,346,544 shares. For the year ended December 31, 2023, 67 thousand shares,\nrespectively, of Adtran Networks stock was tendered to the Company and Exit Compensation payments of approximately €1.2 million\nor approximately $1.3 million based on an exchange rate as of December 31, 2023, were paid to Adtran Networks shareholders.\nWe currently hold 33,957,538 no-par value bearer shares of Adtran Networks, representing 65.32% of Adtran Networks outstanding\nshares as of February 2, 2024.\nThe foregoing description of the DPLTA does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the DPLTA, a\nnon-binding English translation of which incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Combination Transaction Costs\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has incurred $26.2 million of transaction costs related to the Business Combination. During\nthe years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, $0.1 million, $14.2 million and $11.9 million of transaction costs were incurred,\nrespectively.\nBusiness Efficiency Program\nOn November 6, 2023, due to the uncertainty around the current macroeconomic environment and its impact on customer spending\nlevels, the Company’s management decided to implement a business efficiency program (the “Business Efficiency Program”)\ntargeting the reduction of ongoing operating expenses and focusing on capital efficiency inclusive of certain salary reductions, an early\nretirement program, a site consolidation plan to include lease impairments and the partial sale of owned real estate (including the\npotential sale of portions of our headquarters), inventory write downs from product discontinuances, and the suspension of the\nquarterly dividend. The Business Efficiency Program expands upon other recently implemented restructuring efforts and synergy costs\nfollowing the Business Combination. For instance, on August 17, 2023, the Company’s management determined to discontinue its\ncopper-based Digital Subscriber Line broadband access technology products and its fixed wireless access products in its Network\nSolutions segment. Furthermore, on September 29, 2023, the Company’s management decided to exit the \"IoT\" gateway market\n(indoor and outdoor), a subset of the broader IoT market (together with the other product discontinuations, the “Discontinuations”).\nAdditionally, on October 25, 2023, all employees were informed of certain personnel measures, which included the reduction of salary\nfor select management, a reduction of approximately 5% of the workforce, an early retirement program and a hiring freeze.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized $25.1 million of costs relating to the Business Efficiency Program. We\nexpect costs in the first quarter 2024 and thereafter relating to the Business Efficiency Program to range between $22.2 million and\n$35.2 million. Management expects these planned costs to include severance costs ranging from $12.2 million to $18.9 million in\nconnection with an early retirement program and reductions in workforce, inventory write downs from product discontinuances\nranging from $7.6 million to $10.3 million, and site consolidation transaction expenses (primarily brokers fees) ranging from $2.4\nmillion to $6.0 million. Future cash payments include: severance costs and outplacement fees that are anticipated to be in the range of\n$12.2 million to $18.9 million, payments relating to the site consolidation transaction expenses that are anticipated to be in the range\nof $2.4 million to $6.0 million, and potential cash payments in the range of $3.6 million to $6.3 million for anticipated product\ndiscontinuances. We may also incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a\nresult of, or associated with, the Business Efficiency Program, including potential impairment charges related to the discontinuance of\nadditional product lines, regulatory requirements related to personnel measures, and site closures. However, we are not able to\nestimate the amount or range of amounts of such potential incremental charges as of the date of this filing. If required, we will amend\nthis disclosure at such time as management is able in good faith to estimate the amount, or range of amounts, of these charges.\nBusiness Combination Integration Costs\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized $4.9 million of integration costs related to the Business Combination that\nare included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Loss. We expect to incur\nadditional\n68\nintegration costs and expenses associated with the implementation of the DPLTA throughout 2024 and such costs are expected to be\nmaterial. These costs are separate and apart from the costs associated with the integration program discussed below.\nMulti-Year Integration Program\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company initiated a multi-year integration program designed to optimize the assets, business\nprocesses, and information technology systems of the Company. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized\n$21.5 million and $1.6 million of restructuring costs relating to the Business Combination under the multi-year integration program,\nrespectively, that are included in cost of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses\nin the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Loss. The Company does not anticipate additional material expenses to be incurred in\nconnection with this integration program. See Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of\nthis report for additional information.\nOther Cash Requirements\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, other than the Exit Compensation payments, Annual Recurring Compensation under the\nDPLTA, restructuring costs and increased debt service costs, there have been no other material changes in cash requirements from\nthose discussed in the 2022 Form 10-K/A and our cash requirements table shown in Liquidity and Capital Resources above.\nPerformance Bonds\nCertain contracts, customers and jurisdictions in which we do business require us to provide various guarantees of performance such\nas bid bonds, performance bonds and customs bonds. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had commitments related to these bonds\ntotaling $10.8 million and $21.1 million, respectively, which expire at various dates through April 2031. In general, we would only be\nliable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default under each contract; the probability of which we believe is remote.\n69\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that\nare highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the\naccounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the results of financial operations. Several accounting\npolicies, as described in Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report, require\nmaterial subjective or complex judgment and have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as\napplicable. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the\npreparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:\nRevenue\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a\ncustomer and as performance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied. Generally, this occurs with the transfer of\ncontrol of a product to the customer. Review of contracts with customers, for both direct customers and distributors, are performed and\nassessed for principal versus agent considerations to determine primary responsibility for delivery of performance obligation,\npresumed inventory risk, and discretion in establishing pricing, when applicable. For transactions where there are multiple\nperformance obligations, individual products and services are accounted for separately if they are distinct (if a product or service is\nseparately identifiable from other items and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily\navailable to the customer). The consideration, including any discounts, is allocated between separate products and services based on\ntheir stand-alone selling prices. Stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the separate products and\nservices are sold and are allocated based on each item’s relative value to the total value of the products and services in the\narrangement. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate stand-alone selling prices primarily using the “expected cost plus a\nmargin” approach. Payment terms are generally 30 days in the U.S. and typically longer in many geographic markets outside the U.S.\nShipping fees are recorded as revenue and the related cost which we have elected to account for as a cost of fulfilling the related\ncontract is included in cost of revenue. Revenue, value-added and other taxes collected concurrently with revenue-producing activities\nare excluded from revenue. Costs of obtaining a contract, if material, are capitalized and amortized over the period that the related\nrevenue is recognized if greater than one year. We have also elected to apply the practical expedient related to the incremental costs of\nobtaining contracts and recognize those costs as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets is one year or less.\nThese costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Capitalized costs with an amortization period greater than\none year were immaterial.\nRevenue is generated by two reportable segments: Network Solutions and Services & Support.\nNetwork Solutions Segment - Includes hardware products and software defined next-generation virtualized solutions used in Service\nProvider or business networks, as well as prior generation products. The majority of the revenue from this segment is from hardware\nrevenue.\nHardware and Software Revenue\nRevenue from hardware sales is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally when the products are\nshipped. Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point. Revenue from software license sales is recognized at delivery and transfer\nof control to the customer. Revenue is recorded net of estimated discounts and rebates using historical trends. Customers are typically\ninvoiced when control is transferred and revenue is recognized. Our products generally include assurance-based warranties of 90 days\nto five years for product defects, which are accrued at the time products are delivered.\nServices & Support Segment - Includes a complete portfolio of maintenance, network implementation and solutions integration and\nmanaged services, which include hosted cloud services and subscription services to complement our Network Solutions segment.\nMaintenance Revenue\nOur maintenance service periods range from one month to five years. Customers are typically invoiced and pay for maintenance\nservices at the beginning of the maintenance period. We recognize revenue for maintenance services on a straight-line basis over the\nmaintenance period as our customers benefit evenly throughout the contract term and deferred revenue, when applicable, is recorded\nin unearned revenue and non-current unearned revenue. The total balance of our unearned revenue was $71.8 million and $60.4\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNetwork Implementation Revenue\nWe recognize revenue for network implementation, which primarily consists of engineering, execution and enablement services at a\npoint in time when each performance obligation is complete. If we have recognized revenue but have not billed the customer, the right\nto consideration is recognized as a contract asset that is included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The contract\nasset is transferred to accounts receivable when the completed performance obligation is invoiced to the customer.\n70\nNew Accounts Receivable Factoring Agreement\nOn December 19, 2023, the Company entered into a new factoring agreement with a third-party financial institution to replace the\nCompany’s prior accounts receivable purchase agreement and to sell, on a revolving basis, undivided interests in the Company’s\naccounts receivable. The new factoring agreement qualifies for treatment as a secured borrowing with a pledge of collateral under\nAccounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 810, Consolidations, as the Company is considered the primary beneficiary in a\nvariable interest entity created to hold the factored receivables and the Company retains a residual claim on reserves related to the\nfactored receivables. The receivables factored continue to be carried in accounts receivable, less allowance for credit losses on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets, secured borrowings are carried on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as a current liability, in\naccounts payable, proceeds and repayments of secured borrowings are reflected as cash flows provided by (used in) financing\nactivities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and program fees are recorded in interest expense in the Company’s\nConsolidated Statements of Loss. The short-term liability classification of the secured borrowings is based on the estimated timing of\nthe collection of the accounts receivable which are expected to be received within 12 months. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nPrevious Accounts Receivable Factoring Agreement\nThe Company had previously entered into a factoring agreement to sell certain receivables to an unrelated third-party financial\ninstitution on a non-recourse basis. These transactions were accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 860 and resulted in a\nreduction in accounts receivable because the agreement transferred effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the\nbuyers. Trade accounts receivables balances sold were removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash received was reflected\nas cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Factoring related interest\nexpense was recorded to interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Loss. On each sale date, the financial institution retained\nfrom the sale price a default reserve, up to a required balance, which was held by the financial institution in a reserve account and\npledged to the Company. The financial institution was entitled to withdraw from the reserve account the sale price of a defaulted\nreceivable. The balance in the reserve account was included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInventory\nWe carry our inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost being determined using the first-in, first-out method.\nStandard costs for material, labor, and manufacturing overhead are used to value inventory and are updated at least quarterly. Most\nvariances are expensed in the current period; therefore, our inventory costs approximate actual costs at the end of each reporting\nperiod. We establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and\nthe estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on estimated reserve percentages, which consider historical usage, known\ntrends, inventory age and market conditions. If actual trends and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by\nmanagement, we may be required to make additional inventory write-downs. Our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $83.1\nmillion and $51.8 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Inventory disposals charged against the reserve were $7.6\nmillion and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nFor purposes of determining the estimated fair value of market-based PSU awards on the date of grant, the Monte Carlo Simulation\nvaluation method is used. These PSUs are subject to a market condition based on the relative total shareholder return of ADTRAN\nagainst all of the companies in the NASDAQ Telecommunications Index and vest at the end of a three-year performance period. The\nfair value of performance-based PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the business day\nimmediately preceding the grant date. Compensation expense related to unvested performance-based PSUs is recognized over the\nrequisite service period of two to three years as the achievement of the performance obligation becomes probable. For purposes of\ndetermining the estimated fair value of our stock option awards on the date of grant, we use the Black-Scholes Model. This model\nrequires the input of certain assumptions that require subjective judgment. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, expected\nstock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. Because our\nstock option awards have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the input\nassumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the existing model may not provide a reliable, single measure of the fair\nvalue of our stock option awards. Management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the\nestimated fair value of stock-based compensation. Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time,\nwhich could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact our fair value determination. If\nfactors change in future periods, the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the\ncurrent period. As of December 31, 2023, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the non-vested portion of market-based\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock was approximately $15.5 million.\n71\nPursuant to the Business Combination, which closed on July 15, 2022, Adtran Networks stock option holders were entitled to have\ntheir Adtran Networks stock options assumed by ADTRAN Holdings (applying the exchange ratio in the Business Combination\nAgreement), thereafter representing options to acquire stock of ADTRAN Holdings. The maximum number of shares of ADTRAN\nHoldings stock potentially issuable upon such assumption was 2.3 million shares. The period in which such options could be assumed\nended July 22, 2022. A total of 2.1 million shares of ADTRAN Holdings stock were subject to assumed Adtran Networks options. The\ndetermination of the fair value of stock options assumed by ADTRAN Holdings was estimated using the Monte Carlo method and is\naffected by its stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables that may have a significant\nimpact on the fair value estimate. The stock option pricing model requires the use of several assumptions that impact the fair value\nestimate. These variables include, but are not limited to, the volatility of the Company's stock price and employee exercise behaviors.\nAs of December 31, 2023, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the non-vested portion of stock options was\napproximately $8.1 million.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. The Company’s annual impairment\nassessment is done at the reporting unit level, which we determined are generally the same as our operating segments, which are\nidentified in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter\nand also test for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce\nthe fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances may include among others: a significant\nadverse change in legal factors or in the general business climate; significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization;\nunanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit; and an adverse action or\nassessment by a regulator. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and\ncould have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nDue to the Company's decreased market capitalization and long-term projections, a reassessment of our estimated future undiscounted\ncash flows within our two identified reporting units was triggered. Therefore an interim impairment test over goodwill was performed\nas of September 30, 2023. The Company determined the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of an income approach\nand a market based peer group analysis. Management’s determination of the fair value of our reporting units, based on future cash\nflows for the reporting units, requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions related to cash flow projections,\ndiscount rate, peer group determination and market multiple selection. It was determined that the decreases in projected future cash\nflows, discount rates, overall macroeconomic conditions, as well as the decrease in our market capitalization applied in the valuation,\nwere required to align with market-based assumptions and company-specific risk, which resulted in lower fair values of the Services\n& Support reporting unit. As a result of the interim assessment, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $37.9 million\nas its estimated fair value was less than its book value on that date.\nThe Company’s annual impairment test date was October 1, 2023. The Company concluded that there was no goodwill impairment as\nof that date as there was no change in enterprise value from the September 30, 2023 testing date. Between the annual impairment date\nof October 1, 2023 and year-end December 31, 2023, there were no additional triggering events.\nAs a result of the Business Combination during 2022, the Company recognized $350.5 million of goodwill. During the fourth quarter\nof 2022, we decided to proceed directly to the quantitative test of goodwill and forego the qualitative assessment. We estimated the\nfair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby we calculated the fair value of a reporting unit based on the\npresent value of estimated future cash flows. Our discounted cash flow analysis required us to make various judgmental assumptions\nabout future sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates, which are based on our budgets, business plans, economic\nprojections, anticipated future cash flows and market participants. We also estimated the fair value of our reporting units based on a\npeer group analysis, whereby companies in the telecommunications industry or with a comparable product and market structure are\nused to calculate a fair enterprise value using revenue, EBITDA and debt multiples of trading value. Based on our analysis,\nmanagement concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill as of December 31, 2022.\nNo goodwill impairment charge was recorded in 2021 as a result of the Company’s internal assessment.\nThe balance of our goodwill was $353.4 million and $381.7 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIntangible Assets\nPurchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded over the\nestimated useful lives of the respective assets.\nAs part of the purchase price allocation related to the Business Combination with Adtran Networks, the Company recognized $403.8\nmillion of intangible assets on July 15, 2022. The balance of our intangible assets was $328.0 million and $401.2 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n72\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles\nLong-lived assets and intangibles used in operations are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of assets within a reporting unit may not be recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated\nto be generated by the assets are less than the reporting units carrying value. The identification of our reporting units begins at the\noperating segment level and considers whether components one level below the operating segment levels should be identified as\nreporting units for the purpose of testing assets for impairment. For impairment testing purposes, we determined the Company's\nreporting units are generally the same as its operating segments, which are identified in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. Our general policy is to qualitatively assess the carrying value of assets in our reporting units each reporting period for\nevents or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying\namount.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company qualitatively assessed the carrying value of each reporting unit for events or\ncircumstance changes that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Based on\nour assessment of certain qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and\noverall financial performance, management concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit was more likely than not greater than its\ncarrying amount as of December 31, 2023.\nIn connection with the planned integration of information technology following the Business Combination, we determined that certain\nprojects no longer fit our needs. As a result the Company recognized impairment charges of $17.4 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 primarily related to capitalized implementation costs for a cloud computing arrangement. The impairment charges\nwere determined based on actual costs incurred.\nThere were no impairment losses for long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2021, or for intangible assets\nrecognized during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nIncome Taxes\nWe estimate our income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including estimating exposures\nrelated to examinations by taxing authorities. We also make judgments regarding the realization of deferred tax assets and establish\nvaluation allowances where we believe it is more likely than not that future taxable income in certain jurisdictions will be insufficient\nto realize these deferred tax assets. Our estimates regarding future taxable income and income tax provision or benefit may vary due to\nchanges in market conditions, changes in tax laws, or other factors. If our assumptions, and consequently our estimates, change in the\nfuture, the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased, impacting future income tax expense. We\ncontinually review the adequacy of our valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment\nindicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. During\nthe fourth quarter of 2022, after considering all quantitative and qualitative evidence, including our cumulative income position,\nhistorical operating performance and future income projections, we have determined that the positive evidence overcame the negative\nevidence and have concluded that it is more likely than not that a substantial portion of our U.S. federal and certain other state deferred\ntax assets were realizable. As a result, we have released the majority of our valuation allowance against those assets. However, the\namount of deferred tax assets considered realizable could be adjusted in future periods in the event that sufficient evidence is no longer\npresent to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our domestic deferred tax assets will be realized.\nWe establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions\nbecome uncertain. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, as facts and circumstances\nchange.\nLiability for Warranty\nOur products generally include warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects. We accrue a provision for warranty returns at\nthe time of product shipment based on our historical return rate and an estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products.\nWe engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our\ncomponent suppliers. Our products continue to become more complex in both size and functionality as many of our product offerings\nmigrate from line card applications to total systems. The increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences, when\nthey arise, to be more costly. Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material\nusage, and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may\nbe recorded if unforeseen problems arise. Should our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be\nrequired to record additional warranty expense. The liability for warranty obligations totaled $6.4 million and $7.2 million at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\n73\nPension Benefit Plan Obligations\nPension benefit plan obligations are based on various assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating these amounts. These\nassumptions include discount rates, compensation rate increases, expected return on plan assets, retirement rates and mortality rates.\nActual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in assumptions could affect future expenses and obligations. Our net\npension liability totaled $12.7 million and $10.6 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. This liability is\nincluded in pension liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nLease Obligations\nWe have operating leases for office space, automobiles and various other equipment in the U.S. and in certain international locations.\nOther contracts, such as manufacturing agreements and service agreements, are reviewed to determine if they contain potential\nembedded leases. These other contracts are specifically reviewed to determine whether we have the right to substantially all of the\neconomic benefit from the use of any specified assets or the right to direct the use of any specified assets, either of which would\nindicate the existence of a lease. Some of our leases include options to renew. For those leases that are reasonably assured to be\nrenewed, we have included the option to extend as part of our right of use asset and lease liability. The exercise of lease renewal\noptions is at our sole discretion. The depreciable life of leased assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease\nterm. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and lease expense for these leases is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For lease agreements entered into or reassessed after the adoption of Topic 842,\nwe elected to not separate lease and non-lease components. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value\nguarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company records assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, when applicable, and intangible assets\nrecognized as part of business combinations based on their fair values on the date of acquisition subject to purchase accounting\nadjustments. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities\nassumed or acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the estimated fair values of net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed exceed the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recorded. The Company’s estimates of fair value are based on historical\nexperience, industry knowledge, certain information obtained from the management of the acquired company and, in some cases,\nvaluations performed by independent third-party firms. The results of operations of acquired companies are included in the\naccompanying Consolidated Statements of Loss since their dates of acquisition. Costs incurred to complete the Business Combination,\nsuch as legal, accounting or other professional fees, are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in\nPart II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\n74\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The primary\nobjective of the large majority of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time achieve appropriate yields\nwithout significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, a majority of our marketable securities are investment grade, fixed-rate\nbonds and municipal money market instruments denominated in U.S. dollars. Our investment policy provides limitations for issuer\nconcentration, which limits, at the time of purchase, the concentration in any one issuer to 5% of the market value of our total\ninvestment portfolio.\nWe maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions. As of December 31, 2023, $83.2 million of our cash and cash\nequivalents, primarily certain domestic money market funds and foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government provided\ninsured depository limits. Although these depository investments exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the\ncredit-worthiness of these financial institutions and determined the risk of material financial loss due to exposure of such credit risk to\nbe minimal.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately $5.7 million of our cash and investments may be directly affected by changes in interest\nrates. As of December 31, 2023, we held $5.7 million of cash and variable-rate investments where a change in interest rates would\nimpact our interest income. A hypothetical 50 basis point decline in interest rates as of December 31, 2023, assuming all other\nvariables remain constant, would reduce annualized interest income on our cash and investments by less than $0.1 million. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the carrying amounts of our revolving credit agreements totaled $195.0 million where a change in interest rates\nwould impact our interest expense. A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2023, assuming all other\nvariables remain constant, would increase our interest expense by $1.0 million. The analyses cover our debt and investments. The\nanalyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt and investments. The discount rates used were based on the market interest\nrates in effect at December 31, 2023.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent that such changes affect our revenue and gross margin on\nrevenue derived from some international customers, operating expenses, and assets and liabilities held in non-functional currencies\nrelated to our foreign subsidiaries. Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements are with the euro and the\nBritish pound sterling. Our revenue is primarily denominated in the respective functional currency of the subsidiary and paid in that\nsubsidiary's functional currency or certain other local currency. The majority of our global supply chain predominately makes\npayments in U.S. dollars and some of our operating expenses are paid in certain local currencies (approximately 43.2% of total\noperating expense for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively). Therefore, our revenue, gross margins, operating expenses\nand operating loss are all subject to foreign currency fluctuations. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates could cause\nvariations in our operating loss. A hypothetical 10% movement in foreign exchange rates would result in a before-tax positive or\nnegative impact of approximately $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Actual future gains and losses associated with\nour foreign currency exposures and positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of December 31, 2023\ndue to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the foreign currency exchange rates, and our actual exposures and positions.\nWe have certain customers and suppliers who are invoiced or pay in a non-functional currency. Changes in the monetary exchange\nrates used to invoice such customers versus the functional currency of the entity billing such customers may adversely affect our\nresults of operations and financial condition. To manage the volatility relating to these typical business exposures, we may enter into\nvarious derivative transactions, when appropriate. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative\npurposes. All non-functional currencies billed would result in a combined hypothetical gain or loss of $6.7 million if the U.S. dollar\nweakened or strengthened 10% against the billing currencies. All non-functional currencies invoiced by suppliers would result in a\ncombined hypothetical gain or loss of $11.4 million if the U.S. dollar weakened or strengthened 10% against the billing currencies.\nThis change represents an increase in the amount of hypothetical gain or loss compared to prior periods and is mainly due to an\nincrease in U.S. dollar denominated billings in a non-U.S. dollar denominated subsidiary.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had certain material contracts subject to currency revaluation, including accounts receivable, accounts\npayable and lease liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2023, we had 47 forward contracts outstanding\nwith a fair value of $4.8 million. The objective of these foreign currency forward contracts is to reduce the impact of currency\nexchange rate movements on our operating results by offsetting gains and losses on the forward contracts with increases or decreases\nin foreign currency transactions. We do not use foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes. Hedging of our\ncurrency exposures may not always be effective to protect us against currency exchange rate fluctuations. See Note 11 of Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\n75\nOn November 3, 2022, the Company entered into a euro/U.S. dollar forward contract arrangement (the \"Initial Forward\") with Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A. (the “Hedge Counterparty”). The Initial Forward, which is governed by the provisions of an ISDA Master\nAgreement (including schedules thereto and transaction confirmations that supplement such agreement) entered into between the\nCompany and the Hedge Counterparty, enable the Company to convert a portion of its euro denominated payment obligations under\nthe proposed DPLTA into U.S. Dollars. Under the Initial Forward, the Company agreed to exchange an aggregate notional amount of\n€160.0 million for U.S. dollars at a daily fixed forward rate ranging from $1.0141 to $1.0305. The aggregate amount of €160.0 million\nis divided into eight quarterly tranches of €20.0 million, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2022. During the twelve months\nended December 31, 2023, the Company settled four €20.0 million forward contract tranches and the remaining amount will be\ndivided into four quarterly tranches of €20.0 million over the course of 2024. The Company, at its sole discretion, may exchange all or\npart of each tranche on any given day within the applicable quarter; provided, however, that it must exchange the full tranche by the\nend of such quarter. The Initial Forward may be accelerated or terminated early for a number of reasons, including but not limited to\n(i) non-payment by the Company or the Hedge Counterparty, (ii) breach of representation or warranty or covenant by either party or\n(iii) insolvency or bankruptcy of either party.\nOn March 21, 2023, the Company entered into a euro/U.S. dollar forward contract arrangement (the “Forward”) with the Hedge\nCounterparty. Under the Forward, which is governed by the provisions of an ISDA Master Agreement (including schedules thereto and\ntransaction confirmations that supplement such agreement) entered into between the Company and the Hedge Counterparty, the\nCompany will exchange an aggregate notional amount of €160.0 million U.S. dollars for euros at a daily fixed forward rate ranging\nfrom $1.0882 to $1.0955 per €1.00. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company settled four $20.0 million\nforward contract tranches and the remaining amount will be divided into four quarterly tranches of $20.0 million. These forward\ncontracts were executed on March 21, 2023 (to sell EUR/buy USD) and were entered into for the purpose of unwinding the Initial\nForward (to buy EUR/sell USD). The drawdown dates of the Initial Forward are set to the same date as the maturity of the new\noffsetting Forward.\nFor further information about the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2023, see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\n76\nITEM 8.

We also have\naudited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal\nControl - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\nthe Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in\nour opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\n31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO because material\nweaknesses in internal control over financial reporting existed as of that date related to the Company not (i) designing and maintaining\neffective controls in response to the risks of material misstatement; (ii) designing and maintaining effective controls over financial\nstatement preparation, presentation and disclosure commensurate with its financial reporting requirements; and (iii) designing and\nmaintaining effective controls to address the initial application of complex accounting standards and accounting of non-routine,\nunusual or complex events and transactions.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a\nreasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a\ntimely basis. The material weaknesses referred to above are described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial\nReporting appearing under Item 9A. We considered these material weaknesses in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit\ntests applied in our audit of the 2023 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in management's\nreport referred to above. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\nand the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well\nas evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting\nincluded obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included\nperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable\nbasis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\n78\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect\non the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements\nthat was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are\nmaterial to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nInterim Goodwill Impairment Assessments – Network Solutions and Services & Support Reporting Units\nAs described in Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s goodwill balance was $353.4 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023, and the goodwill associated with the Network Solutions and Services & Support reporting units was $297.0\nmillion and $56.4 million, respectively. Goodwill is tested by management for impairment at the reporting unit level annually as of\nOctober 1, or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the Company’s\nreporting unit below its carrying amount. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company’s market capitalization and long-term\nprojections decreased and triggered a reassessment of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows within the Company’s two\nidentified reporting units as of September 30, 2023. Management determined the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination\nof an income approach and a market based peer group analysis. Management’s determination of the fair value of the Company’s\nreporting units, based on future cash flows for the reporting units, requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and\nassumptions related to cash flow projections, discount rate, peer group determination and market multiple selection. As disclosed by\nmanagement, as a result of the interim assessment, the Company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $37.9 million\nfor the Services & Support reporting unit.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the interim goodwill impairment assessments\nof the Network Solutions and Services & Support reporting units is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by\nmanagement when developing the fair value estimates of the Network Solutions and Services & Support reporting units; (ii) a high\ndegree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions\nrelated to cash flow projections, discount rate, peer group determination and market multiples selection; and (iii) the audit effort\ninvolved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion\non the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s\ngoodwill impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of the Network Solutions and Services & Support reporting\nunits. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimates of the\nNetwork Solutions and Services & Support reporting units; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income approach and the market\nbased peer group analyses used by management; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used by management in\nthe income approach and market based peer group analyses; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used\nby management related to cash flow projections, discount rate, peer group determination and market multiples selection. Evaluating\nmanagement’s assumption related to cash flow projections involved evaluating whether the assumption used by management was\nreasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the Network Solutions and Services & Support reporting units; (ii) the\nconsistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other\nareas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the\nincome approach and market based peer group analyses and (ii) the reasonableness of the assumptions related to the discount rate, peer\ngroup determination and market multiples selection.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nBirmingham, Alabama\nMarch 15, 2024\nWe have served as the

(“ADTRAN” or the “Company”) is a leading global provider of networking and communications platforms,\nsoftware, systems and services focused on the broadband access market, serving a diverse domestic and international customer base in\nmultiple countries that includes large, medium and small Service Providers; alternative Service Providers, such as utilities,\nmunicipalities and fiber overbuilders; cable/MSOs; SMBs and distributed enterprises. Our innovative solutions and services enable\nvoice, data, video and internet-communications across a variety of network infrastructures and are currently in use by millions\nworldwide. We support our customers through our direct global sales organization and our distribution networks. Our success depends\nupon our ability to increase unit volume and market share through the introduction of new products and succeeding generations of\nproducts having optimal selling prices and increased functionality as compared to both the prior generation of a product and to the\nproducts of competitors in order to gain market share.

We offer a broad portfolio of flexible software and hardware network solutions and services that enable Service\nProviders to meet today’s service demands, while enabling them to transition to the fully converged, scalable, highly-automated,\ncloud-controlled voice, data, internet and video network of the future. In addition to our global headquarters in Huntsville, Alabama,\nand our European headquarters in Munich, Germany, we have sales and research and development facilities in strategic global\nlocations.\nThe Company solely owns ADTRAN, Inc. and is the majority shareholder of Adtran Networks (formerly ADVA Optical Networking\nSE). ADTRAN, Inc. is a leading global provider of open, disaggregated networking and communications solutions. Adtran Networks\nis a global provider of network solutions for data, storage, voice and video services. We believe that the combined technology\nportfolio can best address current and future customer needs for high-speed connectivity from the network core to the end consumer\nand in particular upon the convergence of solutions at the network edge.\nLiquidity, Domination and Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement and Credit Facility\nThe DPLTA between the Company, as the controlling company, and Adtran Networks SE (\"Adtran Networks\"), as the controlled\ncompany, as executed on December 1, 2022, became effective on January 16, 2023, as a result of its registration with the commercial\nregister (Handelsregister) of the local court (Amtsgericht) at the registered seat of Adtran Networks (Jena).\nUnder the DPLTA, subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, (i) the Company is\nentitled to issue binding instructions to the management board of Adtran Networks, (ii) Adtran Networks will transfer its annual profit\nto the Company, subject to, among other things, the creation or dissolution of certain reserves, and (iii) the Company will generally\nabsorb the annual net loss incurred by Adtran Networks. The obligation of the Company to absorb Adtran Networks’ annual net loss\napplied for the first time to the loss generated in 2023.\nPursuant to the terms of the DPLTA, each Adtran Networks shareholder (other than the Company) has received an offer to elect either\n(1) to remain an Adtran Networks shareholder and receive from us an Annual Recurring Compensation payment, or (2) to receive Exit\nCompensation plus guaranteed interest. The guaranteed interest under the Exit Compensation is calculated from the effective date of\nthe DPLTA to the date the shares are tendered, less any Annual Recurring Compensation paid. The guaranteed interest rate is 5.0%\nplus a variable component (according to the German Civil Code) that was 3.12% as of December 31, 2023. Assuming all the minority\nholders of currently outstanding Adtran Networks shares were to elect the second option, we would be obligated to make aggregate\nExit Compensation payments, including guaranteed interest, of approximately €310.3 million or approximately $342.5 million, based\non an exchange rate as of December 31, 2023 and reflecting interest accrued through December 31, 2023 during the pendency of the\nappraisal proceedings discussed below. Shareholders electing the first option of Annual Recurring Compensation may later elect the\nsecond option. The opportunity for outside Adtran Networks shareholders to tender Adtran Networks shares in exchange for Exit\nCompensation had been scheduled to expire on March 16, 2023. However, due to the appraisal proceedings that have been initiated in\naccordance with applicable German law, this time period for tendering shares has been extended pursuant to the German Stock\nCorporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and will end two months after the date on which a final decision in such appraisal proceedings has\nbeen published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger).\nWe are also obligated to absorb any annual net loss of Adtran Networks under the DPLTA. Additionally, our obligation to pay Annual\nRecurring Compensation under the DPLTA is a continuing payment obligation, which will amount to approximately €10.6 million or\n$11.7 million (based on the current exchange rate) per year assuming none of the minority Adtran Networks shareholders were to elect\nExit Compensation. The foregoing amounts do not reflect any potential increase in payment obligations that we may have depending\non the outcome of ongoing appraisal proceedings in Germany. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we accrued $11.5 million in\nAnnual Recurring Compensation, which was reflected as an increase to retained deficit. With respect to the year ended December 31,\n85\n2023, we will be obligated to pay $11.5 million in Annual Recurring Compensation on the third banking day following the 2024\nordinary general shareholders’ meeting of Adtran Networks (but in any event within eight months following December 31, 2023).\nOn October 18, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase additional shares of Adtran Networks\nthrough open market purchases not to exceed 15,346,544 shares. For the year ended December 31, 2023, 67 thousand shares,\nrespectively, of Adtran Networks stock was tendered to the Company and Exit Compensation payments of approximately €1.2 million\nor approximately $1.3 million based on an exchange rate as of December 31, 2023, were paid to Adtran Networks shareholders.\nOn July 18, 2022, ADTRAN, Inc., as the borrower, and ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of\nbanks, including Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (“Administrative Agent”), and the other lenders\nnamed therein (the “Credit Agreement”), which has since been amended three times. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, as\namended, the Company, ADTRAN, Inc., and the subsidiary guarantors (together, the “Credit Parties”) are subject to a liquidity\ncovenant, which provides that, during the fourth quarter of 2023 through and including the third quarter of 2024 (the “Covenant Relief\nPeriod”) or a Springing Covenant Period (i.e., the period beginning upon the purchase by the Company of at least 60% of the\noutstanding shares of Adtran Networks not owned by the Company as of August 9, 2023 and the three consecutive quarterly test\nperiods after such date), as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, the cash and cash equivalents of the Credit Parties must be at least\n$50.0 million and the cash and cash equivalents of the Company and its subsidiaries must be at least $75.0 million, limiting our ability\nto pay the obligations under the DPLTA. The Company had access to $202.7 million on its Credit Facility for future borrowings;\nhowever, as of December 31, 2023, the Company was limited to additional borrowings of $38.8 million based on debt covenant\ncompliance metrics. See Note 12, Revolving Credit Agreements, and Note 24, Subsequent Events, for additional information regarding\nthe terms of the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement and its amendments.\nAs of December 31, 2023, and as of the date of issuance of these financial statements, the Company does not have sufficient liquidity\nto meet payment obligations under the DPLTA pertaining to Exit Compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2023, 67 thousand\nshares of Adtran Networks stock were tendered to the Company and Exit Compensation payments of approximately €1.2 million or\napproximately $1.3 million based on an exchange rate of December 31, 2023, were paid to Adtran Networks shareholders. We believe\nthe probability that more than a small minority of Adtran Networks shareholders elect to receive Exit Compensation in the next twelve\nmonths is remote based on the diverse base of shareholders that must make this election on an individual shareholder basis, the current\nongoing appraisal proceedings involving a dispute on the value of the Exit Compensation which is expected to take 24-32 months to\nresolve, the current guaranteed Annual Recurring Compensation payment plus the interest earned on such shares during the ongoing\nappraisal proceedings, and the current trading value of Adtran Networks shares.\nThe Company experienced revenue declines in 2023. To the extent that the Company is further impacted by the uncertain\nmacroeconomic environment related to continued elevated interest rates and ongoing inflationary pressures, the Company has\nestablished plans to preserve cash liquidity and maintain compliance with the Company’s covenants. The Company has suspended\ndividend payments and is continuing to implement a business efficiency program, which includes, but is not limited to, our ongoing\nintegration program, planned reductions in operating expenses and a site consolidation plan. In connection with the site consolidation\nplan, the Company is also exploring a potential sale of portions of our headquarters in Huntsville. There can be no assurance that the\nCompany will be successful in effecting this action on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We may need to further reduce capital\nexpenditures and/or take other steps to preserve working capital in order to ensure that we can meet our needs and obligations and\nmaintain compliance with our debt covenants.\nIn summary, the Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents, investments, working capital management initiatives and\navailability to access cash under the Wells Fargo credit facility, including (i) the additional funding provided for under the First\nAmendment to the Wells Fargo Credit Facility that was signed on August 9, 2023, (ii) the additional covenant headroom during the\nCovenant Relief Period provided for under the Second Amendment to Wells Fargo Credit Facility, and (iii) the exclusion of the\nFactoring Agreement as debt for purposes of the Credit Facility’s financial covenants as provided for under the Third Amendment to\nWells Fargo Credit Facility will be adequate to meet our business operating requirements, our capital expenditures and our expected\nobligations under the DPLTA, including anticipated levels of Exit Compensation and continue to comply with our debt covenants\nunder the Credit Facility for at least the next twelve months, from the issuance of these financial statements. See Note 12, Revolving\nCredit Agreements, for additional information regarding the terms of the First Amendment of the Wells Fargo Credit agreement and\nNote 24, Subsequent Events, for additional information regarding the terms of the Second and Third Amendments of the Wells Fargo\nCredit Agreement.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, changes in\nequity and cash flows of ADTRAN and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been\neliminated in consolidation.\n86\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Significant estimates include allowance for\ncredit losses on accounts receivable and contract assets, excess and obsolete inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates,\nestimated income tax provision and income tax contingencies, fair value of stock-based compensation, assessment of goodwill and\nother intangibles for impairment, estimated lives of intangible assets, estimates of intangible assets upon measurement, estimated\npension liability and fair value of investments and estimated contingent liabilities. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these\nestimates.\nWe assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the\ninformation reasonably available to us and the unknown future impacts inflationary pressures, the energy crisis, currency fluctuations\nand political tensions as of December 31, 2023, and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but\nwere not limited to, the allowance for credit losses, stock-based compensation, carrying value of goodwill, intangibles and other long-\nlived assets, financial assets, valuation allowances for tax assets, revenue recognition and costs of revenue. Future conditions related to\nongoing inflationary pressures, the energy crisis, continued elevated interest rates, instability in the financial services industry,\ncurrency fluctuations and political tensions could result in further impacts to the Company's consolidated financial statements in future\nreporting periods.\nRevision of Previously Issued Financial Statements\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company identified an immaterial error relating to the understatement of non-controlling\ninterest and the overstatement of accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31,\n2022. The immaterial misstatements occurred following the Business Combination between the Company and the Company’s\nmajority-owned subsidiary, Adtran Networks on July 15, 2022. The Company incorrectly presented the allocation of foreign currency\ntranslation loss attributable to the non-controlling interest as well as loss attributable to non-controlling interest in calculating the\ncomprehensive income attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc., net of tax for the year ended December 31, 2022. Management\nevaluated the impact of this error on the Company’s full year 2022 consolidated financial statements and determined that the\nconsolidated financial statements were not materially misstated. However, in order to correctly state non-controlling interest and\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest and ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. in connection\nwith the filing of this Form 10-K, the December 31, 2022 the balance sheet items and comprehensive loss for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 have been corrected to reflect the impact of this immaterial error. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\n(Loss) and Non-Controlling Interest were also adjusted within the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity to correct these\nerrors.\nThe following table reflects the impact of the revision to the specific line items presented in the Company’s previously reported\nConsolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity as of December 31, 2022:\nDecember 31, 2022\n(In thousands) As Reported Adjustment As Revised\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) $ 46,713 $ (20,587) $ 26,126\nNon-Controlling Interest $ 309,072 $ 20,587 $ 329,659\nThe following table reflects the impact of the revision to the specific line items presented in the Company’s previously reported\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2022:\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\n(In thousands) As Reported Adjustment As Revised\nComprehensive (Loss) Income attributable to non-controlling interest $ (918) $ 13,736 $ 12,818\nComprehensive Income attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc., net of\ntax $ 49,739 $ (13,736) $ 36,003\nThe accompanying applicable Notes have been updated to reflect the effects of the revision.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents represent demand deposits, money market funds and short-term investments classified as available-for-sale\nwith original maturities of three months or less. We maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, $83.2 million of our cash and cash equivalents, primarily certain domestic money market funds and foreign\ndepository accounts, were in excess of government provided insured depository limits. Although these depository investments may\nexceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit worthiness of these applicable financial institutions and\ndetermined the risk of material financial loss due to the exposure of such credit risk to be minimal.\n87\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived\nfrom such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models may be applied. Assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with\nthe inputs used to measure their fair values.\nThe carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts\npayable approximate fair value due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.\nThe fair value measurements of our derivative instruments are determined using models that maximize the use of the observable\nmarket inputs including interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for currencies, and are classified as Level II under the\nfair value hierarchy. The fair values of our derivatives are included in Note 11.\nThe estimated fair value of our notes payable, approximates the carrying value and is classified as Level II under the fair value\nhierarchy. The carrying value of our notes payable is included in Note 13.\nInvestments with contractual maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and\nbecause such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Despite the long-term\nnature of their stated contractual maturities, we routinely buy and sell these securities and we believe we have the ability to quickly\nsell them to the remarketing agent, tender agent or issuer at par value plus accrued interest in the event we decide to liquidate our\ninvestment in a particular variable rate demand note. All income generated from these investments is recorded as interest income. We\nhave not recorded any losses relating to variable rate demand notes.\nLong-term investments is comprised of our deferred compensation plan assets, corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-\nbacked bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, U.S. and foreign government bonds, marketable equity securities and other equity\ninvestments. Marketable equity securities are reported at fair value as determined by the most recently traded price of the securities at\nthe balance sheet date, although the securities may not be readily marketable due to the size of the available market. Any changes in\nfair value are recognized in net investment gain (loss). Realized gains and losses on sales of debt securities are computed under the\nspecific identification method and are included in other income, net. See Note 5 for additional information.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe record accounts receivable at amortized cost. Prior to establishing payment terms for a new customer, we evaluate the credit risk of\nthe customer. Credit limits and payment terms established for new customers are re-evaluated periodically based on customer\ncollection experience and other financial factors. As of December 31, 2023, a single customer comprised more than 10% of our total\naccounts receivable balance, which accounted for 11.9% of our total accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2022, single customers\ncomprising more than 10% of our total accounts receivable balance included three customers, which accounted for 33.1% of our total\naccounts receivable. As of December 31, 2022, these three customers individually accounted for 11.4%, 11.1% and 10.6%,\nrespectively, of our total accounts receivable.\nWe regularly review the need for an allowance for credit losses related to our outstanding accounts receivable balances using the\nhistorical loss-rate method, as well as assessing asset-specific risks. The assessment of asset-specific risks included the evaluation of\nrelevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to current conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to\npay, such as the customer’s current financial condition or credit rating by geographic location, as provided by a third party and/or by\ncustomer, if needed, and overall macro-economic conditions in which the customer operates. Based on this assessment, an allowance\nfor credit losses would be recorded if the Company determined that, based on our historical write-offs, which have been immaterial,\nand such asset specific risks, there was risk in collectability of the full amount of any accounts receivable.\nAccounts Receivable Factoring\nNew Accounts Receivable Factoring Agreement\nOn December 19, 2023, the Company entered into a new factoring agreement with a third-party financial institution to replace the\nCompany’s prior accounts receivable purchase agreement, to sell on a revolving basis, undivided interests in the Company’s accounts\nreceivable. The new factoring agreement qualifies for treatment as a secured borrowing with a pledge of collateral under Accounting\nStandards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 810, Consolidations, as the Company is considered the primary beneficiary in a variable\ninterest entity created to hold the factored receivables and the Company retains a residual claim on reserves related to the factored\nreceivables. Within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the receivables factored continue to be carried in accounts receivable, less\nallowance for credit losses, and the secured borrowings are carried as a current liability within accounts payable. The proceeds and\nrepayments of secured borrowings are reflected as cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities within the Consolidated\nStatements of Cash Flows, and program fees are recorded as interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Loss. The short-term\nliability classification of the\n88\nsecured borrowings is based on the estimated timing of the collection of the accounts receivable which are expected to be received\nwithin 12 months. See Note 3 for additional information.\nPrevious Accounts Receivable Factoring Agreement\nThe Company had previously entered into a factoring agreement to sell certain receivables to an unrelated third-party financial\ninstitution on a non-recourse basis. These transactions were accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 860 and resulted in a\nreduction in accounts receivable because the agreement transferred effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the\nbuyers. Trade accounts receivables balances sold were removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash received was reflected\nas cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Factoring related interest\nexpense was recorded to interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Loss. On each sale date, the financial institution retained\nfrom the sale price a default reserve, up to a required balance, which was held by the financial institution in a reserve account and\npledged to the Company. The financial institution was entitled to withdraw from the reserve account the sale price of a defaulted\nreceivable. The balance in the reserve account was included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInventory\nInventory is carried at the lower of cost and estimated net realizable value, with cost being determined using the first-in, first-out\nmethod. Standard costs for material, labor and manufacturing overhead are used to value inventory and are updated at least quarterly.\nWe establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the\nestimated net realizable value of the inventory based on estimated reserve percentages, which consider historical usage, known trends,\ninventory age and market conditions. When we dispose of excess and obsolete inventories, the related disposals are charged against\nthe inventory reserve. See Note 6 for additional information.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment, which is stated at cost, is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of\nthe assets. We depreciate building and land improvements from five to 39 years, office machinery and equipment from three to seven\nyears, engineering machinery and equipment from three to seven years, and computer software from three to five years. Expenditures\nfor repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Major improvements that materially prolong the lives of the assets are\ncapitalized. Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are recorded in operating loss. See Note 7 for additional\ninformation.\nIntangible Assets\nPurchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded over the\nestimated useful lives of the respective assets. See Note 10 for additional information.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles\nThe Company’s annual impairment assessment is done at the reporting unit level whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of assets within a reporting unit may not be recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated\nto be generated by the assets are less than the reporting units carrying value. The identification of our reporting units begins at the\noperating segment level and considers whether components one level below the operating segment levels should be identified as\nreporting units for the purpose of testing assets for impairment. For impairment testing purposes, we determined the Company's\nreporting units are generally the same as its operating segments, which are identified in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. Our general policy is to qualitatively assess the carrying value of assets in our reporting units each reporting period for\nevents or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying\namount.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company qualitatively assessed the carrying value of each reporting unit for events or\ncircumstance changes that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. actors and\noverall financial performance, management concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit was more likely than not greater than its\ncarrying amount as of December 31, 2023.\nIn connection with the planned integration of information technology following the Business Combination, we determined that certain\nprojects no longer fit our needs. As a result the Company recognized impairment charges of $17.4 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 primarily related to capitalized implementation costs for a cloud computing arrangement. The impairment charges\nwere determined based on actual costs incurred.\nThere were no impairment losses for long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2021, or for intangible assets\nrecognized during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021.\n89\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. The Company’s annual impairment\nassessment is done at the reporting unit level, which we determined are generally the same as our operating segments, which are\nidentified in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter\nand also test for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce\nthe fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances may include among others: a significant\nadverse change in legal factors or in the general business climate; significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization;\nunanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit; and an adverse action or\nassessment by a regulator. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and\ncould have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nDue to the Company's decreased market capitalization and long-term projections, a reassessment of our estimated future undiscounted\ncash flows within our two identified reporting units was triggered. Therefore an interim impairment test over goodwill was performed\nas of September 30, 2023. The Company determined the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of an income approach\nand a market based peer group analysis. Management’s determination of the fair value of our reporting units, based on future cash\nflows for the reporting units, requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions related to cash flow projections,\ndiscount rate, peer group determination and market multiple selection. It was determined that the decreases in projected future cash\nflows, discount rates, overall macroeconomic conditions, as well as the decrease in our market capitalization applied in the valuation,\nwere required to align with market-based assumptions and company-specific risk, which resulted in lower fair values of the Services\n& Support reporting unit. As a result of the interim assessment, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $37.9 million\nas its estimated fair value was less than its book value on that date.\nThe Company’s annual impairment test date is October 1, 2023. The Company concluded that there was no goodwill impairment as of\nthat date as there was no change in enterprise value from the September 30, 2023 testing date. Between the annual impairment date of\nOctober 1, 2023 and year-end December 31, 2023, there were no additional triggering events.\nAs a result of the Business Combination during 2022, the Company recognized $350.5 million of goodwill. During the fourth quarter\nof 2022, we decided to proceed directly to the quantitative test of goodwill and forego the qualitative assessment. We estimated the\nfair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby we calculated the fair value of a reporting unit based on the\npresent value of estimated future cash flows. Our discounted cash flow analysis required us to make various judgmental assumptions\nabout future sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates, which are based on our budgets, business plans, economic\nprojections, anticipated future cash flows and market participants. We also estimated the fair value of our reporting units based on a\npeer group analysis, whereby companies in the telecommunications industry or with a comparable product and market structure are\nused to calculate a fair enterprise value using revenue, EBITDA and debt multiples of trading value. Based on our analysis,\nmanagement concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill as of December 31, 2022.\nNo goodwill impairment charge was recorded in 2021 as a result of the Company’s internal assessment.\nOther Non-Current Assets\nImplementation costs incurred for hosting arrangements that are related to service contracts are capitalized and amortized over the\nterm of the arrangement. Capitalized implementation costs totaled $0.3 million and $6.2 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, and are included in other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In connection with the planned\nintegration of information technology following the Business Combination, we determined that certain projects no longer fit our\nneeds. As a result the Company recognized impairment charges of $16.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily\nrelated to capitalized implementation costs for a cloud computing arrangement. The impairment charges were determined based on\nactual costs incurred. During the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2021, no impairment charges were recognized. We depreciate\ncapitalized implementation costs over various lives. Amortization expense was $5.9 million, $3.9 million and $1.0 million for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which is recorded almost entirely in selling, general and administrative\nexpenses in the Consolidated Statements of Loss.\nLiability for Warranty\nOur products generally include warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the time of\nproduct shipment based on our historical return rate and estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products. We engage in\nextensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component\nsuppliers. The increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences, when they arise, to be more costly. Our estimates\nregarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage and other rework costs incurred in\ncorrecting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise.\nShould our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to record additional warranty\nexpense. Our liability for warranty returns totaled $6.4 million and $7.2 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n90\nPension Benefit Plan Obligations\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries. Pension benefit plan obligations are\nbased on various assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates,\ncompensation rate increases, expected return on plan assets, retirement rates and mortality rates. Actual results that differ from the\nassumptions and changes in assumptions could affect future expenses and obligations. Our net pension liability totaled $12.7 million\nand $10.6 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLease Obligations\nWe have operating leases for office space, automobiles and various other equipment in the U.S. and in certain international locations.\nOther contracts, such as manufacturing agreements and service agreements, are reviewed to determine if they contain potential\nembedded leases. These other contracts are specifically reviewed to determine whether we have the right to substantially all of the\neconomic benefit from the use of any specified assets or the right to direct the use of any specified assets, either of which would\nindicate the existence of a lease. Some of our leases include options to renew. For those leases that are reasonably assured to be\nrenewed, we have included the option to extend as part of our right of use asset and lease liability. The exercise of lease renewal\noptions is at our sole discretion. The depreciable life of leased assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease\nterm. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and lease expense for these leases is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For lease agreements entered into or reassessed after the adoption of Topic 842,\nwe elected to not separate lease and non-lease components. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value\nguarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have two stock incentive plans from which stock options, performance stock units (“PSUs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and\nrestricted stock are available for grant to employees and directors. Costs related to these awards are recognized over their vesting\nperiods.\nStock-based compensation expense recognized for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $16.0\nmillion, $28.3 million and $7.5 million, respectively. See Note 4 for additional information.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs include compensation for engineers and support personnel, contracted services, depreciation and\nmaterial costs associated with new product development, enhancement of current products and product cost reductions. We continually\nevaluate new product opportunities and engage in intensive research for product and software development efforts. Research and\ndevelopment costs totaled $258.3 million, $173.8 million and $108.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.\nAdtran Networks has arrangements with governmental entities for the purposes of obtaining funding for research and development\nactivities. The Company classifies government grants received under these arrangements as a reduction to research and development\nexpense incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $5.2 million and $1.1 million,\nrespectively as a reduction of research and development expense.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this\napproach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities\nare recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in\ndeferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from the difference between financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities\nand are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when such changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce\ndeferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.\nWe establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions\nbecome uncertain. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, as facts and circumstances\nchange.\nForeign Currency\nTransactions with customers that are denominated in foreign currencies are recorded using the appropriate exchange rates from\nthroughout the year. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the balance sheet dates using the\nclosing rates of exchange between those foreign currencies and the functional currency with any transaction gains or losses reported in\nother income, net. Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements are with our German and United Kingdom\nsubsidiaries, whose functional currencies are the Euro and the British pound sterling. Adjustments resulting from translating financial\nstatements of international subsidiaries are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.\nRevenue\n91\n\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a\ncustomer and as performance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied. Generally, this occurs with the transfer of\ncontrol of a product to the customer. Review of contracts with customers, for both direct customers and distributors, are performed and\nassessment made regarding principal versus agent considerations to determine primary responsibility for delivery of performance\nobligation, presumed inventory risk, and discretion in establishing pricing, when applicable. For transactions where there are multiple\nperformance obligations, individual products and services are accounted for separately if they are distinct (if a product or service is\nseparately identifiable from other items and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily\navailable to the customer). The consideration, including any discounts, is allocated between separate products and services based on\ntheir stand-alone selling prices. Stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the separate products and\nservices are sold and are allocated based on each item’s relative value to the total value of the products and services in the\narrangement. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate stand-alone selling prices primarily using the “expected cost plus a\nmargin” approach. Payment terms are generally 30 days in the U.S. and typically longer in many geographic markets outside the U.S.\nShipping fees are recorded as revenue and the related cost is included in cost of revenue. Revenue, value-added and other taxes\ncollected concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Costs of obtaining a contract, if material, are\ncapitalized and amortized over the period that the related revenue is recognized if greater than one year. We have elected to account for\nshipping fees as a cost of fulfilling the related contract. We have also elected to apply the practical expedient related to the incremental\ncosts of obtaining contracts and recognize those costs as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets is one year\nor less. These costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Capitalized costs with an amortization period greater\nthan one year were immaterial.\nRevenue is generated by two reportable segments: Network Solutions and Services & Support.\nNetwork Solutions Segment - Includes hardware products and software defined next-generation virtualized solutions used in Service\nProvider or business networks, as well as prior generation products. The majority of the revenue from this segment is from hardware\nrevenue.\nHardware and Software Revenue\nRevenue from hardware sales is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally when the products are\nshipped. Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point. Revenue from software license sales is recognized at delivery and transfer\nof control to the customer. Revenue is recognized net of estimated discounts and rebates using historical trends. Customers are\ntypically invoiced when control is transferred and revenue is recognized. Our products generally include assurance-based warranties of\n90 days to five years for product defects, which are accrued at the time products are delivered.\nServices & Support Segment - Includes a complete portfolio of maintenance, network implementation and solutions integration and\nmanaged services, which include hosted cloud services and subscription services to complement our Network Solutions segment.\nMaintenance Revenue\nOur maintenance service periods range from one month to five years. Customers are typically invoiced and pay for maintenance\nservices at the beginning of the maintenance period. We recognize revenue for maintenance services on a straight-line basis over the\nmaintenance period as our customers benefit evenly throughout the contract term and deferred revenue, when applicable, are recorded\nin current and non-current unearned revenue.\nNetwork Implementation Revenue\nWe recognize revenue for network implementation, which primarily consists of engineering, execution and enablement services at a\npoint in time when each performance obligation is complete. If we have recognized revenue but have not billed the customer, the right\nto consideration is recognized as a contract asset that is included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The contract\nasset is transferred to accounts receivable when the completed performance obligation is invoiced to the customer.\nSee Notes 3 and 18 for additional information on reportable segments.\nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue primarily represents customer billings on maintenance service programs and unearned revenue related to multiple\nelement contracts where we still have contractual obligations to our customers. We currently offer maintenance contracts ranging from\none month to five years. Revenue attributable to maintenance contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over the related contract\nterm. In addition, we provide software maintenance and a variety of hardware maintenance services to customers under contracts with\nterms up to ten years. When we defer revenue related to multiple performance obligations where we still have contractual obligations,\nwe also defer the related costs. Current deferred costs are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the accompanying\nConsolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $2.1 million and $1.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Non-current\ndeferred costs included in other non-current assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets were less than $0.1 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n92\nLoss per Share\nLoss per common share and loss per common share assuming dilution are based on the weighted average number of common shares\nand, when dilutive, common equivalent shares outstanding during the year. See Note 22 for additional information.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company records assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, when applicable, and intangible assets\nrecognized as part of business combinations based on their fair values on the date of acquisition subject to purchase accounting\nadjustments. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities\nassumed or acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the estimated fair values of net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed exceed the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recorded. The Company’s estimates of fair value are based on historical\nexperience, industry knowledge, certain information obtained from the management of the acquired company and, in some cases,\nvaluations performed by independent third-party firms. The results of operations of acquired companies are included in the\naccompanying Consolidated Statements of Loss since their dates of acquisition. Costs incurred to complete the Business Combination,\nsuch as legal, accounting or other professional fees are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred.\nRedeemable Non-Controlling Interest\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the non-controlling Adtran Networks stockholders’ equity ownership percentage in Adtran\nNetworks was approximately 34.7% and 34.7%, respectively.\nAs a result of the effectiveness of the DPLTA on January 16, 2023, the Adtran Networks shares, representing the equity interest in\nAdtran Networks held by holders other than the Company, can be tendered at any time and are, therefore, redeemable and must be\nclassified outside stockholders’ equity. Therefore, the permanent equity noncontrolling interest balance was reclassified to redeemable\nnon-controlling interest (RNCI) on January 16, 2023 and was remeasured to fair value based on the trading market price of the Adtran\nNetworks shares.\nSubsequently, the carrying value of the RNCI is adjusted to its maximum redemption value at each reporting date when the maximum\nredemption value is greater than the initial carrying amount of the RNCI. However, the RNCI will be remeasured using the current\nexchange rate at each reporting date as long as the RNCI is currently redeemable. For the period of time that the DPLTA is in effect,\nthe RNCI will continue to be presented as RNCI outside of stockholders’ equity in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. See\nNote 17, Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest, for additional information on RNCI.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2023-09,\n\"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\", which is intended to enhance the transparency, decision\nusefulness and effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this ASU require a public entity to disclose a tabular tax\nrate reconciliation, using both percentages and currency, with specific categories. A public entity is also required to provide a\nqualitative description of the states and local jurisdictions that make up the majority of the effect of the state and local income tax\ncategory and the net amount of income taxes paid, disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes and also disaggregated by\nindividual jurisdictions. The amendments also remove certain disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial. The\namendments are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption and retrospective\napplication are permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have on our disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-7, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures\", which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about\nsignificant segment expenses, allowing financial statement users to better understand the components of a segment's profit or loss to\nassess potential future cash flows for each reportable segment and the entity as a whole. The amendments expand a public entity's\nsegment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision\nmaker (\"CODM\"), clarifying when an entity may report one or more additional measures to assess segment performance, requiring\nenhanced interim disclosures, providing new disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and requiring other\nnew disclosures. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The Company expect to adopt the new disclosures as\nrequired for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on the related disclosures.\n(cid:0)(cid:3)\nRecent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Final Rules Not Yet Adopted\n93\nIn March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules under SEC Release No. 33-11275, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-\nRelated Disclosures for Investors, which requires registrants to provide certain climate-related information in their registration\nstatements and annual reports. The rules require information about a registrant's climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have\na material impact on its business, results of operations, or financial condition. The required information about climate-related risks will\nalso include disclosure of a registrant's greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the rules will require registrants to present certain\nclimate-related financial metrics in their audited financial statements. These requirements are effective for the Company in various\nfiscal years, starting with its fiscal year beginning January 1, 2025. Disclosures will be required prospectively, with information for\nprior periods required only to the extent it was previously disclosed in an SEC filing. The Company is currently evaluating the impact\nof these final rules on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, \"Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract\nLiabilities from Contracts with Customers\", which would require an acquirer to recognize and measure acquired contract assets and\ncontract liabilities in a manner consistent with how the acquiree recognized and measured them in its pre-acquisition financial\nstatements in accordance with Topic 606, Revenue Recognition. The Company early adopted ASU 2021-08 on July 1, 2022 and the\nstandard was applied retrospectively beginning with January 1, 2022.\nNote 2 – Business Combination Agreement\nThere were no business combinations during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2021.\nAdtran Networks (formerly ADVA Optical Networking SE)\nOn August 30, 2021, ADTRAN, Inc. and Adtran Networks (then known as ADVA Optical Networking SE) entered into a Business\nCombination Agreement, pursuant to which both companies agreed to combine their respective businesses and each become\nsubsidiaries of a new holding company, ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as Acorn HoldCo, Inc.), which was formed as a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of ADTRAN, Inc. in order to consummate the transactions under the Business Combination Agreement.\nUnder the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, on July 8, 2022, Acorn MergeCo, Inc, a Delaware corporation and wholly-\nowned direct subsidiary of the Company, merged with and into ADTRAN, Inc., with ADTRAN, Inc. surviving the Business\nCombination as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the Company.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, on July 15, 2022, the Company made a public offer to exchange each\nissued and outstanding no-par value bearer share of Adtran Networks for 0.8244 shares of Company Common Stock, par value $0.01\nper share of the Company. The Exchange Offer was settled on July 15, 2022 (the \"Exchange Offer Settlement Date\"), on which date\nthe Company acquired 33,957,538 bearer shares of Adtran Networks, or 65.43% of Adtran Networks’ outstanding bearer shares as of\nthe Exchange Offer Settlement Date, in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of 27,994,595 shares of Company Common Stock.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, Adtran Networks stock option holders were entitled to have their\nAdtran Networks stock options assumed by ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. (applying the exchange ratio in the Business Combination\nAgreement), thereafter representing options to acquire stock of ADTRAN, Holdings, Inc. The fair value of the Adtran Networks stock\noptions assumed by ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. was $12.8 million, estimated using the Monte Carlo method.\nADTRAN, Inc. and Adtran Networks became subsidiaries of ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. as a result of the Business Combination.\nADTRAN, Inc. was determined to be the accounting acquirer of Adtran Networks based on ADTRAN, Inc. shareholders’ majority\nequity stake in the combined company, the composition of the board of directors and senior management of the combined company,\namong other factors. The Business Combination with Adtran Networks has been accounted for using the acquisition method of\naccounting as per the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”). The Business\nCombination Agreement used a fixed exchange ratio of Company Common Stock for Adtran Networks shares of common stock,\nwhich resulted in a 36.0% equity stake for Adtran Networks stockholders and a 64.0% equity stake for ADTRAN, Inc. stockholders in\nthe post-closing combined company (calculated on a fully diluted basis and utilizing the tender of 65.43% of Adtran Networks’ current\nissued and outstanding share capital) as of July 15, 2022. Therefore, ADTRAN, Inc. shareholders continued to hold a majority interest\nin the combined company following the completion of the Business Combination. Additionally, following the transaction, the Board of\nDirectors was comprised of six members from ADTRAN, Inc. and three members from Adtran Networks; the ADTRAN, Inc. chief\nexecutive officer became and continues to act as the chairman of the Board of Directors and the former Adtran Networks chief\nexecutive officer became the vice chairman of the Board of Directors. Additionally, the ADTRAN, Inc. chief executive officer and\nADTRAN, Inc. chief financial officer held these positions within the combined company immediately following the completion of the\nBusiness Combination. Based upon these and other considerations as outlined in ASC 805, ADTRAN, Inc. represented the accounting\nacquirer.\nThe following table summarizes the purchase price for the Adtran Networks business combination:\n94\n(In thousands, except shares, share price and exchange ratio) Purchase Price\nAdtran Networks shares exchanged 33,957,538\nExchange ratio 0.8244\nADTRAN Holdings, Inc. shares issued 27,994,595\nADTRAN Holdings, Inc. share price on July 15, 2022 $ 20.20\nPurchase price paid for Adtran Networks shares $ 565,491\nEquity compensation (1) $ 12,769\nTotal purchase price $ 578,260\n(1) Represents the portion of replacement share-based payment awards that relates to pre-combination vesting.\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at their respective fair values as of July 15, 2022. In determining the fair\nvalue, the Company utilized various methods of the income, cost and market approaches depending on the asset or liability being fair\nvalued. The estimation of fair value required significant judgment related to future net cash flows reflecting the risk inherent in each\ncash flow stream, competitive trends, market comparables and other factors. Inputs were generally determined by taking into account\nhistorical data, current and anticipated market conditions, and growth rates.\nDeveloped technology and customer relationships were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method. Backlog was valued\nusing the distributor method. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis for (i) developed technology were the\nrevenue growth rates, long-term revenue growth rate, discount rate, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\n(“EBITDA”) margins, obsolescence factors, income tax rate, tax depreciation, and economic depreciation; (ii) customer relationships\nwere earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”) margins, contributory asset charges, and customer attrition rate; and (iii) backlog\nwere EBIT margins, adjusted EBIT margins, and contributory asset charges.\nThe allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was subject to adjustment within the measurement\nperiod (up to one year from the acquisition date). The measurement period adjustments since initial preliminary estimates resulted\nfrom changes to the fair value estimates of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on finalizing the valuations of inventory,\nprepaid expenses and other current assets, property plant and equipment, intangible assets, other non-current assets and deferred tax\nassets and liabilities. The cumulative effect of all measurement period adjustments resulted in a decrease to recognized goodwill of\n$8.7 million.\n95\nThe following table summarizes the final purchase price allocation for each major class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in\nthe Business Combination (in thousands):\n(cid:0)(cid:3)\n(In thousands)\n(cid:0)(cid:3)\nTotal purchase price (cid:0)(cid:3) $ 578,260\nNon-controlling interest (cid:0)(cid:3) $ 316,415\nNet Assets: (cid:0)(cid:3)\nCash and cash equivalents (cid:0)(cid:3) $ 44,003\nAccounts receivable (cid:0)(cid:3) 114,659\nOther receivables (cid:0)(cid:3) 1,457\nInventory (cid:0)(cid:3) 200,331\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets (cid:0)(cid:3) 28,208\nProperty plant and equipment (cid:0)(cid:3) 55,480\nDeferred tax assets (cid:0)(cid:3) 1,759\nIdentifiable intangible assets (cid:0)(cid:3) 403,780\nOther non-current assets (cid:0)(cid:3) 31,074\nAccounts payable (cid:0)(cid:3) (98,587)\nCurrent unearned revenue (cid:0)(cid:3) (26,047)\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities (cid:0)(cid:3) (59,600)\nIncome tax payable, net (cid:0)(cid:3) (4,898)\nCurrent portion of notes payable (cid:0)(cid:3) (25,254)\nTax liabilities (cid:0)(cid:3) (1,400)\nNon-current unearned revenue (cid:0)(cid:3) (11,498)\nPension liability (cid:0)(cid:3) (6,820)\nOther non-current liabilities (cid:0)(cid:3) (6,094)\nNon-current portion of revolving credit agreements and notes payable (cid:0)(cid:3) (15,250)\nNon-current lease obligations (cid:0)(cid:3) (20,046)\nDeferred tax liabilities (cid:0)(cid:3) (61,040)\nTotal net assets acquired (cid:0)(cid:3) $ 544,217\nGoodwill (cid:0)(cid:3) $ 350,458\nThe fair value of the assets acquired included accounts receivable of $114.7 million and other receivables of $1.5 million as of the date\nof the Business Combination. The unpaid principal balance under these receivables as of the date of the Business Combination was\n$118.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The difference between the fair value and the unpaid principal balance represents an\nallowance for credit losses that was factored into the fair value calculation as of the date of the Business Combination.\nThe fair value of the identifiable intangible assets acquired as of the acquisition date:\nEstimated-average useful\n(In thousands) life (in years) (1) Fair value Income Statement Amortization Classification\nDeveloped technology 8.5 $ 291,925 Cost of revenue - Network Solutions\nBacklog 1.4 52,165 Cost of revenue - Network Solutions and Services & Support\nCustomer relationships 10.5 32,704 Selling, general and administrative expenses\nTrade name 2.8 26,986 Selling, general and administrative expenses\nTotal $ 403,780\n(1) Determination of the weighted average period of the individual categories of intangible assets was based on the nature of the\napplicable intangible asset and the expected future cash flows to be derived from the intangible asset. Amortization of intangible assets\nwith definite lives is recognized over the period of time the assets are expected to contribute to future cash flows.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The\nBusiness Combination resulted in the recognition of goodwill of $350.5 million, which the Company believes is attributable to the\nvalue driven by the Company’s expected growth of the business, synergies, and expanded market and product opportunities. Goodwill\ncreated as a result of the Business Combination is not deductible for tax purposes.\nAfter the Business Combination, the chief operating decision maker assessed and will continue to assess the Company’s performance\nand allocate resources to its two segments (1) Network Solutions and (2) Services & Support. The goodwill resulting from the\nBusiness Combination of $272.8 million was allocated to the Network Solutions segment, and $77.7 million was allocated to the\nServices & Support segment. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this report for more\ninformation about the Company’s segments.\n96\n\nAs of the acquisition date, the fair value of the non-controlling interest was approximately $316.4 million and determined using a\nmarket approach. As a portion of Adtran Networks' shares remains trading after the Business Combination, the non-controlling interest\nwas calculated using 17,941,496 Adtran Networks shares held by non-controlling interest multiplied by the Adtran Networks closing\nshare price of €17.58 ($17.64 using the July 15, 2022 EUR to USD conversion rate of $1.00318) on July 15, 2022.\nThe Company has included the financial results of Adtran Networks in its consolidated financial statements since July 15, 2022, the\nacquisition date. The net revenue from the Adtran Networks business for the Adtran Networks business for the period from July 15,\n2022 through December 31, 2022, was $365.9 million and the net loss from the Adtran Networks business for the period from July 15,\n2022 through December 31, 2022, was $12.9 million which are included in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Loss. The net\nrevenue from the Adtran Networks business for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $666.3 million and the net loss from the\nAdtran Networks business for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $93.6 million which are included in the Company’s\nConsolidated Statement of Loss. The net (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interest from the Adtran Networks business for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $8.4 million and ($6.9) million, respectively. For the year ended December 31,\n2023, we recognized $11.5 million, representing the portion of the annual recurring cash compensation to the non-controlling\nshareholders accrued during such periods, which will be paid after the ordinary general shareholders' meeting of Adtran Networks\nbeginning in 2024. See Note 1 and Note 17 for additional information on RNCI and the annual dividend.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has incurred $26.2 million of transaction costs related to the Business Combination, of which\n$0.1 million, $14.2 million and $11.9 million were incurred during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThese transaction costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Loss.\nSupplemental Pro Forma Information (Unaudited)\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations for ADTRAN, Inc.\nand Adtran Networks as though the Business Combination had occurred on January 1, 2021. The pro forma amounts have been\nadjusted for differences in basis of accounting which are determined before taking into effect the impacts of purchase accounting and\nBusiness Combination accounting impacts.\nThe following unaudited pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only. It is not necessarily indicative of the results\nof operations of future periods, the results of operations that actually would have been realized had the entities been a single company\nas of January 1, 2021, or the future operating results of the combined entities. The unaudited pro forma information does not give\neffect to the potential impact of current financial conditions, regulatory matters or any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or\ncost savings that may be associated with the acquisition. The unaudited pro forma information also does not include any integration\ncosts that the Company has incurred and may continue to incur related to the Business Combination as part of combining the\noperations of the companies.\n(cid:0)(cid:3) For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands) 2022 2021\nRevenue $ 1,410,296 $ 1,210,201\nNet loss attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. $ (46,204) $ (91,423)\nNote 3 - Revenue\nThe following is a description of the principal activities from which revenue is generated by reportable segment:\nNetwork Solutions Segment - Includes hardware and software products that enable a digital future which support the Company's\nSubscriber, Access and Aggregation, and Optical Networking Solutions.\nServices & Support Segment - Includes network design, implementation, maintenance and cloud-hosted services supporting the\nCompany's Subscriber, Access and Aggregation, and Optical Networking Solutions.\nRevenue by Category\nIn addition to operating under two reportable segments, the Company also reports revenue across three categories – Subscriber\nSolutions, Access & Aggregation Solutions and Optical Networking Solutions.\n97\nPrior to the Business Combination with Adtran Networks on July 15, 2022, ADTRAN, Inc. reported revenue across the following\nthree categories: (1) Access & Aggregation, (2) Subscriber Solutions & Experience and (3) Traditional & Other Products. Following\nthe Business Combination with Adtran Networks, we have recast these revenues such that ADTRAN, Inc.'s former Access &\nAggregation revenue is combined with a portion of the applicable Adtran Networks solutions to create Access & Aggregation\nSolutions, ADTRAN’s former Subscriber Solutions & Experience revenue is combined with a portion of the applicable Adtran\nNetworks solutions to create Subscriber Solutions, and the revenue from Traditional & Other products is now included in the\napplicable Access & Aggregation Solutions or Subscriber Solutions category.

Total accounts receivables factored as of the end of December 31, 2022,\ntotaled $14.9 million of which $1.2 million was retained pursuant to the Factoring Agreement in the reserve account. As of December\n31, 2023 no accounts receivable were factored under the agreement or held in the reserve account. The cost of receivables purchase\nagreement is included in interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Loss and totaled $0.9 million and $0.3 million for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nOn December 19, 2023, the agreement with the Factor was terminated and the Company, entered into a receivables purchase\nagreement with a third-party financial institution (the “New Factor”) to replace the Company’s prior accounts receivable purchase\nagreement and to sell, on a revolving basis, undivided interests in the Company’s accounts receivable.

No additional awards will be granted under the Company’s previous stock incentive plans, the ADTRAN, Inc. 2015\nEmployee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2015 Employee Plan”) or the 2010 Directors Stock Plan (the “2010 Directors Plan”) subsequent\nto the stockholders’ approval of these new stock plans. Outstanding awards granted under the 2015 Employee Plan and the 2010\nDirectors Plan will remain subject to the terms of such plans, and shares underlying awards granted under such plans that are cancelled\nor forfeited will be available for issuance under the 2020 Employee Plan or the 2020 Directors Plan, as applicable.\n99\n\nUnder the 2020 Employee Plan, the Company is authorized to issue 2.8 million shares of common stock to certain employees, key\nService Providers and advisors through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs and\nrestricted stock, any of which may be subject to performance-based conditions. RSUs and restricted stock granted under the 2020\nEmployee Plan will typically vest pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. Stock\noptions granted under the 2020 Employee Plan will typically become exercisable beginning after one year of continued employment,\nnormally pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and have a ten-year contractual\nterm. Stock options, RSUs and restricted stock granted under the 2020 Employee Plan reduce the shares authorized for issuance under\nthe 2020 Employee Plan by one share of common stock for each share underlying the award. Forfeitures, cancellations or expirations\nof awards granted under the 2015 Employee Plan increase the shares authorized for issuance under the 2020 Employee Plan, with\nforfeitures, cancellations or expirations of RSUs and restricted stock increasing the shares authorized for issuance by 2.5 shares of\ncommon stock for each share underlying the award. Forfeitures, cancellations or expirations of stock options from the 2015 Employee\nPlan increase the shares authorized for issuance under the 2020 Employee Plan by one share of common stock for each share\nunderlying the award.\nUnder the 2020 Directors Plan, the Company is authorized to issue 0.4 million shares of common stock through stock options,\nrestricted stock and RSUs to non-employee directors. Stock awards issued under the 2020 Directors Plan typically will become vested\nin full on the first anniversary of the grant date. Stock options issued under the 2020 Directors Plan will have a ten-year contractual\nterm. Stock options, restricted stock and RSUs granted under the 2020 Directors Plan reduce the shares authorized for issuance under\nthe 2020 Directors Plan by one share of common stock for each share underlying the award. Forfeitures, cancellations and expirations\nof awards granted under the 2010 Directors Stock Plan increase the shares authorized for issuance under the 2020 Directors Plan by\none share of common stock for each share underlying the award.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 1.1 million shares were available for issuance under shareholder-approved equity plans in connection with\nthe grant and exercise of stock options, PSU’s, RSU’s or restricted stock.\nPrevious Stock Incentive Plans\nIn January 2015, the Board of Directors adopted the 2015 Employee Plan, which authorized 7.7 million shares of common stock for\nissuance to certain employees and officers through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock. The 2015 Employee Plan was adopted by stockholder approval at our annual meeting of\nstockholders held in May 2015. PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock granted under the 2015 Plan reduce the shares authorized for\nissuance under the 2015 Employee Plan by 2.5 shares of common stock for each share underlying the award. Options granted under\nthe 2015 Employee Plan typically become exercisable beginning after one year of continued employment, normally pursuant to a four-\nyear vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and have a ten-year contractual term. Expiration dates of\noptions outstanding as of December 31, 2023 under the 2015 Employee Plan range from 2024 to 2029.\nIn January 2006, the Board of Directors adopted the ADTRAN, Inc. 2006 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”), which\nauthorized 13.0 million shares of common stock for issuance to officers and certain employees through incentive stock options and\nnon-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs and restricted stock. Options granted under the 2006 Plan typically\nbecome exercisable beginning after one year of continued employment, normally pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning\non the first anniversary of the grant date and had a ten-year contractual term. The 2006 Plan was replaced in May 2015 by the 2015\nEmployee Plan. Options outstanding as of December 31, 2023 under the 2006 Plan expire in 2024.\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock - ADTRAN Holdings, Inc.\nThe following table is a summary of our PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2023 and the\nchanges that occurred during 2023:\nWeighted\nNumber of Average Grant\nshares (In Date Fair Value\nthousands) (Per Share)\nUnvested PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding, December 31, 2022 1,086 $ 17.54\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock granted 1,509 $ 16.43\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock vested (501) $ 14.67\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock forfeited (152) $ 17.04\nUnvested PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding, December 31, 2023 1,942 $ 17.46\n100\nThe following table details the significant assumptions that impact the fair value estimate of the market-based PSUs:\n2023 2022 2021\nEstimated fair value per share $ 19.26 $ 24.01 $ 26.07\nExpected volatility 51.52% 45.77% 53.27%\nRisk-free interest rate 3.93% 4.28% 0.85%\nExpected dividend yield 2.55% 1.76% 1.63%\nFor market-based PSUs, the number of shares of common stock earned by a recipient is subject to a market condition based on\nADTRAN’s relative total shareholder return against all companies in the NASDAQ Telecommunications Index at the end of a three-\nyear performance period. Depending on the relative total shareholder return over the performance period, the recipient may earn from\n0% to 150% of the shares underlying the PSUs, with the shares earned distributed upon the vesting. The fair value of the award is\nbased on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the expected outcome of the impact of market\nconditions using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method. A portion of the granted PSUs vests and the underlying shares become\ndeliverable upon the death or disability of the recipient or upon a change of control of ADTRAN, as defined by the 2020 Employee\nPlan. The recipients of the PSUs receive dividend credits based on the shares of common stock underlying the PSUs. The dividend\ncredits vest and are earned in the same manner as the PSUs and are paid in cash upon the issuance of common stock for the PSUs.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company granted 0.9 million performance-based PSUs to its executive officers and\ncertain employees. The grant-date fair value of these performance-based awards was based on the closing price of the Company’s\nstock on the date of grant. These awards vest over either a two or three-year period, subject to the grantee’s continued employment,\nwith the ability to earn shares in a range of 0% to either 100% or 150% of the awarded number of PSUs based on the achievement of\ndefined performance targets. Equity-based compensation expense and liabilities with respect to these awards may be adjusted over the\nvesting period to reflect the probability of achievement of performance targets defined in the award agreements.\nDuring each of the years ended December 2022 and 2021, the Company granted 0.3 million performance-based PSUs to its executive\nofficers and certain employees. The grant-date fair value of these performance-based awards was based on the closing price of the\nCompany’s stock on the date of grant. These awards vested over one-year and two-year periods, respectively, subject to the grantee’s\ncontinued employment, with the ability to earn shares in a range of 0% to 142.8% of the awarded number of PSUs based on the\nachievement of defined performance targets. Equity-based compensation expense with respect to these awards may be adjusted over\nthe vesting period to reflect the probability of achievement of performance targets defined in the award agreements. Pursuant to the\nBusiness Combination, the unearned performance-based PSUs converted to time-based RSUs which were treated as an award\nmodification during the third quarter of 2022. This resulted in incremental compensation expense totaling $17.8 million being\nrecognized during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. These awards were fully vested as of December 31, 2022.\nPursuant to the Business Combination, 0.3 million shares of market-based PSU awards converted to time-based RSU awards which\nwere treated as an award modification during the third quarter of 2022. Given that the fair value of these awards after the modification\nwas less than the fair value of the awards immediately before the modification, no incremental compensation expense was recognized.\nThe Company continued to recognize compensation expense based on the award's original grant date fair value.\nThe fair value of RSUs and restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the grant date. RSUs and restricted stock vest\nratably over four-year and one-year periods, respectively.\nWe will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation.\nIf circumstances change, and additional data becomes available over time, we may change our assumptions and methodologies, which\nmay materially impact our fair value determination.\nAs of December 31, 2023, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the non-vested portion of market-based PSUs, RSUs\nand restricted stock was approximately $15.5 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition\nperiod of 2.1 years. There was $10.5 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested 2023 performance-based\nPSUs, which will be recognized over the remaining requisite service period of 2.0 years if achievement of the performance obligation\nbecomes probable. Unrecognized compensation expense will be adjusted for actual forfeitures as they occur.\n101\nStock Options - ADTRAN Holdings, Inc.\nThe following table is a summary of stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the changes that occurred\nduring 2023:\nWeighted Weighted Average\nNumber of Average Remaining Aggregate\nOptions Exercise Price Contractual Life Intrinsic(cid:0)(cid:3)Value\n(In thousands) (Per share) in Years (In thousands)\nStock options outstanding, December 31, 2022 3,148 $ 14.37 3.42 $ 16,251\nStock options granted 1,330 $ 5.27\nStock options exercised (23) $ 7.02\nStock options forfeited (74) $ 11.20\nStock options expired (487) $ 22.74\nStock options outstanding, December 31, 2023 3,894 $ 10.32 5.25 $ 3,087\nStock options exercisable, December 31, 2023 1,478 $ 12.47 1.62 $ 254\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was $8.1 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options which will be\nrecognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 1.8 years.\nPursuant to the Business Combination, which closed on July 15, 2022, Adtran Networks stock option holders were entitled to have\ntheir Adtran Networks stock options assumed by ADTRAN Holdings (applying the exchange ratio in the Business Combination\nAgreement), thereafter representing options to acquire stock of ADTRAN Holdings. The maximum number of shares of ADTRAN\nHoldings stock potentially issuable upon such assumption was 2.3 million shares. The period in which such options could be assumed\nended July 22, 2022. A total of 2.1 million shares of ADTRAN Holdings stock are subject to assumed Adtran Networks options.\nAs part of our Business Efficiency Program, on October 25, 2023, all employees were informed of certain personnel measures, which\nincluded the reduction of salary for select employees. The Company provided the employees subject to the salary reductions with 1.3\nmillion of stock option awards for retention purposes. Our Chief Executive Officer voluntarily reduced his salary by 50% and did not\nreceive any awards under the Business Efficiency Program.\nThe determination of the fair value of stock options assumed or granted by ADTRAN Holdings was estimated using the Monte Carlo\nmethod and is affected by its stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables that may\nhave a significant impact on the fair value estimate. The stock option pricing model requires the use of several assumptions that\nimpact the fair value estimate. These variables include, but are not limited to, the volatility of the Company's stock price and employee\nexercise behaviors.\nAll of the options were previously issued at exercise prices that approximated fair market value at the date of grant.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of stock options represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between ADTRAN’s closing\nstock price on the last trading day of the quarter and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would\nhave been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on December 31, 2023. The amount of\naggregate intrinsic value was $3.1 million as of December 31, 2023 and will change based on the fair market value of ADTRAN’s\nstock. The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $0.1\nmillion, $4.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The fair value of options fully vesting during the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022 was $1.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively.

Market prices are\nobtained from a variety of industry standard data providers, large financial institutions and other third-party sources. These multiple\nmarket prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily market value of each security.\nThe fair value of Level 3 securities is calculated based on unobservable inputs. Quantitative information with respect to unobservable\ninputs consisted of third-party valuations performed in accordance with ASC 820 – Fair Value Measurement. Inputs used in preparing\nthe third-party valuation included the following assumptions, among others: estimated discount rates and fair market yields.\nOur variable rate demand notes have a structure that implies a standard expected market price.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our inventory reserve was $83.1\nmillion and $57.0 million, respectively.\nIn connection with the Company’s restructuring efforts, for the year ended December 31, 2023, management determined that there\nwould be a discontinuation of product lines in the Network solutions segment and, as a result, wrote-down related inventories of $24.3\nmillion, which is included in cost of revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Loss.\nNote 7 – Property, Plant and Equipment\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, property, plant and equipment, net was comprised of the following:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nEngineering and other equipment $ 183,336 $ 170,785\nBuilding 79,215 82,932\nComputer hardware and software 101,572 80,455\nBuilding and land improvements 58,238 47,861\nFurniture and fixtures 21,368 22,403\nLand 5,242 5,364\nTotal Property, Plant and Equipment 448,971 409,800\nLess: accumulated depreciation (325,951) (299,101)\nTotal Property, Plant and Equipment, net $ 123,020 $ 110,699\n106\nLong-lived assets used in operations are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset are less\nthan the asset’s carrying value. In connection with the planned integration of information technology following the Business\nCombination, we determined that certain projects no longer fit our needs or strategic plan. As a result, the Company recognized\nimpairment charges of $0.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 related to software and web site development. The\nimpairment charges were determined based on actual costs incurred. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2021, no\nimpairment charges were recognized.\nDepreciation expense was $30.2 million, $20.9 million and $12.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, which is recorded in cost of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development\nexpenses in the Consolidated Statements of Loss.\nNote 8 – Leases\nWe have operating leases for office space, automobiles and various other equipment in the U.S. and in certain international locations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our operating leases had remaining lease terms of two months to 116 months, some of which included\noptions to extend the leases for up to one year, and some of which included options to terminate the leases within three months.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases is as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n(In thousands) Classification 2023 2022\nAssets\nOperating lease assets Other non-current assets $ 37,474 $ 30,340\nTotal lease asset $ 37,474 $ 30,340\nLiabilities\nCurrent operating lease liability Accrued expenses and other liabilities $ 7,720 $ 7,596\nNon-current lease obligations Non-current lease obligations 31,420 22,807\nTotal lease liability $ 39,140 $ 30,403\nLease expense related to short-term leases was less than $0.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nand is included in cost of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the\nConsolidated Statements of Loss. Lease expense related to variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate, such as real\nestate taxes and insurance reimbursements, was $0.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31,\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe components of lease expense included in the Consolidated Statements of Loss were as follows:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nCost of revenue $ 163 $ 110 $ 51\nResearch and development expenses 990 942 1,071\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 9,708 3,961 883\nTotal operating lease expense $ 10,861 $ 5,013 $ 2,005\nAs of December 31, 2023, operating lease liabilities included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet by future maturity were as follows:\n(In thousands) Amount\n2024 9,639\n2025 8,423\n2026 6,608\n2027 4,923\n2028 4,723\nThereafter 13,210\nTotal lease payments 47,526\nLess: Interest (8,386)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 39,140\n107\n\nFuture operating lease payments include $3.3 million related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being\nexercised. There are no legally binding leases that have not yet commenced.\nAn incremental borrowing rate is used based on information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of\nlease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is determined on a portfolio basis by grouping leases with similar terms, as well as\ngrouping leases based on a U.S. dollar or euro functional currency. The following table provides information about our weighted\naverage lease terms and weighted average discount rates:\nAs of December 31,\nWeighted average remaining lease term (years) 2023 2022\nOperating leases with USD functional currency 8.1 7.9\nOperating leases with EUR functional currency 5.8 4.2\nWeighted average discount rate\nOperating leases with USD functional currency 3.70% 3.77%\nOperating leases with EUR functional currency 3.92% 3.70%\nNote 9 – Goodwill\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2023 are as follows:\n(In thousands) Network Solutions Services & Support Total\nAs of December 31, 2022 $ 298,280 $ 83,444 $ 381,724\nGoodwill impairment — (37,500) (37,500)\nCorrection of a purchase allocation adjustment (9,662) 9,662 —\nForeign currency translation adjustments 8,413 778 9,191\nAs of December 31, 2023 $ 297,031 $ 56,384 $ 353,415\nDue to the Company's decreased market capitalization and long-term projections, a reassessment of our estimated future undiscounted\ncash flows within our two identified reporting units was triggered. Therefore an interim impairment test over goodwill was performed\nas of September 30, 2023. The Company determined the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of an income approach\nand a market based peer group analysis. Management’s determination of the fair value of our reporting units, based on future cash\nflows for the reporting units, requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions related to cash flow projections,\ndiscount rate, peer group determination and market multiple selection. It was determined that the decreases in projected future cash\nflows, discount rates, overall macroeconomic conditions, as well as the decrease in our market capitalization applied in the valuation,\nwere required to align with market-based assumptions and company-specific risk, which resulted in lower fair values of the Services\n& Support reporting unit. As a result of the interim assessment, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $37.9 million\nas its estimated fair value was less than its book value on that date.\nThe Company’s annual impairment test date is October 1, 2023. The Company concluded that there was no goodwill impairment as of\nthat date as there was no change in enterprise value from the September 30, 2023 testing date. Between the annual impairment date of\nOctober 1, 2023 and year-end December 31, 2023, there were no additional triggering events.\nAs of December 31, 2023, accumulated goodwill impairment losses in total were $37.9 million. There were no accumulated goodwill\nimpairment losses as of December 31, 2022. No impairment charges on goodwill were recognized during the years ended December\n31, 2022 and 2021.\n108\nNote 10 – Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, consisted of the following:\n2023 2022\nWeighted\nAverage Useful\nLife Accumulated Accumulated\n(In thousands) (in years) Gross Value Amortization Net Value Gross Value Amortization Net Value\nCustomer relationships 10.9 $ 54,856 $ (15,943) $ 38,913 $ 53,847 $ (11,102) $ 42,745\nBacklog 1.6 57,391 (52,022) 5,369 55,782 (22,725) 33,057\nDeveloped technology 8.5 329,369 (61,271) 268,098 320,364 (21,856) 298,508\nLicensed technology 9.0 5,900 (3,797) 2,103 5,900 (3,141) 2,759\nLicensing agreements 8.5 560 (368) 192 560 (298) 262\nPatents 7.3 500 (500) — 500 (431) 69\nTrade names 3.0 29,689 (16,379) 13,310 28,856 (5,045) 23,811\nTotal $ 478,265 $ (150,280) $ 327,985 $ 465,809 $ (64,598) $ 401,211\nThe Company evaluates impairment at the reporting unit level, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount of assets within a reporting unit may not be recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the\nassets are less than the reporting units carrying value.

The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Derivatives are\ninitially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at\nthe end of each reporting period. All changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized as other income, net in the\nConsolidated Statements of Loss. The derivative instruments are not subject to master netting agreements and are not offset in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. We are exposed to risk from credit-related losses resulting from nonperformance by counterparties to\nour financial instruments. We perform credit evaluations of our counterparties under forward exchange contracts and expect all\ncounterparties to meet their obligations. We have not experienced credit losses from our counterparties.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had 47 forward rate contracts outstanding.\nForeign Currency Hedging Agreement\nOn November 3, 2022, the Company entered into a euro/U.S. dollar forward contract arrangement (the \"Initial Forward\") with Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A. (the “Hedge Counterparty”). The Initial Forward, which is governed by the provisions of an ISDA Master\nAgreement (including schedules thereto and transaction confirmations that supplement such agreement) entered into between the\nCompany and the Hedge Counterparty, enable the Company to convert a portion of its euro denominated payment obligations under\nthe proposed DPLTA into U.S. Dollars. Under the Initial Forward, the Company agreed to exchange an aggregate notional amount of\n€160.0 million for U.S. dollars at a daily fixed forward rate ranging from $1.0141 to $1.0305. The aggregate amount of €160.0 million\nis divided into eight quarterly tranches of €20.0 million, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2022. During the twelve months\nended December 31, 2023, the Company settled four €20.0 million forward contract tranches and the remaining amount will be\ndivided into four quarterly tranches of €20.0 million over the course of 2024. The Company, at its sole discretion, may exchange all or\npart of each tranche on any given day within the applicable quarter; provided, however, that it must exchange the full tranche by the\nend of such quarter.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company settled four $20.0 million\nforward contract tranches and the remaining amount will be divided into four quarterly tranches of $20.0 million. These forward\ncontracts were executed on March 21, 2023 (to sell EUR/buy USD) and were entered into for the purpose of unwinding the Initial\nForward (to buy EUR/sell USD). The drawdown dates of the Initial Forward are set to the same date as the maturity of the new\noffsetting Forward.\nThe fair values of the Company's derivative instruments recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31,\n2023 were as follows:\nBalance Sheet\n(In thousands) Location December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments (Level 2):\nForeign exchange contracts – derivative assets Other receivables $ 7,125 $ 11,992\nForeign exchange contracts – derivative liabilities Accounts payable $ (2,277) $ (633)\nTotal derivatives $ 4,848 $ 11,359\nThe change in the fair values of the Company's derivative instruments recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Loss\nduring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nIncome Statement\n(In thousands) Location 2023 2022 2021\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging\nInstruments:\nForeign exchange contracts Other income, net $ 758 $ 10,793 $ —\n110\nNote 12 – Revolving Credit Agreements\nThe carrying amounts of the Company's revolving credit agreements in its Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\nAs of December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nWells Fargo credit agreement $ 195,000 $ 60,000\nNord/LB revolving line of credit — 16,091\nSyndicated credit agreement working capital line of credit — 10,727\nDZ bank revolving line of credit — 9,118\nTotal revolving credit agreements $ 195,000 $ 95,936\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the estimated fair value of our revolving credit agreements, approximates the carrying value.

unsecured revolving line of credit with Norddeutsche Landesbark -\nGirozentrale (Nord/LB) that bears interest of Euro Short Term Rate plus 1.94%. The line of credit had a perpetual term that could be\nterminated by the Company or Nord/LB at any time. As of December 31, 2023, the Company repaid the outstanding borrowing and\nterminated the line of credit.\nPrior Nord/LB Revolving Line of Credit\nOn August 8, 2022, Adtran Networks entered into a $16.1 million revolving line of credit with Norddeutsche Landesbark -\nGirozentrale (Nord/LB) that bears interest of Euro Short Term Rate plus 1.4% and matured in August 2023. On January 31, 2023, the\nCompany repaid the outstanding borrowings under the Nord/LB revolving line of credit and terminated the line of credit.\nSyndicated Credit Agreement Working Capital Line of Credit\nIn September 2018, Adtran Networks entered into a syndicated credit agreement with Bayerische Landesbank and Deutsche Bank AG\nBranch German Business to borrow up to $10.7 million as part of a working capital line of credit. On January 31, 2023, the Company\nrepaid the outstanding borrowings and terminated the syndicated credit agreement working capital line of credit.\nDZ Bank Revolving Line of Credit\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, Adtran Networks entered into a revolving line of credit with DZ Bank to borrow up to $9.1 million.\nInterest on the line of credit reset monthly based on renewal of the loan and was 2.8% at the time the loan was repaid.

Subsequently,\nthe Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) released its final GILTI regulations on July 9, 2020. The passage of the CARES Act and\nsubsequent issuance of the GILTI final regulations together resulted in the Company’s recognition of a tax benefit in the amount of\n$10.8 million during 2020, $7.9 million of which related to the utilization of deferred tax assets which had previously been offset with\na valuation allowance and $2.9 million primarily related to the tax rate differential on carrying back losses from 2018 and 2019 tax\nyears to prior years in which the U.S. Corporate tax rate was 35% versus the current 21% federal tax rate.\nOn February 12, 2021, the Alabama Business Tax Competitiveness Act (the \"Alabama Act\") was signed into law. As a result of the\nAlabama Act, we recognized an expense of $1.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021 related to the revaluation of our\ndeferred tax assets, which was offset by changes in our valuation allowance previously recorded against our domestic deferred tax\nassets.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2021, Management decided to pursue a claim for refund related to the revocation of our\nIRC Section 59(e) election that was made on our originally filed 2018 U.S. federal tax return. The Company filed a related carryback\nclaim of net operating losses generated in 2018 to prior years as allowed under the CARES Act that was passed in 2020. An IRS\nSection 59(e) election is generally non-revocable except in cases for which IRS Commissioner’s approval is given. Approval is\ngranted only in rare and unusual circumstances. We filed a private letter ruling (“PLR”) request to revoke our election. During the\nthree months ended December 31, 2021, a response to our PLR was published denying our request to revoke the previously made\n59(e). As a result of these filings, and Management’s initial position was to pursue them through appeals; therefore, we have\nestablished a receivable in the amount of $15.2 million and a deferred tax asset related to additional research and development credit\ncarryforward in the amount of $1.8 million that would be available if our revocation request is successful, offset with an uncertain tax\nliability of $17.0 million. As of the year ended December 31, 2023, management no longer wishes to pursue the appeals process;\ntherefore, the receivable, the deferred tax asset and the offsetting uncertain tax liability have been released.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, non-current deferred taxes reflected deferred taxes on net unrealized gains and losses on\navailable-for-sale investments and deferred taxes on unrealized losses in our pension plan. The net change in non-current deferred\ntaxes associated with these items, which resulted in a deferred tax benefit of $0.3 million and $2.0 million in 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, was recorded as an adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), presented in the Consolidated Statements of\nComprehensive Income (Loss).\n115\n\nThe Company continually reviews the adequacy of our valuation allowance and recognizes the benefits of deferred tax assets only as\nthe reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in accordance with ASC 740,\nIncome Taxes (ASC 740). Due to our recent decrease in revenue and profitability for 2023 and all other positive and negative objective\nevidence considered as part of our analysis, our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as projections for future growth is\nlimited when evaluating whether our deferred tax assets will be realized. As such, the Company is no longer able to conclude that it is\nmore likely than not that our domestic deferred tax assets will be realized and a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax\nassets was established in the fourth quarter of 2023. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be\nadjusted in future periods in the event sufficient evidence is present to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or a\nportion of our domestic deferred tax assets will be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had gross deferred tax assets totaling $76.7 million offset by a valuation allowance\ntotaling $86.6 million and gross deferred tax assets totaling $11.4 million offset by a valuation allowance of $5.2 million, respectively.\nOf the current valuation allowance, $84.8 million was established against our domestic deferred tax assets and the remaining $1.8\nmillion is related to foreign net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards where we lacked sufficient activity\nto realize those deferred tax assets. The change in our valuation allowance for the year ending December 31, 2023 was an increase of\n$81.4 million. The change in the valuation allowance was primarily related to the previously mentioned establishment of the valuation\nallowance in the fourth quarter of 2023. The large increase during the year in our international deferred tax liabilities was primarily\nrelated to purchase price accounting, partially offset with acquired deferred tax assets as a result of the Adtran Networks acquisition,\nthat was completed in the third quarter of 2022.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3)\nDecember 31, 2023\nDeferred Tax Assets\n(In thousands) Deferred Tax Assets (Liabilities) Valuation Allowance (Liabilities), net\nDomestic $ 101,120 $ (84,767) $ 16,353\nInternational (24,421) (1,800) (26,221)\nTotal $ 76,699 $ (86,567) $ (9,868)\n(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3)\nDecember 31, 2022\n(In thousands) Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance Deferred Tax Assets, net\nDomestic $ 61,726 $ (3,177) $ 58,549\nInternational (50,315) (2,024) (52,339)\nTotal $ 11,411 $ (5,201) $ 6,210\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the deferred tax assets for foreign and domestic loss carry-forwards, research and development\ntax credits, unamortized research and development costs and state credit carry-forwards totaled $135.1 million and $104.5 million,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2023, $87.2 million of these deferred tax assets will expire at various times between 2024 and 2039.\nThe remaining deferred tax assets will either amortize through 2039 or carryforward indefinitely.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, our cash and cash equivalents were $87.2 million and $108.6 million and short-term\ninvestments were $0.0 million and $0.3 million, which provided available short-term liquidity of $87.2 million and $108.9 million. Of\nthese amounts, our foreign subsidiaries held cash of $76.5 million and $86.3 million, respectively, representing approximately 88%\nand 79% of available short-term liquidity, which is used to fund ongoing liquidity needs of these subsidiaries. As part of our\nrestructuring plan, the Company’s assertion on being indefinitely reinvested changed in a particular jurisdiction in a previous year. The\nCompany has a withholding tax liability of $0.4 million and $0.4 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The\nCompany maintains its assertion in all other jurisdictions that it is indefinitely reinvesting its funds held in foreign jurisdictions outside\nof the U.S., except to the extent any of these funds can be repatriated without withholding tax. However, if all of these funds were\nrepatriated to the U.S., or used for U.S. operations, certain amounts could be subject to tax. Due to the timing and circumstances of\nrepatriation of such earnings, if any, it is not practicable to determine the amount of funds subject to unrecognized deferred tax\nliability.\nDuring 2023, 2022 and 2021, no income tax benefit or expense was recorded for stock options exercised as an adjustment to equity.\n116\nThe change in the unrecognized income tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nBalance at beginning of period $ 17,885 $ 17,836 $ 1,078\nIncreases for tax position related to:\nPrior years — — 17,025\nCurrent year 129 123 136\nDecreases for tax positions related to:\nPrior years (17,025) (13) (27)\nExpiration of applicable statute of limitations — (61) (376)\nBalance at end of period $ 989 $ 17,885 $ 17,836\nAs of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, our total liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $1.0 million, $17.9 million and $17.8\nmillion, respectively, of which $1.0 million, $17.9 million and $17.8 million, respectively, would reduce our effective tax rate if we\nwere successful in upholding all of the uncertain positions and recognized the amounts recorded. We classify interest and penalties\nrecognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the\nbalances of accrued interest and penalties were $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively.\nWe do not anticipate a single tax position generating a significant increase or decrease in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits\nwithin 12 months of this reporting date, unless a resolution is reached regarding the appeal of our PLR denial noted above. We file\nincome tax returns in the U.S. for federal and various state jurisdictions and several foreign jurisdictions. We are not currently under\naudit by the Internal Revenue Service. Generally, we are not subject to changes in income taxes by any taxing jurisdiction for the years\nprior to 2018.\nNote 15 – Employee Benefit Plans\nPension Benefit Plan\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries. Pension benefit plan obligations are\nbased on various assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates,\ncompensation rate increases, expected return on plan assets, retirement rates and mortality rates. Actual results that differ from the\nassumptions and changes in assumptions could affect future expenses and obligations. Details regarding the pension plans are set forth\nbelow.\n• In Germany, there is one defined benefit pension plan and one defined contribution plan. Both plans provide benefits in\nthe event of retirement, death or disability. The plan's benefits are based on age, years of service and salary. The defined\nbenefit plan is financed by contributions paid by the Company and the defined contribution plan is financed by\ncontributions paid by the participants.\n• In Switzerland, there are two defined benefit pension plans. Both plans provide benefits in the event of retirement, death\nor disability. The plan's benefits are based on age, years of service, salary and on a participant's old age account. The plans\nare financed by contributions paid by the participants and by the Company.\n• In Italy, the post-employment benefit plan is required due to statutory provisions. The plan is financed directly by the\nCompany on a pay as you go basis. Employees receive their pension payments as a function of salary, inflation and a\nnotional account.\n• In Israel, there is a defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits in the event of a participant being dismissed\ninvoluntarily, retirement or death. The plan's benefits are based on the higher of the severance benefit required by law or\nthe cash surrender value of the severance benefit component of any qualifying insurance policy or long-term employee\nbenefit fund that is registered in the participants name. The plan is financed by contributions paid by the Company.\n• In India, the post-employment benefit plan is required due to statutory provisions. The plan is financed directly by the\nCompany on a pay as you go basis.\n117\nThe pension benefit plan obligations and funded status as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nChange in projected benefit obligation:\nProjected benefit obligation at beginning of period $ 59,344 $ 73,779 (1)\nService cost 1,579 1,426\nInterest cost 1,851 1,168\nActuarial loss (gain) - experience 1,181 (2,039)\nActuarial loss (gain) - assumptions 1,791 (11,128)\nBenefit payments (1,966) (1,400)\nPlan amendments 966 —\nEffects of foreign currency exchange rate changes 3,151 (2,462)\nProjected benefit obligation at end of period 67,897 59,344\nChange in plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of period 48,720 55,084 (1)\nActual gain (loss) on plan assets 3,125 (4,372)\nContributions 1,215 382\nBenefit payments (231) —\nEffects of foreign currency exchange rate changes 2,389 (2,374)\nFair value of plan assets at end of period 55,218 48,720\nUnfunded status at end of period $ (12,679) $ (10,624)\n(1) In connection with the Business Combination, we acquired $29.6 million of additional projected benefit obligations and\n$22.3 million of plan assets whose beginning of period measurement date is July 15, 2022.\nThe accumulated benefit obligation was $67.1 million and $56.8 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The\ndecrease in the accumulated benefit obligation, projected benefit obligation and the actuarial loss was primarily attributable to an\nincrease in the discount rate during 2023.\nThe net amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the unfunded pension liability as of December 31, 2023 and 2022\nwere as follows:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nCurrent pension liability $ 136 $ —\nNon-current pension liability 12,543 10,624\nTotal $ 12,679 $ 10,624\nThe components of net periodic pension cost, other than the service cost component, are included in other income, net in the\nConsolidated Statements of Loss. The components of net periodic pension cost and amounts recognized in other comprehensive (loss)\nincome for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nNet periodic benefit cost:\nService cost $ 1,579 $ 1,426 $ 1,229\nInterest cost 1,851 1,168 339\nExpected return on plan assets (1,750) (2,129) (1,842)\nAmortization of actuarial losses 26 355 1,088\nNet periodic benefit cost 1,706 820 814\nOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations\nrecognized in other comprehensive income (loss):\nNet actuarial loss (gain) 2,304 (6,549) (4,984)\nAmortization of actuarial losses (145) (113) (825)\nAmount recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) 2,159 (6,662) (5,809)\nTotal recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other\ncomprehensive income (loss) $ 3,865 $ (5,842) $ (4,995)\n118\n\nThe amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nNet actuarial loss $ (3,231) $ (1,073)\nThe defined benefit pension plan is accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the use of various assumptions, including an\nexpected rate of return on plan assets and a discount rate. The expected return on our plan's assets is utilized in determining the benefit\nobligation and net periodic benefit cost is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies,\nanticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among\nthe asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and\nhistorical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return. The discount rate has been derived from the\nreturns of high-quality, corporate bonds denominated in euro currency with durations close to the duration of our pension obligations.\nThe weighted-average assumptions that were used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\nDiscount rate 2.84% 3.24% 1.16%\nRate of compensation increase 2.22% 2.17% 2.00%\nExpected long-term rates of return 4.83% 4.65% 5.90%\nThe weighted-average assumptions that were used to determine the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n2023 2022 2021\nDiscount rate 3.17% 3.10% 1.16%\nRate of compensation increase 2.22% 2.17% 2.00%\nActuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. To the extent unamortized gains and losses\nexceed 10% of the higher of the market-related value of assets or the projected benefit obligation, the excess is amortized as a\ncomponent of net periodic pension cost over the remaining service period of active participants.\nThe Company anticipates making approximately $2.2 million in contributions to the pension plans in 2024.\nThe following pension benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid to participants:\n(In thousands)\n2024 $ 2,851\n2025 3,725\n2026 3,183\n2027 3,683\n2028 3,313\n2029 - 2032 18,498\nTotal $ 35,253\nU.S. GAAP establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy based upon observable and unobservable inputs for fair value measurement of\nfinancial instruments:\n• Level 1 – Observable outputs; values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market;\n• Level 2 – Significant inputs that are observable; values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs\nthat are observable either directly or indirectly;\n• Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs; values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both\nunobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.

The\npolicy is established and administered in a manner that is compliant at all times with applicable government regulations.\n120\n401(k) Savings Plans\nWe maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. 401(k) Retirement Plan and the Adtran Networks SE 401(k) Retirement Plan (the “Savings Plans”)\nfor the benefit of eligible employees. The Savings Plans are intended to qualify under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and is intended to be a “safe harbor” 401(k) plan under Code Section 401(k)(12).\nThe Savings Plans allows employees to save for retirement by contributing part of their compensation to the plan on a tax-deferred\nbasis. The Savings Plans also requires us to contribute a “safe harbor” amount each year. In our legacy ADTRAN, Inc. plan, we match\nup to 4% of employee contributions (100% of an employee’s first 3% of contributions and 50% of their next 2% of contributions),\nbeginning on the employee’s one-year anniversary date. All matching contributions under the legacy ADTRAN, Inc. Savings Plan vest\nimmediately. In our legacy ADTRAN Networks, plan, we match up to 1.5% of employee contributions (25% of an employee's first 6%\nof contributions). All matching contributions under the legacy ADTRAN Networks Savings Plan vest ratably over five years\nbeginning on the employee's one-year anniversary date. In addition, under the legacy ADTRAN Networks plan, an annual matching\nemployer contribution is made which is based on the Company's achievement against a yearly relative Pro-forma EBIT target which\ncan range from no additional match up to an additional 50% match. In calculating our matching contributions, compensation up to the\nstatutory maximum under the Code is used ($330,000 for 2023). Employer contribution expense and plan administration costs for both\nSavings Plan amounted to approximately $4.2 million, $4.1 million and $3.9 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDeferred Compensation Plans\nWe maintain four deferred compensation programs for certain executive management employees and our Board of Directors.\nThe ADTRAN, Inc. Deferred Compensation Program for Employees is offered as a supplement to our tax-qualified 401(k) plan and is\navailable to certain executive management employees who have been designated by our Board of Directors. This deferred\ncompensation plan allows participants to defer all or a portion of certain specified bonuses and up to 25% of remaining cash\ncompensation and permits us to make matching contributions on a discretionary basis without the limitations that apply to the 401(k)\nplan. To date, we have not made any matching contributions under this plan. We also maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. Equity Deferral\nProgram for Employees. Under this plan, participants may elect to defer all or a portion of their vested PSUs and RSUs to the plan.\nSuch deferrals shall continue to be held and deemed to be invested in shares of ADTRAN stock unless and until the amounts are\ndistributed or such deferrals are moved to another deemed investment pursuant to an election made by the participant.\nFor our Board of Directors, we maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. Deferred Compensation Program for Directors. This program allows our\nBoard of Directors to defer all or a portion of monetary remuneration paid to the Director, including, but not limited to, meeting fees\nand annual retainers.

Such deferrals shall continue to be held and deemed to be invested\nin shares of ADTRAN stock unless and until the amounts are distributed or such deferrals are moved to another deemed investment\npursuant to an election made by the director.\nWe have set aside the plan assets for all plans in a rabbi trust (the “Trust”) and all contributions are credited to bookkeeping accounts\nfor the participants. The Trust assets are subject to the claims of our creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency. The assets of\nthe Trust are deemed to be invested in pre-approved mutual funds as directed by each participant and the participant’s bookkeeping\naccount is credited with the earnings and losses attributable to those investments. Benefits are scheduled to be distributed six months\nafter termination of employment in a single lump sum payment or annual installments paid over a three or ten-year term based on the\nparticipant’s election. Distributions will be made on a pro-rata basis from each of the hypothetical investments of the participant’s\naccount in cash. Any whole shares of ADTRAN, Inc. common stock that are distributed will be distributed in-kind.\nAssets of the Trust are deemed invested in mutual funds that cover an investment spectrum ranging from equities to money market\ninstruments. These mutual funds are publicly quoted and reported at fair value. The fair value of the assets held by the Trust and the\namounts payable to the plan participants as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nFair Value of Plan Assets\nLong-term investments $ 26,838 $ 22,943\nTotal Fair Value of Plan Assets $ 26,838 $ 22,943\nAmounts Payable to Plan Participants\nDeferred compensation liability $ 29,039 $ 26,668\nTotal Amounts Payable to Plan Participants $ 29,039 $ 26,668\n121\nThe Trust held $2.2 million and $3.7 million of common stock in the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nShares of the Company held by the Trust are recorded at cost and classified as treasury stock on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nInterest and dividend income of the Trust are included in interest and dividend income in the accompanying 2023, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Loss. Changes in the fair value of the plan assets held by the Trust have been included in other income, net\nin the accompanying 2023, 2022 and 2021 Consolidated Statements of Loss. Changes in the fair value of the deferred compensation\nliability are included as selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying 2023, 2022 and 2021 Consolidated\nStatements of Loss. Based on the changes in the total fair value of the Trust’s assets, the Company recorded deferred compensation\nincome in 2023, 2022 and 2021 of $3.0 million, $6.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively.\nRetiree Medical Coverage\nMedical, dental and prescription drug coverage is provided to certain spouses and former spouses of current and former officers on the\nsame terms as provided to our active officers for up to 30 years.

Therefore, the permanent equity noncontrolling interest balance was reclassified to redeemable\nnon-controlling interest (RNCI) on January 16, 2023 and was remeasured to fair value based on the trading market price of the Adtran\nNetworks shares.\nSubsequently, the carrying value of the RNCI is adjusted to its maximum redemption value at each reporting date when the maximum\nredemption value is greater than the initial carrying amount of the RNCI. However, the RNCI will be remeasured using the current\nexchange rate at each reporting date as long as the RNCI is currently redeemable. For the period of time that the DPLTA is in effect,\nthe RNCI will continue to be presented as RNCI outside of stockholders’ equity in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table summarizes the redeemable non-controlling interest activity for the year ended December 31, 2023:\nFor the Year Ended\n(In thousands) December 31, 2023\nBalance at beginning of period $ —\nReclassification of non-controlling interests 443,757\nFair value on redemption of redeemable non-controlling interests (1,657)\nNet income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests 11,525\nAnnual recurring compensation earned (11,525)\nTranslation adjustment 9,604\nAdtran Networks stock option exercises 52\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 451,756\n124\nAnnual recurring compensation payable on untendered outstanding shares under the DPLTA must be recognized as it is accrued.

See Note 1 and Note 20 for additional information on RNCI and the\nannual dividend.\nNote 18 – Segment Information and Major Customers\nThe chief operating decision maker regularly reviews the Company’s financial performance based on two reportable segments: (1)\nNetwork Solutions and (2) Services & Support.\nThe Network Solutions segment includes hardware and software products that enable a digital future which support the Company's\nSubscriber, Access and Aggregation, and Optical Networking Solutions. The Company's cloud-managed Wi-Fi gateways,\nvirtualization software, and switches provide a mix of wired and wireless connectivity at the customer premises. In addition, its\nCarrier Ethernet products support a variety of applications at the network edge ranging from mobile backhaul to connecting enterprise\ncustomers (“Subscriber Solutions\").

These\nliabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated\nBalance Sheets.\nA summary of warranty expense and write-off activity for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nBalance at beginning of period $ 7,196 $ 5,403 $ 7,146\nPlus: Adtran Networks acquisition — 3,756 —\nPlus: Amounts charged to cost and expenses 2,952 3,104 855\nPlus: Foreign currency translation adjustments 82 334 —\nLess: Deductions (3,784) (5,401) (2,598)\nBalance at end of period $ 6,445 $ 7,196 $ 5,403\nNote 20 – Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Matters\nFrom time to time the Company is subject to or otherwise involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and legal proceedings\nthat arise out of or are incidental to the conduct of our business (collectively, “Legal Matters”), including those relating to employment\nmatters, patent rights, regulatory compliance matters, stockholder claims, and contractual and other commercial disputes. Such Legal\nMatters, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Additionally, an\nunfavorable outcome in a legal matter, including in a patent dispute, could require the Company to pay damages, entitle claimants to\nother relief, such as royalties, or could prevent the Company from selling some of its products in certain jurisdictions. At this time, the\nCompany is unable to predict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with such legal matters.\nAdtran Networks Legal Matter\nOn May 8, 2023, Adtran Networks SE and its subsidiary, ADVA Optical Networking North America, Inc. (together, “Adtran\nNetworks”), filed a lawsuit in the U.S District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (“EDTX”) against Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd\n(“Huawei”) seeking a declaration from the court that Huawei violated its commitments to negotiate in good faith and to license\nstandard essential patents (“SEPs”), to the extent any SEPs are practiced by Adtran Networks, on Fair, Reasonable and Non-\nDiscriminatory (“FRAND”) terms and conditions. The case also sought to obtain a ruling by the EDTX that Adtran Networks has\ncomplied with its own commitments and requested that the Court establish FRAND terms and conditions for obtaining a FRAND\nlicense on any SEPs to the extent they are practiced by Adtran Networks. The lawsuit further sought to enjoin Huawei from enforcing\ncertain Huawei patents that Adtran Networks considers invalid and/or not practiced, and Adtran Networks alleged that Huawei had\ninfringed upon an Adtran Networks patent. On July 20, 2023, Adtran Networks SE was served with a complaint filed by Huawei\nagainst Adtran Networks SE in the District Court München I, Germany, alleging that certain of its products infringe upon one of\nHuawei’s patents. On August 22, 2023, Adtran Networks entered into a settlement agreement with Huawei pursuant to which the\nparties agreed to, among other things, dismiss the lawsuits described above.\n127\nDPLTA Exit and Recurring Compensation Costs\nPursuant to the terms of the DPLTA, each Adtran Networks shareholder (other than the Company) has received an offer to elect either\n(1) to remain an Adtran Networks shareholder and receive from us an Annual Recurring Compensation payment, or (2) to receive Exit\nCompensation plus guaranteed interest. The guaranteed interest under the Exit Compensation is calculated from the effective date of\nthe DPLTA to the date the shares are tendered, less any Annual Recurring Compensation paid. The guaranteed interest rate is 5.0%\nplus a variable component (according to the German Civil Code) that was 3.12% as of December 31, 2023. Assuming all the minority\nholders of currently outstanding Adtran Networks shares were to elect the second option, we would be obligated to make aggregate\nExit Compensation payments, including guaranteed interest, of approximately €310.3 million or approximately $342.5 million, based\non an exchange rate as of December 31, 2023 and reflecting interest accrued through December 31, 2023 during the pendency of the\nappraisal proceedings discussed below. Shareholders electing the first option of Annual Recurring Compensation may later elect the\nsecond option. The opportunity for outside Adtran Networks shareholders to tender Adtran Networks shares in exchange for Exit\nCompensation had been scheduled to expire on March 16, 2023. However, due to the appraisal proceedings that have been initiated in\naccordance with applicable German law, this time period for tendering shares has been extended pursuant to the German Stock\nCorporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and will end two months after the date on which a final decision in such appraisal proceedings has\nbeen published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger).\nOur obligation to pay Annual Recurring Compensation under the DPLTA is a continuing payment obligation, which will amount to\napproximately €10.6 million or $11.7 million (based on the current exchange rate) per year assuming none of the minority Adtran\nNetworks shareholders were to elect Exit Compensation. The foregoing amounts do not reflect any potential increase in payment\nobligations that we may have depending on the outcome of ongoing appraisal proceedings in Germany. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, we accrued $11.5 million in Annual Recurring Compensation, which was reflected as an increase to retained\n(deficit) earnings.\nOn October 18, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase additional shares of Adtran Networks\nthrough open market purchases not to exceed 15,346,544 shares. For the year ended December 31, 2023, 67 thousand shares,\nrespectively, of Adtran Networks stock was tendered to the Company and Exit Compensation payments of approximately €1.2 million,\nrespectively, or approximately $1.3 million based on an exchange rate as of December 31, 2023, were paid to Adtran Networks\nshareholders.\nPerformance Bonds\nCertain contracts, customers and jurisdictions in which the Company do business require us to provide various guarantees of\nperformance such as bid bonds, performance bonds and customs bonds. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the\nCompany had commitments related to these bonds totaling $10.8 million and $22.0 million, respectively, which expire at various dates\nthrough April 2031. In general the Company would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default under each\ncontract, the probability of which the Company believes is remote.\nPurchase Obligations\nThe Company purchases components from a variety of suppliers and use contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for\nour products. Our inventory purchase obligations are for short-term product manufacturing requirements, as well as for obligations to\nsuppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our inventory purchase obligations with contract manufacturers and suppliers\nrelate to arrangements to secure supply and pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. As of December 31, 2023,\npurchase obligations totaled $252.5 million.\nNote 21 – Current Expected Credit Losses\nUnder ASC 326 – Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, the Company estimates credit losses for the contractual life of assets that are\nmeasured at amortized cost and are within the scope of this guidance, which includes accounts receivable, net investment in sales-type\nleases, contract assets under the revenue recognition model and outstanding notes receivable. Where appropriate, the Company pools\nassets if similar risk characteristics exist. Additionally, the Company analyzes its available-for-sale debt securities for impairment and\nrecords a credit loss allowance as needed.\nAssets Measured at Amortized Cost\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company records accounts receivable in the normal course of business as products are shipped or services are performed and\ninvoiced, but payment has not yet been remitted by the customer. Accounts receivable balances are considered past due when payment\nhas not been received by the date indicated on the relevant invoice or based on agreed upon terms between the customer and the\nCompany.\n128\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s net outstanding accounts receivable balance was $216.4 million and $279.4\nmillion, respectively. The Company assessed the need for an allowance for credit losses related to its outstanding accounts receivable\nusing the historical loss-rate method as well as assessing asset-specific risks. The Company’s historical losses related to accounts\nreceivable have been immaterial as evidenced by its historical allowance and write-offs due to collectability. The assessment of asset-\nspecific risks included the evaluation of relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to current\nconditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay, such as the customer’s current financial condition, credit rating by geographic\nlocation, as provided by a third party and/or by customer, if needed, and the overall macro-economic conditions in which the customer\noperates. The Company pooled assets by geographic location to determine if an allowance should be applied to its accounts receivable\nbalance, assessing the specific country risk rating and overall economics of that particular country. If elevated risk existed, or customer\nspecific risk indicated the accounts receivable balance was at risk, the Company further analyzed the need for an allowance related to\nspecific accounts receivable balances. Additionally, the Company determined that significant changes to customer country risk rating\nfrom period-to-period and from the end of the prior year to the end of the current quarter would require further review and analysis by\nthe Company.\nCredit losses totaling $0.4 million and less than $0.1 million were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nrespectively, related to accounts receivable. No credit losses were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021 related to accounts\nreceivable.\nContract Assets\nThe Company records contract assets when it has recognized revenue but has not yet billed the customer. As of December 31, 2023\nand 2022, the Company’s outstanding contract asset balance was $0.7 million and $1.9 million, respectively, which is included in\nother receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company assessed the need for an allowance for credit losses related to its\noutstanding contract assets using the historical loss-rate method as well as asset-specific risks. The Company’s historical losses related\nto contract assets receivable have been immaterial as evidenced by historical write-offs due to collectability. Asset-specific risk\nincluded the evaluation of relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to current conditions that may\naffect a customer’s ability to pay once invoiced, such as the customer’s financial condition, credit rating by geographic location as\nprovided by a third party and/or by customer, if needed, and the overall macro-economic conditions in which the customer operates.\nThe Company pooled assets by geographic location to determine if an allowance should be applied to its contract asset balance,\nassessing the specific country risk rating and the overall economics of that particular country. If elevated risk existed, or customer\nspecific risk indicated the contract balance was at risk, the Company further analyzed the need for an allowance related to specific\ncustomer balances. Additionally, the Company determined that significant changes to customer country risk rating from period-to-\nperiod and from the end of the prior year to the end of the current quarter would be subject to further review and analysis by the\nCompany.\nNo allowance for credit losses was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 related to contract assets.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have exposure to credit losses from off-balance sheet exposures, to provide various guarantees of performance such as bid bonds,\nperformance bonds and customs bonds, where we believe the risk of loss is immaterial to our financial statements as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively. Otherwise, we do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not engaged in any related\nparty transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity\nor the availability of or requirements for capital resources. See Note 20 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\n129\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities\nAs of December 31, 2023 the Company had sold all available-for-sale debt securities. As of December 31, 2022 the Company’s\navailable-for-sale debt securities totaled $9.3 million. These securities were analyzed at the individual investment level, by Committee\non Uniform Securities Identification Procedures (“CUSIP”), to limit credit losses, if applicable, to reflect only the amount by which\nthe fair value of the security was less than its amortized cost. The Company noted that, as of December 31, 2022, there was no intent\nto sell any of its available-for-sale debt securities before maturity, and, therefore, the Company assessed the need for an allowance for\neach of its available-for-sale debt securities in which the fair value was less than its amortized cost as of December 31, 2022. Accrued\ninterest receivable on available-for-sale debt securities, which is included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as\nof December 31, 2022 totaled less than $0.1 million and was excluded from the estimate of credit losses for both periods based on the\nCompany’s accounting policy election. Income generated from available-for-sale debt securities was recorded as interest and dividend\nincome in the Consolidated Statements of Loss.\nThe Company had 99 positions in available-for-sale debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2022.\nSee Note 5 for additional information.\nFor those available-for-sale debt securities whose fair value was less than its amortized cost basis, the Company analyzed additional\ncriteria such as adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry or geographic area, failure of the issuer of the\nsecurity to make scheduled interest or principal payments, if applicable, and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating\nagency to determine if a credit loss existed. The Company used information provided by its investment manager to determine if any\nscheduled interest or principal payments had not been received and used a third party to determine if any changes to credit ratings had\noccurred. Principal and interest payments are considered past due when payment has not been received based on scheduled terms of\neach debt security. The Company ceases to accrue interest on debt securities on a case by case basis. As of December 31, 2023, the\nCompany noted that all principal and interest payments had been received as scheduled and that there had been no changes in credit\nratings year-over-year or period-over-period that warranted further review.\nNo allowance for credit losses was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to the Company’s available-for-sale debt\nsecurities.\nNote 22 – Loss per Share\nThe calculations of basic and diluted loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\n(In thousands, except for per share amounts) 2023 2022 2021\nNumerator\nNet Loss attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. $ (267,688) $ (2,037) $ (8,635)\nDenominator\nWeighted average number of shares – basic 78,416 62,346 48,582\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nStock options — — —\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock — — —\nWeighted average number of shares – diluted 78,416 62,346 48,582\nLoss per share attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. – basic $ (3.41) $ (0.03) $ (0.18)\nLoss per share attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. – diluted $ (3.41) $ (0.03) $ (0.18)\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, less than 0.5 million, 0.1 million and 0.1 million shares of unvested\nor unearned, as applicable, PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share due to their\nanti-dilutive effect.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, 1.8 million, 0.2 million and 0.3 million stock options, respectively, were\noutstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share due to their exercise prices being greater than the\naverage market price of the common shares during the quarter, making them anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.\nNote 23 – Restructuring\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company initiated a restructuring program designed to optimize the assets, business processes,\nand information technology systems of the Company in relation to the Business Combination with Adtran Networks. The restructuring\nprogram is expected to maximize cost synergies by realizing operation scale, combining sales channels, streamlining corporate and\ngeneral and administrative functions, including human capital resources and combining sourcing and production costs. This\nrestructuring program is expected to be completed in late 2024 and includes expenses specifically associated with achieving run-rate\nsynergies as well as Business Efficiency Program expenses described below.\n130\n\nOn November 6, 2023, due to the uncertainty around the current macroeconomic environment and its impact on customer spending\nlevels, the Company’s management decided to implement a business efficiency program (the “Business Efficiency Program”)\ntargeting the reduction of ongoing operating expenses and focusing on capital efficiency inclusive of certain salary reductions, an early\nretirement program, a site consolidation plan to include lease impairments and the partial sale of owned real estate (including the\npotential sale of portions of our headquarters), inventory write downs from product discontinuances, and the suspension of the\nquarterly dividend. The Business Efficiency Program expands upon other recently implemented restructuring efforts and synergy costs\nfollowing the Business Combination. For instance, on August 17, 2023, the Company’s management determined to discontinue its\ncopper-based Digital Subscriber Line broadband access technology products and its fixed wireless access products in its Network\nSolutions segment. Furthermore, on September 29, 2023, the Company’s management decided to exit the \"IoT\" gateway market\n(indoor and outdoor), a subset of the broader IoT market (together with the other product discontinuations, the “Discontinuations”).\nAdditionally, on October 25, 2023, all employees were informed of certain personnel measures, which included the reduction of salary\nfor select management, a reduction of approximately 5% of the workforce, an early retirement program and a hiring freeze.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized $25.1 million of costs relating to the Business Efficiency Program. We\nexpect costs in the first quarter 2024 and thereafter relating to the Business Efficiency Program to range between $22.2 million and\n$35.2 million. Management expects these planned costs to include severance costs ranging from $12.2 million to $18.9 million in\nconnection with an early retirement program and reductions in workforce, inventory write downs from product discontinuances\nranging from $7.6 million to $10.3 million, and site consolidation transaction expenses (primarily brokers fees) ranging from $2.4\nmillion to $6.0 million. Future cash payments include: severance costs and outplacement fees that are anticipated to be in the range of\n$12.2 million to $18.9 million, payments relating to the site consolidation transaction expenses that are anticipated to be in the range\nof $2.4 million to $6.0 million, and potential cash payments of $3.6 million to $6.3 million for anticipated product discontinuances.\nWe may also incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or\nassociated with, the Business Efficiency Program, including potential impairment charges related to the discontinuance of additional\nproduct lines, regulatory requirements related to personnel measures, and site closures. However, we are not able to estimate the\namount or range of amounts of such potential incremental charges as of the date of this filing. If required, we will amend this\ndisclosure at such time as management is able in good faith to estimate the amount, or range of amounts, of these charges.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $21.5 million and $1.6 million of restructuring costs relating to the\nBusiness Combination under the multi-year integration program and synergy realization, respectively, that are included in cost of\nrevenue, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the Condensed Consolidated\nStatement of Loss.\nIn February 2019, the Company announced the restructuring of a certain portion of its workforce predominantly in Germany, which\nincluded the closure of the Company’s office location in Munich, Germany accompanied by relocation or severance benefits for the\naffected employees. Voluntary early retirement was offered to certain other employees and was announced in March 2019 and again in\nAugust 2020. This plan was completed in 2021 and all amounts paid in 2022.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending restructuring liability, which is included in accrued wages and benefits in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, is as follows:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nBalance at beginning of period $ 159 $ 1,514\nPlus: Amounts charged to cost and expense 22,241 1,629\nLess: Amounts paid (14,091) (2,984)\nBalance at end of period $ 8,309 $ 159\nRestructuring expenses included in the Consolidated Statements of Loss are for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nNetwork solutions - cost of revenue $ 2,910 $ 8 $ 13\nNetwork solutions - inventory write-down 24,313 — —\nServices & support - cost of revenue — — 3\nCost of revenue $ 27,223 $ 8 $ 16\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 11,603 117 221\nResearch and development expenses 7,728 1,504 174\nTotal restructuring expenses $ 46,554 $ 1,629 $ 411\n131\nThe following table represents the components of restructuring expense by geographic area for the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022 and 2021:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nUnited States $ 34,629 $ 2 $ 289\nInternational 11,925 1,627 122\nTotal restructuring expenses $ 46,554 $ 1,629 $ 411\nNote 24 – Subsequent Events\nThird Amendment to Wells Fargo Credit Agreement\nOn March 12, 2024, the Company, its wholly-owned direct subsidiary, ADTRAN, Inc. (the “Borrower”), the lenders party thereto and\nWells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”), entered into a Third Amendment to\nCredit Agreement (the “Third Amendment”), which amends that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of July 18, 2022 (as amended or\notherwise modified, including by the Third Amendment, the “Credit Agreement”), by and among the Borrower, the Company, the\nlenders party thereto and the Administrative Agent.\nThe Third Amendment, among other things, amends the definition of “Consolidated Funded Indebtedness” (which is used in the\ncalculation of the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio and the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio) to exclude\nobligations of the Company and its subsidiaries under certain factoring arrangements when calculated for the fiscal quarters ending\nMarch 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024.\nSecond Amendment to Wells Fargo Credit Agreement\nOn January 16, 2024, the Company, its wholly-owned direct subsidiary, ADTRAN, Inc. (the “Borrower”), the lenders party thereto\nand Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”), entered into a Second Amendment\nto Credit Agreement and First Amendment to Collateral Agreement (the “Second Amendment”), which amends (i) that certain Credit\nAgreement, dated as of July 18, 2022 (as amended or otherwise modified, including by the Second Amendment, the “Credit\nAgreement”), by and among the Borrower, the Company, the lenders party thereto and the Administrative Agent and (ii) that certain\nCollateral Agreement, dated as of July 18, 2022, by and among the Borrower, the Company and the Administrative Agent. Capitalized\nterms used in this Note 24 and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Second Amendment or the\nCredit Agreement, as applicable. The Second Amendment, among other things, provides the Company and its subsidiaries with\nadditional covenant headroom from (and including) the fourth quarter of 2023 through and including the third quarter of 2024 (the\n“Covenant Relief Period”) and revises and/or adds certain other financial covenants. The full set of financial covenants includes the\nfollowing:\n• As of the last day of any fiscal quarter, commencing with the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Consolidated\nTotal Net Leverage Ratio may not exceed 5.00x.\n• As of the last day of any fiscal quarter, commencing with the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Consolidated\nSenior Secured Net Leverage Ratio may not exceed:\n• In the event of the purchase by the Company of at least sixty percent (60%) of the outstanding shares of Adtran\nNetworks SE not owned by the Company as of August 9, 2023 that have been tendered (such event, a “Springing\nCovenant Event” and the fiscal quarter in which the Springing Covenant Event Occurs and the three consecutive\nquarterly test periods thereafter, the “Springing Covenant Period”), the following covenant levels:\n• First fiscal quarter ending after a Springing Covenant Event: 4.00x\n• Second fiscal quarter ending after a Springing Covenant Event: 3.75x\n• Third and fourth fiscal quarters ending after a Springing Covenant Event: 3.50x\n• If the Company or any of its subsidiaries incurs certain unsecured Indebtedness in excess of $50,000,000 in connection\nwith a transaction that is a Springing Covenant Event or during a Springing Covenant Period, the Consolidated Senor\nSecured Net Leverage Ratio covenant will step down to 3.50x at the time of such incurrence.\n• If a Springing Covenant Period is not in effect, the following covenant levels:\n• From December 31, 2023 through and including March 31, 2024: 3.25x.\n• From April 1, 2024 through and including June 30, 2024: 3.50x.\n132\n• From July 1, 2024 and thereafter: 3.25x.\n• As of the last day of any fiscal quarter, commencing with the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Consolidated\nFixed Charge Coverage Ratio may not exceed 1.25x.\n• During the Covenant Relief Period or a Springing Covenant Period, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter (i) cash and\ncash equivalents of the Credit Parties must be at least $50.0 million and (ii) cash and cash equivalents of the Company and\nits subsidiaries must be at least $75.0 million.\nThe Credit Agreement is guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company, and the Company is also required to add certain\nadditional domestic and international subsidiaries as guarantors under the Credit Agreement (such existing and new guarantors,\ncollectively, the “Guarantors”). In addition to the guarantees provided by the Guarantors, the Guarantors have granted (or will grant)\nsecurity interests in favor of the Administrative Agent over substantially all tangible and intangible assets, and the Borrower will grant\nmortgages in favor of the Administrative Agent over certain owned real estate assets.\nThe Credit Agreement continues to provide for revolving borrowings of up to $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount, as well as\nan additional $50.0 million delayed draw term loan tranche that would be available upon a Springing Covenant Event. It also\ncontinues to permit the Company to prepay any or all of the outstanding loans or to reduce the commitments under the Credit\nAgreement subject to certain limitations and minimum payment thresholds.\nDuring the Covenant Relief Period, the Company is not permitted to make certain dividend payments to the Company's Stockholders\nor certain other Restricted Payments. However, the Company is permitted to make the Recurring Compensation Payment to each\nAdtran Networks shareholder (other than the Company), pursuant to the terms of the DPLTA. See Note 20 for additional information.\nFurthermore, the Credit Agreement continues to contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including incurrence\ncovenants and certain other limitations on the ability of the Company and the Company’s subsidiaries to incur additional debt,\nguarantee other obligations, grant liens on assets, make investments, dispose of assets, make restricted payments, engage in mergers or\nconsolidations, engage in transactions with affiliates, modify its organizational documents, and enter into certain restrictive\nagreements. The negative covenants are subject to various exceptions and carveouts; however, certain of the exceptions and carveouts\nare not permitted to be used during the Covenant Relief Period. It also contains customary events of default, such as misrepresentation\nand a default in the performance or observance of any covenant (subject to customary cure periods and materiality thresholds). Upon\nthe occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the Administrative Agent is entitled to take various actions, including\nthe acceleration of all amounts due under the Credit Agreement.\nUpon the effective date of the Second Amendment, (A) the applicable commitment fee increased to 0.25% per annum, (B) for any\nrevolving credit loan that is a Term SOFR Loan, the applicable margin rate increased to 3.15% per annum, (C) for any revolving credit\nloan that is a Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the applicable margin rate increased to 3.25% per annum, (D) for any revolving credit loan that\nis a Base Rate Loan (including any Swingline Loan), the applicable margin rate increased to 2.15% per annum, (E) for any Delayed\nDraw Term Loan that is a Term SOFR Loan, the applicable margin rate increased to 3.40% per annum and (F)_for any Delayed Draw\nTerm Loan that is a Base Rate Loan, the applicable margin rate increased to 2.40% per annum.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in\nreports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the SEC, and that such information\nis accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as\nappropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out by management, including our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and\n15d-15(e)) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that\ndue to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below, our disclosure controls and procedures\nwere not effective as of December 31, 2023.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement of ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. (“ADTRAN”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over\nfinancial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. ADTRAN’s internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. ADTRAN’s internal control\nover financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n• pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of ADTRAN;\n• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of ADTRAN are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of ADTRAN; and\n• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of\nADTRAN’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of ADTRAN’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making\nthis assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(\"COSO\") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a\nreasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a\ntimely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, management\ndetermined that there were deficiencies in ADTRAN’s internal control over financial reporting that constituted material weaknesses as\nfollows:\n• The Company did not design and maintain effective controls in response to the risks of material misstatement.\nSpecifically, changes to existing controls or the implementation of new controls have not been sufficient to respond to\nchanges to the risks of material misstatement to financial reporting. This material weakness contributed to the following\nadditional material weaknesses:\n• The Company did not design and maintain effective controls over financial statement preparation, presentation and\ndisclosure commensurate with its financial reporting requirements. Specifically, the Company did not design and maintain\neffective controls over the presentation and disclosure of transactions, including non-controlling interest.\n134\n• The Company did not design and maintain effective controls to address the initial application of complex accounting\nstandards and accounting of non-routine, unusual or complex events and transactions. Specifically, the Company did not\ndesign and maintain effective controls to timely analyze and account for (i) non-controlling interest and (ii) the receivable\npurchase and servicing agreement.\nThe material weaknesses resulted in the restatements and revisions of and immaterial adjustments to our consolidated financial\nstatements for the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as the condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarterly and\nyear-to-date periods ended September 30, 2022, March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, and September 30, 2023. The material weaknesses\nalso resulted in material adjustments to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. Additionally,\nthese material weaknesses could result in misstatements of the Company’s accounts or disclosures that would result in a material\nmisstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.\nBecause of these material weaknesses, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Item 8.\nManagement’s Remediation Efforts for Unremediated Material Weaknesses\nTo remediate the material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting related to the risks of material\nmisstatement, including financial statement preparation, presentation and disclosure of transactions and the non-controlling interest,\nthe Company plans to initiate a remediation plan that includes designing and implementing new or enhanced controls over the review\nof our consolidated financial statements and identification and assessment of risks of material misstatement. We believe that the\nforegoing actions will support the improvement of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, and, through our efforts to\nidentify, design, and implement the necessary control activities, will be effective in remediating such material weaknesses.\nTo remediate the material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting relating to accounting of non-routine\nunusual or complex events and transactions for non-controlling interest and the receivable purchase and servicing agreement, the\nCompany plans to initiate a remediation plan that includes designing and implementing new controls over the identification and\nreview of contracts, transactions or arrangements that may result in a financial obligation including the use of an accounting specialist\nas needed to ensure proper presentation of these items within our financial statements.\nWe will continue to devote significant time and attention to these remediation efforts. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve\nour internal control over financial reporting, management may determine to take additional measures to address the material\nweaknesses or determine to modify the remediation plans described above. Until the remediation steps set forth above, including the\nefforts to implement the necessary control activities that we identify, are fully completed, and there has been time for us to conclude\nthrough testing that the control activities are operating effectively, the material weaknesses described above will not be considered\nremediated.\nRemediation of Previously Disclosed Material Weakness\nAs previously reported in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 of Amendment No. 1,\nwe identified the following material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which was remediated as of December\n31, 2023.\n• We identified that we did not design and maintain effective controls over the presentation and disclosure of debt\nagreements, specifically to ensure the presentation and disclosure reflect the terms of the agreements.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023, our management implemented a new control over the review of new or\namendments to our agreements for terms and conditions that impact the presentation or disclosure of debt. As of December 31, 2023,\nour management determined that the new control has been in place for a sufficient period of time and concluded, through testing, that\nthe material weakness identified above has been remediated.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter\ncovered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial\nreporting.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\n(a) Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement - Third Amendment to Wells Fargo Credit Agreement\n135\nOn March 12, 2024, the Company, its wholly-owned direct subsidiary, ADTRAN, Inc. (the “Borrower”), the lenders party thereto and\nWells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”), entered into a Third Amendment to\nCredit Agreement (the “Third Amendment”), which amends that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of July 18, 2022 (as amended or\notherwise modified, including by the Third Amendment, the “Credit Agreement”), by and among the Borrower, the Company, the\nlenders party thereto and the Administrative Agent. Capitalized terms used in this Item 9B(a) and not otherwise defined herein have\nthe meanings assigned to them in the Third Amendment or the Credit Agreement, as applicable.\nThe Third Amendment, among other things, amends the definition of “Consolidated Funded Indebtedness” (which is used in the\ncalculation of the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio and the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio) to exclude\nobligations of the Company and its subsidiaries under certain factoring arrangements when calculated for the fiscal quarters ending\nMarch 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024.\nCost Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities\nAs the Company previously reported in Item 5 of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 filed\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 9, 2023, on November 6, 2023, the Company’s management resolved to\nimplement the Business Efficiency Program targeting the reduction of ongoing operating expenses and focusing on capital efficiency\ninclusive of certain salary reductions, an early retirement program, a site consolidation plan to include lease impairments and the\npartial sale of owned real estate (including the potential sale of portions of our headquarters), inventory write downs from product\ndiscontinuances, and the suspension of the quarterly dividend. At such time, management expected the total cost of the Business\nEfficiency Program to fall within the range of $35.5 million to $45.5 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized $25.1 million of costs relating to the Business Efficiency Program. We\nexpect costs in the first quarter 2024 and thereafter relating to the Business Efficiency Program to range between $22.2 million and\n$35.2 million. Management expects these planned costs to include severance costs ranging from $12.2 million to $18.9 million in\nconnection with an early retirement program and reductions in workforce, inventory write down of product discontinuances ranging\nfrom $7.6 million to $10.3 million, and site consolidation transaction expenses (primarily brokers fees) ranging from $2.4 million to\n$6.0 million. Future cash payments include: severance costs and outplacement fees that are anticipated to be in the range of $12.2\nmillion to $18.9 million, payments relating to the site consolidation transaction expenses that are anticipated to be in the range of $2.4\nmillion to $6.0 million, and potential cash payments of $3.6 million to $6.3 million for anticipated product discontinuances. We may\nalso incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or associated\nwith, the Business Efficiency Program, including potential impairment charges related to the discontinuance of additional product\nlines, regulatory requirements related to personnel measures, and site closures. However, we are not able to estimate the amount or\nrange of amounts of such potential incremental charges as of the date of this filing. If required, we will amend this disclosure at such\ntime as management is able in good faith to estimate the amount, or range of amounts, of these charges.\nThe Business Efficiency Program is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2024, with expected cash payments\ncontinuing into 2025.\n(b) During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, none of the Company’s directors or executive officers adopted or terminated\nany contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative\ndefense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.”\nITEM 9C.

We and our\nrepresentatives may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in this report, our other filings with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and other communications with our stockholders. Any statement that does not directly relate to a historical or\ncurrent fact is a forward-looking statement. Generally, the words “believe”, “expect”, “intend”, “estimate”, “anticipate”, “would”, “will”, “may”, “might”,\n“could”, “should”, “can”, “future”, “assume”, “plan”, “seek”, “predict”, “potential”, “objective”, “expect”, “target”, “project”, “outlook”, “forecast” and similar\nexpressions identify forward-looking statements. We caution you that any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are subject to uncertainties\nand other factors that could affect the accuracy of such statements. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations, as well as\ncertain assumptions and estimates made by, and information available to, management at the time the statements are made. Those statements are based on\ngeneral assumptions and are subject to various risks, and because they also relate to the future, they are likewise subject to inherent uncertainties and other\nfactors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the views, beliefs and projections expressed in such statements. These risks, uncertainties and other\nfactors include, but are not limited to, the risks identified in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this report and those described below:\nRisks related to the Business Combination and DPLTA\n• We may fail to realize the anticipated strategic and financial benefits sought from the Business Combination.\n• We have experienced operational challenges as a result of the Business Combination and may also experience negative synergies and loss of\ncustomers.\n• The terms of the DPLTA may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition.\n• We are exposed to additional litigation risk and uncertainty with respect to the remaining minority shareholders of ADVA, which litigation may\nrequire us to pay a higher purchase price for additional ADVA shares than the amount provided for under the DPLTA.\n• We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant transaction fees and costs in connection with the Business Combination and post-\nclosing integration efforts.\n• We incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness in connection with the Business Combination and DPLTA.

BUSINESS\nCompany Overview\nWe are a leading global provider of open networking and communications platforms, software, systems and services focused on the broadband access market,\nserving a diverse domestic and international customer base in multiple countries that includes traditional communication services providers, alternative service\nproviders, such as utilities, municipalities and fiber overbuilders, cable/MSOs, SMBs and distributed enterprises. Our innovative solutions and services enable\nvoice, data, video and internet-communications across a variety of network infrastructures and are currently in use by millions of people worldwide. We support\nour customers through our direct global sales organization and our distribution networks. Our success depends upon our ability to increase unit volume and\nmarket share through the introduction of new products and succeeding generations of products having optimal selling prices and increased functionality as\ncompared to both the prior generation of a product and to the products of competitors in order to gain market share. To service our customers and grow revenue,\nwe are continually conducting research and developing new products addressing customer needs and testing those products for the specific requirements of the\nparticular customers. We offer a broad portfolio of flexible software and hardware network solutions and services that enable service providers to meet today’s\nservice demands, while also enabling them to transition to the fully converged, scalable, highly-automated, cloud-controlled voice, data, internet and video\nnetwork of the future. In addition to our global headquarters in Huntsville, Alabama and our European headquarters in Munich, Germany, we have sales,\nresearch and development, and production facilities in strategic global locations.\nIn 2022, following the business combination (the “Business Combination”) with ADVA Optical Networking SE (“ADVA”), which included the Merger, we\nbecame the sole owner of and successor to ADTRAN, Inc. and the majority shareholder of ADVA. ADTRAN, Inc. is a leading global provider of open,\ndisaggregated networking and communications solutions that enable voice, data, video, and internet communications across any network infrastructure. Its\naward-winning end-to-end fiber broadband solutions portfolio spans from OLTs to in-home services and intelligent SaaS solutions. ADVA is a global provider of\nopen networking solutions with over 25 years of experience in optical networking, carrier Ethernet access and network synchronization. ADVA has led the\nindustry for over two decades with open and secure networking solutions that carefully balance space, power and cost. Together, we serve customers in a broad\nrange of industries in over 100 countries. We believe that our combined technology portfolio can best address current and future requirements, especially\nregarding the convergence of solutions at the network edge.\nWe operate under two reportable segments: (1) Network Solutions, which includes hardware and software products, and (2) Services & Support, which includes\na portfolio of network design and implementation services, support services and cloud-hosted SaaS applications that complement our product portfolio and can\nbe utilized to support other platforms as well. These two segments span across our three revenue categories: (1) Subscriber Solutions, (2) Access & Aggregation\nSolutions and (3) Optical Networking Solutions. See below for a detailed discussion of these reportable segments and revenue categories.\nWe are focused on being a top global supplier of fiber-based communications infrastructure and SaaS applications spanning from the cloud edge (data center) to\nthe subscriber edge (customer premise) serving both the residential and enterprise connectivity markets. We offer a broad portfolio of flexible network\ninfrastructure solutions, customer premises equipment, software applications, and global services and support that enable service providers to meet their service\ndemands now and in the future. These products and services enable service providers to transition to a common network supporting the simplified delivery of\nhigh-capacity services, regardless of subscriber density, network topology and infrastructure diversity.\nWe began operations in January 1986. Our global headquarters are located at Cummings Research Park in Huntsville, Alabama, the second largest research park\nin the U.S. and fourth largest in the world. Our mailing address is 901 Explorer Boulevard, Huntsville, Alabama, 35806. Our telephone number at that location is\n(800) 923-8726. Our website is www.adtran.com. No information contained on our website is intended to be included as part of, or incorporated by reference\ninto, this report.\nDomination and Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement\nThe DPLTA between the Company, as the controlling company, and ADVA Optical Networking SE, as the controlled company, which was executed on\nDecember 1, 2022, became effective on January 16, 2023 as a result of its registration with the commercial register (Handelsregister) of the local court\n(Amtsgericht) at the registered seat of ADVA (Jena).\nUnder the DPLTA, subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, (i) the Company is\nentitled to issue binding instructions to the management board of ADVA, (ii) ADVA will transfer its annual profit to the Company, subject to, among other\nthings, the creation or dissolution of certain reserves, and (iii) the Company will generally absorb the annual net loss incurred by ADVA. The obligation of\nADVA to transfer its annual profit to the Company applies for the first time to the profit generated, if any, in the ADVA fiscal year 2023. The obligation of the\nCompany to absorb ADVA’s annual net loss applies for the first time to the loss generated, if any, in the ADVA fiscal year 2023.\n9\nAdditionally, and subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, the DPLTA provides that ADVA shareholders\n(other than us) be offered, at their election, (i) to put their ADVA shares to the Company in exchange for a compensation in cash of EUR 17.21 per share (the\n“Exit Compensation”), or (ii) to remain ADVA shareholders and receive a recurring compensation in cash of EUR 0.59 (EUR 0.52 net under the current tax\nregime) per share for each full fiscal year of ADVA (the “Annual Recurring Compensation”). The Annual Recurring Compensation is due on the third banking\nday following the ordinary general shareholders’ meeting of ADVA for the respective preceding fiscal year (but in any event within eight months following\nexpiration of the fiscal year) and is first granted for the 2023 fiscal year, payable for the first time after the ordinary general shareholders’ meeting of ADVA in\n2024.\nThe adequacy of both forms of compensation have been challenged by minority shareholders of ADVA via court-led appraisal proceedings under German law,\nand it is possible that the courts in such appraisal proceedings may adjudicate a higher Exit Compensation or Annual Recurring Compensation (in each case,\nincluding interest thereon) than agreed upon in the DPLTA.\nThe opportunity for outside ADVA shareholders to tender ADVA shares in exchange for Exit Compensation had been scheduled to expire on March 16, 2023.\nHowever, due to the appraisal proceedings that have been initiated in accordance with applicable German law, this time period for tendering shares has been\nextended pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and will end two months after the date on which a final decision in such appraisal\nproceedings has been published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger).\nWe currently hold 33,961,170 no-par value bearer shares of ADVA, representing 65.30% of ADVA’s outstanding shares as of February 14, 2023.\nThe foregoing description of the DPLTA does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the DPLTA, a non-binding English\ntranslation of which incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $14.2 million of transaction costs. We expect to incur integration costs and costs associated with our\nperformance under the DPLTA during 2023 and such costs are expected to be material.\nReportable Segments\nOur business operates under two reportable segments: (1) Network Solutions and (2) Services & Support. We review our financial performance, specifically\nrevenue and gross profit, based on these two segments.\nNetwork Solutions Segment\nThe Network Solutions segment includes hardware and software products that enable a digital future. Our cloud-managed Wi-Fi gateways, virtualization\nsoftware, and switches provide a mix of wired and wireless connectivity at the customer premises. In addition, our Carrier Ethernet products support a variety of\napplications at the network edge ranging from mobile backhaul to connecting enterprise customers (“Subscriber Solutions\"). Our portfolio includes products for\nmulti-gigabit service delivery over fiber or alternative media to homes and businesses. We support traditional chassis-based network solutions, such as the Total\nAccess 5000 and hiX 5600. We also accelerate the industry’s transition to open, disaggregated fiber access solutions with our SDX Series. Data streams are\naggregated via our XG400 product family and synchronized by our Oscilloquartz offerings (“Access and Aggregation Solutions”). All resulting traffic requires\ntransport through fiber-based networks as supported by our FSP 3000 and MicroMux product families while the underlying infrastructure is monitored by our\nALM product offering (“Optical Networking Solutions”). Our customers can use our Mosaic and Ensemble software suites to manage and orchestrate our\ncomplete portfolio of subscriber solutions, access and aggregation solutions and optical networking solutions. The Mosaic and Ensemble software suites include\na mix of orchestration and management solutions that simplify the deployment and virtualization of next generation fiber networks.\nServices & Support Segment\nThe Services & Support segment offers a comprehensive portfolio of network design, implementation, maintenance and cloud-hosted services supporting our\nSubscriber, Access and Aggregation, and Optical Networking Solutions. These services assist operators in the deployment of multi-vendor networks while\nreducing their cost to maintain these networks. The cloud-hosted services include a suite of SaaS applications under our Mosaic One platform that manages end-\nto-end network and service optimization for both fiber access infrastructure and mesh Wi-Fi connectivity. We back these services with a global support\norganization that offers on-site and off-site support services with varying SLAs. By pairing our network solutions with our global services and support\norganization, customers can turn to us as their single turnkey partner to assist with the deployment and maintenance of modern fiber-based networks to connect\nhomes, businesses and datacenters with the metro or network core.\nRevenue Categories\nIn addition to classifying our operations into two reportable segments, we report revenue across three categories of products and services: (1) Subscriber\nSolutions, (2) Access & Aggregation Solutions and (3) Optical Networking Solutions.\n10\nPrior to the Business Combination with ADVA on July 15, 2022, we reported revenue across the following three categories: (1) Access & Aggregation, (2)\nSubscriber Solutions & Experience and (3) Traditional & Other Products. Following the Business Combination with ADVA, we have recast these revenues such\nthat our former Access & Aggregation revenue is combined with a portion of the applicable ADVA solutions to create Access & Aggregation Solutions, our\nformer Subscriber Solutions & Experience revenue is combined with a portion of the applicable ADVA solutions to create Subscriber Solutions, and the revenue\nfrom Traditional & Other products is now included in the applicable Access & Aggregation Solutions or Subscriber Solutions category.

Unprecedented levels of investment by\ncommunications service providers in their networks is being driven by the pursuit of growth in subscriber acquisition, retention, and average revenue per user,\nalongside the streamlining of operations to reduce operational costs and complexity, while lowering energy consumption and improving their overall ESG\nposition. Drivers facilitating this network investment cycle include the evolution of government funding programs, private equity infrastructure investment\nappetite, regulatory broadband policies, competition, merger obligations and ever-increasing subscriber demand for higher speed broadband.\nSubscriber demand for greater bandwidth continues to increase as connectivity is being woven ever more tightly into the fabric of everyone’s day-to-day lives.\nIncreasing numbers of connected devices, shifting working arrangements, the transition of entertainment over to OTT video, along with the evolution of gaming\ntowards subscription models where new hybrids of download and streaming are emerging globally. This is further compounded with the prevalence of IoT and\nthe increasing transition of applications over to cloud-based services and internet applications where recurring revenues replace one-time sales. Performance and\nuser satisfaction are directly related to bandwidth availability and service robustness. As the demand for high-definition video and game streaming services,\nsymmetric bandwidth for online collaboration, ever lower latency for interactive cloud applications and smart home video surveillance applications continue to\nincrease, so too does the need for fiber-based broadband to every home, business and location of socioeconomic activity.\nIn order to satisfy these complex requirements and deliver on the efficiency improvements demanded by operators, communications service providers are\ntransitioning to full fiber access networks. This transition has created an unprecedented market opportunity where the comprehensive replacement of copper and\ncoaxial networks along with the equipment that enables broadband over them, opens what has historically been a stagnant market to an entirely new wave of\nfresh competition.\nThis new market entrance opportunity is further enhanced by shifts in the geopolitical landscape alongside architectural evolutions. Several vendors that once\ndominated the European and other markets have found themselves classified on the high-risk vendor register where resistance is increasingly emerging about\ntheir use in national network infrastructures. This further levels the playing field for the remaining vendor community. In their pursuit of efficiency, operators are\nembracing new architectures, reflecting those used throughout the web scale industry by the hyper-scalers. This is resulting in an additional inflection point\nwhere traditional access network equipment architectures are coming under increasing scrutiny about their longevity, efficiency and scalability.\nWe aim to serve as a trusted partner to our customers. Working side-by-side with our customers, we assist them with maximizing the performance of their\nnetworks by providing a flexible path for their networks to evolve cost effectively over to full fiber while availing themselves of the benefits that web scale\narchitectures deliver and helping to further monetize their investments.\nOur Strategy\nOur strategy is to provide innovative and cost-effective solutions for our customers that enable them to address their increasing broadband demand. Our\nsolutions focus on technology transformations that are happening in broadband network infrastructure, home and business CPE and software platforms, and\nservices needed to help our customers address increasing complexity while scaling to meet increasing consumer demands. ADVA’s technology complements\nADTRAN’s portfolio and significantly expands the solutions set we can offer to our customers, helping them in their quest to enable the rapidly advancing\ndigitalization of ecosystems around the world. Optical networking technology provides the scalable transmission capacity needed to handle bandwidth growth.\nCloud access solutions allow the flexible and fast deployment of new communication services including state-of-the-art edge computing solutions, and the\nsynchronization technology ensures maximum performance in the network.\nWe aspire to be one of the top communication technology players in the world and the innovation leader around the converged edge, enabling the intelligent,\nself-optimizing, fiber-everywhere future. We plan to achieve this goal through innovation in network, home and business technology paired with a customer-\nfocused organizational structure that tailors solutions to meet the needs of our target customers. ADTRAN has one of the most comprehensive solutions\nportfolios that empowers operators to build a converged infrastructure from the metro core to the customer premise, serving all networking applications for\nresidential, business, wholesale and mobile users. We take an approach to our portfolio in which we are focused in specific markets where we can offer\ncompetitive differentiation and scale while also having enough diversity and breadth in the portfolio to provide end-to-end connectivity solutions that offer value\nto our customers. More specifically, our corporate strategy consists of the following elements:\n• Leadership in fiber networking: Breadth of portfolio, open and advanced architecture, assured and secure connectivity.\n• Growth in focus markets: More turnkey solutions and in-region resources, especially North America and EMEA.\n• Investment in converged edge: Innovation in optics, security, AI-driven networking, virtualization, SaaS, etc.\n• Transformation through software: Open and cloud-centric systems, end-to-end programmability, simplification through software, and innovative\nSaaS offerings.\n14\n• Diversification of customers: Cross-selling current portfolio, acquisition of new customers and partners based on larger portfolio and trusted\nsupplier status.\n• Focus on sustainability: Science-based emissions targets, process-based product eco-design, optimization of operations, logistics and all\npackaging, circular-economy processes.\nCustomers\nWe have a diverse global customer base that includes Tier-1, -2 and -3 service providers, alternative service providers, such as utilities, municipalities and fiber\noverbuilders, cable/MSOs, SMBs and distributed enterprises. Many network operators require product approval before the purchase or installation of a product.\nThe nature of our business involves a dynamic process of submitting new and succeeding generations of products for approval prior to orders being placed.\nOne service provider customer individually comprised more than 10% of our revenue in 2022. Additionally, our revenue in the U.S., U.K. and Germany\ncomprised more than 10% of our revenue in 2022. The revenue from this service provider and these countries is reported in both our Network Solutions and\nServices & Support segments.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with customers, service providers and approval processes, see “Risk Factors – The lengthy sales and approval process\nrequired by service providers for new products could result in fluctuations in our revenue,” “Risk Factors – We depend heavily on sales to certain customers; the\nloss of any of these customers would significantly reduce our revenue and net income,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nDistribution, Sales and Marketing\nWe sell our products through our direct sales organization and our distribution network. Our direct sales organization supports major accounts and has offices in\ndomestic and international locations. Sales to most smaller and independent telephone companies are fulfilled through a combination of direct sales and\ndistributors. Our services offerings can be purchased directly from us or through one of our service providers, channel partners or distribution partners.\nBefore placing an order, service providers typically require lengthy product qualification and standardization processes that can extend for several months or\neven years. Once approved, product orders are typically placed under single or multi-year supply agreements that are generally not subject to minimum volume\ncommitments. Service providers generally prefer having two or more suppliers for most products. Therefore, individual orders are usually subject to competition\nbased on some combination of total value, service, price, delivery and other terms.\nOrders for end-user products are fulfilled through a combination of direct sales and distributors. This is supported by a direct sales organization for major\naccounts and a channel-based sales organization to facilitate sales to our partners. MSPs, VARs and SIs may be affiliated with us as channel partners, or they\nmay purchase from a distributor in an unaffiliated fashion. Affiliated partners participate with us at various program levels, based on sales volume and other\nfactors, to receive benefits such as product discounts, market development funds, technical support and training.\nOutside of the U.S., most service provider products are sold through our direct sales organization and end-user products are sold direct or through distribution\narrangements customized for each region. Some regions are supported from a field office that offers sales and support functions, and in some cases, warehousing\nand manufacturing support. Our field sales organizations, distributors and service provider customers receive support from regional-based marketing, sales and\ncustomer support groups.\n15\nOur marketing organization promotes all brands associated with us to key stakeholders, including customers, partners and prospects throughout the world.\nMarketing is complemented by product marketing and management teams that work with our engineering teams to develop and promote new products and\nservices, as well as product enhancements.\nResearch and Development\nRapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, supply constraints and continuing developments in\ncommunications service offerings characterize the markets for our products. Our on-going ability to adapt to these changes and to develop new and enhanced\nproducts that meet or anticipate market demand is the main factor influencing our competitive position and our ability to grow.\nOur product development activities are a central part of our strategy. We plan to maintain our emphasis on product development to enable us to respond to\nrapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. Our research and development and engineering functions are global. We maintain research and\ndevelopment functions at multiple sites in the U.S., Europe, Israel and Asia. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, research and\ndevelopment expenditures totaled $173.8 million, $108.7 million and $113.3 million, respectively.\nWe develop the majority of our products internally, and we also leverage partners for some solutions. Additionally, we license intellectual property or acquire\ntechnologies. Internal development on advanced technology products gives us more control over design and manufacturing issues, while for traditional designs,\nODM and/or licensed intellectual property provides us with the ability to leverage the economies of scale of our technology partners. This balanced approach\nensures we provide best-in-class solutions for our customers.\nAs we continue to create more software-based intellectual property, such as our SDN/NFV portfolio, our use of lean agile practices in research and development\nensures we remain responsive and customer-focused. This enables us to deliver products faster, at higher quality and more economically to our customers and\nthe market on a continuous basis.\nOur ability to continually reduce product costs, while focusing on delivery and quality, are important parts of our overall business strategy. Our product\ndevelopment efforts are often centered on entering a market with improved technology, enabling us to offer products at competitive prices and compete for\nmarket share. In 2022, we again encountered supply chain disruptions and component shortages, which resulted in us re-engineering many of our products to\nwork around component availability and end of life issues. See Inventory included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding our supply\nchain disruptions.\nDevelopment activities focus on solutions that support both existing and emerging communications industry technologies in segments that we consider viable\nrevenue opportunities. We are actively engaged in developing and refining technologies to support data, voice and video transport primarily over IP/Ethernet and\nOptical network architectures. This includes optical transport, packet demarcation and aggregation, synchronization and fiber-optic access, DSL, access routing,\nEthernet switching, wireless LANs, integrated access, converged services, VoIP, network management and professional services. In addition, we focus on\nvertical optical technologies like Silicon Photonics, as well as microelectronics in order to differentiate and fully control the vertical value stack of our solutions.\nIn 2022, we released many market-leading products like additions to our SDX OLT range, new residential gateway and ONT families, outdoor packet\ndemarcation devices, 100G packet demarcation, encryption/security products, 800G transport solutions and the unique Optical Cesium based atomic clocks.\nFurthermore, we enhanced our SaaS delivery abilities and Mosaic One software.\nOur research function and advanced technology team is driving many specific research projects in the fields of sustainable optical transmission, security,\nquantum communications, SDN and access technologies. It fosters differentiated product concepts and guides our various product design and engineering teams\nin IPR creation, industry and network standards and technological forecasting.\nWe are an active participant in several SDOs and have assisted with the development of worldwide standards in many technologies.\nOur SDO activities are primarily in the area of broadband access, optical networking and synchronization. This includes involvement with the ITU-T, ATIS,\nETSI, ONF and the BBF. We are involved in the evolution of optical access technologies on next-generation PON. We also continue to be involved in driving\noptical networking, synchronization and SDN standardization and participate in industry-wide interoperability, performance-testing and system-level projects\nrelated to those standards in e.g. BBF and ONF. We are also members of MEF, TIA, CableLabs and TIP.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with our research and development activities, see “Risk Factors – We must continue to update and improve our products and\ndevelop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology” and “Risk Factors – We engage in research and\ndevelopment activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application of developed technologies, and as a consequence may miss certain\nmarket opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially greater research and development effort and which may focus on more leading edge\ndevelopment,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\n16\nManufacturing and Operations\nThe principal steps in our manufacturing process include the purchase and management of materials, assembly, testing, final inspection, packing and shipping.\nWe purchase parts and components for the assembly of some products from a large number of suppliers through a worldwide sourcing program. Additionally, we\nmanage a process that identifies the components that are best purchased directly by contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of our products to achieve\nmanufacturing efficiency, quality and cost objectives. Certain key components used in our products are currently available from a single source, and other key\ncomponents are available from only a limited number of sources. In the past, we have experienced delays in the receipt of certain key components, which has\nresulted in delays in related product deliveries. We attempt to manage these risks through developing alternative sources, by staging inventories at strategic\nlocations, through engineering efforts designed to prevent the necessity of certain components and by maintaining close contact and building long-term\nrelationships with our suppliers. With the current global supply chain and transportation constraints, and limited availability of semiconductor chips and other\ncomponents of our products, we have experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times, increased logistics intervals and costs, and lower volume\nof products deliveries, which have and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on\ncustomer relations and our financial condition. We believe these supply chain challenges and their adverse impact on our industry will continue to ease during\n2023. See Inventory included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information.\nWe rely on subcontractors for assembly and testing of certain printed circuit board assemblies, sub-assemblies, chassis, enclosures and equipment shelves, and to\npurchase some of the raw materials used in such assemblies. We typically manufacture our lower-volume, higher-mix products and build and test product\nprototypes and many of our initial production units at our manufacturing site in Huntsville, Alabama. We later transfer the production of higher-volume, lower-\nmix assemblies to our subcontractors. Subcontract assembly operations can lengthen fulfillment cycle times, but we believe we can respond more rapidly to\nuncertainties in incoming order rates by selecting assembly subcontractors that have significant reserve capacity and flexibility. Our subcontractors have\ngenerally proven to be flexible and able to meet our quality requirements.\nWe ship the majority of products to our U.S. customers from our facilities in Huntsville, Alabama and Norcross, Georgia. The majority of international\ncustomers are being served from our logistics hubs in Meiningen, Germany and York, United Kingdom. We also ship directly from subcontractors to a number of\ncustomers in the U.S. and international locations. Most of our facilities are certified pursuant to the most current releases of ISO 9001, TL 9000, ISO 14001 and\nISO 27001. Our Huntsville, Alabama facilities and many of our key suppliers are C-TPAT certified. Our products are also certified to certain other customer,\nindustry and privacy standards, including those relating to emission of electromagnetic energy and safety specifications.\nOur dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products, combined with supply shortages, have\nprevented and may continue to prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on\noperating results and could have a material adverse effect on customer relations.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with manufacturing activities, see “Risk Factors – Our strategy of outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing requirements\nto subcontractors located in various international regions may result in us not meeting our cost, quality or performance standards” and “Risk Factors – Our\ndependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products, combined with supply shortages, have prevented\nand may continue to prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on operating\nresults and could have a material adverse effect on customer relations,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nCompetition\nWe compete in markets for networking and communications services and solutions for service providers, businesses, government agencies and other\norganizations worldwide. Our products and services provide solutions supporting voice, data and video communications across fiber-, copper-, coaxial- and\nwireless-based infrastructure, as well as across wide area networks, local area networks and the internet.\nWe compete with a number of companies in the markets we serve. In the Subscriber Solutions & Experience category, our primary competitors include Calix,\nCisco, CommScope, Juniper Networks, Ribbon Communications. In our Access & Aggregation solutions category, key competitors include Calix, Casa Systems,\nCiena, CommScope, DZS, Harmonic, Huawei, Nokia, Reliance/Radisys, Vecima Networks and ZTE. Main competitors of our Optical Networking solutions\nportfolio are Ciena, Cisco, Ekinops, Huawei, Infinera, Nokia, Ribbon and ZTE.\nAcross our markets and segments, the principal competitive factors can include, among others:\n• differentiated feature functionality of our products and solutions;\n• price performance of our solutions and lowest total cost of ownership for customers;\n• quality and reliability of our products;\n17\n• financial stability and health of our company;\n• ability to manage supply chains and produce and deliver products in accordance with customer wish date;\n• ability to innovate and provide customers with differentiated solutions, advantageous to their business model;\n• compelling technology roadmap and R&D power;\n• industry thought leadership and time to market with innovative solutions;\n• country of origin for products and solutions and trusted supplier status;\n• security of enterprise value chain, from design to product development, support processes, to products and solutions;\n• energy consumption of our products and commitment to sustainability, supporting customers in achieving their climate goals;\n• customer relationship and incumbency;\n• ability to deliver comprehensive solutions with a high degree of automation and ease-of-use, including hardware, software and services; and\n• broad range of services and support capabilities.\nFor further discussion of risks associated with our competition, see “Risk Factors – We must continue to update and improve our products and develop new\nproducts to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology” and “Risk Factors – We compete in markets that have become\nincreasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and market share,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nSeasonality\nWe experience quarterly fluctuations in our revenue that occur due to many factors, including the varying budget cycles and seasonal buying patterns of our\ncustomers. More specifically, our customers tend to spend less in the first fiscal quarter as they are finalizing their annual capital spending budgets. These\nseasonal effects may continue to vary and do not always correlate to our operating results. Accordingly, they should not be considered a reliable indicator of our\nfuture revenue or operating results. Additionally, the effects of the dynamic supply and demand environment we have experienced in recent periods may impact\nthe traditional seasonality in our business.\nForeign Currency\nTransactions with customers that are denominated in foreign currencies are recorded using the appropriate exchange rates from throughout the year. Assets and\nliabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the balance sheet dates using the closing rates of exchange between those foreign currencies and\nthe functional currency with any transaction gains or losses reported in other income (expense). Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate\nmovements are with the Euro and the British pound sterling. Adjustments resulting from translating financial statements of international subsidiaries are\nrecorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.\nInventory\nA substantial portion of our shipments in any fiscal period relates to orders received and shipped within that fiscal period for customers under agreements\ncontaining non-binding purchase commitments. Further, a significant percentage of orders require delivery within a few days. However, with the current global\nsupply chain and transportation constraints, and limited availability of semiconductor chips and other components of our products, we have experienced and may\ncontinue to experience extended lead times, increased logistics intervals and costs, and lower volume of products deliveries, which have had and may continue to\nhave a material adverse effect on our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our customer relations and our financial condition.\nWe have seen increased demand for our products due to the Business Combination with ADVA, increased volume of sales activity to service provider customers\nand as a result of customer strategies designed to mitigate supply constraints and assure access to needed products. To meet this demand, we have enhanced and\nimplemented supply chain management systems and processes to manage the materials planning and production processes. We maintain substantial inventories\nof raw materials for long lead time components to support this demand and avoid expedite fees. In the current environment, our raw material inventory has\ngrown due to increased purchases in preparation for strategic inventory buffer purchases as well as new product ramp ups to ensure supply continuity during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. We expect inventory levels to fluctuate as we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory in response to COVID-19 uncertainties related to\nsupply chain and supply, seasonal cycles of our business and ensuring competitive lead times while managing the risk of inventory. We also maintain substantial\nfinished goods inventories. Our practice of maintaining sufficient inventory levels to\n18\nassure prompt delivery of our products and services increases the amount of inventory that may be considered excess and/or obsolete. This excess and obsolete\ninventory may require us to write down the value of the inventory, which may have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nFor further discussion of risks associated with managing our inventory, see “Risk Factors – Managing our inventory is complex and may include write-downs of\nexcess or obsolete inventory,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\n19\nGovernment Regulation\nOur products must comply with various regulations and standards established by communications authorities in various countries, as well as those of certain\ninternational bodies. Environmental legislation within the EU may increase our cost of doing business as we amend our products to comply with these\nrequirements. For example, the EU issued the RoHS directive, the WEEE directive and the REACH regulation. We continue to implement measures to comply\nwith these and other similar directives and regulations from additional countries.\nWe strive to deliver innovative network access solutions that lower the total cost and reduce the time of deploying services, increase the level of performance\nachievable with established infrastructures, reduce operating and capital expenses for our customers, increase network bandwidth and functionality, and extend\nnetwork reach. Our development process is conducted in accordance with ISO 9001, TL 9000, ISO 14001, and ISO 27001, all of which are international\nstandards for quality and environmental management systems. We strive to ensure that our corporate practices also conform to GDPR requirements, which\nprotect digital data for all EU residents, and to other applicable data protection laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act. To date, our compliance\nactions and costs relating to these laws, rules and regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive\nposition.\nFor further discussion of risks associated with government regulation, see “Risk Factors – We are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws,\nregulations and standards governing the conduct of our business. Violations of these laws and regulations may harm our business, subject us to penalties and to\nother adverse consequences.”\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance\nWe believe that as we follow our corporate vision to enable a fully connected world, we must continue to be responsible corporate citizens. As more people are\nconnected, work and life can be accomplished using fewer resources. We have established ESG and Sustainability programs and policies that encompass the\nelements of Environmental, Health & Safety, Ethics, Labor, and Management Systems in alignment with the ISO 26000 Guidelines. We are committed to\noperating in full compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of all the countries in which we operate. The major aims of our program are eliminating waste\nand emissions, maximizing energy efficiency and productivity and minimizing practices that can adversely affect utilization of natural resources by coming\ngenerations. Our ESG programs are important to us. ESG is a dedicated focus throughout the company. We have Board oversight including an ESG Committee,\nstrong management support and engagement from our employees.\nAreas of focus in our environmental sustainability program include:\n• established an ESG Committee of the Board of Directors;\n• maintained our mature environmental management system certified to ISO 14001 from 2006;\n• advanced our Energy Management program where we have continually set targets for reduced energy and water consumption since 2005;\n• continued investment in Wind Renewable Energy Credits;\n• purchased certified carbon offsets to achieve net zero for our Scope 1 emissions;\n• continued to monitor and report our carbon emissions to CDP;\n• adopted a platform to engage top suppliers to obtain an ESG assessment aligned with international standards, allowing us to monitor ESG risks in\nour supply chain;\n• the Technology organization established Eco-Design guidelines;\n• completed an initial Life Cycle Assessment pilot;\n• initiated innovative packaging solutions to reduce materials and waste;\n• committed to SBTi for Net Zero targets within the next two years;\n• increased visibility of our program internally and externally through customer engagement, joining peer sustainability groups, offering training to\nteam members and web site enhancements;\n• implemented GRI standards; and\n• actively engaged our stakeholders with investor and supply chain assessments\n20\nFor further discussion of risks associated with government regulation, see “Risk Factors – Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance\nconsiderations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.”\nESG Report\nDue to certain regulations, proceedings of the merger and the operations of ADTRAN and ADVA during 2022 there will be separate reports published for the\ntwo organizations. These ESG reports provide additional information regarding ADTRAN Holding’s ESG program. Within the report is information on our\nenvironmental programs, initiatives related to our people and our community. This information can be found on our website at: www.adtran.com/en/about-\nus/esg/environmental. No information contained on our website is intended to be included as part of, or incorporated by reference into, this report.\nHuman Capital\nWe believe that our most valuable asset is our people. To ensure we continue to succeed, our objective is to be able to recruit, hire and retain top talent. Our\nability to attract and retain a high-quality workforce is dependent on our ability to maintain a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace that provides\nopportunities for our employees to learn and grow in their careers. This is supported by competitive compensation and benefits, along with strong community\nservice and other programs that enable employees to build connections within the community.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 3,307 full-time employees, with 1,417 in the U.S. and 1,890 in our international subsidiaries located in North America, Latin\nAmerica, EMEA and APAC regions. 1,948 of these full-time employees are employees of ADVA and its subsidiaries. We also utilized 177 contractors and\nnumerous temporary employees domestically and internationally in various manufacturing, engineering, sales and general and administrative capacities. We\nbelieve that our relationship with our employees is good. We have a diverse employee base located in 37 countries. We pride ourselves on a highly educated\nworkforce, and the majority of our employees serve in engineering, information technology and technical roles within the organization.\nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately 170 employees (75%) of ADTRAN GmbH were subject to collective bargaining agreements of either the Association\nof Metal and Electrical Industry in Berlin and Brandenburg e.V. or NORDMETALL Association of Metal and Electrical Industry e.V. Although these collective\nbargaining agreements will expire on September 30, 2024, negotiations with the employees of ADTRAN GmbH for a new collective bargaining agreement are\nongoing and we have not experienced any work stoppage. As of December 31, 2022, ADVA had 85 employees in Switzerland, France, Italy, Finland and Spain\nthat were subject to collective bargaining agreements of different associations. None of our other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.\nAdditionally, we continually work to recruit technical talent in diverse communities through our cooperative education program. This program seeks to identify\ncollege students that major in relevant technological areas and expose them to our work environment on an alternating semester basis. Our goal is to retain as\nmany of these students as possible for full-time employment after graduation building our organization's future.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe believe that maintaining a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to the success of our business. We encourage an environment where individuality is\nembraced regardless of age, gender, identity, race, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, ethnicity and perspective and where each employee is accepted\nand respected and can, therefore, bring their most authentic self to work.\nIn addition to diversity in our workforce, we seek to ensure diversity in our Board of Directors with respect to skills, experience, gender, race and ethnicity. Our\nBoard of Directors is comprised of nine members, three of which are females and three of which are ethnically diverse. Additionally, the Board of Directors has\na diversity of skills and experience with respect to accounting and finance, management and leadership, vision and strategy, business operations, business\njudgment, crisis management, risk assessment, industry knowledge, corporate governance and global markets.\nHealth, Safety and Wellness\nThe well-being of our employees is paramount to the continued success of our business. To this end, we are committed to each of our employees' health, safety\nand wellness. We provide our employees with access to various health and wellness benefits designed to enable them and their family members to have\naffordable access to health, dental and vision insurance. Additionally, we offer access to many programs that provide additional monetary support in the event of\na qualifying incident, including accident insurance, life insurance and hospital indemnity insurance, among others. We understand that mental health is an\nessential aspect of our employees’ wellbeing. As a result, we offer an employee assistance program at no charge to employees and their family members. This\nprogram provides access to qualified personnel to address various issues such as grief, financial stress, family and emotional issues.\n21\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that were determined to be in the best interest of our employees and the\ncommunities in which we operate. We introduced enhanced health and safety standards that are in compliance with, or exceed, local, state and federal\nrecommendations and regulations in the U.S. and at our international locations. This includes having our global employees work from home, hybrid or on-site. In\nareas where it is necessary to have critical, on-site personnel, such as at our manufacturing facilities, additional health and safety measures have been\nimplemented to provide the safest environment possible for these workers.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe continually work to provide a competitive compensation and benefits program as this plays a key role in our ability to attract and retain a highly skilled\nworkforce. In addition to salaries, these programs, which vary by country/region, include long-term equity incentive awards with certain vesting requirements,\ndeferred compensation plans (which are offered to certain members of executive management), a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings\nand flexible spending accounts, paid time off, paid volunteer time off, employee assistance program and tuition assistance. Additionally, at our global\nheadquarters in Alabama, we offer our employees certain on-site services, including nurse practitioner care and a fitness center, among others.\nTalent Development\nWe invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain a market-leading global supplier of broadband infrastructure. We offer numerous training\nopportunities on both technical and professional development topics. We utilize tools and processes to provide performance feedback which helps develop high\npotential employees into becoming our future leaders.\nOur Career Development Program provides an opportunity for employees to shape their career journey. The program provides opportunities for employees to\ndevelop competencies in areas including technology, business acumen, emotional intelligence, design and systems thinking. As employees increase their\ncompetencies in these areas and master skills within their individual roles, this program offers a variety of career advancement paths. Employees also have\naccess to the ADTRAN Learning Network. This platform houses all required training, as well as optional training in a variety of areas.\nIntellectual Property\nADTRAN develops and owns a significant amount of intellectual property. We hold over 1,000 patents worldwide related to our products and over 50 additional\npending patent applications. Our patents expire at various dates between 2023 and 2041. We continue to seek additional patents related to our research and\ndevelopment activities. We do not derive any material amount of revenue from the licensing of our patents.\nThe ADTRAN corporate logo is a registered trademark of ours, as is the name “ADTRAN”, “SmartRG” and a number of our product identifiers and names. We\nalso claim rights to a number of unregistered trademarks.\nWe protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights in accordance with good legal and business practices. We believe, however, that our competitive\nsuccess will not fully depend on the ownership of intellectual property, but instead will depend primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and\nmarketing abilities of our personnel.\nThe communications industry is characterized by the existence of an ever-increasing volume of patent litigation and licensing activities. We have received, and\nmay continue to receive, notices of claims alleging that we are infringing upon patents or other intellectual property. We cannot predict whether we will prevail\nin any claims or litigation over alleged infringements, or whether we will be able to license any valid and infringed patents, or other intellectual property, on\ncommercially reasonable terms. It is possible that such litigation may result in significant legal costs and judgments and that intellectual property infringement\nclaims, or related litigation against or by us could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property and proprietary rights, see “Risk Factors – Our failure to maintain rights to intellectual\nproperty used in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality, and commercial value of our products” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\n22\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nSet forth below is certain information regarding our current executive officers.

RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves substantial risks. Any of the risk factors described below or elsewhere in this report could significantly and adversely affect our business\nprospects, financial condition and results of operations. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not\npresently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect us.\nRisks related to the Business Combination and DPLTA\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated strategic and financial benefits sought from the Business Combination.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination. The success of the Business Combination will depend on, among other things,\nour ability to combine our business with ADVA’s business in a manner that facilitates growth as a provider of fiber networking solutions and realizes anticipated\ncost savings. We believe that the Business Combination provides an opportunity for revenue growth in optical transport solutions, fiber access solutions and\nsubscriber solutions.\nAdditionally, our ability to realize anticipated benefits of the Business Combination could be affected by a number of other factors, including: the need for\ngreater than expected cash or other financial resources or management time in order to integrate ADVA; increases in other expenses related to the Business\nCombination, including restructuring and other exit costs; the timing and impact of purchase accounting adjustments; accounting for IFRS to U.S. GAAP\nadjustments; difficulties in employee or management integration; the impact of appraisal proceedings in connection with the DPLTA; and unanticipated\nliabilities associated with the Business Combination. Any potential cost-saving opportunities may take several years following the Business Combination to\nimplement, and any results of these actions may not be realized for several years thereafter, if at all.\nHowever, we must successfully combine the business in a manner that permits these anticipated benefits to be realized. In addition, we must achieve the\nanticipated growth and cost savings without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. Further, providing integrated fiber\nnetworking solutions can be highly complex and can involve the design, development, implementation and operation of new solutions and the transitioning of\nclients from traditional platforms to new platforms. If we are not able to effectively provide different solutions and successfully achieve the growth and cost\nsavings objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nWe have experienced operational challenges and may also experience negative synergies and loss of customers.\nIntegrating the operations and personnel of the ADTRAN and ADVA businesses involves complex operational, technological and personnel-related challenges.\nThis process has been and will continue to be time-consuming and expensive, and it has and may continue to disrupt our business. Difficulties in the integration\nof the business, which may result in significant costs and delays, include:\n• managing a significantly larger company;\n• integrating and unifying the offerings and services available to customers and coordinating distribution and marketing efforts;\n• coordinating corporate and administrative infrastructures and harmonizing insurance coverage;\n• unanticipated issues in coordinating accounting, information technology, communications, administration and other systems;\n• difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n• challenges associated with converting ADVA's financial reporting from international financial reporting standards (IFRS) to accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the U.S. (U.S GAAP) and compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules promulgated\nthereunder by the SEC;\n• legal and regulatory compliance;\n• dual market filing and publications obligations;\n• creating and implementing uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n• litigation relating to the transactions contemplated by a reorganization, including shareholder litigation;\n• diversion of management’s attention from other operations;\n• maintaining existing agreements and relationships with customers, distributors, providers and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new\nagreements with prospective customers, distributors, providers and vendors;\n• realizing the benefits from our restructuring programs;\n24\n• unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the Business Combination, including the risk that certain executive officers may be subject to\nadditional fiduciary duties and liability;\n• identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming functions and assets;\n• effecting actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals; and\n• a deterioration of credit ratings.\nWe have and may continue to lose customers or our share of customers’ business as entities that were customers of both ADTRAN and AVDA seek to diversify\ntheir suppliers of services and products.\n25\nThe terms of the DPLTA may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition.\nOn January 16, 2023, the DPLTA with ADVA became effective. The DPLTA allows us to issue binding instructions to the management board of ADVA, which\ncould be disadvantageous to ADVA and result in a decline in the business and earnings power of ADVA. This could have a material adverse effect on the assets,\nfinancial position and income of ADVA, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the terms of the DPLTA, each ADVA shareholder (other than the Company) has received an offer to elect either (1) to remain an ADVA\nshareholder and receive from us an Annual Recurring Compensation payment, or (2) to receive Exit Compensation. Assuming all of the minority holders of\ncurrently outstanding ADVA shares were to elect the second option, we would be obligated to make aggregate Exit Compensation payments of approximately\nEUR 310.6 million or approximately $333.2 million. based on an exchange rate as of December 31, 2022. Shareholders electing the first option of Annual\nRecurring Compensation may later elect the second option. The opportunity for outside ADVA shareholders to tender ADVA shares in exchange for Exit\nCompensation expires on March 16, 2023 (subject to appraisal proceedings). Our obligation to pay Annual Recurring Compensation under the DPLTA would\nlead to a continuing payment obligation, which would amount to approximately EUR $10.6 million, or $11.4 million based on the current exchange rate, per year\nassuming none of the minority ADVA shareholders were to elect Exit Compensation. The foregoing amounts do not reflect any potential increase in payment\nobligations that we may have depending on the outcome of ongoing appraisal proceedings in Germany.\nThe amount of this Annual Recurring Compensation payment obligation pursuant to the DPLTA could exceed the amount of dividends that otherwise might be\ndistributed by ADVA to minority shareholders and would even have to be paid if ADVA incurs losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our\nfinancial results and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to additional litigation risk and uncertainty with respect to the remaining minority shareholders of ADVA, which litigation may require us to\npay a higher purchase price for additional ADVA shares than the amount provided for under the DPLTA.\nAs a result of the Business Combination, we continue to be exposed to litigation risk and uncertainty associated with the remaining minority shareholders of\nADVA. The terms of the DPLTA, including the adequacy of compensation payments to minority ADVA shareholders under the terms of the DPLTA, have been\nchallenged by minority shareholders of ADVA by initiating court-led appraisal proceedings under German law. We cannot rule out that the competent court in\nthese appraisal proceedings may adjudicate higher Exit Compensation or Annual Recurring Compensation payment obligations (in each case, including interest\nthereon) than agreed upon in the DPLTA, the financial impact and timing of which is uncertain.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant transaction fees and costs in connection with the Business Combination and post-closing\nintegration efforts.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur a number of significant non-recurring implementation and restructuring costs associated with combining the\noperations of ADTRAN and ADVA. In addition, we have incurred significant banking, legal, accounting and other transaction fees and costs related to the\nBusiness Combination. As of December 31, 2022, we have incurred $26.1 million of transaction costs related to the Business Combination.\nWe expect to incur additional integration costs, as well costs associated with the implementation of the DPLTA and such costs are expected to be material.\nAny cost savings or other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses that could offset these transaction- and combination-related costs over time may\nnot be achieved in the near term, or at all. In addition, the timeline in which cost savings are expected to be realized is lengthy and may not be achieved. Failure\nto realize these synergies and cost reductions and other efficiencies in a timely manner or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business and cash\nflows, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness in connection with the Business Combination and the DPLTA. Our failure to meet our debt service\nobligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSubsequent to the closing of the Business Combination, we entered into a new credit facility providing for borrowings of up to $400 million and under which we\nhave incurred $60.0 million of indebtedness as of December 31, 2022. Subsequent to the closing of the Business Combination, ADVA entered into a new\nrevolving line of credit with Norddeutsche Landesbank - Girozentrale which it subsequently repaid and terminated, and a revolving line of credit with DZ Bank.\nAs of December 31, 2022, ADVA had borrowings of $16.1 million and $9.1 million of borrowings under the two revolving lines of credit, respectively.\nAdditionally, subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company borrowed an additional $127.5 million under the new credit facility, a portion of which was used\nto pay down and retire ADVA's notes payable and credit facility agreements except for ADVA's new revolving line of credit with DZ Bank, which remains\noutstanding. See “Cash Requirements” in Part I, Item 7 of this report for additional information.\nOur increased indebtedness could adversely affect our operations and liquidity. Our level of indebtedness could, among other things:\n26\n• make it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because we may\nnot have sufficient cash flows to make its scheduled debt payments;\n• cause us to use a larger portion of our cash flow to fund interest and principal payments, reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital,\ncapital expenditures, research and development and other business activities;\n• make it more difficult for us to continue to pay the current dividend or cause us to reduce the dividend paid to the Company's stockholders;\n• limit our ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or\nindustry conditions;\n• cause us to be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n• cause us to be disadvantaged compared to competitors with less leverage; and\n• limit our ability to borrow additional money in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development and other\ngeneral corporate purposes.\nOur ability to satisfy our debt obligations and renew the credit facility is dependent upon our future performance and other risk factors discussed in this section.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. In addition, the credit agreement governing our indebtedness\ncontains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants\ncould result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all its debt.\nWe may also incur additional long-term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would increase our total indebtedness.\nAlthough the terms of its existing and future credit agreements and of the indentures governing its debt contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt,\nincluding secured debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be\nsubstantial. If we or our restricted subsidiaries incur significant additional debt, the related risks that we face could intensify.\nWe may be unable to successfully retain and motivate our personnel, including personnel at ADVA.\nThe success of the Business Combination and our post-closing integration efforts depends, in part, on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key\nemployees, including key decision-makers, currently employed by ADTRAN, Inc. and ADVA. Some of our employees have decided and others may decide not\nto remain with us as a result of the Business Combination. If key employees terminate their employment, or if an insufficient number of employees are retained\nto maintain effective operations, our business activities may be adversely affected and management’s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating\nADTRAN and ADVA to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause our business to deteriorate. We may not be able to locate suitable replacements for\nany key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms. In addition, we may not be able to motivate certain key\nemployees due to organizational changes, reassignments of responsibilities, the perceived lack of appropriate opportunities for advancement or other reasons. If\nwe fail to successfully retain and motivate our employees, relevant capabilities and expertise may be lost which may have an adverse effect on our cash flows,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and the business operations in general.\nThe terms of our and ADVA's credit agreements restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain\nactions.\nOur Credit Agreement and ADVA's revolving line of credit with DZ Bank contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and\nfinancial restrictions on us and/or our subsidiaries and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on\nour and/or our subsidiaries' ability to:\n• incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n• pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n• prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n• issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;\n• make loans and investments;\n• sell assets;\n• incur liens;\n• enter into transactions with affiliates;\n27\n• alter the businesses we conduct; and\n• consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in such credit facilities require us and/or our subsidiaries to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial\ncondition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to meet them.\nA breach of the covenants or restrictions under such credit facilities could result in an event of default. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the\nrelated debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default\nunder such credit facilities would permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the applicable facility. Furthermore, if we were\nunable to repay the amounts due and payable under such credit facilities, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted them to secure that\nindebtedness. In the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay\nthat indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n• limited in how we conduct our business;\n• unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; and\n• unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\n28\nThese restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy. In addition, our financial results, our substantial indebtedness and our credit\nratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing.\nWe could be required to recognize impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets.\nThe Business Combination added a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets to our consolidated balance sheets. In accordance with U.S.\nGAAP, management periodically assesses these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our\nbusiness, the inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, the underperformance of our business as compared to management’s initial expectations,\nunexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures, and market capitalization declines may impair goodwill and other intangible\nassets. Any charges relating to such impairments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the periods\nrecognized.\nNegative publicity related to integration measures may adversely affect us.\nPolitical and public sentiment in connection with post-closing integration measures following the Business Combination may result in a significant amount of\nadverse press coverage and other adverse public statements. Adverse press coverage and public statements, whether or not driven by political or popular\nsentiment, may also result in legal claims or in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials. Responding to these investigations and\nlawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceedings, can divert the time and effort of senior management from operating the business. Addressing any\nadverse publicity, governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings could be time-consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis\nfor the assertions being made, could have a negative impact on our reputation, on the morale and performance of our employees and on our relationships with\nregulators, suppliers and customers. It may also have a negative impact on our ability to take timely advantage of various business and market opportunities. The\ndirect and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash\nflows, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to our financial results and Company success\nOur revenue for a particular period can be difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.\nAs a result of the many factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict and will fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nTypically, our customers request product delivery within a short period following our receipt of an order. Consequently, we do not typically carry a significant\norder backlog and are dependent upon obtaining orders and completing delivery in accordance with shipping terms that are predominantly within each quarter to\nachieve our targeted revenue. Supply of semiconductor chips and other components of our products has become constrained resulting in extended lead times and\nincreased costs. Transportation constraints, including shortages for both air and surface freight, as well as labor shortages in the transportation industry, have also\naffected the timing and the cost of obtaining raw materials and production supplies. As a result, our gross margin percentage declined in the second half of 2021\nand throughout 2022. If supply chain constraints and transportation constraints continue, it could cause our net revenue and gross profit to decline or to grow at a\nslower rate than in previous quarters. Our deployment/installation cycle can also vary depending on the customer’s schedule, site readiness, network size and\ncomplexity and other factors, which can cause our revenue to fluctuate from period to period. Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be affected if\nthe variable revenue patterns seen in prior quarters recur in future quarters. We have experienced periods of time during which manufacturing issues have\ndelayed shipments, leading to variable shipping patterns. In addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages continue to\nresult in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in quarters in which we and our subcontractors are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible\nthat revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected, and we may not be able to remediate the conditions within the same quarter. Currently, our revenue growth\nand profitability in the near-term are being impacted by supply chain constraint issues. While we are working closely with our suppliers and customers to address\nthe near-term supply chain challenges facing the industry and believe these challenges will continue to lessen and will begin to normalize during 2023, there can\nbe no assurance this will be the case.\nIn the past, under certain market conditions, long manufacturing lead times have caused our customers to place the same order multiple times. When multiple\nordering occurs, along with other factors, it may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and, as a result, could impair our ability to manage inventory\neffectively.\nWe plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively\nfixed in the short term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed\nexpenses in response to short-term business changes.\nThe lengthy sales and approval process required by service providers for new products could result in fluctuations in our revenue.\nIn the industry in which we compete, sales and approval cycles are often lengthy. Selling efforts often involve a significant commitment of time and resources by\nus and our customers that may include extensive product testing, laboratory or network certification, or region-specific product certification and homologation\nrequirements for deployment in networks. Additionally, a supplier must first obtain product approval from a major or other service provider to sell its products to\nthese service providers. This process can last from six to\n29\neighteen months, or longer, depending on the technology, the service provider and the demand for the product from the service provider’s subscribers.\nConsequently, we are involved in a constant process of submitting for approval succeeding generations of products, as well as products that deploy new\ntechnology or respond to new technology demands from a major or other service provider. We have been successful in the past in obtaining these approvals;\nhowever, we cannot be certain that we will obtain these approvals in the future or that sales of these products will continue to occur. Any attempt by a major or\nother service provider to seek out additional or alternative suppliers, or to undertake, as permitted under applicable regulations, the production of these products\ninternally, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Furthermore, the delay in sales until the completion of the approval process, the length\nof which is difficult to predict, could result in fluctuations of revenue and uneven operating results from quarter to quarter or year to year. Further, once customer\napproval or certifications are met, our supply chain customers typically do not guarantee us a minimum, or any, volume of sales. We are dependent on individual\npurchase orders as discussed elsewhere in this report.\nWe depend heavily on sales to certain customers; the loss of any of these customers or a significant project would significantly reduce our revenue and net\nincome.\nHistorically, a large percentage of our revenue has been made to major service providers and larger independent communications companies. As long as the\nmajor and larger independent communications companies represent such a substantial percentage of our total revenue, our future success will significantly\ndepend upon certain factors which are not within our control, including:\n• the timing and size of future purchase orders, if any, from these customers;\n• changes in strategic plans and capital budgets of these customers;\n• the product requirements of these customers;\n• the subscriber take rate, including subscriber loss or churn, of our customers;\n• the financial and operational success of these customers;\n• the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on these customers;\n• consolidation, acquisition of, or corporate reorganization among these customers;\n• the success of these customers' services deployed using our products; and\n• the impact of work stoppages at these customers.\nIn the past, revenue to our large customers have fluctuated, and may fluctuate in the future, significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. The loss of, or\na significant reduction or delay in, revenue to any such customer or the occurrence of revenue fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business\nand results of operations. Further, any attempt by a major or other service provider to seek out additional or alternative suppliers or to undertake, as permitted\nunder applicable regulations, the production of these products internally, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or\nhold their market positions or are unable to continue operations. This could lead to variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, operating results, financial condition and cash flow. In addition, particularly in the service provider market, rapid consolidation will lead to fewer\ncustomers, with the effect that a loss of a major customer could have a material impact on our results that we would not have anticipated in a marketplace\ncomposed of more numerous participants.\nOur exposure to the credit risks of our customers and distributors may make it difficult to collect accounts receivable and could adversely affect our\noperating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nMost of our revenue is made on an open credit basis, generally with payment terms of 30 to 45 days in the U.S. and typically 45 to 60 days in many geographic\nmarkets outside the U.S. As our international revenue grows, our total accounts receivable balance has increased and will likely continue to increase. Our DSO\ncould also increase as a result of a greater mix of international revenue. Additionally, international laws may not provide the same degree of protection against\ndefaults on accounts receivable as provided under U.S. laws governing domestic transactions; therefore, as our international business grows, we may be subject\nto higher bad debt expense compared to historical trends. Overall, we monitor individual customer and distributor payment capability in granting such open\ncredit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts that we believe customers and distributors can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate\nto cover exposure for credit losses and other macroeconomic indicators. In the course of our sales to customers and distributors, we may encounter difficulty\ncollecting accounts receivable and could be exposed to risks associated with uncollectible accounts receivable due to various reasons, including potential\ndeclining operating cash flows or bankruptcy filings. While we attempt to monitor these situations carefully and attempt to take appropriate measures to collect\naccounts receivable balances, there are no assurances we can avoid write-downs and/or write-offs of accounts receivable as a result of declining financial\nconditions for our customers, including bankruptcy. Such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they\noccur and could potentially have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n30\nWe expect gross margins to continue to vary over time, and our levels of product and services gross margins may not be sustainable.\nOur level of gross margins may not be sustainable and has been and may continue to be adversely affected by numerous factors, including:\n• changes in customer, geographic or product or services mix, including software and the mix of configurations and professional services revenue\nwithin each product segment;\n• mix of domestic versus international revenue;\n• introduction of new products by competitors, including products with price-performance advantages;\n• our ability to reduce product cost;\n• increases in labor or material cost, including increases in material costs resulting from inflation or tariffs;\n• foreign currency exchange rate movements;\n• expediting costs incurred to meet customer delivery requirements;\n• excess inventory and inventory holding charges;\n• excess and obsolescence charges;\n• changes in shipment volume;\n• our ability to absorb fixed manufacturing costs during short-term fluctuations in customer demand;\n• loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly\nanticipate product demand;\n• lower than expected benefits from value engineering;\n• increased price competition, including competitors from Asia, specifically China;\n• changes in distribution channels;\n• increased warranty cost or quality issues;\n• liquidated damages costs relating to customer contractual terms;\n• our ability to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations relating to our revenue or cost of revenue;\n• slowdowns, recessions, economic instability, political unrest, armed conflicts (such as the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine), or outbreaks of\ndisease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, around the world; and\n• Business Combination purchase price allocations.\nFor example, since the third quarter of 2021 and continuing throughout 2022, we have incurred and may continue to incur supply chain constraint expenses,\nincluding price inflation for certain electronic components, semiconductor chips and transportation related costs, which have lowered our gross margins and\ndecreased our profitability.\nOur dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products, combined with supply shortages, have\nprevented and may continue to prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect\non operating results and could have a material adverse effect on customer relations.\nThe fact that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results.\nThe financial problems of our suppliers and industry consolidation occurring within one or more component supplier markets, such as the semiconductor market,\nin each case, could either limit supply or increase costs.\nA reduction or interruption in supply, including disruptions on our global supply chain, caused in part by public health emergencies (including the COVID-19\npandemic), geopolitical tensions (including as a result of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and China-Taiwan relations) or a significant natural disaster (including\nas a result of climate change); a significant increase in the price of one or more components (including as a result of inflation); a failure to adequately authorize\nprocurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers; a failure to appropriately cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs; or\na decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage\ncustomer relationships. Furthermore, as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase raw materials or\ncomponents at prices that are higher than those available in the current market. In the event that we become committed to\n31\npurchasing raw materials or components at prices in excess of the current market price when the raw materials or components are actually used, our gross\nmargins could decrease.\nIn addition, certain raw materials and key components used in our products are currently available from only one source, and others are available from only a\nlimited number of sources. The availability of these raw materials and supplies may be subject to market forces beyond our control, such as inflation, merger and\nacquisition activity of our suppliers and consolidation in some segments of our supplier base. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience\nincreased inflationary pressures on input costs, such as, raw materials, supplies, labor and distribution costs to increase. Our attempts to offset these cost\npressures, through increases in the selling prices of some of our products, may not be successful and could negatively affect our operating results. In addition,\nfrom time to time, there may not be sufficient quantities of raw materials and supplies in the marketplace to meet customer demand. For example, wafer\nfoundries that support chipmakers have not invested enough in recent years to increase capacities to the levels need to support demand from all of their\ncustomers and wafers have a long lead time for production, in some cases in excess of 30 weeks, which has led to a recent shortage in chip supplies. Many\ncompanies utilize the same raw materials and supplies that we do in the production of their products. Suppliers may be under pressure to allocate product to\ncertain customers for business, regulatory or political reasons, and/or demand changes in agreed pricing as a condition of supply. As a result, companies with\nmore resources than our own may have a competitive advantage in obtaining raw materials and supplies. These factors have resulted in reduced supply, higher\nprices of raw materials and delays in the receipt of certain of our key components, which in turn has generated increased costs, lower margins and delays in\nproduct delivery, with a corresponding adverse effect on revenue. Delays in product deliveries and corresponding product price increases may likewise have an\nadverse effect on customer relationships. We attempt to manage these risks through developing alternative sources, by staging inventories at strategic locations,\nthrough engineering efforts designed to obviate the necessity of certain components and by building long-term relationships and close contact with each of our\nkey suppliers; however, we cannot assure that delays in or failures of deliveries of key components, either to us or to our contract manufacturers, and consequent\ndelays in product deliveries, will not continue to occur in the future. In addition, our supply chain challenges are forcing us to devote a substantial portion of our\nresearch and development expenses to redesign existing products, reducing our capacity to develop new products. For a discussion of the impact of the COVID-\n19 pandemic on our supply chain, see “- The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition, particularly our supply chain and workforce.”\nWe believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future: new markets in which we participate may grow quickly, which may make it\ndifficult to quickly obtain significant raw materials and/or components; as we acquire companies and new technologies, we may be dependent on unfamiliar\nsupply chains or relatively small supply partners; and we face competition for certain raw materials or components that are supply-constrained from existing\ncompetitors and companies in other markets.\nWe compete in markets that have become increasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and market share.\nThe markets for our products are intensely competitive. New manufacturers have entered the markets in recent years to offer products in competition with us.\nAdditionally, certain companies have, in recent years, developed the ability to deliver competing products using coaxial cable and cellular transmission,\nespecially in high-density metropolitan areas. Competition will further increase if new companies enter the market or existing competitors expand their product\nlines. Some of these potential competitors may have greater financial, technological, manufacturing, sales and marketing, and personnel resources. As a result,\nthese competitors may be able to respond more rapidly or effectively to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, withstand\nsignificant price decreases, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products.\nIn addition, our present and future competitors may be able to enter our existing or future markets with products or technologies comparable or superior to those\nthat we offer. An increase in competition could cause us to reduce prices, decrease our market share, require increased spending by us on product development\nand sales and marketing, or cause delays or cancellations in customer orders, any one of which could reduce our gross profit margins and adversely affect our\nbusiness and results of operations.\n32\nOur estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, installation and shipment volumes, field service repair\nobligations and other rework costs incurred in correcting product failures. If our estimates change, our liability for warranty obligations may increase or\ndecrease, impacting future cost of revenue.\nOur products are highly complex, and we cannot ensure that our extensive product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect\nall defects, errors, failures and quality issues. Quality or performance problems for products covered under warranty could adversely impact our reputation and\nnegatively affect our operating results, financial position and cash flows. The development and production of new products with high complexity often involves\nproblems with software, components and manufacturing methods. If significant warranty obligations arise due to reliability or quality issues arising from defects\nin software, faulty components or manufacturing methods, our operating results, financial position and cash flows could be negatively impacted by:\n• costs associated with fixing software or hardware defects;\n• costs associated with internal or third-party installation errors;\n• high service and warranty expenses;\n• costs associated with recalling and replacing products with software or hardware defects, including costs from writing-off defective products\nrecalled;\n• high inventory obsolescence expense;\n• delays in collecting accounts receivable;\n• payment of liquidated damages for performance failures;\n• extended performance bond expenses; and\n• a decline in revenue to existing customers.\nManaging our inventory is complex and may include write-downs of excess or obsolete inventory.\nManaging our inventory of components and finished products is complicated by a number of factors, including the need to maintain a significant inventory of\ncertain components that are in short supply, that have been discontinued by the component manufacturer, that must be purchased in bulk to obtain favorable\npricing or that require long lead times. These issues may result in our purchasing and maintaining significant amounts of inventory, which if not used or expected\nto be used based on anticipated production requirements, may become excess or obsolete. Any excess or obsolete inventory could also result in sales price\nreductions and/or inventory write- downs, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe continuing growth of our international operations could expose us to additional risks, increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results,\nfinancial condition and cash flows.\nWe are expanding our presence in international markets, which represented 49.5%, 33.5% and 30.5% of our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022,\n2021 and 2020, respectively, and as a result, we anticipate increased revenue and operating costs in these markets. This international expansion has increased and\nmay continue to increase our operational risks and impact our results of operations, including:\n• exposure to unfavorable commercial terms in certain countries;\n• the time and cost to staff and manage foreign operations, including the time and cost to maintain good relationships with employee associations\nand work councils;\n• the time and cost to ensure adequate business interruption controls, processes and facilities;\n• the time and cost to manage and evolve financial reporting systems, maintain effective financial disclosure controls and procedures, and comply\nwith corporate governance requirements in multiple jurisdictions;\n• the cost to collect accounts receivable and extension of collection periods;\n• the cost and potential disruption of facilities transitions required in some business acquisitions;\n• risks as a result of less regulation of patents or other safeguards of intellectual property in certain countries;\n• the potential impact of adverse tax, customs regulations and transfer-pricing issues;\n• exposure to increased price competition from additional competitors in some countries;\n33\n• exposure to global social, political and economic instability, changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rate movements;\n• potential exposure to liability or damage of reputation resulting from a higher incidence of corruption or unethical business practices in some\ncountries;\n• potential regulations on data protection, regarding the collection, use, disclosure and security of data;\n• potential trade protection measures, export compliance issues, domestic preference procurement requirements, qualification to transact business\nand additional regulatory requirements;\n• potential exposure to natural disasters, epidemics and pandemics (and government regulations in response thereto) and acts of war or terrorism;\nand\n• potential exposure to ongoing military conflict in Ukraine. The U.S. and certain other countries imposed sanctions on Russia and could impose\nfurther sanctions against it, which could damage or disrupt international commerce and the global economy. Other potential consequences include,\nbut are not limited to, a heightened risk of cyber-warfare, biological warfare or nuclear warfare, growth in the number of popular uprisings in the\nregion, increased political discontent, especially in the regions most affected by the conflict or economic sanctions, continued displacement of\npersons to regions close to the areas of conflict and an increase in the number of refugees, among other unforeseen social and humanitarian effects\nwhich could impact our business, customers, and suppliers.\nIn February 2022, armed conflict escalated between Russia and Ukraine. The U.S. and certain other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia and could\nimpose further sanctions, which could damage or disrupt international commerce and the global economy. We are complying with a broad range of U.S. and\ninternational sanctions and export control requirements imposed on Russia.\nIf we are unable to successfully address the potential risks associated with our overall international expansion, our operating results, financial condition and cash\nflows may be negatively impacted.\n34\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining key personnel.\nOur business has grown significantly since its inception. Our success is dependent in large part on the continued employment of our executive officers, including\nThomas R. Stanton, our Chief Executive Officer, and other key management personnel. The unplanned departure of one or more of these individuals could\nadversely affect our business. In addition, for ADTRAN to continue as a successful entity we must also be able to attract and retain key engineers and software\ndevelopers and architects whose expertise helps us maintain competitive advantages. We believe that our future success will depend, in large part, upon our\nability to continue to attract, retain, train and motivate highly-skilled employees who are in great demand. Stock awards are designed to reward employees for\ntheir long-term contributions and to provide incentives for them to remain with us. Changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive\nprogram, may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees. Properly managing our continued growth, avoiding the problems often resulting from such\ngrowth and expansion and continuing to operate in the manner which has proven successful to us to date will be critical to the future success of our business.\nIf we fail to manage our exposure to worldwide financial and securities markets successfully, our operating results and financial statements could be\nmaterially impacted.\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and prices of marketable equity and fixed-income securities. The global\nmacroeconomic environment has been challenging and inconsistent due to uncertainty in the global central bank monetary policy and uncertainty in global credit\nmarkets and the geopolitical environment in many areas of the world. The primary objective of the majority of our investment activities is to preserve principal\nwhile at the same time achieving appropriate yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, a majority of our marketable securities are\ninvestment grade corporate and municipal fixed-rate bonds, U.S. government bonds and municipal money market instruments denominated in U.S. dollars.\nWhile we do invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equities, which are subject to market risks, including the loss of principal, our equity investments are\ngenerally invested in professionally-managed portfolios with the objective of exceeding the performance of their underlying benchmarks.\nWe have significant investments in corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, U.S. government bonds\nand foreign government bonds. Through December 31, 2022, we have not been required to impair any of these investments; however, we have and may continue\nto experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity in these investments, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial\ncondition. Fixed-rate interest securities may have their fair value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while variable-rate securities may produce less\nincome than expected if interest rates fall. Our investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may increase because of\nconditions in the financial markets and related credit liquidity issues. Consequently, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes\nin interest rates, or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in fair value due to changes in interest rates.\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Part II, Item 7 of this\nreport, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of this report and Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for more information about our investments.\nWe are exposed to adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations in jurisdictions where we transact in local currency, which could harm our financial results\nand cash flows.\nWe are exposed to changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchanges rates we use to\nconvert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-\nexchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period’s currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. Our\nprimary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements are the Euro and the British pound sterling. As a result of our global operations, our revenue,\ngross margins, operating expense and operating income in some international markets have been and may continue to be affected by foreign currency\nfluctuations.\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness, our potential payment obligations to ADVA shareholders under the DPLTA, and\nother obligations.\nOur ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to service our outstanding indebtedness could harm our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we have entered into a DPLTA with ADVA. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the DPLTA, each\nADVA shareholder (other than the Company) has received an offer to elect either (1) to remain an ADVA shareholder and receive from us an Annual Recurring\nCompensation payment, or (2) to receive Exit Compensation. Any failure to satisfy our payment obligations under the DPLTA could harm our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. See “Risk Factors - The terms of the DPLTA may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition\" in\nPart I, Item 1A of this report for additional information.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, to cover our payment obligations under the DPLTA, and to fund working capital needs and\nplanned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent,\n35\nis subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If our business does not\ngenerate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us and our subsidiaries to pay our\nindebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof, sell assets,\nreduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition, we may not be able to effect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our\nindebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest\nrates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt\ninstruments or preferred stock may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and\nprincipal on our outstanding indebtedness or dividend payments on our outstanding shares of preferred stock would likely result in a reduction of our credit\nrating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness or otherwise raise capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to\ngenerate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service, payment obligations to ADVA shareholders under the DPLTA, and other obligations, or to refinance or\nrestructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or securities convertible into equity, or undertake certain transactions intended to address\nour existing indebtedness, our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of the Company, or our leverage and outstanding\nindebtedness could increase. Current capital market conditions, including the impact of inflation, have increased borrowing rates and can be expected to\nsignificantly increase our cost of capital as compared to prior periods should we seek additional funding.\nWe may be unable to successfully and effectively manage and integrate acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions, which could harm our\noperating results, business and prospects.\nAs part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint\nventures, divestitures and outsourcing arrangements, and we enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives. In\norder to pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify suitable candidates, successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex,\nand manage post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees and the divestiture of combined businesses, operations and\nemployees. Integration, divestiture and other risks of these transactions can be more pronounced in larger and more complicated transactions, or if multiple\ntransactions are pursued simultaneously. If we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to\nexpend resources to develop products and technology internally. This may put us at a competitive disadvantage and we may be adversely affected by negative\nmarket perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our revenue, gross margin and profitability.\nIntegration and divestiture issues are complex, time-consuming and expensive and, without proper planning and implementation, could significantly disrupt our\nbusiness. The challenges involved in integrating and divesting include:\n• combining service and product offerings and entering into new markets in which we are not experienced;\n• convincing customers and distributors that any such transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus, preventing customers\nand distributors from deferring purchasing decisions or switching to other suppliers or service providers (which could result in additional\nobligations to address customer uncertainty), and coordinating service, sales, marketing and distribution efforts;\n• consolidating and rationalizing corporate information technology infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems from various\nacquisitions and integrating software code;\n• minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns;\n• persuading employees that business cultures are compatible, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, integrating employees\ninto our company, correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring programs;\n• coordinating and combining administrative, service, manufacturing, research and development and other operations, subsidiaries, facilities and\nrelationships with third parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures;\n• our responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire, some of which we may not anticipate, including costs of third-party advisors to\nresolve disputes;\n• achieving savings from supply chain and administration integration; and\n36\n• efficiently divesting combined business operations which may cause increased costs as divested businesses are de-integrated from embedded\nsystems and operations.\nWe evaluate and enter into these types of transactions on an ongoing basis. We may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any transaction and the time\nframe for achieving benefits of a transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees, suppliers or other third parties. In addition, the pricing and\nother terms of our contracts for these transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts, and, during the course\nof our due diligence, we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate costs accurately. Any increased or unexpected costs, unanticipated delays or\nfailure to achieve contractual obligations could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable.\nManaging these types of transactions requires varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. These\ntransactions could result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings, including those related to severance pay, early retirement costs, employee\nbenefit costs, asset impairment charges, charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, in-process research and development charges,\ninventory adjustments, assumed litigation, regulatory compliance and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to\nexecutive officers and key employees under retention plans. Moreover, we could incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of\ncertain assets acquired in connection with these transactions, and, to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives acquired in\nconnection with a transaction becomes impaired, we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. In order to\ncomplete an acquisition, we may issue common shares, potentially creating dilution for existing shareholders, or borrow funds, which could affect our financial\ncondition, results of operations and potentially our credit ratings. Any prior or future downgrades in our credit rating associated with a transaction could\nadversely affect our ability to borrow and our borrowing cost, and result in more restrictive borrowing terms. In addition, our effective tax rate on an ongoing\nbasis is uncertain, and such transactions could impact our effective tax rate. We also may experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a\ntransaction and the risk that an announced transaction may not close. As a result, any completed, pending or future transactions may contribute to financial\nresults that differ materially from the investment community’s expectations.\nRisks related to COVID-19\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, particularly our\nsupply chain.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. Due to the pandemic and a global semiconductor chip\nshortage, we experienced disruption and delays in our supply chain and significant price increases with certain of our manufacturing partners, and those\ndisruptions, delays and price increases may continue. For example, in the second half of 2021 and throughout 2022, our results of operations were negatively\nimpacted by increased expenses resulting from supply chain disruptions. Current global supply chain and transportation constraints, including delays in supply\nchain deliveries and the related global semi-conductor chip shortage, may continue to have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on customer relations and our financial condition. We believe these supply chain challenges and their adverse impact on our industry will\ncontinue to ease during 2023. However, there can be no assurance that the ongoing disruptions due to COVID-19, the related global semiconductor chip shortage\nor other supply chain constraints or price increases will be resolved in the near term, which could continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of COVID-19 and supply chain constraints on our business.\n37\nRisks related to our control environment\nBreaches of our information systems and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property and cause significant damage to our business and\nreputation.\nWe maintain sensitive data on our information systems and the networks of third-party providers, including intellectual property, financial data and proprietary or\nconfidential business information relating to our business, customers, suppliers, and business partners. We also produce networking equipment solutions and\nsoftware used by network operators to ensure security and reliability in their management and transmission of data. Our customers, particularly those in\nregulated industries, are increasingly focused on the security features of our technology solutions. Maintaining the security of information sensitive to us and our\nbusiness partners is critical to our business and reputation. We rely upon several internal business processes and information systems to support key operations\nand financial functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical. Companies are increasingly subjected to cyber-attacks and other\nattempts to gain unauthorized access. We have a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity, which includes prevention, detection, containment, and response. Our\nlayered defense approach encompasses proactive security monitoring of our global infrastructure by both internal solutions and multiple third-party Security\nOperation Centers. Additionally, we routinely perform patch management, vulnerability scans, penetration tests and continuous monitoring across our entire\nenterprise. Our security policy framework includes meaningful and enforceable Information Security policies and procedures. The cybersecurity program is\naligned with our mission and business objectives, reviewed periodically for improvements, and is supported by experienced and certified security professionals.\nThis is supplemented by an information security awareness program that spans our global workforce. Despite this, our network and storage applications and\nthose systems and applications maintained by our third-party providers may be targeted by cyber-attacks or potentially breached due to operator error, fraudulent\nactivity, or other system disruptions. For example, a vulnerability named “Log4Shell” was reported for the widely used Java logging library, Apache Log4j 2\n(“Log4j”), in December of 2021. Although we did not identify indicators of compromise in response to the Log4j vulnerability, we cannot assure that future\nvulnerabilities or malware attacks will not be successful in breaching our system and in turn, have a material impact our business. Unauthorized access or\ndisclosure of our information could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. Our information systems are designed to\nappropriate industry standards and resiliently engineered to reduce downtime in the event of power outages, weather or climate events and cybersecurity issues.\nThese risks, as well as the number and frequency of cybersecurity events globally, may also be heightened during times of geopolitical tension or instability\nbetween countries, including, for example, the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine with Russia, from which a number of recent cybersecurity events have been\nalleged to have originated. We carry cybersecurity insurance policies meant to limit our risk and exposure should one of these cybersecurity issues occur.\nHowever, a significant failure of our systems due to these issues could result in significant remediation costs, disrupt business operations, and divert management\nattention, which could result in harm to our business reputation, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.\nAs part of our due diligence and integration planning process, the Company’s cybersecurity team has conducted a review of ADVA’s cybersecurity program.\nAdditionally, prior to integration of facilities, networks, or systems, the Company also engage CrowdStrike, a global cybersecurity leader to conduct an\nenterprise-wide compromise assessment to determine if there were any targeted compromises by nation-state actors of the ADVA information technology\nlandscape. The results from the CrowdStrike Compromise assessment indicated that there was no indication of compromise of the ADVA information technology\nenvironment. As part of the integration plan, the Company intends to expand its current cybersecurity program to cover all ADVA’s global infrastructure and\nadopt any mature cybersecurity practices already in place. A significant failure of our review and integration of ADVA's cybersecurity program could expose us\nto penalties for failing to comply with the EU's GDPR requirements as well as result in significant remediation costs and a disruption to our operations.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting we could have a material weakness in our internal controls, that if not\nremediated, could materially adversely affect us.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”) requires us to include in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K an assessment by the Company’s\nmanagement of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a report from our independent registered public accounting firm on\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, as required by Section 404. Our compliance with Section 404 may require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend\nsignificant management efforts.\nAs permitted by SEC guidance, we currently exclude ADVA in our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting and related disclosure controls and\nprocedures for the first year after the Business Combination. However, we are in the process of extending our oversight and monitoring processes that support\nour internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to include ADVA’s operations.\nIf we are not able to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, including any failure to implement required new or improved\ncontrols, or if we experience difficulties in the implementation of or the implemented controls required in connection\n38\nwith the Business Combination, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed. In addition, if management or our independent\nregistered public accounting firm is unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the\naccuracy and completeness of our financial statements, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price or lead to litigation claims.\nRisks related to the telecommunications industry\nWe must continue to update and improve our products and develop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications\ntechnology.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and continuing improvements in the\ncommunications service offerings of service providers. If technologies or standards applicable to our products, or service provider offerings based on our\nproducts, become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our existing products or products under development may become obsolete or\nunmarketable. Moreover, the introduction of products embodying new technologies, the emergence of new industry standards, or changes in service provider\nofferings could adversely affect our ability to sell our products. For instance, we offer a large number of products that apply primarily to the delivery of high-\nspeed digital communications over the local loop utilizing copper wire. We compete favorably with our competitors by developing a high-performance line of\nthese products. We market products that apply to fiber optic transport in the local loop. We expect, however, that use of coaxial cable and fixed and mobile\nwireless access in place of local loop access will increase. Also, MSOs are increasing their presence in the local loop. To meet the requirements of these new\ndelivery systems and to maintain our market position, we expect to continue to develop new products and/or modify existing products. We expect that the\naddition of fiber-based products focused on the cable MSO operators, using EPON and fixed wireless access solutions will better position us to benefit from\nspending in these adjacent markets.\nOur revenue and profitability in the past have, to a significant extent, resulted from our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards and service\nprovider offerings, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products. Our continued ability to adapt will be a significant factor in maintaining or\nimproving our competitive position and our prospects for growth. We cannot assure that we will be able to respond effectively to changes in technology, industry\nstandards, service provider offerings or new product announcements by our competitors. We also cannot assure that we will be able to successfully develop and\nmarket new products or product enhancements, or that these products or enhancements will achieve market acceptance. Any failure by us to continue to\nanticipate or respond in a cost-effective and timely manner to changes in technology, industry standards, service provider offerings or new product\nannouncements by our competitors, or any significant delays in product development or introduction, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to\ncompetitively market our products and on our revenue, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable environmental regulations could adversely impact our results of\noperations.\nThe manufacture, assembly and testing of our products may require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to environmental, health and safety\nregulations. Our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with any of these applicable requirements could result in regulatory penalties,\nlegal claims or disruption of production. In addition, our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to properly manage the use, transportation, emission,\ndischarge, storage, recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could subject us to increased costs or liabilities. Existing and future environmental regulations\nmay restrict our use of certain materials to manufacture, assemble and test products. Any of these consequences could adversely impact our results of operations\nby increasing our expenses and/or requiring us to alter our manufacturing processes.\nIf our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks, installations may be delayed or canceled, which could harm our business.\nOur products must interface with existing networks, each of which may have different specifications, utilize multiple protocol standards and incorporate products\nfrom other vendors. Many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown\nand evolved. Our products may be required to interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks, as well as future products to meet our\ncustomers’ requirements. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks, we may have to modify our\nsoftware or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate with the existing software and hardware. Implementation of product\ncorrections involving interoperability issues could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations. Such issues may affect our ability to obtain\nproduct acceptance from other customers.\nWe engage in research and development activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application of developed technologies, and as a\nconsequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially greater research and development efforts and which may\nfocus on more leading edge development.\nA portion of our research and development activities are focused on the continued innovation of currently accepted access and edge transmission technologies in\norder to deliver faster internet speeds, more capacity, better quality of service and operational efficiency. These research and development efforts result in\nimproved applications of technologies for which demand already exists or is latent.\n39\nWe also focus our research and development efforts on developing software, solutions and platforms that enable service providers to increase revenue-generating\nservice velocity, reducing operational costs, increasing scale and providing service agility. We rarely engage in research projects that represent a vast departure\nfrom the current business practices of our key customers. While we believe our strategy provides a higher likelihood of producing nearer term or more\nsustainable revenue streams, this strategy could result in lost revenue opportunities and higher operating expenses should a new technology achieve rapid and\nwidespread market acceptance. When we do engage in research and development activities for new, leading-edge technologies and market approaches, there is\nno guarantee that those technologies or market approaches will be successful or that they will be adopted and purchased by our customers.\nOur strategy of outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing requirements to subcontractors located in various international regions may result in us not\nmeeting our cost, quality or performance standards.\nWe are heavily dependent on subcontractors for the assembly and testing of certain printed circuit board assemblies, subassemblies, chassis, enclosures and\nequipment shelves, and the purchase of some raw materials used in such assemblies. This reliance involves several risks, including the unavailability of, or\ninterruptions in, access to certain process technologies and reduced control over product quality, delivery schedules, transportation, manufacturing yields and\ncosts. We may not be able to provide product order volumes to our subcontractors that are high enough to achieve sufficient cost savings. If shipments fall below\nforecasted levels, we may incur increased costs or be required to take ownership of excess inventory. Changes in international tariff structures could adversely\nimpact our product costs. We also have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased inflationary pressures on input costs, such as, raw materials,\nlabor and distribution costs. Our attempts to offset these cost pressures, such as through increases in the selling prices of some of our products and services, may\nnot be successful and could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, a significant component of maintaining cost competitiveness is the ability of our\nsubcontractors to adjust their costs to compensate for possible adverse exchange rate movements. To the extent that the subcontractors are unable to do so, and\nwe are unable to procure alternative product supplies, then our competitiveness and results of operations could be adversely impaired. These risks may be\nexacerbated by economic, regulatory or political changes or uncertainties, terrorist actions, acts of war, the effects of climate change, natural disasters or\npandemics in the foreign countries in which our subcontractors are located.\nTo date, we believe that we have successfully managed the risks of our dependence on these subcontractors through a variety of efforts, which include seeking\nand developing alternative subcontractors while maintaining existing relationships; however, we cannot be assured that delays in product deliveries will not\noccur in the future because of shortages resulting from this limited number of subcontractors or from the financial or other difficulties of these parties. Our\ninability to develop alternative subcontractors if and as required in the future, or the need to undertake required retraining and other activities related to\nestablishing and developing a new subcontractor relationship, could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which, in turn, could have a negative\neffect on our customer relationships and operating results.\nOur failure to maintain rights to intellectual property used in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality and commercial value of\nour products.\nOur future success depends in part upon our proprietary technology. Although we attempt to protect our proprietary technology by contract, trademark, copyright\nand patent registration and internal security, including trade secret protection, these protections may not be adequate. Furthermore, our competitors can develop\nsimilar technology independently without violating our proprietary rights. From time to time, we receive and may continue to receive notices of claims alleging\nthat we are infringing upon patents or other intellectual property. Any of these claims, whether with or without merit, could result in significant legal fees, divert\nour management’s time, attention and resources, delay our product shipments or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. We cannot predict\nwhether we will prevail in any claims or litigation over alleged infringements, or whether we will be able to license any valid and infringed patents, or other\nintellectual property, on commercially reasonable terms. If a claim of intellectual property infringement against us is successful and we fail to obtain a license or\ndevelop or license non-infringing technology, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be affected adversely.\nSoftware under license from third parties for use in certain of our products may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe integrate third-party software into certain of our products. Licenses for this technology may not be available or continue to be available to us on\ncommercially reasonable terms. Difficulties with third-party technology licensors could result in the termination of such licenses, which may result in increased\ncosts or require us to purchase or develop a substitute technology. Difficulty obtaining and maintaining third-party technology licenses may disrupt the\ndevelopment of our products and increase our costs, which could harm our business.\nOur use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products.\nSeveral of our solutions utilize elements of open source or publicly available software. Although we closely monitor our use of open source software, the terms\nof many open source software licenses have not been interpreted by the courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could\nimpose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to sell our products. In\n40\nsuch event, we could be required to make our proprietary software generally available to third parties, including competitors, at no cost, to seek licenses from\nthird parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot\nbe accomplished on a timely basis or at all, any of which could adversely affect our revenue and operating expenses.\nWe may incur liabilities or become subject to litigation that would have a material effect on our business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we accept purchase orders, and enter into sales and other related contracts, for the marketing, sale, manufacture, distribution\nor use of our products and services. We may incur liabilities relating to our performance under such agreements, or which result from damage claims arising\nfrom certain events as outlined within the particular contract. While we attempt to include reasonable limitations of liability and other protective measures to all\nagreements, such agreements may not always contain, or be subject to, maximum loss clauses and liabilities arising from them may result in significant adverse\nchanges to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including employment disputes, patent claims, disputes over contract\nagreements and other commercial disputes. In some cases, claimants seek monetary recovery, or other relief, including damages such as royalty payments related\nto patents, lost profits or injunctive relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. Any such disputes may be resolved before trial, or if tried,\nmay be resolved in our favor; however, the cost of claims sustained in litigation, and costs associated with the litigation process, may not be covered by our\ninsurance. Such costs, and the demands on management time during such an event, could harm our business, reputation and have a material adverse effect on our\nliquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and maintain relationships with SIs, service providers and enterprise VARs, our revenue may be negatively affected.\nAs part of our sales strategy, we are targeting SIs, service providers and enterprise VARs. In addition to specialized technical expertise, SIs, service providers and\nVARs typically offer sophisticated service capabilities that are frequently desired by enterprise customers. To expand our distribution channel to include resellers\nwith such capabilities, we must be able to provide effective support to these resellers. If our sales, marketing or service capabilities are not sufficient to provide\neffective support to such SIs, service providers and VARs, our revenue may be negatively affected, and current SI, service provider and VAR partners may\nterminate their relationships with us, which would adversely impact our revenue and overall results of operations.\nRisks related to the Company’s stock price\nOur operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price.\nOur operating results have been, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors. These factors include, but\nare not limited to:\n• fluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially with respect to significant network expansion projects undertaken by service\nproviders;\n• continued growth of communications network traffic and the adoption of communication services and applications by enterprise and consumer\nend users;\n• changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers’ spending plans and associated revenue,\nespecially should a slowdown in communications industry spending occur due to economic downturns, tight capital markets, or declining liquidity\ntrends;\n• reductions in demand for our traditional products as new technologies gain acceptance;\n• our ability, and that of our distributors, to maintain appropriate inventory levels and related purchase commitments;\n• price and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change rapidly due to technological innovation;\n• the overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers;\n• our dependence on sales of our products by channel partners, the timing of their replenishment orders, the potential for conflicts and competition\ninvolving our channel partners and large end-user customers and the potential for consolidation among our channel partners;\n• variations in sales channels, product cost or mix of products and services sold;\n• delays in receiving acceptance, as defined under contract, from certain customers for shipments or services performed near the end of a reporting\nperiod;\n41\n• our ability to maintain high levels of product support and professional services;\n• manufacturing and customer order lead times, and potential restrictions in the supply of key components;\n• fluctuations in our gross margin and the factors that contribute to this (as described above);\n• our ability to achieve cost reductions;\n• the ability of our customers, channel partners and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures;\n• our ability to execute on our strategy and operating plans;\n• benefits anticipated from our investments in engineering, sales and marketing activities;\n• the effects of climate change and other natural events;\n• the effect of political or economic conditions, including the effect of tariffs or so-called “trade wars” on us and our supply chain, acts of war,\nterrorist attacks or other unrest in certain international markets;\n• the effect of escalating tensions along the Russia-Ukraine border. The U.S. and certain other countries imposed sanctions on Russia and could\nimpose further sanctions against it, which could damage or disrupt international commerce and the global economy; and\n• changes in tax laws and regulations or accounting pronouncements.\nAs a result, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future\nperiods. Any of the above-mentioned factors, or other factors discussed elsewhere in this report, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, financial condition and cash flows that could adversely affect our stock price.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ADTN. Since our initial public offering in August 1994, there has been,\nand may continue to be, significant volatility in the market for our common stock, based on a variety of factors, including factors listed in this section, some of\nwhich are beyond our control.\n42\nRisks related to the regulatory environments in which we do business\nWe are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and standards governing the conduct of our business. Violations of these laws\nand regulations may harm our business, subject us to penalties and to other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that govern conduct by our Company, our employees and agents and the manufacture, sale and use of our products. Our\ninability to comply with current and evolving laws and regulations governing our business domestically and internationally may adversely affect our revenue,\nresults of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. New and changing laws, regulations and industry practices could require us to modify our business,\nproducts or services offered, potentially in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new products, services and features. If we violate these laws\nand regulations, governmental authorities in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions could seek to impose civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have\nan adverse effect on our reputation, as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThese laws and regulations include, but are not limited to:\n• various regulations and regional standards established by communications authorities and import/export control authorities that govern the\nmanufacture, sale and use of our products. Changes in domestic or international communications regulations, tariffs, potential changes in trade\npolicies by the U.S. and other nations, application requirements, import/export controls or expansion of regulation to new areas, including access,\ncommunications or commerce over the internet, may affect customer demand for our products or slow the adoption of new technologies which\nmay affect our revenue. Further, the cost of complying with the evolving standards and regulations, including the cost of product re-design if\nnecessary, or the failure to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certification such that we may not be able to sell our products\nwhere these standards or regulations apply, may adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n• compliance with a wide variety of provincial, state, national and international laws and regulations applicable to the collection, use, retention,\nprotection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of data, including personal data. Foreign data protection, privacy and other laws and\nregulations, including GDPR, are often more restrictive than those in the U.S. These data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are\nvaried, evolving, can be subject to significant change, may be augmented or replaced by new or additional laws and regulations and may result in\never-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. For example, numerous states have adopted\nwithin the past three years or are in the process of adopting various privacy-related laws and regulations. In addition, on July 16, 2020, the Court\nof Justice of the European Union issued a decision that invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework as a basis for transfers of personal data\nfrom the EU to the U.S., resulting in uncertainty and potential additional compliance obligations to ensure that a valid basis under the GDPR\nexists for these data transfers. The European Commission published revised standard contractual clauses for data transfers from the European\nEconomic Area in 2021, which were required to go into effect by December 2022. Finally, the U.K. has enacted a version of the GDPR the\nimplementation of which occurred by way of the Data Protection Act 2018, collectively referred to as the U.K. GDPR. Uncertainty remains,\nhowever, regarding how aspects of data protection in the U.K. will be handled in the medium to long term. There is also a risk that we, directly or\nas the result of a third-party service provider we use, could be found to have failed to comply with the laws and regulations applicable in a\njurisdiction regarding the collection, consent, handling, transfer or disposal of personal data.\n• the FCPA, which prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of directing,\nobtaining or keeping business, and requires companies to maintain reasonable books and records and a system of internal accounting controls. The\nFCPA applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for the\ncorrupt actions taken by employees, strategic or local partners or other representatives. Because a significant portion of our total revenue is\ngenerated from revenue outside of the U.S., we have proactively implemented internally and externally focused measures and controls to address\nthis risk. We help ensure that our employees understand the key requirements of FCPA compliance and the consequences of non-compliance\nthrough training courses and detective controls. ADTRAN senior management and employees whose responsibilities include international\nactivities are required to complete an online training program and pass an exam every two years. We have put processes in place to help detect\nnon-compliance through providing our employees access to a worldwide reporting “hotline,” available by phone and online, that is maintained by\na third-party provider. Finally, we perform annual reviews of our employees’ expense reports and corporate credit card activity to identify possible\ncorruption concerns. We have also implemented controls to help ensure our third-party partners and customers observe FCPA requirements. Prior\nto selling to new international distributors, resellers or agents, we review third-party data and check them against over 200 denied party lists from\ngovernment institutions worldwide for potential FCPA concerns. We also require international distributors, resellers and agents to complete an\nAnti-Corruption Due Diligence Questionnaire, which is reviewed and assessed by a cross-functional compliance committee and our export-\ncompliance function.\n43\n• environmental, health and safety regulation governing the manufacture, assembly and testing of our products, including without limitation\nregulations governing the use of hazardous materials. Our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to properly manage the use,\ntransportation, emission, discharge, storage, recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could subject us to increased costs or liabilities. Existing\nand future environmental regulations may restrict our use of certain materials to manufacture, assemble and test products.\n• requirements by the SEC governing the disclosure regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\nadjoining countries (the “DRC”) and disclosure with respect to procedures regarding a manufacturer’s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such\nminerals from the DRC. Certain of these minerals are present in our products. SEC rules implementing these requirements may have the effect of\nreducing the pool of suppliers that can supply “conflict free” components and parts, and we may not be able to obtain conflict free products or\nsupplies in sufficient quantities for our operations. Because our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers,\nstockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins for the conflict minerals used in our products and cannot\nassert that our products are “conflict free.” Environmental or similar social initiatives may also make it difficult to obtain supply of compliant\ncomponents or may require us to write off non-compliant inventory, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n• the insider trading prohibitions and the respective directors' dealing rules under the German Securities Trading Act (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz) and\nRegulation (EU) No. 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 16, 2014, and other applicable regulations.\nChanges in trade policy in the U.S. and other countries, specifically the U.K. and China, including the imposition of additional tariffs and the resulting\nconsequences, may adversely impact our gross profits, gross margins, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn recent years, international market conditions and the international regulatory environment have been increasingly affected by competition among countries\nand geopolitical frictions. In particular, there have been a number of significant geopolitical events, including trade tensions and regulatory actions, involving the\ngovernments of the U.S. and China. The U.S. government has raised tariffs, and imposed new tariffs, on a wide range of imports of Chinese products, including\ncomponent elements of our solutions and certain finished goods products that we sell. U.S. tariff policy involving imports from China are slated for a broad\nreview in 2023. The U.S. government has also introduced broad new restrictions on imports from China allegedly manufactured with forced labor, and the EU\nhas debated similar restrictions. China has retaliated by raising tariffs, and imposing new tariffs, on certain exports of U.S. goods to China, as well as introducing\nblocking measures to restrict the ability of domestic companies to comply with U.S. trade restrictions. For instance, over the course of 2020, the U.S. introduced\nsignificant further restrictions limiting access to controlled U.S. technology to additional Chinese government and commercial entities. More recently, in October\n2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed additional export control restrictions targeting the provision of, inter alia, certain semiconductors and related\ntechnology to China that could further disrupt supply chains that could adversely impact our business. In addition, the U.S. Federal Communications\nCommission (the “FCC”) in November 2022 prohibited communications equipment deemed to pose an unacceptable risk to national security from obtaining the\nequipment authorization that allows the products to be imported, marketed, or sold in the U.S. This prohibition currently includes telecommunications equipment\nproduced by Huawei and its affiliates and subsidiaries and four other Chinese companies, and additional entities may be subsequently added to this list. The\nsituation involving U.S.-China trade relations remains volatile and uncertain and there can be no assurance that further actions by either country will not have an\nadverse impact on our business, operations and access to technology, or components thereof, sourced from China.\nThe past few years have been challenging for the credit markets due to a shift from a time of quantitative easing to a time of quantitative tightening by central\nbanks around the world. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or further deteriorate, we may\nexperience material impacts on our business and operating results. We may also be adversely affected in ways that we do not currently anticipate.\n44\nNew or revised tax regulations, changes in our effective tax rate, recognition of a valuation allowance or assessments arising from tax audits may have an\nadverse impact on our results.\nWe are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions, both domestically and internationally, in which we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in the\ndetermination of our provision for income taxes, and this determination requires the interpretation and application of complex and sometimes uncertain tax laws\nand regulations. Our effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by changes in the mix of earnings between jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, in\nthe valuation of our deferred tax assets, and by changes in tax rules and regulations. We continually monitor our deferred tax assets and when it becomes more\nlikely than not that a tax benefit will not be recognized, a valuation allowance is recorded against those assets. In addition, we are subject to examination of our\nincome tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and various other tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We regularly assess the\nlikelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that\nthe outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Additionally, we\ncontinually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that it is more\nlikely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recognized. As such, we may release a portion of the valuation allowance or establish a new valuation\nallowance based on operations in the jurisdictions in which these assets arose. Management continues to evaluate all evidence including historical operating\nresults, the existence of losses in the most recent year, forecasted earnings, future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Should management determine that\na valuation allowance is needed in the future due to not being able to absorb deferred tax assets, it would have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, which made a number of changes to the Internal Revenue Code, including adding a 1% excise\ntax on stock buybacks by publicly traded corporations and a 15% corporate minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income of certain large companies. The\nimpact of these provisions on our effective tax rate will also depend on additional guidance to be issued by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\nWe are currently evaluating the impact of these provisions on our effective tax rate. Further, the Tax Act amended the Internal Revenue Code to require that\nspecific research and experimental (“R&E”) expenditures be capitalized and amortized over five years (U.S. R&E) or fifteen years (non-U.S. R&E) beginning in\nthe Company’s fiscal 2023. Although the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would defer, modify, or repeal the capitalization and amortization\nrequirement, there is no assurance that the provision will be deferred, repealed, or otherwise modified. If the requirement is not repealed or otherwise modified,\nit may increase our effective tax rate. Additionally, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the “OECD”), an international association\ncomprised of 38 countries, including the U.S., has issued proposals that change long-standing tax principles including on a global minimum tax initiative. On\nDecember 12, 2022 the EU member states agreed to implement the OECD’s Pillar 2 global corporate minimum tax rate of 15% on companies with revenues of\nat least EUR 750 million, which would go into effect in 2024. Other countries including the U.K., Switzerland, Canada, Australia and South Korea are also\nactively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD’s proposals.\nCentral Banks' monetary policy actions could increase our costs of borrowing money and negatively impact our financial condition and future operations.\nMarket interest rates are rising and are expected to continue to rise across the yield curve. Depending on future inflation levels, the rise of nominal interest rates\nmay produce a rise in real interest rates. Higher interest rates resulting from tightening monetary policy are expected to increase credit costs and decrease credit\navailability. Increases in interest rates could increase our costs of borrowing money under certain of our debt facilities with variable interest rates, which would\nnegatively impact our financial condition and future operations.\nRising inflation could negatively impact our revenues and profitability if increases in the prices of our products and services or a decrease in customer\nspending result in lower sales.\nRecent significant increases in inflation may result in decreased demand for our products and services, increased manufacturing and operating costs (including\nour labor costs), reduced liquidity, and limitations on our ability to access credit or otherwise raise debt and equity capital. In an inflationary environment,\nbecause certain of our customer contracts provide for fixed pricing and/or due to our competitor’s pricing strategies, we may be unable to raise the sales prices of\nour products and services at or above the rate at which our costs increase, which would reduce our profit and operating margins and could have a material\nadverse effect on our financial results. We also may experience lower than expected sales and potential adverse impacts on our competitive position if there is a\ndecrease in customer spending or a negative reaction to any price increases we are able to implement. A reduction in our revenue would be detrimental to our\nprofitability and financial condition and could also have an adverse impact on our future growth.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational\nharm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\n45\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance\nconsiderations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In\naddition, we may make statements about our environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives through our website, press statements and other\ncommunications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and\nuncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside of our control. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us\nto achieve our targets, further our initiatives, adhere to our public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance\nlaws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and\nmaterially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\n46\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur global headquarters and certain administrative, engineering and manufacturing facilities are located on an 82-acre campus in Cummings Research Park in\nHuntsville, Alabama. Two office buildings in Huntsville, Alabama serve both our Network Solutions and our Services & Support segments. We lease a facility\nfor our European headquarters in Munich, Germany. We lease engineering facilities in the U.S., EMEA and APAC that are used to develop products sold by our\nNetwork Solutions segment. In addition, we lease office space in North America, Latin America, EMEA and APAC, which provide sales and service support for\nboth of our segments. These cancelable and non-cancelable leases expire at various times through 2032. For more information, see Note 9 of Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nWe also have numerous sales and support staff operating from home-based offices serving both our Network Solutions and our Services & Support segments,\nwhich are located within the U.S. and abroad.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time we are subject to or otherwise involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and legal proceedings that arise out of or are incidental to\nthe conduct of our business (collectively, “Legal Matters”), including those relating to employment matters, patent rights, regulatory compliance matters,\nstockholder claims, and contractual and other commercial disputes. Such Legal Matters, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant\nfinancial and managerial resources. Additionally, an unfavorable outcome in a legal matter, including in a patent dispute, could require us to pay damages, entitle\nclaimants to other relief, such as royalties, or could prevent us from selling some of our products in certain jurisdictions. At this time, we are unable to predict\nthe outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these legal matters.\nITEM 4.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8 of\nthis report. We have omitted discussion of the earliest of the three years of financial condition and results of operations and this information can be found in Part\nI, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov and on our\nwebsite at www.adtran.com.\nThis discussion is designed to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements, the changes in certain\nkey items in those financial statements from period to period, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting\nprinciples affect our consolidated financial statements. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” on page 2 of this report for a\ndescription of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected results. See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K.\nUnless the context otherwise indicates or requires, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to \"ADTRAN\", the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”\nrefer to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries for periods subsequent to the Merger and to ADTRAN, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries\nfor periods prior to the Merger. The prior period results do not include the results of ADVA prior to the Merger.\nOverview\nThe Company is a leading global provider of networking and communications platforms, software, systems and services focused on the broadband access\nmarket, serving a diverse domestic and international customer base in multiple countries that includes Tier-1, -2 and -3 service providers, alternative service\nproviders, such as utilities, municipalities and fiber overbuilders, cable/MSOs, SMBs and distributed enterprises. Our innovative solutions and services enable\nvoice, data, video and internet-communications across a variety of network infrastructures and are currently in use by millions worldwide. We support our\ncustomers through our direct global sales organization and our distribution networks. Our success depends upon our ability to increase unit volume and market\nshare through the introduction of new products and succeeding generations of products having optimal selling prices and increased functionality as compared to\nboth the prior generation of a product and to the products of competitors in order to gain market share. To service our customers and grow revenue, we are\ncontinually conducting research and developing new products addressing customer needs and testing those products for the specific requirements of the\nparticular customers. We offer a broad portfolio of flexible software and hardware network solutions and services that enable service providers to meet today’s\nservice demands, while enabling them to transition to the fully converged, scalable, highly-automated, cloud-controlled voice, data, internet and video network\nof the future. In addition to our global headquarters in Huntsville, Alabama, and our European headquarters in Munich, Germany, we have sales, administrative\nand research and development facilities in strategic global locations.\nADTRAN Holdings, Inc. solely owns ADTRAN, Inc. and is the majority shareholder of ADVA Optical Networking SE (\"ADVA\"). ADTRAN is a leading global\nprovider of open, disaggregated networking and communications solutions. ADVA is a global provider of network solutions for data, storage, voice and video\nservices. The combined technology portfolio can best address current and future requirements, especially regarding the convergence of solutions at the network\nedge.\nIn addition to the Company's reportable segments, revenue is also reported for the following three categories – Subscriber Solutions, Access & Aggregation\nSolutions, and Optical Networking Solutions.\nPrior to the Business Combination with ADVA on July 15, 2022, ADTRAN reported revenue across the following three categories: (1) Access & Aggregation,\n(2) Subscriber Solutions & Experience and (3) Traditional & Other Products. Following the Business Combination with ADVA, we have recast these revenues\nsuch that ADTRAN’s former Access & Aggregation revenue is combined with a portion of the applicable ADVA solutions to create Access & Aggregation\nSolutions, ADTRAN’s former Subscriber Solutions & Experience revenue is combined with a portion of the applicable ADVA solutions to create Subscriber\nSolutions and the revenue from Traditional & Other products is now included in the applicable Access & Aggregation Solutions or Subscriber Solutions\ncategory. Optical Networking Solutions is a new revenue category added to represent a meaningful portion of ADVA’s portfolio.\nOur Subscriber Solutions portfolio is used by service providers to terminate their access services infrastructure at the customer premises while providing an\nimmersive and interactive experience for residential, business and wholesale subscribers. This revenue category includes hardware- and software-based products\nand services. These solutions include fiber termination solutions for residential, business and wholesale subscribers, Wi-Fi access solutions for residential and\nbusiness subscribers, Ethernet switching and network edge virtualization solutions for business subscribers and cloud software solutions covering a mix of\nsubscriber types.\nOur Access & Aggregation Solutions are solutions that are used by communications service providers to connect residential subscribers, business subscribers and\nmobile radio networks to the service providers’ metro network, primarily through fiber-based connectivity. This revenue category includes hardware- and\nsoftware-based products and services. Our solutions within this category are a mix of fiber access and aggregation platforms, precision network synchronization\nand timing solutions and access orchestration solutions that ensure highly reliable and efficient network performance.\n51\nOur Optical Networking Solutions are used by communications service providers, internet content providers and large-scale enterprises to securely interconnect\nmetro and regional networks over fiber. This revenue category includes hardware- and software-based products and services. Our solutions within this category\ninclude open optical terminals, open line systems, optical subsystems and modules, network infrastructure assurance systems and automation platforms that are\nused to build high-scale, secure and assured optical networks.\nADVA Domination and Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement\nThe DPLTA between the Company, as the controlling company, and ADVA Optical Networking SE, as the controlled company, which was executed on\nDecember 1, 2022, became effective on January 16, 2023, as a result of its registration with the commercial register (Handelsregister) of the local court\n(Amtsgericht) at the registered seat of ADVA (Jena).\nUnder the DPLTA, subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, (i) the Company is\nentitled to issue binding instructions to the management board of ADVA, (ii) ADVA will transfer its annual profit to the Company, subject to, among other\nthings, the creation or dissolution of certain reserves, and (iii) the Company will generally absorb the annual net loss incurred by ADVA. The obligation of\nADVA to transfer its annual profit to the Company applies for the first time to the profit, if any, generated in the ADVA fiscal year 2023. The obligation of the\nCompany to absorb ADVA’s annual net loss applies for the first time to the loss, if any, generated in the ADVA fiscal year 2023.\nAdditionally, and subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, the DPLTA provides that ADVA shareholders\n(other than us) be offered, at their election, (i) to put their ADVA shares to the Company in exchange for a compensation in cash of EUR 17.21 per share (the\n“Exit Compensation”), or (ii) to remain ADVA shareholders and receive a recurring compensation in cash of EUR 0.59 (EUR 0.52 net under the current tax\nregime) per share for each full fiscal year of ADVA (the “Annual Recurring Compensation”). The Annual Recurring Compensation is due on the third banking\nday following the ordinary general shareholders’ meeting of ADVA for the respective preceding fiscal year (but in any event within eight months following\nexpiration of the fiscal year) and is first granted for the 2023 fiscal year, payable for the first time after the ordinary general shareholders’ meeting of ADVA in\n2024. The adequacy of both forms of compensation have been challenged by minority shareholders of ADVA via court-led appraisal proceedings under German\nlaw, and it is possible that the courts in such appraisal proceedings may adjudicate a higher Exit Compensation or Annual Recurring Compensation (in each case,\nincluding interest thereon) than agreed upon in the DPLTA.\nThe opportunity for outside ADVA shareholders to tender ADVA shares in exchange for Exit Compensation had been scheduled to expire on March 16, 2023.\nHowever, due to the appraisal proceedings that have been initiated in accordance with applicable German law, this time period for tendering shares has been\nextended pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and will end two months after the date on which a final decision in such appraisal\nproceedings has been published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger).\nWe currently hold 33,961,170 no-par value bearer shares of ADVA, representing 65.30% of ADVA’s outstanding shares as of February 14, 2023.\nThe foregoing description of the DPLTA does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the DPLTA, a non-binding English\ntranslation of which is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $14.2 million of transaction costs relating to the Business Combination. We expect to incur integration\ncosts and costs associated with the implementation of the DPLTA during 2023 and such costs are expected to be material.\nMulti-Year Integration Program\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company initiated a multi-year integration program designed to optimize the assets, business processes, and information\ntechnology systems of the Company.\nThe program has identified several potential cost synergies, including:\n• realizing operational scale;\n• combined sales channels;\n• streamlining corporate and general and administrative functions; and\n• combined sourcing and production costs.\nWe have and will continue to invest significant dollars to restructure the workforce, optimize legacy systems, streamline legal entities and consolidate real estate\nholdings. By executing these integration activities, we expect to deliver greater innovation for customers, career enrichment opportunities for employees, and\nenhanced value for shareholders. See Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional\ninformation.\n52\nFinancial Performance and Trends\nWe ended 2022 with a year-over-year revenue increase of 82.2% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, driven by increased volume of sales activity\ndue to the Business Combination with ADVA and to service provider customers. During 2022, we had one 10% revenue customer which was a domestic service\nprovider customer and our five largest customers comprised 38.3% of our revenue. Our year-over-year domestic revenue increased by 38.1%, driven by\nincreased sales volume due to the Business Combination with ADVA and an increased sales volume of residential gateways and optical network terminals in our\nNetwork Solutions segment. Internationally, our revenue increased by 169.7% compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by increased volume of sales\nactivity due to the Business Combination with ADVA and increased shipments to a Tier-1 network operator in Europe. We experienced strong demand for our\nsolutions during 2022 and achieved significant year-over-year bookings growth. Bookings are defined as orders received for a product or service during a fiscal\nperiod that will be delivered or performed sometime in the future and is a forward looking metric that we utilize to help us understand future revenue growth for\nthe Company. Bookings are generally subject to modification and or cancellation per the terms of the order. Our increase in demand comes from service\nproviders planning to deploy our fiber access platforms, in-home service delivery platforms and SaaS applications. We expect this growth to accelerate. During\n2021 and 2022, we secured several Tier-1 next-generation fiber customers, and previously announced Tier-1 fiber customers significantly increased their\nbookings for our fiber access platforms. Although we expect our revenue growth and profitability in the near-term to continue to be negatively impacted by\nsupply chain issues, our outlook continues to strengthen given the increased demand for our products and our expectation of an improving supply chain over the\nlonger term.\nA substantial portion of our shipments of inventory in any fiscal period relate to orders received and shipped within that fiscal period for customers under\nagreements containing non-binding purchase commitments. Further, a significant percentage of orders require delivery within a few days. However, with the\ncurrent global supply chain and transportation constraints, and limited availability of semiconductor chips and other components of our products, we have\nexperienced and may continue to experience extended lead times, increased logistics intervals and costs, and lower volume of products deliveries, which have\nhad and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our customer relations and our\nfinancial condition.\nThe extent of the impact of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic on our business remains uncertain and difficult to predict because of the dynamic and\nevolving nature of the situation. Despite the widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines and related treatments, the global impact of the outbreak continues to\nadversely affect many industries, and different geographies continue to reflect the effects of public health restrictions in various ways. The economic recovery\nfollowing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is only partially underway and has been gradual, uneven and characterized by meaningful dispersion across\nsectors and regions with uncertainty regarding its ultimate length and trajectory. The COVID-19 pandemic and related countermeasures have previously\nimpacted our operations. During 2022, notwithstanding improvement in many markets in which we operate due to a return to more normalized business\noperations, certain markets continued to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 or as a result of policies relating to COVID-19.\nAdditionally, due to the pandemic and a global semiconductor chip shortage, we experienced disruption and delays in our supply chain and significant price\nincreases with certain of our manufacturing partners, and those disruptions, delays and price increases may continue. For example, in the second half of 2021 and\nthroughout 2022, our results of operations were negatively impacted by increased expenses resulting from supply chain disruptions. With the current global\nsupply chain and transportation constraints, including delays in supply chain deliveries and the related global semi-conductor chip shortage may continue to have\na material adverse effect on our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on customer relations and our financial condition. We believe these\nsupply chain challenges and their adverse impact on our industry will continue to ease during 2023. However, there can be no assurance that the ongoing\ndisruptions due to COVID-19, the related global semiconductor chip shortage or other supply chain constraints or price increases will be resolved in the near\nterm, which could continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of\nthe impact of COVID-19 on our business.\nOur operating results have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, on a quarterly basis due to several factors, including customer order activity, supply chain\nconstraints, component availability, the Company's consolidation, purchase accounting, and integration with ADVA. A substantial portion of our shipments in\nany fiscal period relates to orders received and shipped within that fiscal period for customers under agreements containing non-binding purchase commitments.\nFurther, a significant percentage of orders require delivery within a few days requiring us to maintain higher inventory levels. These factors may result in limited\norder flow visibility. However, with the current global supply chain and transportation constraints, and limited availability of semiconductor chips and other\ncomponents of our products, we have experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times, increased logistics intervals and costs, and lower volume\nof products deliveries, which have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on\ncustomer relations and our financial condition. We believe these supply chain challenges and their adverse impact on our industry will continue at least through\nfiscal 2023 and expect that the extended lead times and elevated supply chain costs experienced by our industry will persist for the reasonably foreseeable future.\nIt is unclear when the supply environment will become less volatile and what impacts the supply environment will have on the industry in future periods.\nOperating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term; therefore, a shortfall in quarterly revenues could significantly impact our financial results in a given\nquarter.\n53\nOur operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors, including a decline in general economic and market conditions, specifically the\ndecline that initially resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic and that may recur and foreign currency exchange rate movements, inflation, regional conflicts,\nincreased competition, customer order patterns, changes in product and services mix, timing differences between price decreases and product cost reductions,\nproduct warranty returns, expediting costs, tariffs and announcements of new products by us or our competitors. Specifically, we expect inflationary pressures on\ninput costs, such as raw materials and labor, and distribution costs to increase. We continue to support our customer demand for our products by working with\nour suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, and customers to address and to limit the disruption to our operations and order fulfillment. Our attempts to\noffset these cost pressures, such as through increases in the selling prices of some of our products and services, may not be successful and could negatively affect\nour operating results. Additionally, maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory that may\nbecome obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of this inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. Also, not\nmaintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products may cause us to incur expediting costs to meet customer delivery requirements,\nwhich may negatively impact our operating results.\nWe are exposed to changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchanges rates we use to\nconvert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-\nexchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period’s currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. Our\nprimary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements are with the Euro and the British pound sterling. As a result of our global operations, our\nrevenue, gross margins, operating expense and operating income in some international markets have been and may continue to be affected by foreign currency\nfluctuations.\nOur historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results, and, in general, management expects that our financial results\nmay vary from period to period. For a discussion of risks associated with our operating results, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this report.\n54\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents selected financial information derived from our Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income expressed as a percentage of revenue for\nthe years indicated.

The emphasis of the discussion is a comparison of the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. For a discussion of a comparison of the\nyears ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021\nRevenue\nOur revenue increased 82.2% from $563.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $1,026 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase\nin revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 is primarily attributable to a $365.9 million increase in volume of sales activity due to the Business\nCombination with ADVA and a $96.6 million increase in volume of sales activity related to our ADTRAN, Inc. operations. The increase in revenue by category\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to a $261.1 million increase in Optical Networking Solutions products due to the Business\nCombination with ADVA and a $184.2 million increase in Subscriber Solutions products. Although our revenue increased, supply of semiconductor chips and\nother components of our products has become constrained resulting in extended lead times and increased costs. Transportation constraints, including shortages\nfor both air and surface freight, as well as labor shortages in the transportation industry, have also affected the timing and the cost of obtaining raw materials and\nproduction supplies. Although our revenue growth and profitability in the near-term may be impacted by these global supply chain issues, our longer term\noutlook continues to strengthen given our progress with new customer opportunities and the increased customer demand.\nNetwork Solutions segment revenue increased 83.8% from $498.8 million in 2021 to $916.8 million in 2022, due primarily to the increase of $320.3 million in\nvolume of sales activity due to the Business Combination with ADVA and the increase in revenue for Subscriber Solutions products of $107.0 million, partially\noffset by a decrease in Access & Aggregation Solutions products of $9.3 million revenue in our ADTRAN, Inc. operations.\n55\nServices & Support revenue increased by 69.5% from $64.2 million in 2021 to $108.7 million in 2022. The increase in revenue for 2022 was primarily\nattributable to the increase of $45.6 million in volume of sales activity from the Business Combination with ADVA partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in\nrevenue for Access & Aggregation Solutions products in our ADTRAN, Inc. operations.\nDomestic revenue increased by 38.1% from $374.6 million in 2021 to $517.4 million in 2022, driven by increased volume of network termination and fiber CPE\nin our Network Solutions segment. In addition, such growth was a result of increased revenue to Tier-2 and Tier-3 customers with diversified business among\nour fiber access and CPE, service provider CPE and services.\nInternational revenue, which is defined as revenue generated from the Network Solutions and Services & Support segments provided to a customer outside of\nthe U.S., increased by 169.7% from $188.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $508.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. International\nrevenue, as a percentage of total revenue, increased from 33.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 49.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The\nincrease in international revenue for 2022 was primarily attributable to the increase in volume of $263.8 million in sales activity from the Business Combination\nwith ADVA and increased shipments to a Tier-1 network operator and multiple alternative network operators in Europe. While international revenue has\nincreased to approximately 49.5% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, the mix of our Network Solutions and Services & Support segments\nas a percentage of total international revenue remains relatively linear. For the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31,\n2021, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S dollar decreased our net sales by approximately $41.5 million.\nOur ADTRAN, Inc. international revenue is largely focused on broadband infrastructure and is consequently affected by the decisions of our customers as to\ntiming for installation of new technologies, expansion of their networks and/or network upgrades. Our international customers must make these decisions in the\nregulatory and political environment in which they operate – both nationally and in some instances, regionally – whether of a multi-country region or a more\nlocal region within a country. Consequently, while we expect the global trend towards deployment of more robust broadband speeds and access to continue\ncreating additional market opportunities for us, the factors described above may result in pressure on revenue and operating income. Our ADVA international\nrevenue is largely focused on the manufacture and selling of networking solutions that are based on three core areas of expertise: fiber-optic transmission\ntechnology (cloud interconnect), cloud access technology for rapid creation of innovative services around the network edge and solutions for precise timing and\nsynchronization of networks. In addition, ADVA's international operations offers a comprehensive portfolio of network design, implementation and maintenance\nservices to assist operators in the deployment of market-leading networks while reducing their cost to maintain these networks.\nCost of Revenue\nAs a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue increased from 61.2% for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 68.1% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The\nincrease was primarily attributable to acquisition related expenses, adjustments consisting of intangible amortization of backlog, developed technology and fair\nvalue adjustments to inventory costs that flow through to cost of revenue as a result of the Business Combination with ADVA, as well as supply chain constraint\nrelated expenses and to a lesser extent changes in customer and product mix and a regional revenue shift in our ADTRAN, Inc. operations. As our current\ninventory that was acquired in the Business Combination with ADVA is sold, we expect that our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue will return to more\nnormalized levels. For the year ended December 31, 2022, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar decreased our cost of revenue by\napproximately $9.6 million.\nNetwork Solutions cost of revenue, as a percentage of that segment’s revenue, increased from 61.7% of revenue in 2021 to 70.6% of revenue in 2022. The\nincrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to acquisition related expenses, amortizations and adjustments consisting of\nintangible amortization of backlog, developed technology and fair value adjustments to inventory costs that flow through to cost of revenue as a result of the\nBusiness Combination with ADVA, as well as supply chain constraint related expenses and to a lesser extent changes in customer and product mix and a regional\nrevenue shift in our ADTRAN, Inc. operations.\nServices & Support cost of revenue, as a percentage of that segment’s revenue, decreased from 57.3% of revenue in 2021 to 47.1% of revenue in 2022. The\ndecrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to customer mix and changes in Services & Support mix as a result of the\nBusiness Combination with ADVA.\nServices & Support revenue is comprised of network planning and implementation, maintenance, support and cloud-based management services, with network\nplanning and implementation being the largest and fastest growing component in the long-term. Compared to our other services, such as maintenance, support\nand cloud-based management services, our network planning and implementation services typically utilize a higher percentage of internal and subcontracted\nengineers, professionals and contractors to perform the work for customers. The additional costs incurred to perform these infrastructure and labor-intensive\nservices inherently result in lower average gross margins as compared to maintenance and support services. Within the Services & Support segment, we do\nexpect variability in gross margins from quarter-to-quarter based on the mix of the services recognized.\n56\nGross Profit\nAs a percentage of revenue, gross profit decreased from 38.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 31.9% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The\ndecrease was primarily attributable to increases in cost of revenue related to acquisition related expenses, adjustments consisting of intangible amortization of\nbacklog, developed technology and fair value adjustments to inventory costs that flow through to cost of revenue as a result of the Business Combination with\nADVA, as well as supply chain constraint related expenses and to a lesser extent changes in customer and product mix and a regional revenue shift in our\nADTRAN, Inc. operations partially offset by an increase in volume of sales activity due to the Business Combination with ADVA and an increase in volume of\nsales activity related to our ADTRAN, Inc. operations.\nAs a percentage of that segment's revenue, Network Solutions gross profit decreased from 38.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 29.4% for the year\nended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to increases in cost of revenue related to acquisition related expenses, adjustments consisting\nof intangible amortization of backlog, developed technology and fair value adjustments to inventory costs that flow through to cost of revenue as a result of the\nBusiness Combination with ADVA, as well as supply chain constraint related expenses and to a lesser extent changes in customer and product mix and a regional\nrevenue shift in our ADTRAN, Inc. operations partially offset by an increase in volume of sales activity due to the Business Combination with ADVA and an\nincrease in volume of sales activity related to our ADTRAN, Inc. operations.\nAs a percentage of that segment's revenue, Services & Support gross profit increased from 42.7% for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 52.9% for the year\nended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in volume of sales activity due to the Business Combination with ADVA, an\nincrease in volume of sales activity related to our ADTRAN, Inc. and a decrease in cost of revenue attributable to customer mix and changes in Services &\nSupport mix as a result of the Business Combination with ADVA.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 22.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 20.4% for the year\nended December 31, 2022. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will generally fluctuate whenever there is a significant\nfluctuation in revenue for the periods being compared as these costs are relatively fixed in the short term.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by 67.9% from $124.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $208.9 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. Selling, general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for management, accounting, information technology, human\nresources, sales and marketing, as well as independent auditor, tax and other professional fees, contract services and legal and litigation related costs. The\nincrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased expenses related to the Business Combination with ADVA such as\nemployee-related costs due to an increase in the number of employees, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and\ntransactions costs. For the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S\ndollar decreased our selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $4.4 million.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 19.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 16.9% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate whenever there are incremental product development\nactivities or significant fluctuations in revenue for the periods being compared as these costs are relatively fixed in the short term.\nResearch and development expenses increased by 59.9% from $108.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $173.8 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to increased expenses related to the Business Combination\nwith ADVA such as employee-related costs due to an increase in the number of employees and expenses related to our multi-year integration program,\namortization of intangible assets and depreciation of property, plant and equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar decreased our research and development expenses by approximately $5.2 million.\nADVA has arrangements with governmental entities for the purposes of obtaining funding for research and development activities. The Company classifies\ngovernment grants received under these arrangements as a reduction to research and development expense incurred. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the\nCompany recognized $1.1 million as a reduction of research and development expense.\nWe expect to continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with our new and existing products. We continually evaluate new product\nopportunities and engage in significant research and product development efforts, which provides for new product development, enhancement of existing\nproducts and product cost reductions. We may incur significant research and development expenses prior to the receipt of revenue from a major new product\ngroup.\n57\nAsset Impairments\nIn connection with the planned integration of information technology following the Business Combination, we determined that certain projects no longer fit our\nneeds. As a result, the Company recognized impairment charges of $17.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily attributable to capitalized\nimplementation costs for a cloud computing arrangement. There were no asset impairments recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 11 of\nthe Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nInterest and Dividend Income\nInterest and dividend income decreased by 25.4% from $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31,\n2022. The decrease in interest and dividend income was primarily attributable to a decrease in the investment balance for the twelve months ended December 31,\n2022. Our investments decreased from $71.0 million as of December 31, 2021 to $33.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and was primarily attributable to the\nsale of certain equity and fixed income investments for working capital and other purposes.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased from less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase\nin interest expense was primarily related to an increase in assumed debt associated with the Business Combination with ADVA and the new Wells Fargo Credit\nAgreement. See Note 13 and Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report and “Financing Activities” in\n“Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.\nNet Investment (Loss) Gain\nWe recognized a net investment gain of $1.8 million and a loss of $11.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The fluctuations\nin our net investments were primarily attributable to changes in the fair value of our securities recognized during the period. We expect that any future market\nvolatility could result in continued fluctuations in our investment portfolio. See “Investing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” of this report and\nNote 1 and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net, increased from income of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to income of $14.5 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, other income (expense), net, is comprised primarily of unrealized gains on foreign\nexchange contracts, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and income from excess material sales. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Part II, Item 8 of the report for additional information on foreign exchange contracts.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nOur effective tax rate changed from an expense of 37.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 to a benefit of 87.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe change in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022, was driven primarily by the release of the majority of our valuation allowance against\nour domestic deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of 2022, that was partially offset by increased international tax expense primarily as a result of our\nclosing of the Business Combination with ADVA during the third quarter of 2022. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in\nPart II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nNet (Loss) Income Attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc.\nAs a result of the above factors, our net loss attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. decreased from $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to a net\nloss of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. As a percentage of revenue, net loss was 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021 and net loss\nwas 0.2% for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nWe have historically financed, our ongoing business with existing cash, investments and cash flow from operations. In the current supply environment we also\nexpect to utilize our credit arrangements to manage our working capital needs. We have used, and expect to continue to use, existing cash, investments, credit\narrangements and cash generated from operations for working capital, business acquisitions, shareholder dividends and other general corporate purposes,\nincluding product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop new products, expand our sales and marketing activities and fund capital\nexpenditures. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has incurred a total of $26.1 million of transaction costs related to the Business Combination. We will also\nbe obligated to compensate any annual net loss of ADVA under the DPLTA. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the DPLTA, each\n58\nADVA shareholder (other than the Company) has received an offer to elect either (1) to remain an ADVA shareholder and receive from us an Annual Recurring\nCompensation payment, or (2) to receive Exit Compensation. Assuming all of the minority holders of currently outstanding ADVA shares were to elect the\nsecond option, we would be obligated to make aggregate Exit Compensation payments of approximately EUR 310.6 million or approximately $333.2 million,\nbased on an exchange rate as of December 31, 2022. Shareholders electing the first option of Annual Recurring Compensation may later elect the second option.\nThe opportunity for outside ADVA shareholders to tender ADVA shares in exchange for Exit Compensation expires on March 16, 2023 (subject to appraisal\nproceedings). Our obligation to pay Annual Recurring Compensation under the DPLTA would lead to a continuing payment obligation, which would amount to\napproximately EUR 10.6 million or $11.4 million (based on the current exchange rate), per year assuming none of the minority ADVA shareholders were to elect\nExit Compensation. The foregoing amounts do not reflect any potential increase in payment obligations that we may have depending on the outcome of ongoing\nappraisal proceedings in Germany.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations and access to funds under the new Wells Fargo credit facility\n(described below) will be adequate to meet our operating and capital needs and our obligations under the Business Combination and the DPLTA for at least the\nnext 12 months.\nAs of December 31, 2022, cash on hand was $108.6 million and short-term investments were $0.3 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of\n$108.9 million, of which $86.3 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2021, cash on hand was $56.6 million and short-term\ninvestments were $0.4 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $57.0 million, of which $47.7 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries.\nGenerally, we intend to permanently reinvest funds held outside the U.S., except to the extent that any of these funds can be repatriated without withholding tax.\nThe decrease in short-term liquidity from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to the sale of certain equity and fixed income\ninvestments for working capital and other purposes.\nIn addition to our cash and cash equivalents and the credit facility, we may fund a portion or all of the Exit Compensation through the sale of securities. There\ncan be no assurances that we would be successful in effecting these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities of $44.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $47.2 million compared to $3.0 million of net cash\nprovided during the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to net cash outflows from working capital, specifically, an inventory build\nrelated to component availability, an increase in accounts receivables and transaction costs related to the Business Combination partially offset by an increase in\nthe average number of days payable to our trade suppliers. Additional details related to our working capital and its drivers are discussed below.\nNet accounts receivable increased 76.0% from $158.7 million as of December 31, 2021 to $279.4 million as of December 31, 2022. There was an allowance for\ncredit losses of less than $0.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and no allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2021. The increase in net accounts\nreceivable was due primarily to the increase in sales volume related to the Business Combination with ADVA and an increase in sales volume in our ADTRAN,\nInc. operations. Quarterly accounts receivable DSO decreased from 95 days as of December 31, 2021 to 72 days as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in DSO\nwas due to customer and geographical mix associated with the Business Combination with ADVA and timing of sales within the quarter.\nOther receivables increased 192.4% from $11.2 million as of December 31, 2021 to $32.8 million as of December 31, 2022. The increase in other receivables\nwas primarily attributable to an increase in prepaid taxes associated with Business Combination with ADVA and contract assets partially offset by a decrease in\nour receivables for sales of raw materials and reclaimed duty drawbacks.\nAnnual inventory turnover decreased from 2.60 turns as of December 31, 2021 to 2.46 turns as of December 31, 2022. Inventory increased 205.6% from $139.9\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 to $427.5 million as of December 31, 2022. The increase in inventory was due to Business Combination with ADVA and\nstrategic inventory buffer purchases given extended component lead times and availability constraints as well as new product ramp ups to ensure supply\ncontinuity. We expect inventory levels to fluctuate as we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory in response to supply chain uncertainties.\nAccounts payable increased 131.9% from $102.5 million as of December 31, 2021 to $237.7 million as of December 31, 2022. The increase in accounts payable\nwas primarily due to the increase in volume of operating costs associated with the Business Combination with ADVA, additional purchases of raw material\ninventory and extended payment terms. Accounts payable will fluctuate due to variations in the timing of the receipt of inventory, supplies and services and our\nsubsequent payments for these purchases.\nInvesting Activities\nCapital expenditures totaled approximately $17.1 million and $5.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These expenditures\nwere primarily used to purchase manufacturing and test equipment, software, computer hardware and building improvements.\n59\nOur combined short-term and long-term investments decreased $38.0 million from $71.0 million as of December 31, 2021 to $33.0 million as of December 31,\n2022. This decrease reflects the impact of the sale of portions of our equity and fixed income investments and the net unrealized and realized gains and losses on\nour investments.\nWe typically invest all available cash not required for immediate use in operations, primarily in securities that we believe bear minimal risk of loss. See Note 6 of\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our corporate bonds, municipal bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency bonds, U.S. government bonds and other government\nbonds were classified as available-for-sale and had a combined duration of 1.74 years with an average Standard & Poor’s credit rating of AA-. Because our\ninvestment portfolio has a high-quality rating and contractual maturities of short duration, we are able to obtain prices for these bonds derived from observable\nmarket inputs, or for similar securities traded in an active market, on a daily basis.\nOur long-term investments decreased 53.7% from $70.6 million as of December 31, 2021 to $32.7 million as of December 31, 2022. Our investments include\nvarious marketable equity securities classified as long-term investments with a fair market value of $0.8 million and $12.6 million, as of December 31, 2022 and\n2021, respectively. Long-term investments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 also included $22.9 million and $26.9 million, respectively, related to our deferred\ncompensation plan.\nFinancing Activities\nDividends\nDuring 2022 and 2021, we paid shareholder dividends totaling $22.9 million and $17.5 million, respectively. The continued payment of dividends is at the\ndiscretion of the Company's Board of Directors and is subject to general business conditions and ongoing financial results of the Company. The following table\nshows dividends per common share paid to our shareholders in each quarter of 2022 and 2021:\nDividends per Common Share\n2022 2021\nFirst Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nSecond Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nThird Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nFourth Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nOn February 20, 2023, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common share to be paid to the\nCompany’s stockholders of record at the close of business on March 7, 2023. The dividends will be paid on March 21, 2023 in the aggregate amount of\napproximately $7.0 million.\nStock Repurchase Program\nThere were no stock repurchases during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and there currently is no authorized stock repurchase plan.\nStock Option Exercises\nTo accommodate employee stock option exercises, the Company issued 0.5 million and 0.4 million shares of common stock and treasury stock which resulted in\nproceeds of $6.9 million and $6.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additionally, to accommodate ADVA Optical\nNetworking SE stock option exercises, ADVA Optical Networking SE issued 0.1 million of ADVA Optical Networking SE common stock which resulted in\nproceeds of $0.8 million, during the period July 15, 2022 to December 31, 2022. ADVA Optical Networking SE stock options outstanding as of December 31,\n2022 totaled 81 thousand (representing less than 0.2% of ADVA's outstanding shares), of which 27 thousand were exercisable.\nEmployee Pension Plan\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries. Pension benefit plan obligations are based on various assumptions\nused by our actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, compensation rate increases, expected return on plan assets,\nretirement rates and mortality rates. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in assumptions could affect future expenses and obligations.\nIn connection with the Business Combination, we acquired $29.6 million of additional obligations and $22.3 million of assets related to postemployment benefit\nplans for certain groups of employees at our new operations outside of the U.S. Plans vary depending on the legal, economic, and tax environments of the\nrespective country. For defined benefit plans, accruals for pensions and similar commitments have been included in the results for this year. The new defined\nbenefit plans are for employees in Switzerland, Italy, Israel and India:\n60\n• In Switzerland, there are two defined benefit pension plans. Both plans provide benefits in the event of retirement, death or disability. The plan's\nbenefits are based on age, years of service, salary and on a participants old age account. The plans are financed by contributions paid by the\nparticipants and by the Company.\n• In Italy, the post-employment benefit plan is required due to statutory provisions. The plan is financed directly by the Company on a pay-as-you-\ngo basis. Employees receive their pension payments as a function of salary, inflation and a notional account.\n• In Israel, there is a defined benefit plan that provides benefits in the event of a participant being dismissed involuntarily, retirement or death. The\nplan's benefits are based on the higher of the severance benefit required by law or the cash surrender value of the severance benefit component of\nany qualifying insurance policy or long-term employee benefit fund that is registered in the participants name. The plan is financed by\ncontributions paid by the Company.\n• In India, the post-employment benefit plan is required due to statutory provisions. The plan is financed directly by the Company on a pay-as-you-\ngo basis.\nOur defined benefit plan assets consist of a balanced portfolio of equity funds, bond funds, emerging market funds, real estate funds and balanced funds. Our\ninvestment policy includes various guidelines and procedures designed to ensure assets are invested in a manner necessary to meet expected future benefits\nearned by participants and consider a broad range of economic conditions. The objectives of our investment policy are to maintain investment portfolios that\ndiversify risk through prudent asset allocation parameters, achieve asset returns that meet or exceed the plans’ actuarial assumptions and achieve asset returns\nthat are competitive with like institutions employing similar investment strategies. The investment policy is periodically reviewed by us and a designated third-\nparty fiduciary for investment matters. At December 31, 2022, the estimated fair market value of our defined benefit pension plans' assets increased to $48.7\nmillion from $32.7 million at December 31, 2021.\nThe defined benefit pension plan is accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the use of various assumptions, including an expected rate of return on\nplan assets and a discount rate. The expected return on our German plan assets that is utilized in determining the benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost\nis derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks\nusing standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration\nto recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return. The discount rate has been derived from\nthe returns of high-quality, corporate bonds denominated in Euro currency with durations close to the duration of our pension obligations. The projected benefit\nobligation for our defined benefit pension plans was $59.3 million and $44.2 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe components of net periodic pension cost, other than the service cost component, are included in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements\nof (Loss) Income. The components of net periodic pension cost and amounts recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income for the years ended December 31,\n2022 and 2021 were ($5.8) million and ($5.0) million, respectively.\nActuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. To the extent unamortized gains and losses exceed 10% of the higher\nof the market-related value of assets or the projected benefit obligation, the excess is amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost over the remaining\nservice period of active participants. We estimate that less than $0.1 million will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income into net\nperiodic pension cost in 2023 for the net actuarial loss. The net actuarial loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of December 31, 2022 and\n2021 was $1.1 million and $7.7 million, respectively. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for\nadditional information.\n61\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or\nother persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources.\nCash Requirements\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s material short- and long-term cash requirements from known obligations pursuant to certain contracts and\ncommitments as of December 31, 2022, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations and payments are expected to be satisfied (but excluding\npayments that may be made pursuant to the DPLTA and currency hedging arrangements, which are discussed below).\n(In thousands) Total 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 After 2027\nWells Fargo credit agreement(1) $ 60,000 $ 60,000 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nNord/LB revolving line of credit(2) 16,091 16,091 — — — — —\nSyndicated credit agreement working\ncapital line of credit(3) 10,727 10,727 — — — — —\nDZ Bank revolving line of credit (4) 9,118 9,118 — — — — —\nSyndicated credit agreement note\npayable(5) 24,598 24,598 — — — — —\nPurchase obligations(6) 552,440 527,562 24,141 309 167 261 —\nOperating lease obligations(7) 34,976 8,992 8,076 6,740 3,825 2,865 4,478\nTotals $ 707,950 $ 657,088 $ 32,217 $ 7,049 $ 3,992 $ 3,126 $ 4,478\n(1) See description below.\n(2) See description below.\n(3) See description below.\n(4) See description below.\n(5) See description below.\n(6) We have purchase obligations related to open purchase orders to our contract manufacturers, ODMs, component suppliers, service partners and other vendors.

See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for more information.\n(7) We have operating leases for office space, automobiles and various other equipment in the U.S. and in certain international locations. Our operating leases had remaining lease terms ranging from one month to 119 months as of December\n31, 2022.\nNew Wells Fargo Credit Agreement\nOn July 18, 2022, ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. and ADTRAN, Inc., as the borrower, entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, including Wells\nFargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (“Administrative Agent”), and the other lenders named therein (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit\nAgreement allows for borrowings of up to $100 million in aggregate principal amount, subject to being increased to up to $400 million in aggregate principal\namount upon the Company or Borrower’s execution of a DPLTA with ADVA or a parent of ADVA, among other conditions (the “Senior Credit Facilities\nIncrease”). The DPLTA as executed on December 1, 2022, became effective on January 16, 2023, as a result of its registration with the commercial register\n(Handelsregister) of the local court (Amtsgericht) at the registered seat of ADVA (Jena). See Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for\nfurther information.\n62\nAs of December 31, 2022, ADTRAN, Inc.’s borrowings under the revolving line of credit were $60.0 million in tranches that mature during the first quarter of\n2023 and can either be repaid or borrowed again for a one month, three month or six month period. In addition, we may issue up to $25 million in letters of\ncredit against the first $100 million in our total facility. As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of $21.3 million in letters of credit with ADTRAN, Inc.\noutstanding against our eligible borrowings, leaving a net amount of $18.7 million available for future borrowings. Upon the DPLTA becoming effective on\nJanuary 16, 2023, the available total borrowings under the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement increased from $100 million to $400 million. On January 31, 2023, the\nCompany increased its borrowings under the Credit Agreement from $60.0 million to $187.5 million. In February 2023, the borrowings under the Credit\nAgreement were paid down by $7.5 million, leaving $180.0 million of borrowings as of February 28, 2023. After considering our outstanding letters of credit,\nthis leaves the Company approximately $198.7 million available for future borrowings as of February 28, 2023. The Company used approximately $51.4 million\nof the proceeds from the borrowings under the Credit Agreement to retire the outstanding borrowings under ADVA's syndicated credit agreement note payable,\nsyndicated credit agreement working capital line of credit and the Nord/LB revolving line of credit. ADVA's $9.1 million of borrowings under its revolving line\nof credit with DZ Bank remain outstanding. Any future credit extensions under the Credit Agreement are subject to customary conditions precedent. The\nproceeds of any loans are expected to be used for general corporate purposes and to pay a portion of the Exchange Offer consideration.\nAll U.S. borrowings under the Credit Agreement (other than swingline loans, which will bear interest at the Base Rate (as defined below)) will bear interest, at\nthe Company’s option, at a rate per annum equal to (A)(i) the highest of (a) the federal funds rate (i.e., for any day, the rate per annum equal to the weighted\naverage of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork on the business day next succeeding such day) plus ½ of 1%, (b) the prime commercial lending rate of the Administrative Agent, as established from time\nto time at its principal U.S. office (which such rate is an index or base rate and will not necessarily be its lowest or best rate charged to its customers or other\nbanks), and (c) the daily Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for a one-month tenor plus 1%, plus (ii) the applicable rate, ranging from\n0.5% to 1.25% (the “Base Rate”), or (B) the sum of the Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus the applicable rate, ranging from 1.4% to\n2.15%, provided that such sum is subject to a 0.0% floor (such loans utilizing this interest rate, “SOFR Loans”). All EU borrowings under the Credit Agreement\n(other than swingline loans) will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Euro Interbank Offered Rate as administered by the European Money\nMarkets Institute (or a comparable or successor administrator approved by the Administrative Agent) plus the applicable rate, ranging from 1.5% to 2.25%,\nprovided that such sum is subject to a 0.0% floor (such loans utilizing this interest rate, “EURIBOR Loans”). The applicable rate is based on the consolidated net\nleverage ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries as determined pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. Default interest is 2.00% per annum in excess of\nthe rate otherwise applicable in the case of any overdue principal or any other overdue amount.\nIn addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the\nCredit Agreement in respect of unutilized revolving loan commitments and an additional commitment ticking fee at a rate of 0.25% on the commitment amounts\nof each lender until the earliest of (i) the date of the Senior Credit Facilities Increase, (ii) the Company’s voluntary termination of the credit facility commitment,\nand (iii) December 31, 2023. The Company is also required to pay a participation fee to the Administrative Agent for the account of each lender with respect to\nthe Company’s participations in letters of credit at the then applicable rate for SOFR Loans.\nThe Credit Agreement permits the Company to prepay any or all of the outstanding loans or to reduce the commitments under the Credit Agreement without\nincurring premiums or penalties (except breakage costs with respect to SOFR Loans and EURIBOR Loans). The Credit Agreement contains customary\naffirmative and negative covenants, including incurrence covenants and certain other limitations on the ability of the Company and the Company’s subsidiaries\nto incur additional debt, guarantee other obligations, grant liens on assets, make investments, dispose of assets, pay dividends or other payments on capital stock,\nmake restricted payments, engage in mergers or consolidations, engage in transactions with affiliates, modify its organizational documents, and enter into certain\nrestrictive agreements. It also contains customary events of default (subject to customary cure periods and materiality thresholds). Furthermore, the Credit\nAgreement requires that the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Company and its subsidiaries tested on the last\nday of each fiscal quarter not exceed 3.25 to 1.0 through September 30, 2024 and 2.75 to 1.00 from December 31, 2024 and thereafter, subject to certain\nexceptions. The Credit Agreement also requires that the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries tested on the last day of each fiscal quarter not fall below 3.00 to 1.00. The Credit Agreement matures in July 2027 but provides the Company with\nan option to request extensions subject to customary conditions.\nFinally, pursuant to a Collateral Agreement, dated as of July 18, 2022, among the Company, ADTRAN, Inc. and the Administrative Agent, ADTRAN, Inc.’s\nobligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of ADTRAN, Inc. and the Company. In addition, the Company has\nguaranteed ADTRAN, Inc.’s obligations under the Credit Agreement pursuant to a Guaranty Agreement, dated as of July 18, 2022, by ADTRAN, Inc. and the\nCompany in favor of the Administrative Agent.\n63\nNord/LB Revolving Line of Credit\nOn August 8, 2022, ADVA entered into a $16.1 million revolving line of credit with Norddeutsche Landesbark - Girozentrale (Nord/LB) that bears interest of\nEuro Short Term Rate plus 1.4% and which matures in August 2023. During the term of the loan, ADVA is obligated to maintain an adjusted net debt to cover\nratio that is equal to or less than 2.75. As of December 31, 2022, ADVA’s borrowings under the revolving line of credit were $16.1 million. On January 31, 2023,\nthe Company increased its borrowings under the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement. A portion of the proceeds from the borrowings were used to retire the\noutstanding borrowings under the Nord/LB revolving line of credit.\nSyndicated Credit Agreement Working Capital Line of Credit\nIn September 2018, ADVA entered into a syndicated credit agreement with Bayerische Landesbank and Deutsche Bank AG Branch German Business to borrow\nup to $10.7 million as part of a working capital line of credit. The interest rate for the working capital line of credit is adjusted periodically based on a defined\nleverage ratio and is currently EURIBOR plus 1.35% as of December 31, 2022. The working capital line of credit matures in September 2023. As of December\n31, 2022, borrowings under the working capital line of credit totaled $10.7 million. On January 31, 2023, the Company increased its borrowings under the Wells\nFargo Credit Agreement. A portion of the proceeds from the borrowings were used to retire the outstanding borrowings under the syndicated credit agreement\nworking capital line of credit.\nDZ Bank Money Market Facility\nAs of December 31, 2022, ADVA’s borrowings under its revolving line of credit with DZ Bank totaled $9.1 million, with no amounts available for future\nborrowings. The interest rate is currently a fixed rate of 2.85%, which resets monthly based on renewal of the loan.\n64\nSyndicated Credit Agreement Note Payable\nIn September 2018, ADVA entered into a syndicated credit agreement with Bayerische Landesbank and Deutsche Bank AG Branch German Business to borrow\n$63.7 million. As of December 31, 2022, the amount outstanding under the note payable is $24.6 million. The interest rate for the note payable is adjusted\nperiodically based on a defined leverage ratio and is currently EURIBOR plus 1.35% as of December 31, 2022.

A portion of the proceeds from the borrowings were used\nto retire the outstanding borrowings under the syndicated credit agreement note payable.\nCurrency Hedging Arrangements\nOn November 3, 2022, the Company entered into a Euro/U.S. dollar cross-currency swap arrangement (the “Swap”) with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Hedge\nCounterparty”). The Swap, which is governed by the provisions of an ISDA Master Agreement (including schedules thereto and transaction confirmations that\nsupplement such agreement) entered into between the Company and the Hedge Counterparty, enable the Company to convert a portion of its Euro denominated\npayment obligations under the DPLTA into U.S. Dollars. Under the Swap, the Company will exchange an aggregate notional amount of $160.0 million U.S.\ndollars for Euros at a daily fixed forward rate ranging from $0.98286 to $1.03290. The aggregate amount of $160.0 million will be divided into eight quarterly\ntranches of $20.0 million. The Company, at its sole discretion, may exchange all or part of each tranche on any given day within the applicable quarter; provided,\nhowever, that it must exchange the full tranche by the end of such quarter. The Swap may be accelerated or terminated early for a number of reasons, including\nbut not limited to (i) non-payment by the Company or the Hedge Counterparty, (ii) breach of representation or warranty or covenant by either party or (iii)\ninsolvency or bankruptcy of either party.\nADVA Domination and Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement\nOn December 1, 2022, we, as the controlling company, entered into the DPLTA with ADVA, as the controlled company (the “DPLTA”). The DPLTA, which was\nexecuted on December 1, 2022, became effective on January 16, 2023, as a result of its registration with the commercial register (Handelsregister) of the local\ncourt (Amtsgericht) at the registered seat of ADVA (Jena).\nUnder the DPLTA, subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law, (i) we are entitled to issue binding instructions to the management board of ADVA,\n(ii) ADVA will transfer all of its annual profits to us, subject to, among other things, the creation or dissolution of certain reserves, and (iii) we will generally\nabsorb all annual losses incurred by ADVA. The obligation of ADVA to transfer its annual profit to us, as well as our obligation to absorb ADVA’s annual net\nloss, applies for the first time to the profits or losses generated in the ADVA fiscal year 2023.\nAdditionally, and subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, the DPLTA provides that ADVA shareholders\n(other than us) be offered, at their election, (i) to put their ADVA shares to the Company in exchange for a compensation in cash of EUR 17.21 per share (the\n“Exit Compensation”), or (ii) to remain ADVA shareholders and receive a recurring compensation in cash of EUR 0.59 (EUR 0.52 net under the current tax\nregime) per share for each full fiscal year of ADVA (the “Annual Recurring Compensation”). The Annual Recurring Compensation is due on the third banking\nday following the ordinary general shareholders’ meeting of ADVA for the respective preceding fiscal year (but in any event within eight months following\nexpiration of the fiscal year) and is first granted for the 2023 fiscal year, payable for the first time after the ordinary general shareholders’ meeting of ADVA in\n2024. The adequacy of both forms of compensation have been challenged by minority shareholders of ADVA via court-led appraisal proceedings under German\nlaw, and it is possible that the courts in such appraisal proceedings may adjudicate a higher Exit Compensation or Annual Recurring Compensation (in each case,\nincluding interest thereon) than agreed upon in the DPLTA. Our aggregate potential payment obligations under the DPLTA are discussed above under\n\"Liquidity\".\nThe opportunity for outside ADVA shareholders to tender ADVA shares in exchange for Exit Compensation had been scheduled to expire on March 16, 2023.\nHowever, due to the appraisal proceedings that have been initiated in accordance with applicable German law, this time period for tendering shares has been\nextended pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and will end two months after the date on which a final decision in such appraisal\nproceedings has been published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger).\nWe currently hold 33,961,170 no-par value bearer shares of ADVA, representing 65.30% of ADVA’s outstanding shares as of February 14, 2023.\nThe foregoing description of the DPLTA does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the DPLTA, a non-binding English\ntranslation of which incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $14.2 million of transaction costs relating to the Business Combination. We expect to incur integration\ncosts and costs associated with the implementation of the DPLTA during 2023 and such costs are expected to be material.\n65\nPerformance Bonds\nCertain contracts, customers and jurisdictions in which we do business require us to provide various guarantees of performance such as bid bonds, performance\nbonds and customs bonds. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had commitments related to these bonds totaling $21.1 million and $22.9 million,\nrespectively, which expire at various dates through April 2031. In general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default\nunder each contract; the probability of which we believe is remote.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the\ntime the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur\ncould materially impact the results of financial operations. Several accounting policies, as described in Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this report, require material subjective or complex judgment and have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of\noperations, as applicable. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our\nConsolidated Financial Statements:\nRevenue\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a customer and as\nperformance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied. Generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of a product to the customer. Review of\ncontracts with customers, for both direct customers and distributors, are performed and assessed for principal versus agent considerations to determine primary\nresponsibility for delivery of performance obligation, presumed inventory risk, and discretion in establishing pricing, when applicable. For transactions where\nthere are multiple performance obligations, individual products and services are accounted for separately if they are distinct (if a product or service is separately\nidentifiable from other items and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer). The\nconsideration, including any discounts, is allocated between separate products and services based on their stand-alone selling prices. Stand-alone selling prices\nare determined based on the prices at which the separate products and services are sold and are allocated based on each item’s relative value to the total value of\nthe products and services in the arrangement. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate stand-alone selling prices primarily using the “expected cost plus\na margin” approach. Payment terms are generally 30 days in the U.S. and typically longer in many geographic markets outside the U.S. Shipping fees are\nrecorded as revenue and the related cost which we have elected to account for as a cost of fulfilling the related contract is included in cost of revenue. Revenue,\nvalue-added and other taxes collected concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Costs of obtaining a contract, if material, are\ncapitalized and amortized over the period that the related revenue is recognized if greater than one year. We have also elected to apply the practical expedient\nrelated to the incremental costs of obtaining contracts and recognize those costs as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets is one year\nor less. These costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Capitalized costs with an amortization period greater than one year were\nimmaterial.\nRevenue is generated by two reportable segments: Network Solutions and Services & Support.\nNetwork Solutions Segment - Includes hardware products and software defined next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or business\nnetworks, as well as prior generation products. The majority of the revenue from this segment is from hardware revenue.\n66\nHardware and Software Revenue\nRevenue from hardware sales is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally when the products are shipped. Shipping terms are\ngenerally FOB shipping point. Revenue from software license sales is recognized at delivery and transfer of control to the customer. Revenue is recorded net of\nestimated discounts and rebates using historical trends. Customers are typically invoiced when control is transferred and revenue is recognized. Our products\ngenerally include assurance-based warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects, which are accrued at the time products are delivered.\nServices & Support Segment - Includes a complete portfolio of maintenance, network implementation and solutions integration and managed services, which\ninclude hosted cloud services and subscription services to complement our Network Solutions segment.\nMaintenance Revenue\nOur maintenance service periods range from one month to five years. Customers are typically invoiced and pay for maintenance services at the beginning of the\nmaintenance period. We recognize revenue for maintenance services on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period as our customers benefit evenly\nthroughout the contract term and deferred revenue, when applicable, is recorded in unearned revenue and non-current unearned revenue. The total balance of our\nunearned revenue was $60.4 million and $27.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNetwork Implementation Revenue\nWe recognize revenue for network implementation, which primarily consists of engineering, execution and enablement services at a point in time when each\nperformance obligation is complete. If we have recognized revenue but have not billed the customer, the right to consideration is recognized as a contract asset\nthat is included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when the completed\nperformance obligation is invoiced to the customer.\nAccounts Receivable Factoring\nThe Company has entered into a factoring agreement to sell certain receivables to an unrelated third-party financial institution on a non-recourse basis. These\ntransactions are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, and result in a reduction in\naccounts receivable because the agreements transfer effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyers. Trade accounts receivables balances\nsold are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash received is reflected as cash provided by (used in) operating activities in the Consolidated\nStatements of Cash Flow. Factoring related interest expense is recorded to interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income. On each sale date,\nthe financial institution retains from the sale price a default reserve, up to a required balance, which is held by the financial institution in a reserve account and\npledged to the Company. The financial institution is entitled to withdraw from the reserve account the sale price of a defaulted receivable. The balance in the\nreserve account is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInventory\nWe carry our inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost being determined using the first-in, first-out method. Standard costs for material,\nlabor, and manufacturing overhead are used to value inventory and are updated at least quarterly. Most variances are expensed in the current period; therefore,\nour inventory costs approximate actual costs at the end of each reporting period. We establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the\ndifference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on estimated reserve percentages, which consider\nhistorical usage, known trends, inventory age and market conditions. If actual trends and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by\nmanagement, we may be required to make additional inventory write-downs. Our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $51.8 million and $44.6 million\nat December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Inventory disposals charged against the reserve were $2.9 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December\n31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\n67\nStock-Based Compensation\nFor purposes of determining the estimated fair value of market-based PSU awards on the date of grant, the Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method is used.\nThese PSUs are subject to a market condition based on the relative total shareholder return of ADTRAN against all of the companies in the NASDAQ\nTelecommunications Index and vest at the end of a three-year performance period. The fair value of performance-based PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock is equal\nto the closing price of our stock on the business day immediately preceding the grant date. Compensation expense related to unvested performance-based PSUs\nis recognized over the requisite service period of two to three years as the achievement of the performance obligation becomes probable. For purposes of\ndetermining the estimated fair value of our stock option awards on the date of grant, we use the Black-Scholes Model. This model requires the input of certain\nassumptions that require subjective judgment. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and\nactual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. Because our stock option awards have characteristics significantly different from those of traded\noptions, and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the existing model may not provide a reliable, single measure\nof the fair value of our stock option awards. Management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of\nstock-based compensation. Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to these assumptions\nand methodologies and thereby materially impact our fair value determination. If factors change in future periods, the compensation expense that we record may\ndiffer significantly from what we have recorded in the current period. As of December 31, 2022, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the non-\nvested portion of market-based PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock was approximately $15.8 million.\nPursuant to the Business Combination, which closed on July 15, 2022, ADVA stock option holders were entitled to have their ADVA stock options assumed by\nADTRAN Holdings (applying the exchange ratio in the Business Combination Agreement), thereafter representing options to acquire stock of ADTRAN\nHoldings. The maximum number of shares of ADTRAN Holdings stock potentially issuable upon such assumption was 2.3 million shares. The period in which\nsuch options could be assumed ended July 22, 2022. A total of 2.1 million shares of ADTRAN Holdings stock are subject to assumed ADVA options. The\ndetermination of the fair value of stock options assumed by ADTRAN Holdings was estimated using the Monte Carlo method and is affected by its stock price,\nas well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables that may have a significant impact on the fair value estimate. The stock option\npricing model requires the use of several assumptions that impact the fair value estimate. These variables include, but are not limited to, the volatility of the\nCompany's stock price and employee exercise behaviors. As of December 31, 2022, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the non-vested portion\nof stock options was approximately $8.3 million.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. The carrying value of goodwill is tested for impairment in the fourth\nquarter of each year or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed at the\nlevel of the reporting unit. The identification of our reporting units begins at the operating segment level and considers whether components one level below the\noperating segment levels should be identified as reporting units for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment. For goodwill impairment testing purposes,\nwe determined the Company's reporting units are generally the same as its operating segments, which are identified in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nOur general policy is to qualitatively assess the carrying value of goodwill each reporting period for events or changes in circumstances that would more likely\nthan not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. In connection with the Business Combination with ADVA the Company\nrecognized $350.5 million of goodwill upon the closing of the exchange offer on July 15, 2022. Therefore, we decided to proceed directly to the quantitative test\nof goodwill and forego the qualitative assessment. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby we calculate the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental\nassumptions about future sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates, which are based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections,\nanticipated future cash flows and market participants. We also estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on a peer group analysis, whereby companies\nin the telecommunications industry or with a comparable product and market structure are used to calculate a fair enterprise value using revenue, EBITDA and\ndebt multiples of trading value. Based on our analysis, management concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill as of December 31, 2022. No goodwill\nimpairment charges were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The balance of our goodwill was $381.7 million and $7.0 million as\nof December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIntangible Assets\nPurchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives of the\nrespective assets.\n68\nAs part of the purchase price allocation related to the Business Combination with ADVA, the Company recognized $403.8 million of intangible assets on July\n15, 2022. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company assessed\nimpairment triggers related to intangible assets during the fourth quarter of 2022, 2021 and 2020. As a result, no quantitative impairment test of long-lived assets\nwas performed as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, and no impairment losses of intangible assets were recorded during the years ended December 31,\n2022, 2021 and 2020. The balance of our intangible assets was $401.2 million and $19.3 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe estimate our income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including estimating exposures related to examinations by\ntaxing authorities. We also make judgments regarding the realization of deferred tax assets and establish valuation allowances where we believe it is more likely\nthan not that future taxable income in certain jurisdictions will be insufficient to realize these deferred tax assets. Our estimates regarding future taxable income\nand income tax provision or benefit may vary due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws, or other factors. If our assumptions, and consequently\nour estimates, change in the future, the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased, impacting future income tax expense. We\ncontinually review the adequacy of our valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that it is more\nlikely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. During the fourth quarter of 2022, after considering all\nquantitative and qualitative evidence, including our cumulative income position, historical operating performance and future income projections, we have\ndetermined that the positive evidence overcame the negative evidence and have concluded that it is more likely than not that a substantial portion of our U.S.\nfederal and certain other state deferred tax assets were realizable. As a result we have released the majority of our valuation allowance against those assets.\nHowever, the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable could be adjusted in future periods in the event that sufficient evidence is no longer present to\nsupport a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our domestic deferred tax assets will be realized.\nWe establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain. We adjust\nthese reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, as facts and circumstances change.\nLiability for Warranty\nOur products generally include warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the time of product shipment based on\nour historical return rate and an estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products. We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes,\nincluding actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. Our products continue to become more complex in both size and\nfunctionality as many of our product offerings migrate from line card applications to total systems. The increasing complexity of our products will cause\nwarranty incidences, when they arise, to be more costly. Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material\nusage, and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen\nproblems arise. Should our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to record additional warranty expense. The\nliability for warranty obligations totaled $7.2 million and $5.4 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These liabilities are included in accrued\nexpenses and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPension Benefit Plan Obligations\nPension benefit plan obligations are based on various assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates,\ncompensation rate increases, expected return on plan assets, retirement rates and mortality rates. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in\nassumptions could affect future expenses and obligations. Our net pension liability totaled $10.6 million and $11.4 million at December 31, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, respectively. This liability is included in pension liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n69\nLease Obligations\nWe have operating leases for office space, automobiles and various other equipment in the U.S. and in certain international locations. Other contracts, such as\nmanufacturing agreements and service agreements, are reviewed to determine if they contain potential embedded leases. These other contracts are specifically\nreviewed to determine whether we have the right to substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of any specified assets or the right to direct the use of\nany specified assets, either of which would indicate the existence of a lease. Some of our leases include options to renew. For those leases that are reasonably\nassured to be renewed, we have included the option to extend as part of our right of use asset and lease liability. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our\nsole discretion. The depreciable life of leased assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months\nor less are not recorded on the balance sheet and lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For lease agreements\nentered into or reassessed after the adoption of Topic 842, we elected to not separate lease and non-lease components. Our lease agreements do not contain any\nmaterial residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company records assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, when applicable, and intangible assets recognized as part of business\ncombinations based on their fair values on the date of acquisition subject to purchase accounting adjustments. The excess of the purchase price over the\nestimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed or acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the estimated fair values of net\ntangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceed the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recorded. The Company’s estimates of fair\nvalue are based on historical experience, industry knowledge, certain information obtained from the management of the acquired company and, in some cases,\nvaluations performed by independent third-party firms. The results of operations of acquired companies are included in the accompanying Consolidated\nStatements of (Loss) Income since their dates of acquisition. Costs incurred to complete the Business Combination, such as legal, accounting or other\nprofessional fees, are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this\nreport for additional information.\n70\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The primary objective of the large majority of\nour investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time achieve appropriate yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective,\na majority of our marketable securities are investment grade, fixed-rate bonds and municipal money market instruments denominated in U.S. dollars. Our\ninvestment policy provides limitations for issuer concentration, which limits, at the time of purchase, the concentration in any one issuer to 5% of the market\nvalue of our total investment portfolio.\nWe maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions. As of December 31, 2022, $100.1 million of our cash and cash equivalents, primarily\ncertain domestic money market funds and foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government provided insured depository limits. Although these\ndepository investments exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit-worthiness of these financial institutions and determined the\nrisk of material financial loss due to exposure of such credit risk to be minimal.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately $10.6 million of our cash and investments may be directly affected by changes in interest rates. As of December 31,\n2022, we held $1.5 million of cash and variable-rate investments where a change in interest rates would impact our interest income. A hypothetical 50 basis point\ndecline in interest rates as of December 31, 2022, assuming all other variables remain constant, would reduce annualized interest income on our cash and\ninvestments by less than $0.1 million. In addition, we held $9.1 million of fixed-rate bonds whose fair values may be directly affected by a change in interest\nrates. A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2022, assuming all other variables remain constant, would reduce the fair value\nof our fixed-rate bonds by approximately $0.1 million. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying amounts of our revolving credit agreements and notes payable\ntotaled $95.9 million and $24.6 million, respectively, where a change in interest rates would impact our interest expense. A hypothetical 50 basis point increase\nin interest rates as of December 31, 2022, assuming all other variables remain constant, would increase our interest expense by $0.6 million. The analyses cover\nour debt and investments. The analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt and investments. The discount rates used were based on the market\ninterest rates in effect at December 31, 2022.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent that such changes affect our revenue and gross margin on revenue derived from some\ninternational customers, expenses, and assets and liabilities held in non-functional currencies related to our foreign subsidiaries. Our primary exposures to\nforeign currency exchange rate movements are with the Euro and the British pound sterling. Our revenue is primarily denominated in the respective functional\ncurrency of the subsidiary and paid in that subsidiary's functional currency or certain other local currency. The majority of our global supply chain predominately\nmakes payments in U.S. dollars and some of our operating expenses are paid in certain local currencies (approximately 28.5% of total operating expense for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022, respectively). Therefore, our revenue, gross margins, operating expenses and operating income (loss) are all subject to foreign\ncurrency fluctuations. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates could cause variations in our operating income (loss).\nWe have certain customers and suppliers who are invoiced or pay in a non-functional currency. Changes in the monetary exchange rates used to invoice such\ncustomers versus the functional currency of the entity billing such customers may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. To manage\nthe volatility relating to these typical business exposures, we may enter into various derivative transactions, when appropriate. We do not hold or issue derivative\ninstruments for trading or other speculative purposes. All non-functional currencies billed would result in a combined hypothetical gain or loss of $8.0 million if\nthe U.S. dollar weakened or strengthened 10% against the billing currencies. All non-functional currencies invoiced by suppliers would result in a combined\nhypothetical gain or loss of $10.4 million if the U.S. dollar weakened or strengthened 10% against the billing currencies. This change represents an increase in\nthe amount of hypothetical gain or loss compared to prior periods and is mainly due to an increase in U.S. dollar denominated billings in a non-U.S. dollar\ndenominated subsidiary.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had certain material contracts subject to currency revaluation, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and lease liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2022, we had 47 forward contracts outstanding with a fair value of $11.9 million. The objective of these\nforeign currency forward contracts is to reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our operating results by offsetting gains and losses on the\nforward contracts with increases or decreases in foreign currency transactions. We do not use foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes.\nHedging of our currency exposures may not always be effective to protect us against currency exchange rate fluctuations. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nIn addition, on November 3, 2022, the Company entered into the Swap with the Hedge Counterparty, which enables the Company to convert a portion of its Euro\ndenominated payment obligations under the DPLTA into U.S. Dollars. Under the Swap, the Company will exchange an aggregate notional amount of $160.0\nmillion U.S. dollars for Euros at a daily fixed forward rate ranging from $0.98286 to\n71\n$1.03290. The aggregate amount of $160.0 million will be divided into eight quarterly tranches of $20.0 million. The Company, at its sole discretion, may\nexchange all or part of each tranche on any given day within the applicable quarter; provided, however, that it must exchange the full tranche by the end of such\nquarter. The Swap may be accelerated or terminated early for a number of reasons, including but not limited to (i) non-payment by the Company or the Hedge\nCounterparty, (ii) breach of representation or warranty or covenant by either party or (iii) insolvency or bankruptcy of either party.\nFor further information about the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2022, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in\nPart II, Item 8 of this report.\n72\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe following consolidated financial statements are contained in this report.\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 74\nFinancial Statements 77\nConsolidated Balance Sheets,\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021 77\nConsolidated Statements of (Loss) Income,\nYears Ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 78\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income,\nYears Ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 79\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Equity,\nYears Ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 80\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows,\nYears Ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 82\nSchedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts,\nYears Ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 139\n73\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of ADTRAN Holdings, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and\n2021, and the related consolidated statements of (loss) income, of comprehensive (loss) income, of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively\nreferred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCOSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nappearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control\nover financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over\nfinancial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing\nand evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as\nwe considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded ADVA Optical Networking SE from its\nassessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination\nduring 2022.We have also excluded ADVA Optical Networking SE from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. ADVA Optical Networking SE is a\nsubsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent\n41.42% and 35.68%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n74\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and\n(ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the\ncritical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAcquisition of ADVA Optical Networking SE – Valuation of Developed Technology, Customer Relationships, and Backlog Intangible Assets\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of ADVA Optical Networking SE for total purchase\nconsideration of $578.3 million on July 15, 2022. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at their respective fair values as of July 15, 2022,\nwhich resulted in the recognition of $403.8 million of identifiable intangible assets. The fair value of the identifiable intangible assets acquired as of the\nacquisition date primarily consisted of developed technology of $291.9 million, customer relationships of $32.7 million, and backlog of $52.2 million. In\ndetermining the fair value, management utilized various methods of the income approach depending on the asset. The estimation of fair value required\nsignificant judgment by management related to net cash flows reflecting the risk inherent in each cash flow stream, competitive trends, market comparables and\nother factors. Inputs were generally determined by taking into account historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, and growth rates. Developed\ntechnology and customer relationships were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method. Backlog was valued using the distributor method. Significant\nassumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis for (i) developed technology were the revenue growth rates, long-term revenue growth rate, discount rate,\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margins, obsolescence factors, income tax rate, tax depreciation, and economic\ndepreciation; (ii) customer relationships were earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margins, contributory asset charges, and customer attrition rate; and (iii)\nbacklog were EBIT margins, adjusted EBIT margins, and contributory asset charges.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the developed technology, customer relationships, and\nbacklog intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of ADVA Optical Networking SE is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management\nwhen developing the fair value estimates of the identifiable intangible assets acquired; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in\nperforming procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to the revenue growth rates, long-term revenue growth rate, discount rate,\nEBITDA margins, obsolescence factors, income tax rate, tax depreciation, and economic depreciation used in the valuation of the developed technology; EBIT\nmargins, contributory asset charges, and customer attrition rate used in the valuation of the customer relationships; and EBIT margins, adjusted EBIT margins,\nand contributory asset charges used in the valuation of the backlog; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and\nknowledge.\n75\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over the valuation\nof the identifiable intangible assets acquired. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing management’s\nprocess for developing the fair value estimates of the developed technology, customer relationships, and backlog intangible assets; (iii) evaluating the\nappropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings and distributor methods; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used by management\nin the valuation methods; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management related to the revenue growth rates, long-term\nrevenue growth rate, discount rate, EBITDA margins, obsolescence factors, income tax rate, tax depreciation, and economic depreciation used in the valuation of\nthe developed technology; EBIT margins, contributory asset charges, and customer attrition rate used in the valuation of the customer relationships; and EBIT\nmargins, adjusted EBIT margins, and contributory asset charges used in the valuation of the backlog. Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant\nassumptions related to the revenue growth rates, long-term revenue growth rate, EBITDA margins, obsolescence factors, income tax rate, tax depreciation, and\neconomic depreciation related to the developed technology; the EBIT margins, contributory asset charges, and customer attrition rate related to the customer\nrelationships; and EBIT margins, adjusted EBIT margins, and contributory asset charges related to backlog involved considering (i) the past performance of the\nacquired business; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in\nother areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the valuation methods\nused and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate significant assumption.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nBirmingham, Alabama\nMarch 1, 2023\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1986.\n76\nFinancial Statements\nADTRAN Holdings, Inc.\nConsolidated

In addition to our global headquarters in Huntsville, Alabama, and our European headquarters in Munich, Germany, we\nhave sales and research and development facilities in strategic global locations.\nIn 2022, following the business combination (the “Business Combination”) with ADVA Optical Networking SE (“ADVA”), which included the Merger, we\nbecame the sole owner of and successor to ADTRAN, Inc. and the majority shareholder of ADVA. ADTRAN, Inc. is a leading global provider of open,\ndisaggregated networking and communications solutions that enable voice, data, video, and internet communications across any network infrastructure. Its\naward-winning end-to-end fiber broadband solutions portfolio spans from OLTs to in-home services and intelligent SaaS solutions.

ADVA has led the\nindustry for over two decades with open and secure networking solutions that carefully balance space, power and cost. Together, we serve customers in a broad\nrange of industries in over 100 countries.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S.\nGAAP”) and include the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, changes in equity and cash flows of ADTRAN and its wholly-\nowned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts\nof assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense\nduring the reporting period. Significant estimates include allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable and contract assets, excess and obsolete inventory\nreserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates, determination and accrual of the deferred revenue related to performance obligations under contracts with\ncustomers, estimated costs to complete obligations associated with deferred and accrued revenues and network installations, estimated income tax provision and\nincome tax contingencies, fair value of stock-based compensation, assessment of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment, estimated lives of intangible\nassets, estimates of intangible assets upon measurement, estimated pension liability and fair value of investments. Actual amounts could differ significantly from\nthese estimates.\nWe assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably\navailable to us and the unknown future impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus/COVID-19 global pandemic (or variants of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus),\nsupply chain constraints, inflationary pressures, the energy crisis, currency fluctuations and political tensions as of December 31, 2022 and through the date of\nthis report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the allowance for credit losses, stock-based compensation, carrying value of\ngoodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets, financial assets, valuation allowances for tax assets, revenue recognition and costs of revenue. Future\nconditions related to the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors, including supply chain constraints and inflationary\npressures could result in further impacts to the Company's consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\nCorrection of Immaterial Misstatements\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, it was determined that certain investments held in the Company’s stock for a deferred compensation plan accounted for as a\nRabbi trust were incorrectly classified as long-term investments with the fair value of such investments incorrectly marked to market at each period end rather\nthan classified as treasury stock held at historical cost. This plan has been in existence since 2011. The Company corrected this misstatement as an out-of-period\nadjustment in the three months ended March 31, 2020 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, by remeasuring the investment assets to their historical\ncost basis through the\n83\nrecording of a net investment gain of $1.5 million in the Consolidated Statement of (Loss) Income and then correcting the classification by decreasing the long-\nterm investment balance at its remeasured cost basis of $2.8 million to treasury stock in the Consolidated 2020 Balance Sheet. Management has determined that\nthis misstatement was not material to any of its previously issued financial statements and that correction of the misstatement was not material to the 2020\nannual financial results on either a quantitative or qualitative basis.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents represent demand deposits, money market funds and short-term investments classified as available-for-sale with original maturities of\nthree months or less. We maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions. As of December 31, 2022, $100.1 million of our cash and cash\nequivalents, primarily certain domestic money market funds and foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government provided insured depository limits.\nAlthough these depository investments may exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit worthiness of these applicable financial\ninstitutions and determined the risk of material financial loss due to the exposure of such credit risk to be minimal.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable\nprices or inputs are not available, valuation models may be applied. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets are categorized\nbased upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair values.\nThe carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair\nvalue due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.\nThe fair value measurements of our derivative instruments are determined using models that maximize the use of the observable market inputs including interest\nrate curves and both forward and spot prices for currencies, and are classified as Level II under the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of our derivatives are\nincluded in Note 12.\nThe estimated fair value of our notes payable, approximates the carrying value and is classified as Level II under the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value of\nour notes payable is included in Note 14.\nInvestments with contractual maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable\nsecurities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Despite the long-term nature of their stated contractual maturities, we routinely\nbuy and sell these securities and we believe we have the ability to quickly sell them to the remarketing agent, tender agent or issuer at par value plus accrued\ninterest in the event we decide to liquidate our investment in a particular variable rate demand note. All income generated from these investments is recorded as\ninterest income. We have not recorded any losses relating to variable rate demand notes.\nLong-term investments is comprised of deferred compensation plan assets, corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-\nbacked bonds, U.S. and foreign government bonds, marketable equity securities and other equity investments. Marketable equity securities are reported at fair\nvalue as determined by the most recently traded price of the securities at the balance sheet date, although the securities may not be readily marketable due to the\nsize of the available market. Any changes in fair value are recognized in net investment (loss) gain. Realized gains and losses on sales of debt securities are\ncomputed under the specific identification method and are included in other income (expense). See Note 6 for additional information.\nFor financing receivables, the Company does not measure the allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables, as the uncollectable accrued interest\nreceivable is written off by reversing any previously recorded interest income in a timely manner (as soon as these amounts are determined to be uncollectable).\nAccounts Receivable\nWe record accounts receivable at amortized cost. Prior to establishing payment terms for a new customer, we evaluate the credit risk of the customer. Credit\nlimits and payment terms established for new customers are re-evaluated periodically based on customer collection experience and other financial factors. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, single customers comprising more than 10% of our total accounts receivable balance included three customers, which accounted for 33.1%\nof our total accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2022, these three customers individually accounted for 11.4%, 11.1% and 10.6%, respectively, of our total\naccounts receivable. As of December 31, 2021, single customers comprising more than 10% of our total accounts receivable balance included three customers,\nwhich accounted for 59.9% of our total accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2021, these three customers individually accounted for 35.8%, 12.1% and\n12.0%, respectively, of our total accounts receivable.\nWe regularly review the need for an allowance for credit losses related to our outstanding accounts receivable balances using the historical loss-rate method as\nwell as assessing asset-specific risks. The assessment of asset-specific risks included the evaluation of\n84\nrelevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to current conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay, such as the\ncustomer’s current financial condition or credit rating by geographic location, as provided by a third party and/or by customer, if needed, and overall macro-\neconomic conditions in which the customer operates. Based on this assessment, an allowance for credit losses would be recorded if the Company determined\nthat, based on our historical write-offs, which have been immaterial, and such asset specific risks, there was risk in collectability of the full amount of any\naccounts receivable.\nAccounts Receivable Factoring\nThe Company has entered into a factoring agreement to sell certain receivables to an unrelated third-party financial institution on a non-recourse basis. These\ntransactions are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, and result in a reduction in\naccounts receivable because the agreements transfer effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyers. Trade accounts receivables balances\nsold are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash received is reflected as cash provided by (used in) operating activities in the Consolidated\nStatements of Cash Flow. Factoring related interest expense is recorded to interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Loss. On each sale date, the\nfinancial institution retains from the sale price a default reserve, up to a required balance, which are held by the financial institution in a reserve account and\npledged to the Company. The financial institution is entitled to withdraw from the reserve account the sale price of a defaulted receivable. The balance in the\nreserve account is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInventory\nInventory is carried at the lower of cost and estimated net realizable value, with cost being determined using the first-in, first-out method. Standard costs for\nmaterial, labor and manufacturing overhead are used to value inventory and are updated at least quarterly. We establish reserves for estimated excess and\nobsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on estimated reserve\npercentages, which consider historical usage, known trends, inventory age and market conditions. When we dispose of excess and obsolete inventories, the\nrelated disposals are charged against the inventory reserve. See Note 7 for additional information.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment, which is stated at cost, is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We depreciate\nbuilding and land improvements from five to 39 years, office machinery and equipment from three to seven years, engineering machinery and equipment from\nthree to seven years, and computer software from three to five years. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Major\nimprovements that materially prolong the lives of the assets are capitalized. Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are recorded in\noperating loss. See Note 8 for additional information.\nIntangible Assets\nPurchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives of the\nrespective assets. See Note 11 for additional information.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles\nLong-lived assets used in operations are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may\nnot be recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value. In connection with the planned\nintegration of information technology following the Business Combination, we determined that certain projects no longer fit our needs. As a result the Company\nrecognized impairment charges of $17.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 related to capitalized implementation costs for a cloud computing\narrangement. The impairment charges were determined based on actual costs incurred. There were no impairment losses for long-lived assets during the years\nended December 31, 2021 and 2020, or for intangible assets recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020.\n85\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. The carrying value of goodwill is tested for impairment in the fourth\nquarter of each year or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed at the\nlevel of the reporting unit. The identification of our reporting units begins at the operating segment level and considers whether components one level below the\noperating segment levels should be identified as reporting units for purpose of testing goodwill for impairment. For goodwill impairment testing purposes, the\nCompany determined the Company's reporting units are generally the same as its operating segments, which are identified in Note 18 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nOur general policy is to qualitatively assess the carrying value of goodwill each reporting period for events or changes in circumstances that would more likely\nthan not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Related to the Business Combination with ADVA the Company recognized $350.5\nmillion of goodwill upon the merger on July 15, 2022. Therefore, we decided to proceed directly to the quantitative test of goodwill and forego the qualitative\nassessment. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the\npresent value of estimated future cash flows. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about future sales, operating\nmargins, growth rates and discount rates, which are based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and market\nparticipants. We also estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on a peer group analysis, whereby companies in the telecommunications industry or\nwith a comparable product and market structure are used to calculate a fair enterprise value using revenue, EBITDA and debt multiples of trading value. Based\non our analysis, management concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill as of December 31, 2022. No impairment charges on goodwill were\nrecognized during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nOther Non-Current Assets\nImplementation costs incurred for hosting arrangements that are related to service contracts are capitalized and amortized over the term of the arrangement.\nCapitalized implementation costs totaled $6.2 million and $21.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively and are included in other non-current\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In connection with the planned integration of information technology following the Business Combination, we\ndetermined that certain projects no longer fit our needs. As a result the Company recognized impairment charges of $16.9 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 related to capitalized implementation costs for a cloud computing arrangement. The impairment charges were determined based on actual\ncosts incurred. During the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, no impairment charges were recognized. We depreciate capitalized implementation costs on\na straight-line basis over ten years. Amortization expense was $3.9 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively,\nwhich is recorded almost entirely in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income. No amortization expense was\nrecognized for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nLiability for Warranty\nOur products generally include warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the time of product shipment based on\nour historical return rate and estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products. We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes,\nincluding actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. The increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences,\nwhen they arise, to be more costly. Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage and other rework\ncosts incurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise. Should our\nactual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to record additional warranty expense. Our liability for warranty\nreturns totaled $7.2 million and $5.4 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nPension Benefit Plan Obligations\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries. Pension benefit plan obligations are based on various assumptions\nused by our actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, compensation rate increases, expected return on plan assets,\nretirement rates and mortality rates. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in assumptions could affect future expenses and obligations. Our\nnet pension liability totaled $10.6 million and $11.4 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n86\nLease Obligations\nWe have operating leases for office space, automobiles and various other equipment in the U.S. and in certain international locations. Other contracts, such as\nmanufacturing agreements and service agreements, are reviewed to determine if they contain potential embedded leases. These other contracts are specifically\nreviewed to determine whether we have the right to substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of any specified assets or the right to direct the use of\nany specified assets, either of which would indicate the existence of a lease. Some of our leases include options to renew, with renewal terms of up to five years.\nFor those leases that are reasonably assured to be renewed, we have included the option to extend as part of our right of use asset and lease liability. The exercise\nof lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. The depreciable life of leased assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term. Leases\nwith an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nlease term. For lease agreements entered into or reassessed after the adoption of Topic 842, we elected to not separate lease and non-lease components. Our lease\nagreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have two stock incentive plans from which stock options, performance stock units (“PSUs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock are\navailable for grant to employees and directors. Costs related to these awards are recognized over their vesting periods.\nStock-based compensation expense recognized for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $28.3 million, $7.5 million, and $6.8\nmillion, respectively. See Note 5 for additional information.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs include compensation for engineers and support personnel, contracted services, depreciation and material costs associated with\nnew product development, enhancement of current products and product cost reductions. We continually evaluate new product opportunities and engage in\nintensive research for product and software development efforts. Research and development costs totaled $173.8 million, $108.7 million and $113.3 million for\nthe years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nADVA has arrangements with governmental entities for the purposes of obtaining funding for research and development activities. The Company classifies\ngovernment grants received under these arrangements as a reduction to research and development expense incurred. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the\nCompany recognized $1.1 million as a reduction of research and development expense.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes\nrepresent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes\nrepresents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from the difference between\nfinancial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when such changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are\nrecorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.\nWe establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain. We adjust\nthese reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, as facts and circumstances change.\n87\nForeign Currency\nTransactions with customers that are denominated in foreign currencies are recorded using the appropriate exchange rates from throughout the year. Assets and\nliabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the balance sheet dates using the closing rates of exchange between those foreign currencies and\nthe functional currency with any transaction gains or losses reported in other income (expense). Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate\nmovements are with our German subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Euro and our Australian subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Australian\ndollar. Adjustments resulting from translating financial statements of international subsidiaries are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive\n(loss) income.\nRevenue\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a customer and as\nperformance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied. Generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of a product to the customer. Review of\ncontracts with customers, for both direct customers and distributors, are performed and assessment made regarding principal versus agent considerations to\ndetermine primary responsibility for delivery of performance obligation, presumed inventory risk, and discretion in establishing pricing, when applicable. For\ntransactions where there are multiple performance obligations, individual products and services are accounted for separately if they are distinct (if a product or\nservice is separately identifiable from other items and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the\ncustomer). The consideration, including any discounts, is allocated between separate products and services based on their stand-alone selling prices. Stand-alone\nselling prices are determined based on the prices at which the separate products and services are sold and are allocated based on each item’s relative value to the\ntotal value of the products and services in the arrangement. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate stand-alone selling prices primarily using the\n“expected cost plus a margin” approach. Payment terms are generally 30 days in the U.S. and typically longer in many geographic markets outside the U.S.\nShipping fees are recorded as revenue and the related cost is included in cost of revenue. Revenue, value-added and other taxes collected concurrently with\nrevenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Costs of obtaining a contract, if material, are capitalized and amortized over the period that the related\nrevenue is recognized if greater than one year. We have elected to account for shipping fees as a cost of fulfilling the related contract. We have also elected to\napply the practical expedient related to the incremental costs of obtaining contracts and recognize those costs as an expense when incurred if the amortization\nperiod of the assets is one year or less. These costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Capitalized costs with an amortization period\ngreater than one year were immaterial.\nRevenue is generated by two reportable segments: Network Solutions and Services & Support.\nNetwork Solutions Segment - Includes hardware products and software defined next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or business\nnetworks, as well as prior generation products. The majority of the revenue from this segment is from hardware revenue.\nHardware and Software Revenue\nRevenue from hardware sales is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally when the products are shipped. Shipping terms are\ngenerally FOB shipping point. Revenue from software license sales is recognized at delivery and transfer of control to the customer. Revenue is recorded net of\nestimated discounts and rebates using historical trends. Customers are typically invoiced when control is transferred and revenue is recognized. Our products\ngenerally include assurance-based warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects, which are accrued at the time products are delivered.\nServices & Support Segment - Includes a complete portfolio of maintenance, network implementation and solutions integration and managed services, which\ninclude hosted cloud services and subscription services to complement our Network Solutions segment.\nMaintenance Revenue\nOur maintenance service periods range from one month to five years. Customers are typically invoiced and pay for maintenance services at the beginning of the\nmaintenance period. We recognize revenue for maintenance services on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period as our customers benefit evenly\nthroughout the contract term and deferred revenue, when applicable, are recorded in current and non-current unearned revenue.\n88\nNetwork Implementation Revenue\nWe recognize revenue for network implementation, which primarily consists of engineering, execution and enablement services at a point in time when each\nperformance obligation is complete. If we have recognized revenue but have not billed the customer, the right to consideration is recognized as a contract asset\nthat is included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when the completed performance\nobligation is invoiced to the customer.\nSee Notes 4 and 18 for additional information on reportable segments.\nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue primarily represents customer billings on maintenance service programs and unearned revenue related to multiple element contracts where we\nstill have contractual obligations to our customers. We currently offer maintenance contracts ranging from one month to five years. Revenue attributable to\nmaintenance contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over the related contract term. In addition, we provide software maintenance and a variety of\nhardware maintenance services to customers under contracts with terms up to ten years. When we defer revenue related to multiple performance obligations\nwhere we still have contractual obligations, we also defer the related costs. Current deferred costs are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on\nthe accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $1.5 million and $0.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Non-current deferred\ncosts are included in other non-current assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and less than $0.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and $0.1\nmillion as of December 31, 2021.\n(Loss) Earnings per Share\n(Loss) earnings per common share and (loss) earnings per common share assuming dilution are based on the weighted average number of common shares and,\nwhen dilutive, common equivalent shares outstanding during the year. See Note 22 for additional information.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company records assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, when applicable, and intangible assets recognized as part of business\ncombinations based on their fair values on the date of acquisition subject to purchase accounting adjustments. The excess of the purchase price over the\nestimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed or acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the estimated fair values of net\ntangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceed the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recorded. The Company’s estimates of fair\nvalue are based on historical experience, industry knowledge, certain information obtained from the management of the acquired company and, in some cases,\nvaluations performed by independent third-party firms. The results of operations of acquired companies are included in the accompanying Consolidated\nStatements of (Loss) Income since their dates of acquisition. Costs incurred to complete the Business Combination, such as legal, accounting or other\nprofessional fees are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred.\nNon-Controlling Interest\nNon-controlling interest represents the equity interest in ADVA held by holders other than the Company. On July 15, 2022, upon the close of the Business\nCombination, the ADVA stockholders’ equity ownership percentage in ADVA was approximately 36%. The Company has consolidated the financial position and\nresults of operations of ADVA and reflected the proportionate interest held by the ADVA stockholders as non-controlling interest in the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, the ADVA stockholders’ equity ownership percentage in ADVA was approximately 34.7%.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nThere are currently no recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted which would have a material effect on the Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic\n805) Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which would require an acquirer to recognize and measure\nacquired contract assets and contract liabilities in a manner consistent with how the acquiree recognized and measured them in its pre-acquisition financial\nstatements in accordance with Topic 606, Revenue Recognition. The Company early adopted ASU 2021-08 on July 1, 2022 and the standard was applied\nretrospectively beginning with January 1, 2022.\nNote 2 – Business Combination Agreement\nADVA Optical Networking SE\nOn August 30, 2021, ADTRAN and ADVA, entered into a Business Combination Agreement, pursuant to which both companies agreed to combine their\nrespective businesses and each become subsidiaries of a new holding company, ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. (formerly\n89\nknown as Acorn HoldCo, Inc.) which was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ADTRAN in order to consummate the transactions under the Business\nCombination Agreement. Under the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, on July 8, 2022, Acorn MergeCo, Inc, a Delaware corporation and wholly-\nowned direct subsidiary of the Company, merged with and into ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. leaving ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. surviving the Business Combination\nas a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the Company.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, on July 15, 2022, the Company made a public offer to exchange each issued and outstanding no-\npar value bearer share of ADVA for 0.8244 shares of Company Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share of the Company. The Exchange Offer was settled on\nExchange Offer Settlement Date, on which date the Company acquired 33,957,538 bearer shares of ADVA, or 65.43% of ADVA’s outstanding bearer shares as of\nthe Exchange Offer Settlement Date, in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of 27,994,595 shares of Company Common Stock. Additionally, pursuant to\nthe Business Combination Agreement, ADVA stock option holders were entitled to have their ADVA stock options assumed by ADTRAN Holdings, Inc.\n(applying the exchange ratio in the Business Combination Agreement), thereafter representing options to acquire stock of ADTRAN, Inc. The fair value of the\nADVA stock options assumed by ADTRAN, Inc. was $12.8 million, estimated using the Monte Carlo method.\nADTRAN, Inc. and ADVA became subsidiaries of ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. as a result of the Business Combination. ADTRAN was determined to be the\naccounting acquirer of ADVA based on ADTRAN shareholders’ majority equity stake in the combined company, the composition of the board of directors and\nsenior management of the combined company, among other factors. The Business Combination of ADVA has been accounted for using the acquisition method of\naccounting as per the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”). The Business Combination Agreement used\na fixed exchange ratio of Company Common Stock for ADVA shares of common stock, which resulted in a 36% equity stake for ADVA stockholders and 64%\nequity stake for ADTRAN stockholders in the post-closing combined company (calculated on a fully diluted basis and utilizing the tender of 65.43% of ADVA’s\ncurrent issued and outstanding share capital). Therefore, ADTRAN shareholders continue to hold a majority interest in the combined company after the Business\nCombination was completed. Additionally, the Board of Directors is comprised of six members from ADTRAN and three members from ADVA; the current\nADTRAN chief executive officer acts as the chairman of the Board of Directors and the former ADVA chief executive officer as the vice chairman of the Board\nof Directors. Additionally, the current ADTRAN chief executive officer and ADTRAN chief financial officer hold these positions within the combined company.\nBased upon these and other considerations as outlined in ASC 805, ADTRAN represents the accounting acquirer.\nThe following table summarizes the purchase price for the ADVA business combination:\n(In thousands, except shares, share price and exchange ratio) Purchase Price\nADVA shares exchanged 33,957,538\nExchange ratio 0.8244\nADTRAN Holdings, Inc. shares issued 27,994,595\nADTRAN Holdings, Inc. share price on July 15, 2022 $ 20.20\nPurchase price paid for ADVA shares $ 565,491\nEquity compensation (1) $ 12,769\nTotal purchase price $ 578,260\n(1) Represents the portion of replacement share-based payment awards that relates to pre-combination vesting.\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at their respective fair values as of July 15, 2022. In determining the fair value, the Company utilized\nvarious methods of the income, cost and market approaches depending on the asset or liability being fair valued. The estimation of fair value required significant\njudgment related to future net cash flows reflecting the risk inherent in each cash flow stream, competitive trends, market comparables and other factors. Inputs\nwere generally determined by taking into account historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, and growth rates.\nDeveloped technology and customer relationships were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method. Backlog was valued using the distributor method.\nSignificant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis for (i) developed technology were the revenue growth rates, long-term revenue growth rate,\ndiscount rate, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) margins, obsolescence factors, income tax rate, tax depreciation,\nand economic depreciation; (ii) customer relationships were earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”) margins, contributory asset charges, and customer\nattrition rate; and (iii) backlog were EBIT margins, adjusted EBIT margins, and contributory asset charges.\nThe allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was subject to adjustment within the measurement period (up to one year from\nthe acquisition date). The measurement period adjustments since initial preliminary estimates resulted from changes to the fair value estimates of the acquired\nassets and assumed liabilities based on finalizing the valuations of inventory, prepaid expenses and other current assets, property plant and equipment, intangible\nassets, other non-current assets and deferred tax assets and liabilities. The cumulative effect of all measurement period adjustments resulted in a decrease to\nrecognized goodwill of $8.7 million.\n90\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation for each major class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of\nADVA (in thousands):\n(cid:0)(cid:3)\n(In thousands)\n(cid:0)(cid:3)\nTotal purchase price (cid:0)(cid:3) $ 578,260\nNon-controlling interest (cid:0)(cid:3) $ 316,415\nNet Assets: (cid:0)(cid:3)\nCash and cash equivalents (cid:0)(cid:3) $ 44,003\nAccounts receivable (cid:0)(cid:3) 114,659\nOther receivables (cid:0)(cid:3) 1,457\nInventory (cid:0)(cid:3) 200,331\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets (cid:0)(cid:3) 28,208\nProperty plant and equipment (cid:0)(cid:3) 55,480\nDeferred tax assets (cid:0)(cid:3) 1,759\nIdentifiable intangible assets (cid:0)(cid:3) 403,780\nOther non-current assets (cid:0)(cid:3) 31,074\nAccounts payable (cid:0)(cid:3) (98,587)\nCurrent unearned revenue (cid:0)(cid:3) (26,047)\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities (cid:0)(cid:3) (59,600)\nIncome tax payable, net (cid:0)(cid:3) (4,898)\nCurrent portion of notes payable (cid:0)(cid:3) (25,254)\nTax liabilities (cid:0)(cid:3) (1,400)\nNon-current unearned revenue (cid:0)(cid:3) (11,498)\nPension liability (cid:0)(cid:3) (6,820)\nOther non-current liabilities (cid:0)(cid:3) (6,094)\nNon-current portion of revolving credit agreements and notes payable (cid:0)(cid:3) (15,250)\nNon-current lease obligations (cid:0)(cid:3) (20,046)\nDeferred tax liabilities (cid:0)(cid:3) (61,040)\nTotal net assets acquired (cid:0)(cid:3) $ 544,217\nGoodwill (cid:0)(cid:3) $ 350,458\nThe allocation of the purchase price and fair value assessment of goodwill, deferred tax assets, and deferred tax liabilities continues to be preliminary. The\nacquisition accounting is subject to revision once the Company receives final information. It is possible that the final assessment of fair value may differ\nmaterially from the preliminary assessment. If the final assessment differs from this preliminary assessment, the measurement period adjustments will be\nrecorded in the period in which they are determined as if they had been completed at the acquisition date.\nThe preliminary fair value of the assets acquired include accounts receivable of $114.7 million and other receivables of $1.5 million. The unpaid principal\nbalance under these receivables is $118.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The difference between the fair value and the unpaid principal balance primarily\nrepresents amounts expected to be uncollectible.\nThe fair value of the identifiable intangible assets acquired as of the acquisition date:\nEstimated-average useful life\n(In thousands) (in years) (1) Fair value Income Statement Amortization Classification\nDeveloped technology 8.5 $ 291,925 Cost of revenue - Network Solutions\nBacklog 1.4 52,165 Cost of revenue - Network Solutions and Services & Support\nCustomer relationships 10.5 32,704 Selling, general and administrative expenses\nTrade name 2.8 26,986 Selling, general and administrative expenses\nTotal $ 403,780\n(1) Determination of the weighted average period of the individual categories of intangible assets was based on the nature of the applicable intangible asset and\nthe expected future cash flows to be derived from the intangible asset. Amortization of intangible assets with definite lives is recognized over the period of time\nthe assets are expected to contribute to future cash flows.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Based on preliminary estimates, the\nADVA acquisition resulted in the recognition of goodwill of $350.5 million, which the Company believes is attributable to the value driven by the Company’s\nexpected growth of the business, synergies, and expanded market and product opportunities. Goodwill created as a result of the ADVA acquisition is not\ndeductible for tax purposes.\n91\nAfter the Business Combination, the chief operating decision maker assessed and will continue to assess the Company’s performance and allocate resources to\nits two segments (1) Network Solutions and (2) Services & Support. Based on preliminary estimates, the goodwill resulting from the Business Combination of\n$272.8 million was allocated to the Network Solutions segment, and $77.7 million was allocated to the Services & Support segment. See Note 18 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements, included in this report for more information about the Company’s segments.\nAs of the acquisition date, the fair value of the non-controlling interest was approximately $316.4 million and determined using a market approach. As a portion\nof ADVA shares will remain trading after the Business Combination, the non-controlling interest was calculated using 17,941,496 ADVA shares held by non-\ncontrolling interest multiplied by the ADVA closing share price of €17.58 ($17.64 using the July 15, 2022 EUR to USD conversion rate of $1.00318) on July 15,\n2022.\nThe Company included the financial results of ADVA in its consolidated financial statements since July 15, 2022, the acquisition date. The net revenue and net\nloss from the ADVA business since July 15, 2022, were $365.9 million and $12.9 million, respectively, which are included in the Company’s Consolidated\nStatement of Loss. The net loss attributable to non-controlling interest from the ADVA business for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $6.9 million.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has incurred $26.1 million of transaction costs related to the Business Combination, of which $14.2 million and $11.9\nmillion were incurred during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These transaction costs are recorded in selling, general and\nadministrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Loss.\nSupplemental Pro Forma Information (Unaudited)\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations for ADTRAN and ADVA as though the\nBusiness Combination had occurred on January 1, 2021.

Following the Business Combination with ADVA, we have recast these revenues\nsuch that ADTRAN’s former Access & Aggregation revenue is combined with a portion of the applicable ADVA solutions to create Access & Aggregation\nSolutions, ADTRAN’s former Subscriber Solutions & Experience revenue is combined with a portion of the applicable ADVA solutions to create Subscriber\nSolutions, and the revenue from Traditional & Other products is now included in the applicable Access & Aggregation Solutions or Subscriber Solutions\ncategory. Optical Networking Solutions is a new revenue category added to represent a meaningful portion of ADVA’s portfolio.\nOur Subscriber Solutions portfolio is used by service providers to terminate their access services infrastructure at the customer premises while providing an\nimmersive and interactive experience for residential, business and wholesale subscribers. This revenue category includes hardware- and software-based products\nand services. These solutions include fiber termination solutions for residential, business and wholesale subscribers, Wi-Fi access solutions for residential and\nbusiness subscribers, Ethernet switching and network edge virtualization solutions for business subscribers, and cloud software solutions covering a mix of\nsubscriber types.\nOur Access & Aggregation Solutions are solutions that are used by communications service providers to connect residential subscribers, business subscribers and\nmobile radio networks to the service providers’ metro network, primarily through fiber-based connectivity. This revenue category includes hardware- and\nsoftware-based products and services. Our solutions within this category are a mix of fiber access and aggregation platforms, precision network synchronization\nand timing solutions, and access orchestration solutions that ensure highly reliable and efficient network performance.\nOur Optical Networking Solutions are used by communications service providers, internet content providers and large-scale enterprises to securely interconnect\nmetro and regional networks over fiber.

No additional\nawards will be granted under the Company’s previous stock incentive plans, the ADTRAN, Inc. 2015 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2015 Employee\nPlan”) or the 2010 Directors Stock Plan (the “2010 Directors Plan”) subsequent to the stockholders’ approval of these new stock plans. Outstanding awards\ngranted under the 2015 Employee Plan and the 2010 Directors Plan will remain subject to the terms of such plans, and shares underlying awards granted under\nsuch plans that are cancelled or forfeited will be available for issuance under the 2020 Employee Plan or the 2020 Directors Plan, as applicable.\nUnder the 2020 Employee Plan, the Company is authorized to issue 2.8 million shares of common stock to certain employees, key service providers and advisors\nthrough incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs and restricted stock, any of which may be subject to\nperformance-based conditions. RSUs and restricted stock granted under the 2020 Employee Plan will typically vest pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule\nbeginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. Stock options granted under the 2020 Employee Plan will typically become exercisable beginning after one\nyear of continued employment, normally pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and have a ten-year\ncontractual term. Stock options, RSUs and restricted stock granted under the 2020 Employee Plan reduce the shares authorized for issuance under the 2020\nEmployee Plan by one share of common stock for each share underlying the award. Forfeitures, cancellations or expirations of awards granted under the 2015\nEmployee Plan increase the shares authorized for issuance under the 2020 Employee Plan, with forfeitures, cancellations or expirations of RSUs and restricted\nstock increasing the shares authorized for issuance by 2.5 shares of common stock for each share underlying the award. Forfeitures, cancellations or expirations\nof stock options from the 2015 Employee Plan increase the shares authorized for issuance under the 2020 Employee Plan by one share of common stock for each\nshare underlying the award.\nUnder the 2020 Directors Plan, the Company is authorized to issue 0.4 million shares of common stock through stock options, restricted stock and RSUs to non-\nemployee directors. Stock awards issued under the 2020 Directors Plan typically will become vested in full on the first anniversary of the grant date. Stock\noptions issued under the 2020 Directors Plan will have a ten-year contractual term. Stock options, restricted stock and RSUs granted under the 2020 Directors\nPlan reduce the shares authorized for issuance under the 2020 Directors Plan by one share of common stock for each share underlying the award. Forfeitures,\ncancellations and expirations of awards granted under the 2010 Directors Stock Plan increase the shares authorized for issuance under the 2020 Directors Plan by\none share of common stock for each share underlying the award.\nPrevious Stock Incentive Plans\nIn January 2015, the Board of Directors adopted the 2015 Employee Plan, which authorized 7.7 million shares of common stock for issuance to certain\nemployees and officers through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock. The 2015\nEmployee Plan was adopted by stockholder approval at our annual meeting of stockholders held in May 2015. PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock granted under\nthe 2015 Plan reduce the shares authorized for issuance under the 2015 Employee Plan by 2.5 shares of common stock for each share underlying the award.\nOptions granted under the 2015 Employee Plan typically become exercisable beginning after one year of continued employment, normally pursuant to a four-\nyear vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and have a ten-year contractual term. Expiration dates of options outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2022 under the 2015 Employee Plan range from 2025 to 2026.\nIn January 2006, the Board of Directors adopted the ADTRAN, Inc. 2006 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”), which authorized 13.0 million\nshares of common stock for issuance to officers and certain employees through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,\nRSUs and restricted stock. Options granted under the 2006 Plan typically become exercisable beginning after one year of continued employment, normally\npursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and had a ten-year contractual term. The 2006 Plan was replaced in\nMay 2015 by the 2015 Employee Plan. Expiration dates of options outstanding as of December 31, 2022 under the 2006 Plan range from 2022 to 2024.\nIn May 2010, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2010 Directors Plan, under which 0.5 million shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance.\nThis plan replaced the 2005 Directors Stock Option Plan. Under the 2010 Directors Plan, the Company may issue stock options, restricted stock and RSUs to our\nnon-employee directors. Stock awards issued under the 2010 Directors Plan become vested in full on the first anniversary of the grant date. Options issued under\nthe 2010 Directors Plan had a ten-year contractual term. All remaining options under the 2010 Directors Plan expired in 2019.\n95\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock - ADTRAN Holdings, Inc.\nThe following table is a summary of our PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 and the changes that occurred during\n2022:\nWeighted\nNumber of Average Grant\nshares (In thousands) Date Fair Value\nUnvested PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding, December 31, 2021 1,930 $ 14.11\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock granted 645 $ 20.56\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock vested (1,440) $ 12.81\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock forfeited (49) $ 14.22\nUnvested PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding, December 31, 2022 1,086 $ 17.54\nThe following table details the significant assumptions that impact the fair value estimate of the market-based PSUs:\n2022 2021 2020\nEstimated fair value per share $ 24.01 $ 26.07 $ 14.43\nExpected volatility 45.77% 53.27% 51.88%\nRisk-free interest rate 4.28% 0.85% 0.24%\nExpected dividend yield 1.76% 1.63% 2.85%\n96\nFor market-based PSUs, the number of shares of common stock earned by a recipient is subject to a market condition based on ADTRAN’s relative total\nshareholder return against all companies in the NASDAQ Telecommunications Index at the end of a three-year performance period. Depending on the relative\ntotal shareholder return over the performance period, the recipient may earn from 0% to 150% of the shares underlying the PSUs, with the shares earned\ndistributed upon the vesting. The fair value of the award is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the expected\noutcome of the impact of market conditions using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method. A portion of the granted PSUs vests and the underlying shares\nbecome deliverable upon the death or disability of the recipient or upon a change of control of ADTRAN, as defined by the 2020 Employee Plan. The recipients\nof the PSUs receive dividend credits based on the shares of common stock underlying the PSUs. The dividend credits vest and are earned in the same manner as\nthe PSUs and are paid in cash upon the issuance of common stock for the PSUs.\nDuring each of the years ended December, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company granted 0.3 million performance-based PSUs to its executive officers and certain\nemployees. The grant-date fair value of these performance-based awards was based on the closing price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. These\nawards vest over one-year, two-year and three-year periods, respectively, subject to the grantee’s continued employment, with the ability to earn shares in a range\nof 0% to 142.8% of the awarded number of PSUs based on the achievement of defined performance targets. Equity-based compensation expense with respect to\nthese awards may be adjusted over the vesting period to reflect the probability of achievement of performance targets defined in the award agreements. Pursuant\nto the Business Combination, the unearned performance-based PSUs converted to time-based RSUs which were treated as an award modification during the\nthird quarter of 2022. This resulted in incremental compensation expense totaling $17.8 million being recognized during the twelve months ended December 31,\n2022. These awards were fully vested as of December 31, 2022.\nPursuant to the Business Combination, 0.3 million shares of market-based PSU awards converted to time-based RSU's awards which were treated as an award\nmodification during the third quarter of 2022. Given that the fair value of these awards after the modification was less than the fair value of the awards\nimmediately before the modification, no incremental compensation expense was recognized. The Company continued to recognize compensation expense based\non the award's original grant date fair value. As of December 31, 2022, there was $1.4 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to these awards\nwhich will be recognized over the weighted average remaining service period of 1.57 years.\nThe fair value of RSUs and restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the grant date. RSUs and restricted stock vest ratably over four-year and\none-year periods, respectively.\nWe will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation. If circumstances change,\nand additional data becomes available over time, we may change our assumptions and methodologies, which may materially impact our fair value determination.\nAs of December 31, 2022, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the non-vested portion of market-based PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock was\napproximately $15.8 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 2.25 years and will be adjusted for actual\nforfeitures as they occur.\nAs of December 31, 2022, 3.3 million shares were available for issuance under shareholder-approved equity plans in connection with the grant and exercise of\nstock options, PSU’s, RSU’s or restricted stock.\nStock Options - ADTRAN Holdings, Inc.\nThe following table is a summary of stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the changes that occurred during 2022:\nWeighted Avg.\nWeighted Remaining\nNumber of Average Contractual Aggregate\nOptions Exercise Price Life Intrinsic(cid:0)(cid:3)Value\n(In thousands) (Per share) in Years (In thousands)\nStock options outstanding, December 31, 2021 1,721 $ 19.37 2.39 $ 6,669\nADVA stock options replaced by ADTRAN Holdings stock options(1) 2,094 $ 11.12\nStock options exercised (519) $ 15.70\nStock options forfeited (10) $ 10.28\nStock options expired (138) $ 22.73\nStock options outstanding, December 31, 2022 3,148 $ 14.37 3.42 $ 16,251\nStock options exercisable, December 31, 2022 1,711 $ 15.95 1.95 $ 7,104\n(1) Each ADVA stock option surrendered was exchanged for 0.8244 ADTRAN Holdings stock options.\n97\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $8.3 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options which will be recognized over the remaining\nweighted-average period of 2.4 years.\nPursuant to the Business Combination, which closed on July 15, 2022, ADVA stock option holders were entitled to have their ADVA stock options assumed by\nADTRAN Holdings (applying the exchange ratio in the Business Combination Agreement), thereafter representing options to acquire stock of ADTRAN\nHoldings. The maximum number of shares of ADTRAN Holdings stock potentially issuable upon such assumption was 2.3 million shares. The period in which\nsuch options could be assumed ended July 22, 2022. A total of 2.1 million shares of ADTRAN Holdings stock are subject to assumed ADVA options. The\ndetermination of the fair value of stock options assumed by ADTRAN Holdings was estimated using the Monte Carlo method and is affected by its stock price,\nas well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables that may have a significant impact on the fair value estimate. The stock option\npricing model requires the use of several assumptions that impact the fair value estimate. These variables include, but are not limited to, the volatility of the\nCompany's stock price and employee exercise behaviors.\nAll of the options were previously issued at exercise prices that approximated fair market value at the date of grant.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of stock options represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between ADTRAN’s closing stock price on the last\ntrading day of the quarter and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all\noption holders exercised their options on December 31, 2022.

Related to the Business Combination with ADVA the Company recognized $350.5\nmillion of goodwill upon the merger on July 15, 2022. Therefore, we decided to proceed directly to the quantitative test of goodwill and forego the qualitative\nassessment. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the\npresent value of estimated future cash flows. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about future sales, operating\nmargins, growth rates and discount rates, which are based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and market\nparticipants. We also estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on a peer group analysis, whereby companies in the telecommunications industry or\nwith a comparable product and market structure are used to calculate a fair enterprise value using revenue, EBITDA and debt multiples of trading value. Based\non our analysis, management concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill as of December 31, 2022. No impairment charges on goodwill were\nrecognized during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nNote 11 – Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, consisted of the following:\n2022 2021\nWeighted\nAverage Useful\nLife Accumulated Accumulated\n(In thousands) (in years) Gross Value Amortization Net Value Gross Value Amortization Net Value\nCustomer relationships 10.9 $ 55,517 $ (12,772) $ 42,745 $ 20,796 $ (9,906) $ 10,890\nBacklog 1.6 55,782 (22,725) 33,057 — — —\nDeveloped technology 8.5 320,364 (21,856) 298,508 8,200 (3,683) 4,517\nLicensed technology 9.0 5,900 (3,141) 2,759 5,900 (2,486) 3,414\nLicensing agreements 8.5 560 (298) 262 560 (225) 335\nPatents 7.3 500 (431) 69 500 (363) 137\nTrade names 3.0 29,066 (5,255) 23,811 210 (210) —\nTotal $ 467,689 $ (66,478) $ 401,211 $ 36,166 $ (16,873) $ 19,293\n105\nAs part of the purchase price allocation related to the Business Combination with ADVA, the Company recognized $403.8 million of intangible assets on July\n15, 2022. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company assessed\nimpairment triggers related to intangible assets during each financial period in 2022, 2021 and 2020. As a result, no quantitative impairment test of long-lived\nassets was performed as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, and no impairment losses of intangible assets were recorded during the years ended December\n31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nAmortization expense was $47.3 million, $4.1 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and was included\nin cost of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income.\nAs of December 31, 2022, estimated future amortization expense of intangible assets was as follows:\n(In thousands) Amount\n2023 $ 82,080\n2024 57,545\n2025 46,095\n2026 42,851\n2027 41,491\nThereafter 131,149\nTotal $ 401,211\nNote 12 - Hedging\nThe Company has certain forward rate agreements to hedge foreign currency exposure of expected future cash flows in foreign currency. The Company does not\nhold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is\nentered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. All changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are\nrecognized as other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The derivative instruments are not subject to master netting agreements and are\nnot offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We are exposed to risk from credit-related losses resulting from nonperformance by counterparties to our financial\ninstruments. We perform credit evaluations of our counterparties under forward exchange contracts and expect all counterparties to meet their obligations. We\nhave not experienced credit losses from our counterparties.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had 47 forward rate contracts outstanding.\nForeign Currency Hedging Agreement\nOn November 3, 2022, the Company entered into a Euro/U.S. dollar cross-currency swap arrangement (the “Swap”) with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Hedge\nCounterparty”). The Swap, which is governed by the provisions of an ISDA Master Agreement (including schedules thereto and transaction confirmations that\nsupplement such agreement) entered into between the Company and the Hedge Counterparty, enable the Company to convert a portion of its Euro denominated\npayment obligations under the proposed DPLTA into U.S. Dollars. Under the Swap, the Company will exchange an aggregate notional amount of $160.0 million\nU.S. dollars for Euros at a daily fixed forward rate ranging from $0.98286 to $1.03290. The aggregate amount of $160.0 million will be divided into eight\nquarterly tranches of $20.0 million. The Company, at its sole discretion, may exchange all or part of each tranche on any given day within the applicable quarter;\nprovided, however, that it must exchange the full tranche by the end of such quarter.

See Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for\nfurther information.\nThe Credit Agreement replaced the Cadence Revolving Credit Agreement and the Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Agreement. In connection with the entry into\nthe Credit Agreement, all outstanding borrowings under such credit agreements have been repaid and the agreements terminated.\nAs of December 31, 2022, ADTRAN, Inc.’s borrowings under the revolving line of credit were $60.0 million in tranches that mature during the first quarter of\n2023 and can either be repaid or borrowed again for a one month, three month or six month period. In addition, we may issue up to $25.0 million in letters of\ncredit against our $100.0 million dollar total facility. As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of $21.3 million in letters of credit with ADTRAN, Inc.\noutstanding against our eligible borrowings, leaving a net amount of $18.7 million available for future borrowings. In February 2023, the borrowings under the\nCredit Agreement were paid down by $7.5 million, leaving, $180.0 million of borrowings as of February 28, 2023. After considering our outstanding letters of\ncredit, this leaves the Company approximately $198.7 million available for future borrowings as of February 28, 2023. Any future credit extensions under the\nCredit Agreement are subject to customary conditions precedent. The proceeds of any loans are expected to be used for general corporate purposes and to pay a\nportion of the Exchange Offer consideration.\n107\nAll U.S. borrowings under the Credit Agreement (other than swingline loans, which will bear interest at the Base Rate (as defined below)) will bear interest, at\nthe Company’s option, at a rate per annum equal to (A)(i) the highest of (a) the federal funds rate (i.e., for any day, the rate per annum equal to the weighted\naverage of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork on the business day next succeeding such day) plus ½ of 1%, (b) the prime commercial lending rate of the Administrative Agent, as established from time\nto time at its principal U.S. office (which such rate is an index or base rate and will not necessarily be its lowest or best rate charged to its customers or other\nbanks), and (c) the daily Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for a one-month tenor plus 1%, plus (ii) the applicable rate, ranging from\n0.5% to 1.25% (the “Base Rate”), or (B) the sum of the Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus the applicable rate, ranging from 1.4% to\n2.15%, provided that such sum is subject to a 0.0% floor (such loans utilizing this interest rate, “SOFR Loans”). All EU borrowings under the Credit Agreement\n(other than swingline loans) will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Euro Interbank Offered Rate as administered by the European Money\nMarkets Institute (or a comparable or successor administrator approved by the Administrative Agent) plus the applicable rate, ranging from 1.5% to 2.25%,\nprovided that such sum is subject to a 0.0% floor (such loans utilizing this interest rate, “EURIBOR Loans”). The applicable rate is based on the consolidated net\nleverage ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries as determined pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. Default interest is 2.00% per annum in excess of\nthe rate otherwise applicable in the case of any overdue principal or any other overdue amount.\nIn addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the\nCredit Agreement in respect of unutilized revolving loan commitments and an additional commitment ticking fee at a rate of 0.25% on the commitment amounts\nof each lender until the earliest of (i) the date of the Senior Credit Facilities Increase, (ii) the Company’s voluntary termination of the credit facility commitment,\nand (iii) December 31, 2023.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all material covenants. The\nCredit Agreement matures in July 2027 but provides the Company with an option to request extensions subject to customary conditions.\nFinally, pursuant to a Collateral Agreement, dated as of July 18, 2022, among the Company, ADTRAN, Inc. and the Administrative Agent, ADTRAN, Inc.’s\nobligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of ADTRAN, Inc. and the Company. In addition, the Company has\nguaranteed ADTRAN, Inc.’s obligations under the Credit Agreement pursuant to a Guaranty Agreement, dated as of July 18, 2022, by ADTRAN, Inc. and the\nCompany in favor of the Administrative Agent.\nNord/LB Revolving Line of Credit\nOn August 8, 2022, ADVA entered into a $16.1 million revolving line of credit with Norddeutsche Landesbark - Girozentrale (Nord/LB) that bears interest of\nEuro Short Term Rate plus 1.4% and which matures in August 2023. During the term of the loan, ADVA is obligated to maintain an adjusted net debt to cover\nratio that is equal to or less than 2.75. As of December 31, 2022, The Company was in compliance with the adjusted net debt to cover ratio. As of December 31,\n2022, ADVA’s borrowings under the revolving line of credit were $16.1 million, with no amounts available for future borrowings. On January 31, 2023, the\nCompany increased its borrowings under the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement. A portion of the proceeds from the borrowings were used to retire the outstanding\nborrowings under the Nord/LB revolving line of credit.\nSyndicated Credit Agreement Working Capital Line of Credit\nIn September 2018, ADVA entered into a syndicated credit agreement with Bayerische Landesbank and Deutsche Bank AG Branch German Business to borrow\nup to $10.7 million as part of a working capital line of credit. The interest rate for the working capital line of credit is adjusted periodically based on a defined\nleverage ratio and is currently EURIBOR plus 1.35% as of December 31, 2022. The working capital line of credit matures in September 2023. As of December\n31, 2022, borrowings under the working capital line of credit totaled $10.7 million, with no amounts available for future borrowings. On January 31, 2023, the\nCompany increased its borrowings under the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement. A portion of the proceeds from the borrowings were used to retire the outstanding\nborrowings under the syndicated credit agreement working capital line of credit.\n108\nDZ Bank Money Market Facility\nAs of December 31, 2022, ADVA’s borrowings under the revolving line of credit totaled $9.1 million, with no amounts available for future borrowings. The\ninterest rate is currently a rate of 2.8%, which resets monthly based on renewal of the loan.\nPrior Wells Fargo Revolving Credit Agreement\nOn April 1, 2022, ADTRAN, Inc. entered into a Credit Agreement and related Revolving Line of Credit Note (together, the “Prior Wells Revolving Credit\nAgreement”) in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as lender (the “Wells Lender”). The Wells Revolving Credit Agreement provided the Company\nwith a $25.0 million secured revolving credit facility. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company made draws totaling $10.0 million under the\nPrior Wells Revolving Credit Agreement all of which had been repaid as of December 31, 2022. The Wells Fargo Credit Agreement replaced the Prior Wells\nFargo Revolving Credit Agreement and all outstanding borrowings have been repaid and the prior agreement was terminated.\nPrior Cadence Revolving Credit Agreement\nOn May 19, 2022, ADTRAN, Inc., as borrower, modified its Revolving Credit and Security Agreement and related Promissory Note (together, the “Cadence\nRevolving Credit Agreement”) with Cadence Bank, N.A., as lender (the “Cadence Lender”).

Subsequently, the Internal Revenue\nService (“IRS”) released its final GILTI regulations on July 9, 2020. The passage of the CARES Act and subsequent issuance of the GILTI final regulations\ntogether resulted in the Company’s recognition of a tax benefit in the amount of $10.8 million during 2020, $7.9 million of which related to the utilization of\ndeferred tax assets which had previously been offset with a valuation allowance and $2.9 million primarily related to the tax rate differential on carrying back\nlosses from 2018 and 2019 tax years to prior years in which the U.S. Corporate tax rate was 35% versus the current 21% federal tax rate.\nOn February 12, 2021, the Alabama Business Tax Competitiveness Act (the \"Act\") was signed into law. As a result of the Act, we recognized an expense of $1.6\nmillion in the three months ended March 31, 2021 related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets, which was offset by changes in our valuation allowance\npreviously recorded against our domestic deferred tax assets.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2021, Management decided to pursue a claim for refund related to the revocation of our IRC Section 59(e)\nelection that was made on our originally filed 2018 U.S. federal tax return. The Company filed a related carryback claim of net operating losses generated in\n2018 to prior years as allowed under the CARES Act that was passed in 2020. An IRS Section 59(e) election is generally non-revocable except in cases for\nwhich IRS Commissioner’s approval is given. Approval is granted only in rare and unusual circumstances. We filed a private letter ruling (“PLR”) request to\nrevoke our election. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, a response to our PLR was published denying our request to revoke the previously\nmade 59(e). As a result of these filings, and Management’s position to pursue them through appeals, we have established a receivable in the amount of $15.2\nmillion and a deferred tax asset related to additional research and development credit carryforward in the amount of $1.8 million that would be available if our\nrevocation request is successful, offset with an uncertain tax liability of $17.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, non-current deferred taxes reflected deferred taxes on net unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments and\ndeferred taxes on unrealized losses in our pension plan. The net change in non-current deferred taxes associated with these items, which resulted in a deferred tax\nexpense of $2.0 million and $1.6 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, was recorded as an adjustment to other comprehensive (loss) income, presented in the\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income.\nThe Company continually reviews the adequacy of its valuation allowance and recognizes the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates\nthat it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recognized in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Our assessment of the realizability of\nour deferred tax assets includes the evaluation of evidence, some of which requires significant judgment, including historical operating results, the evaluation of\na three-year cumulative income position, future taxable income projections and tax planning strategies. Should management’s conclusion change in the future\nand additional valuation allowance or a partial or full release of the valuation allowance become necessary, it could have a material effect on our consolidated\nfinancial statements. During the fourth quarter of 2022, after considering all quantitative and qualitative evidence, including our cumulative income position,\nhistorical operating performance and future income projections, we have determined that the positive evidence overcame the negative evidence and have\nconcluded that it is more likely than not that a substantial portion of our U.S. federal and certain other state deferred tax assets were realizable. As a result we\nhave released the majority of our valuation allowance against those assets.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had gross deferred tax assets totaling $11.4 million offset by a valuation allowance totaling $5.2 million and\ngross deferred tax assets totaling $59.6 million offset by a valuation allowance of $50.6 million, respectively. Of the current valuation allowance, $3.2 million\nwas established against our domestic deferred tax assets and the remaining $2.0 million is related to foreign net operating loss and research and development\ncredit carryforwards where we lacked sufficient activity to realize those deferred tax assets. The change in our valuation allowance for the year ending December\n31, 2022 was a decrease of $45.4 million. The change in the valuation allowance was primarily related to the previously mentioned release of the valuation\nallowance in the fourth quarter of 2022. The large increase during the year in our international deferred tax liabilities was primarily related to purchase price\naccounting, partially offset with acquired deferred tax assets as a result of the ADVA acquisition, that was completed in the third quarter of 2022.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3)\nDecember 31, 2022\n(In thousands) Deferred Tax Assets (Liabilities) Valuation Allowance Deferred Tax Assets (Liabilities), net\nDomestic $ 61,726 $ (3,177) $ 58,549\nInternational (50,315) (2,024) (52,339)\nTotal $ 11,411 $ (5,201) $ 6,210\n112\n(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3)\nDecember 31, 2021\n(In thousands) Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance Deferred Tax Assets, net\nDomestic $ 48,265 $ (48,265) $ —\nInternational 11,378 (2,299) 9,079\nTotal $ 59,643 $ (50,564) $ 9,079\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the deferred tax assets for foreign and domestic loss carry-forwards, research and development tax credits, unamortized\nresearch and development costs and state credit carry-forwards totaled $104.5 million and $39.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, $21.8 million\nof these deferred tax assets will expire at various times between 2023 and 2038. The remaining deferred tax assets will either amortize through 2038 or\ncarryforward indefinitely.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, our cash and cash equivalents were $108.6 million and $56.6 million and short-term investments were $0.3\nmillion and $0.4 million, which provided available short-term liquidity of $108.9 million and 57.0 million. Of these amounts, our foreign subsidiaries held cash\nof $86.3 million and $47.7 million, respectively, representing approximately 79% and 84% of available short-term liquidity, which is used to fund ongoing\nliquidity needs of these subsidiaries. As part of our restructuring plan, the Company’s assertion on being indefinitely reinvested changed in a particular\njurisdiction in a previous year. The Company has a withholding tax liability of $0.4 million and $0.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company maintains its assertion in all other jurisdictions that it is indefinitely reinvesting its funds held in foreign jurisdictions outside of the U.S., except to\nthe extent any of these funds can be repatriated without withholding tax. However, if all of these funds were repatriated to the U.S., or used for U.S. operations,\ncertain amounts could be subject to tax. Due to the timing and circumstances of repatriation of such earnings, if any, it is not practicable to determine the amount\nof funds subject to unrecognized deferred tax liability.\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, no income tax benefit or expense was recorded for stock options exercised as an adjustment to equity.\nThe change in the unrecognized income tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2022 2021 2020\nBalance at beginning of period $ 17,836 $ 1,078 $ 1,487\nIncreases for tax position related to:\nPrior years — 17,025 4\nCurrent year 123 136 165\nDecreases for tax positions related to:\nPrior years (13) (27) —\nExpiration of applicable statute of limitations (61) (376) (578)\nBalance at end of period $ 17,885 $ 17,836 $ 1,078\nAs of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our total liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $17.9 million, $17.8 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of\nwhich $17.9 million, $17.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively, would reduce our effective tax rate if we were successful in upholding all of the uncertain\npositions and recognized the amounts recorded. We classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax\nexpense. As of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the balances of accrued interest and penalties were $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively.\nWe do not anticipate a single tax position generating a significant increase or decrease in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of this\nreporting date, unless a resolution is reached regarding the appeal of our PLR denial noted above. We file income tax returns in the U.S. for federal and various\nstate jurisdictions and several foreign jurisdictions. We are not currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. Generally, we are not subject to changes in\nincome taxes by any taxing jurisdiction for the years prior to 2018.\nNote 16 – Employee Benefit Plans\nPension Benefit Plan\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries.\nIn connection with the Business Combination, we acquired $29.6 million of additional obligations and $22.3 million of assets related to postemployment benefit\nplans for certain groups of employees at our new operations outside of the U.S. Plans vary depending on the legal, economic, and tax environments of the\nrespective country. For defined benefit plans, accruals for pensions and similar commitments have been included in the results for this year. The new defined\nbenefit plans are for employees in Switzerland, Italy, Israel and India:\n113\n• In Switzerland, there are two defined benefit pension plans. Both plans provide benefits in the event of retirement, death or disability. The plan's\nbenefits are based on age, years of service, salary and on a participants old age account. The plans are financed by contributions paid by the\nparticipants and by the Company.\n• In Italy, the post-employment benefit plan is required due to statutory provisions. The plan is financed directly by the Company on a pay as you go\nbasis. Employees receive their pension payments as a function of salary, inflation and a notional account.\n• In Israel, there is a defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits in the event of a participant being dismissed involuntarily, retirement or\ndeath. The plan's benefits are based on the higher of the severance benefit required by law or the cash surrender value of the severance benefit\ncomponent of any qualifying insurance policy or long-term employee benefit fund that is registered in the participants name. The plan is financed\nby contributions paid by the Company.\n• In India, the post-employment benefit plan is required due to statutory provisions.

The expected return on our plans assets is utilized in determining the benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost is derived\nfrom periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using\nstandard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to\nrecent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return. The discount rate has been derived from the\nreturns of high-quality, corporate bonds denominated in Euro currency with durations close to the duration of our pension obligations.\nThe weighted-average assumptions that were used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as\nfollows:\n2022 2021 2020\nDiscount rate 3.24% 1.16% 1.00%\nRate of compensation increase 2.17% 2.00% 2.00%\nExpected long-term rates of return 4.65% 5.90% 5.90%\nThe weighted-average assumptions that were used to determine the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n2022 2021 2020\nDiscount rate 3.10% 1.16% 0.69%\nRate of compensation increase 2.17% 2.00% 2.00%\nActuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. To the extent unamortized gains and losses exceed 10% of the higher\nof the market-related value of assets or the projected benefit obligation, the excess is amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost over the remaining\nservice period of active participants.\n115\nThe Company anticipates making approximately $1.8 million in contributions to the pension plans in 2023\nThe following pension benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid to participants:\n(In thousands)\n2023 $ 2,377\n2024 2,303\n2025 3,331\n2026 3,092\n2027 3,710\n2028 - 2032 18,287\nTotal $ 33,100\nU.S. GAAP establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy based upon observable and unobservable inputs for fair value measurement of financial instruments:\n• Level 1 – Observable outputs; values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market;\n• Level 2 – Significant inputs that are observable; values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either\ndirectly or indirectly;\n• Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs; values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and\nsignificant to the overall fair value measurement.

The Savings Plan is intended to qualify under\nSections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and is intended to be a “safe harbor” 401(k) plan under Code\nSection 401(k)(12). The Savings Plan allows employees to save for retirement by contributing part of their compensation to the plan on a tax-deferred basis. The\nSavings Plan also requires us to contribute a “safe harbor” amount each year. We match up to 4% of employee contributions (100% of an employee’s first 3% of\ncontributions and 50% of their next 2% of contributions), beginning on the employee’s one-year anniversary date. In calculating our matching contribution,\ncompensation up to the statutory maximum under the Code is used ($305,000 for 2022). All matching contributions under the Savings Plan vest immediately.\nEmployer contribution expense and plan administration costs for the Savings Plan amounted to approximately $4.1 million, $3.9 million and $4.0 million in\n2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDeferred Compensation Plans\nWe maintain four deferred compensation programs for certain executive management employees and our Board of Directors.\nThe ADTRAN, Inc. Deferred Compensation Program for Employees is offered as a supplement to our tax-qualified 401(k) plan and is available to certain\nexecutive management employees who have been designated by our Board of Directors. This deferred compensation plan allows participants to defer all or a\nportion of certain specified bonuses and up to 25% of remaining cash compensation and permits us to make matching contributions on a discretionary basis\nwithout the limitations that apply to the 401(k) plan. To date, we have not made any matching contributions under this plan. We also maintain the ADTRAN, Inc.\nEquity Deferral Program for Employees. Under this plan, participants may elect to defer all or a portion of their vested PSUs and RSUs to the plan. Such\ndeferrals shall continue to be held and deemed to be invested in shares of ADTRAN stock unless and until the amounts are distributed or such deferrals are\nmoved to another deemed investment pursuant to an election made by the participant.\nFor our Board of Directors, we maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. Deferred Compensation Program for Directors. This program allows our Board of Directors to defer\nall or a portion of monetary remuneration paid to the Director, including, but not limited to, meeting fees and annual retainers. We also maintain the ADTRAN,\nInc. Equity Deferral Program for Directors. Under this plan, participants may elect to defer all or a portion of their vested restricted stock awards. Such deferrals\nshall continue to be held and deemed to be invested in shares of ADTRAN stock unless and until the amounts are distributed or such deferrals are moved to\nanother deemed investment pursuant to an election made by the director.\nWe have set aside the plan assets for all plans in a rabbi trust (the “Trust”) and all contributions are credited to bookkeeping accounts for the participants. The\nTrust assets are subject to the claims of our creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency. The assets of the Trust are deemed to be invested in pre-approved\nmutual funds as directed by each participant and the participant’s bookkeeping account is credited with the earnings and losses attributable to those investments.\nBenefits are scheduled to be distributed six months after termination of employment in a single lump sum payment or annual installments paid over a three or\nten-year term based on the participant’s election. Distributions will be made on a pro-rata basis from each of the hypothetical investments of the participant’s\naccount in cash. Any whole shares of ADTRAN, Inc. common stock that are distributed will be distributed in-kind.\nAssets of the Trust are deemed invested in mutual funds that cover an investment spectrum ranging from equities to money market instruments.

These liabilities are included in\naccrued expenses and other liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nA summary of warranty expense and write-off activity for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2022 2021 2020\nBalance at beginning of period $ 5,403 $ 7,146 $ 8,394\nPlus: ADVA acquisition 3,756 — —\nPlus: Amounts charged to cost and expenses 3,104 855 1,538\nPlus: Foreign currency translation adjustments 334\nLess: Deductions (5,401) (2,598) (2,786)\nBalance at end of period $ 7,196 $ 5,403 $ 7,146\nNote 20 – Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Matters\nFrom time to time the Company is subject to or otherwise involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and legal proceedings that arise out of or are\nincidental to the conduct of our business (collectively, “Legal Matters”), including those relating to employment matters, patent rights, regulatory compliance\nmatters, stockholder claims, and contractual and other commercial disputes. Such Legal Matters, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of\nsignificant financial and managerial resources. Additionally, an unfavorable outcome in a legal matter, including in a patent dispute, could require the Company\nto pay damages, entitle claimants to other relief, such as royalties, or could prevent the Company from selling some of its products in certain jurisdictions. At this\ntime, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with such legal matters.\nPerformance Bonds\nCertain contracts, customers and jurisdictions in which the Company do business require us to provide various guarantees of performance such as bid bonds,\nperformance bonds and customs bonds. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had commitments related to these bonds totaling $22.0\nmillion and $22.9 million, respectively, which expire at various dates through April\n123\n2031. In general the Company would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default under each contract, the probability of which the\nCompany believes is remote.\nPurchase Commitments\nThe Company purchases components from a variety of suppliers and use contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. Our\ninventory purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing\ncapacity. Certain of our inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure supply and pricing for\ncertain product components for multi-year periods. As of December 31, 2022, purchase commitments totaled $552.4 million.\nNote 21 – Current Expected Credit Losses\nUnder ASC 326 – Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, the Company estimates credit losses for the contractual life of assets that are measured at amortized\ncost and are within the scope of this guidance, which includes accounts receivable, net investment in sales-type leases, contract assets under the revenue\nrecognition model and outstanding notes receivable. Where appropriate, the Company pools assets if similar risk characteristics exist. Additionally, the Company\nanalyzes its available-for-sale debt securities for impairment and records a credit loss allowance as needed.\nAssets Measured at Amortized Cost\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company records accounts receivable in the normal course of business as products are shipped or services are performed and invoiced, but payment has not\nyet been remitted by the customer. Accounts receivable balances are considered past due when payment has not been received by the date indicated on the\nrelevant invoice or based on agreed upon terms between the customer and the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s net outstanding accounts receivable balance was $279.4 million and $158.7 million, respectively. The\nCompany assessed the need for an allowance for credit losses related to its outstanding accounts receivable using the historical loss-rate method as well as\nassessing asset-specific risks. The Company’s historical losses related to accounts receivable have been immaterial as evidenced by its historical allowance and\nwrite-offs due to collectability. The assessment of asset-specific risks included the evaluation of relevant available information, from internal and external\nsources, relating to current conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay, such as the customer’s current financial condition, credit rating by geographic\nlocation, as provided by a third party and/or by customer, if needed, and the overall macro-economic conditions in which the customer operates. The Company\npooled assets by geographic location to determine if an allowance should be applied to its accounts receivable balance, assessing the specific country risk rating\nand overall economics of that particular country. If elevated risk existed, or customer specific risk indicated the accounts receivable balance was at risk, the\nCompany further analyzed the need for an allowance related to specific accounts receivable balances. Additionally, the Company determined that significant\nchanges to customer country risk rating from period-to-period and from the end of the prior year to the end of the current quarter would require further review\nand analysis by the Company.\nCredit losses totaling less than $0.1 million were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022, related to accounts receivable. No credit losses were recorded\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 related to accounts receivable. The Company's allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable was\nless than $0.1 as of December 31, 2022. The Company had no allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021.\nContract Assets\nThe Company records contract assets when it has recognized revenue but has not yet billed the customer. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s\noutstanding contract asset balance was $1.9 million and $0.5 million, respectively, which is included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company assessed the need for an allowance for credit losses related to its outstanding contract assets using the historical loss-rate method as well as asset-\nspecific risks. The Company’s historical losses related to contract assets receivable have been immaterial as evidenced by historical write-offs due to\ncollectability. Asset-specific risk included the evaluation of relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to current conditions that\nmay affect a customer’s ability to pay once invoiced, such as the customer’s financial condition, credit rating by geographic location as provided by a third party\nand/or by customer, if needed, and the overall macro-economic conditions in which the customer operates. The Company pooled assets by geographic location to\ndetermine if an allowance should be applied to its contract asset balance, assessing the specific country risk rating and the overall economics of that particular\ncountry. If elevated risk existed, or customer specific risk indicated the contract balance was at risk, the Company further analyzed the need for an allowance\nrelated to specific customer balances. Additionally, the Company determined that significant changes to customer country risk rating from period-to-period and\nfrom the end of the prior year to the end of the current quarter would be subject to further review and analysis by the Company.\nNo allowance for credit losses was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 related to contract assets.\n124\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022, 2021 or January 1, 2021.\n125\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021 the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities totaled $9.3 million and $30.1 million, respectively. These securities were\nanalyzed at the individual investment level, by Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures (“CUSIP”), to limit credit losses, if applicable, to\nreflect only the amount by which the fair value of the security was less than its amortized cost. The Company noted that, as of December 31, 2022 and, 2021,\nthere was no intent to sell any of its available-for-sale debt securities before maturity, and, therefore, the Company assessed the need for an allowance for each of\nits available-for-sale debt securities in which the fair value was less than its amortized cost as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Accrued interest receivable on\navailable-for-sale debt securities, which is included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, which totaled\nless than $0.1 million and was excluded from the estimate of credit losses for both periods based on the Company’s accounting policy election. Income\ngenerated from available-for-sale debt securities was recorded as interest and dividend income in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income.\nThe Company had 99 positions in available-for-sale debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2022. See Note 6 for additional\ninformation.\nFor those available-for-sale debt securities whose fair value was less than its amortized cost basis, the Company analyzed additional criteria such as adverse\nconditions specifically related to the security, an industry or geographic area, failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal\npayments, if applicable, and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency to determine if a credit loss existed. The Company used information\nprovided by its investment manager to determine if any scheduled interest or principal payments had not been received and used a third party to determine if any\nchanges to credit ratings had occurred. Principal and interest payments are considered past due when payment has not been received based on scheduled terms of\neach debt security. The Company ceases to accrue interest on debt securities on a case by case basis. As of December 31, 2022, the Company noted that all\nprincipal and interest payments had been received as scheduled and that there had been no changes in credit ratings year-over-year or period-over-period that\nwarranted further review.\nNo allowance for credit losses was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 related to the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities.\nNote 22 – (Loss) Earnings per Share\nThe calculations of basic and diluted (loss) earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\n(In thousands, except for per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020\nNumerator\nNet (Loss) Income attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. $ (2,037) $ (8,635) $ 2,378\nDenominator\nWeighted average number of shares – basic 62,346 48,582 47,996\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock — — 292\nWeighted average number of shares – diluted 62,346 48,582 48,288\n(Loss) earnings per share attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. – basic $ (0.03) $ (0.18) $ 0.05\n(Loss) earnings per share attributable to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. – diluted $ (0.03) $ (0.18) $ 0.05\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, less than 0.1 million, 0.1 million and 0.1 million shares of unvested or unearned, as applicable,\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted (loss) earnings per share due to their anti-dilutive effect.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, 0.2 million, 0.3 million and 3.6 million stock options, respectively, were outstanding but were not\nincluded in the computation of diluted (loss) earnings per share due to their exercise prices being greater than the average market price of the common shares\nduring the quarter, making them anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.\n126\nNote 23 – Restructuring\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company initiated a multi-year integration program designed to optimize the assets, business processes, and information\ntechnology systems of the Company in relation to the Business Combination with ADVA. The integration program is expected to maximize cost synergies by\nrealizing operation scale, combining sales channels, streamlining corporate and general and administrative functions and combining sourcing and production\ncosts.\nDuring the second half of 2019, the Company initiated a restructuring plan to realign its expense structure with the reduction in revenue experienced in recent\nyears and overall Company objectives. As part of this restructuring plan, the Company announced plans to reduce its overall operating expenses, both in the U.S.\nand internationally. This plan was completed and all amounts paid in 2021.\nIn February 2019, the Company announced the restructuring of a certain portion of its workforce predominantly in Germany, which included the closure of the\nCompany’s office location in Munich, Germany accompanied by relocation or severance benefits for the affected employees. Voluntary early retirement was\noffered to certain other employees and was announced in March 2019 and again in August 2020. This plan was completed in 2021 and all amounts paid in 2022.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending restructuring liability, which is included in accrued wages and benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, is as follows:\n(In thousands) 2022 2021\nBalance at beginning of period $ 1,514 $ 4,186\nPlus: Amounts charged to cost and expense 1,629 411\nLess: Amounts paid (2,984) (3,083)\nBalance at end of period $ 159 $ 1,514\nRestructuring expenses included in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income are for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\n(In thousands) 2022 2021 2020\nNetwork solutions - cost of revenue $ 8 $ 13 $ 220\nServices & support - cost of revenue — 3 235\nCost of revenue $ 8 $ 16 $ 455\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 117 221 1,832\nResearch and development expenses 1,504 174 3,942\nTotal restructuring expenses $ 1,629 $ 411 $ 6,229\nThe following table represents the components of restructuring expense by geographic area for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\n(In thousands) 2022 2021 2020\nUnited States $ 2 $ 289 $ 2,234\nInternational 1,627 122 3,995\nTotal restructuring expenses $ 1,629 $ 411 $ 6,229\n127\nNote 24 – Subsequent Events\nDividend approval\nOn February 20, 2023, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common share to be paid to the\nCompany’s stockholders of record at the close of business on March 7, 2023. The payment date will be March 21, 2023 in the aggregate amount of\napproximately $7.0 million.\nEffectiveness of the Domination and Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement\nThe DPLTA between the Company, as the controlling company, and ADVA Optical Networking SE, as the controlled company as executed on December 1,\n2022, became effective on January 16, 2023, as a result of its registration with the commercial register (Handelsregister) of the local court (Amtsgericht) at the\nregistered seat of ADVA (Jena).\nUnder the DPLTA, subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law and the specific terms of the DPLTA, (i) the Company is\nentitled to issue binding instructions to the management board of ADVA, (ii) ADVA will transfer its annual profit to the Company, subject to, among other\nthings, the creation or dissolution of certain reserves, and (iii) the Company will generally absorb the annual net loss incurred by ADVA. The obligation of\nADVA to transfer its annual profit to the Company applies for the first time to the profit generated in the ADVA fiscal year 2023. The obligation of the Company\nto absorb ADVA’s annual net loss applies for the first time to the loss generated in the ADVA fiscal year 2023.\nExpansion of Wells Fargo Line of Credit & Payoff of ADVA Loans.\nUpon the DPLTA becoming effective on January 16, 2023, the available total borrowings under the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement increased from $100 million\nto $400 million. On January 31, 2023, the Company increased its borrowings under the Credit Agreement from $60.0 million to $187.5 million. In February\n2023, the borrowings under the Credit Agreement were paid down by $7.5 million, leaving $180.0 million of borrowings as of February 28, 2023. After\nconsidering our outstanding letters of credit, this leaves the Company approximately $198.7 million available for future borrowings as of February 28, 2023. The\nCompany used approximately $51.4 million of the proceeds from the borrowings under the Credit Agreement to retire the outstanding borrowings under ADVA's\nsyndicated credit agreement note payable, syndicated credit agreement working capital line of credit and the Nord/LB revolving line of credit. ADVA's $9.1\nmillion of borrowings under their revolving line of credit with DZ bank remains outstanding.\nIntegration Bonus Plan\nOn March 1, 2023, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company established an “Integration Bonus Plan” consisting of a combination\nof performance-based performance stock units (\"PSUs\") and cash bonus award amounts (together with the PSUs, the “Integration Awards”). Under the\nIntegration Bonus Plan, certain key employees of the Company, including the Company’s named executive officers as disclosed in the most recent proxy\nstatement filed by the Company with the SEC (the “Participants”), are eligible to earn the Integration Awards over a performance period beginning upon the date\nof the grant and ending on December 31, 2024 based on the achievement of cost savings targets related to the Business Combination.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports\nthat we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,\nincluding our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because of the\ninherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide\nabsolute assurance that all control issues, if any, with a company have been prevented or detected on a timely basis. Even disclosure controls and procedures\ndetermined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance that their objectives are achieved.\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out by management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial\nOfficer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based\non that evaluation, which excluded the impact of the acquisition of a controlling equity stake in ADVA discussed below, our Chief Executive Officer and our\nChief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement of ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule\n13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. ADTRAN’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles. ADTRAN’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n• pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of\nADTRAN;\n• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of ADTRAN are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\nmanagement and directors of ADTRAN; and\n• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of ADTRAN’s assets that could\nhave a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of ADTRAN’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment,\nmanagement used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\") in Internal Control-Integrated\nFramework (2013).\nAs permitted by SEC guidance, we currently exclude ADVA in our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting and related disclosure controls and\nprocedures for the first year after the Business Combination. See “Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting” for additional discussion.\nBased on our assessment and those criteria, management has concluded that ADTRAN maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Item 8.\n129\nAuditor Attestation Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe attestation report of our registered public accounting firm on our internal control over financial reporting is included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements\nand Supplementary Data,” of this report.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nOn July 15, 2022, the Company acquired 33,957,538 bearer shares of ADVA, or 65.43% of ADVA’s outstanding bearer shares as of such date, as further\ndescribed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2022, ADVA’s assets represented approximately 41.4%\nof our consolidated assets. For the year ended December 31, 2022, ADVA’s revenues represented approximately 35.7% of our consolidated revenues and loss\nbefore income taxes represented approximately 43.8% of our consolidated loss before income taxes. As permitted by SEC guidance, we currently exclude ADVA\nin our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting and related disclosure controls and procedures for the first year after the Business Combination.\nHowever, we are in the process of extending our oversight and monitoring processes that support our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure\ncontrols and procedures to include ADVA’s operations. There were no other changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred\nduring the most recent fiscal quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\n130\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nOn March 1, 2023, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company established an “Integration Bonus Plan” consisting of a combination\nof performance-based performance stock units (“PSUs”) and cash bonus award amounts (together with the PSUs, the “Integration Awards”). Under the\nIntegration Bonus Plan, certain key employees of the Company, including the Company’s named executive officers as disclosed in the most recent proxy\nstatement filed by the Company with the SEC (the “Participants”), are eligible to earn the Integration Awards over a performance period beginning upon the date\nof the grant, March 1, 2023, and ending on December 31, 2024 based on the achievement of cost savings targets related to the Business Combination during such\nperiod. The Compensation Committee chose the performance measure of “Company Synergy Achievement” in order to incentivize the Participants to drive cost\nsavings and expected synergies following the closing of the Business Combination, and it approved a target level of synergies against which the Company’s non-\nGAAP expenses will be measured. For purposes of measuring performance, the Company’s GAAP expenses will be adjusted for restructuring expenses;\nacquisition-related expenses, amortizations and adjustments; stock-based compensation expense; amortization of actuarial pension losses and the impact of\nequity market changes on deferred compensation expenses; non-operating income; and any other exclusions adopted by the Company.\nIf the Company Synergy Achievement over the performance period reaches the performance levels noted below, the Participants will be entitled to a\ncorresponding number of shares of the Company’s common stock under the PSUs:\n• If Company Synergy Achievement is less than the threshold amount, the Participants will not earn any shares under the performance-based PSUs.\n• If Company Synergy Achievement is greater than or equal to the threshold amount but less than the target amount, the Participants will earn shares\nunder the performance-based PSUs equal to 33% of their base salary (as of the date of grant).\n• If the Company Synergy Achievement is greater than or equal to the target amount, the Participants will earn shares under the performance-based\nPSUs equal to 66% of their base salary.\nIf the threshold level of Company Synergy Achievement is reached, the Participants are also eligible to receive a cash award up to 66% of their base salary (as of\nthe date of grant) based on the percentage of individual objectives related to cost savings achieved by each Participant, as determined by the Compensation\nCommittee. If the target level of Company Synergy Achievement is achieved and all of the individual objectives are achieved, the Participants will earn a\nmaximum amount under the Integration Bonus Plan equal to 132% of their base salary, as reflected below:\nValue of Threshold Value of Target PSU Max Total Value of\nBase Salary (as of PSU Award (33% of Award (66% of Base Target Cash Award Integration Bonus\nNamed Executive Officer March 1, 2023) Base Salary) Salary) (66% of Base Salary) Award\nThomas R.

Company Synergy Achievement is calculated,\nusing the Company’s audited financial results, as the Company’s non-GAAP expenses, adjusted for restructuring expenses; acquisition-related\nexpenses, amortizations, and adjustments; stock-based compensation expense; amortization of actuarial pension losses and the impact of equity\nmarket changes on deferred compensation expenses; non-operating income; and any other non-GAAP exclusions adopted by the Company.\nCompany Synergy Achievement will be compared to the Company’s projected cost savings due to the Business Combination over the\nPerformance Period (the “Synergy Budget Target”). If necessary, the Synergy Budget Target will be updated by the Company’s Finance\ndepartment during the Performance Period in the case of organizational changes, M&A activity, and other modifications to the organization and\nbusiness. The final performance of the Company Synergy Achievement compared to the Synergy Budget Target will be audited and approved by\nthe Company’s Internal Audit department.\nCalculation of Earned PSUs\nThe Participant is eligible to earn a percentage of Base Salary (as defined below) in PSUs based on the chart below:\nCompany Synergy Achievement Earned PSUs as % of Base Salary\n[___] 0%\n[___] 33%\n[___] 66%\n“Base Salary” is determined as of the Date of Grant but may be adjusted for certain individuals with changing responsibilities due to the Business\nCombination.\nNote that $[__] is considered the “threshold” level of Company Synergy Achievement, and such level must be achieved for any PSUs to be issued,\nand $[___] is considered the “target” level of Company Synergy Achievement. The number of PSUs issued will be based on the Fair Market\nValue of the Common Stock, as defined in Section 2.18(a) of the Plan, on the date that the Compensation Committee certifies the level of\nCompany Synergy Achievement.\nCalculation of Earned Cash Award\nIf the threshold level of Company Synergy Achievement is reached, the Participant is also eligible to earn between 0% and 66% of base salary (as\nof the Date of Grant) based on the percentage of individual objectives related to cost savings achieved by the Participant, as determined by the\nCompensation Committee. For the sale of clarity, if the target level of Company Synergy Achievement is achieved and all the individual\nobjectives are achieved, the Participant will earn the maximum Integration Award equal to 132% of the Participant’s Base Salary.\nExample Calculations\nCompany Synergy Earned PSUs as % of Base Individual Objectives Earned Cash Award as % of\nAchievement Salary Achievement Base Salary\n$[___]M 0% 100% 0%\n$[___]M 33% 50% 33%\n$[___]M 33% 100% 66%\n$[___]M 66% 100% 66%\nExhibit 10.1(t)\nADTRAN HOLDINGS, INC.\n2020 EMPLOYEE STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN\nOriginally effective May 13, 2020\nAmended and Restated Effective July 8, 2022\nADTRAN HOLDINGS, INC.\nAMENDED AND RESTATED\n2020 EMPLOYEE STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN\nARTICLE I\nPLAN INFORMATION\n1.1 Background. ADTRAN, Inc. (the “ADTRAN, Inc.”), predecessor to ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”),\ninitially adopted this equity incentive plan for the benefit of its employees to replace certain Prior Plans; provided, however, that\nnotwithstanding that replacement, the Prior Plans shall remain in effect with respect to outstanding awards as long as the awards\nthereunder are outstanding. This plan was assumed by the Company, as the successor to ADTRAN, Inc., at the closing of the Merger\nfor the benefit of the Company’s employees and was amended and restated effective July 8, 2022. This plan shall be known as the\nADTRAN Holdings, Inc. 2020 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the “Plan”).\n1.2 General Purpose. The purpose of the Plan is to further the growth and development of the Company by offering\nemployees and key service providers and advisors of the Company and its Subsidiaries the opportunity to own a proprietary interest in\nthe Company. The Company intends that the Plan will provide such individuals with an added incentive to continue in the employ\nand/or service, promote the growth, efficiency and profitability, and help to attract outstanding individuals to the service, of the\nCompany and its Subsidiaries.\n1.3 Types of Awards Available Under the Plan. The Plan permits Awards of Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights\n(“SARs”), Restricted Stock, and Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”). The types of Stock Options permitted under the Plan are incentive\nstock options (“ISOs”) and nonqualified stock options (“NQSOs”).\n1.4 Intended Tax Effects of Awards. The Company intends that ISOs granted under the Plan qualify as incentive stock\noptions under Code Section 422. Restricted Stock Awards are subject to taxation under Code Section 83. Nonqualified Stock Options\nand Stock Appreciation Rights are subject to taxation when the Nonqualified Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right is exercised.\nRestricted Stock Units are subject to taxation when the underlying shares of Common Stock are issued to the Participant.\n1.5 Effective Date of the Plan. The Plan became effective on the date of its approval by the stockholders of ADTRAN,\nInc. on May 13, 2020 (the “Effective Date”) in accordance with applicable law (including, without limitation, approvals required\nunder Rule 16b-3 and Code Section 422).\n1.6 Term. Unless earlier terminated by the Board pursuant to the provisions of Article IX hereof, the Plan shall remain\nin effect until the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Effective Date; provided, however, that notwithstanding its termination, the Plan shall\nremain in effect with respect to outstanding Awards as long as any Awards are outstanding.\n1.7 Operation, Administration and Definitions. The operation and administration of the Plan are subject to the\nprovisions of this Plan document. Capitalized terms used in the Plan are defined in Article II below or may be defined within the\nPlan.\n1.8 Legal Compliance. The Plan is intended to comply with (a) the requirements for ISOs under Code Section 422, (b)\nCode Section 409A, to the extent any Awards are treated as nonqualified deferred compensation under Code Section 409A, and (c) the\nexemption of Awards under the provisions of Rule 16b-3.\nARTICLE II\nPLAN DEFINITIONS\nThe following words and phrases as used in this Plan shall have the meanings set forth in this Article unless a different meaning\nis clearly required by the context:\n2.1 “Affiliate” means an entity that, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with\nthe Company, within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.\n2.2 “Award” means any award or benefit granted to Participant under the Plan, including, without limitation, the grant\nof Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Units.\n2.3 “Award Agreement” means the written (or electronic) agreement issued by the Company to the Participant that sets\nforth the terms and provisions of the Award granted under the Plan.\n2.4 “Base Value” means the per share base price of a Stock Appreciation Right.\n2.5 “Beneficiary” means, with respect to a Participant, the person(s) to whom the Participant’s Award shall be\ntransferred upon the Participant’s death, determined as set forth in Section 10.1.\n2.6 “Board” or “Board of Directors” means the Board of Directors of the Company.\n2.7 “Cause” means, as defined in such Participant’s employment, severance or similar agreement (if any) with the\nCompany or an Affiliate if such an agreement exists as of the Participant’s Separation from Service and contains a definition of cause\n(or a like term) or, if no such agreement exists or such agreement does not contain a definition of cause (or a like term), then Cause\nmeans:\n(a) willful and continued failure to substantially perform his duties with the Company or any Affiliate within ten (10)\nbusiness days after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Participant which identifies the\nmanner in which the Company or such Affiliate believes that the Participant has not substantially performed his\nduties;\n(b) unlawful or willful misconduct which is economically injurious to the Company or to any Affiliate;\n(c) commission of, or a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony charge (other than a traffic violation);\n(d) habitual drug or alcohol abuse that impairs the Participant’s ability to perform the essential duties of his position;\n(e) an act of embezzlement or fraud;\n(f) competition with the business of the Company or an Affiliate, either directly or indirectly; or\n(g) a breach of any provision of any employment, confidentiality, intellectual property or non-competition agreement\nwith the Company or an Affiliate, and to the extent curable, such breach is not cured by the Participant within ten\n(10) business days after a written notice is delivered to the Participant.\n2.8 “Change of Control” means the occurrence of any of the following events on or after the Effective Date of this\nPlan:\n(a) Change in Ownership. A change in the ownership of the Company occurs on the date that any one person, or more\nthan one person acting as a group, acquires ownership of stock of the Company that, together with stock held by\nsuch person or group, constitutes more than fifty percent (50%) of the total fair market value or total voting power\nof the stock of the Company. However, if any one person or more than one person acting as a group, is considered\nto own more than fifty percent (50%) of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the\nCompany, the acquisition of additional stock by the same person or persons is not considered to cause a change in\nthe ownership of the Company or to cause a change in the effective control of the Company (within the meaning of\nsubsection (b) below).

As an alternative to delivering a stock certificate to the Participant, the Committee\nmay deposit or transfer such shares electronically with a custodian designated by the Committee. The Committee shall cause\nthe custodian to issue a receipt for the shares to the Participant for any Restricted Stock so deposited.

No fractional shares shall be issued or optioned in making\nthe foregoing adjustments, and the number of shares available under the Plan or the number of shares subject to any\noutstanding Awards shall be the next lower number of shares, rounding all fractions downward.\n(c) If any rights or warrants to subscribe for additional shares are given pro rata to holders of outstanding\nshares of the class or classes of stock then set aside for the Plan, each Participant shall be entitled to the same rights or\nwarrants on the same basis as holders of the outstanding shares with respect to such portion of his Award for which shares\nhave not yet been issued in his or her name on or prior to the record date or which portion is otherwise not included in the\ndetermination of shareholders entitled to receive or exercise such rights or warrants.\n7.2 Reorganization. Subject to any required action by the shareholders, if the Company shall be a party to any\nreorganization involving merger, consolidation, acquisition of the stock or acquisition of the assets of the Company which does not\nconstitute a Change of Control, and if the agreement memorializing such reorganization so provides, any outstanding Award granted\nunder the Plan shall pertain to and apply, with appropriate adjustment as determined by the Committee, to the securities of the\nresulting corporation to which a holder of the number of shares of the Common Stock subject to such Award would have been\nentitled. If such agreement does not so provide: (a) any or all Options granted hereunder shall become immediately nonforfeitable\nand fully exercisable or vested (to the extent permitted under federal or state securities laws) and are to be terminated after giving at\nleast 30 days' notice to the Participants to whom such Options have been granted and (b) any or all unvested Awards of Restricted\nStock or Restricted Stock Units hereunder shall become immediately fully vested, nonforfeitable and/or payable.\n7.3 Dissolution and Liquidation.

The Participant shall, upon the request of the Committee,\nexecute and deliver to the Company an agreement or affidavit to such effect. Should the Committee have reasonable cause to believe\nthat such Participant did not execute such agreement or affidavit in good faith, the Company shall not be bound by the grant of the\nAward or by the exercise of an Option. All certificates representing shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the Plan shall be\nmarked with the following restrictive legend or similar legend, if such marking, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, is\nnecessary or desirable:\nThe shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or\nthe securities laws of any state and are held by an \"affiliate\" (as such term is defined in Rule 144 promulgated by the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) of the Company.

Any attempted transfer of this certificate or the\nshares represented hereby which is in violation of the preceding restrictions will not be recognized by the Company,\nnor will any transferee be recognized as the owner thereof by the Company.\nIf the Common Stock is (A) held by a Participant who ceases to be an \"affiliate,\" as that term is defined in Rule 144 of the\nSecurities Act, or (B) registered under the Securities Act and all applicable state securities laws and regulations as provided in Section\n8.2, the Committee, in its discretion and with the advice of counsel, may dispense with or authorize the removal of the restrictive\nlegend set forth above or the portion thereof which is inapplicable.\n8.2 Registration. In the event that the Company in its sole discretion shall deem it necessary or advisable to register,\nunder the Securities Act or any state securities laws or regulations, any shares with respect to which Awards have been granted\nhereunder, then the Company shall take such action at its own expense before delivery of the certificates representing such shares to a\nParticipant. In such event, and if the shares of Common Stock of the Company shall be listed on any national securities exchange (as\nsuch term is defined by the Exchange Act) or on the NASDAQ National Market System at the time of the removal of restrictions from\nan Award or exercise of any Option, the Company shall make prompt application at its own expense for the listing on such stock\nexchange or the NASDAQ National Market System of the shares of Common Stock to be issued.\nARTICLE IX\nAmendment and Termination\n9.1 Amendment and Termination By the Board. Subject to Code Section 409A and Section 9.2 below, the Board shall\nhave the power at any time to add to, amend, modify or repeal any of the provisions of the Plan, to suspend the operation of the entire\nPlan or any of its provisions for any period or periods or to terminate the Plan in whole or in part.

No Award Agreement may be amended to reprice or constructively reprice any Award.\n9.2 Restrictions on Amendment and Termination. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9.1 above, the following\nrestrictions shall apply to the Board's authority under Section 9.1 above:\n(a) Prohibition Against Adverse Effects on Outstanding Awards. No addition, amendment, modification,\nrepeal, suspension or termination shall adversely affect, in any way, the rights of a Participant who has an outstanding Award\nwithout the consent of such Participant.

No modification or amendment of the Plan\nmay be made without the prior approval of the shareholders of the Company if such approval is necessary with respect to tax,\nsecurities or other applicable laws or the applicable rules or regulations of any stock exchange or the NASDAQ National\nMarket System.\nARTICLE X\nMiscellaneous Provisions\n10.1 Beneficiary. Upon a Participant’s death, the Participant’s Beneficiary shall be determined as follows:\n(a) Designation of Beneficiary.

A Participant shall designate his or her original Beneficiary in writing (on paper or electronically) on the form\nprovided by the Committee. Any subsequent modification of the Participant's Beneficiary shall be on the form provided by\nthe Committee. A designation of Beneficiary shall be effective when the properly completed form is received and accepted\nby the Committee (or its designee), as determined in the Committee's (or its delegate’s) sole discretion.\n(b) No Designated Beneficiary. If no Beneficiary has been validly designated by a Participant, or the\nBeneficiary designated by the Participant is no longer living or in existence at the time of the Participant's death, then the\nParticipant's Beneficiary shall be deemed to be the Participant's legal spouse under applicable state law, or if none, the\nParticipant's estate.\n(c) Designation of Multiple Beneficiaries. A Participant may, consistent with subsection (a) above, designate\nmore than one Person as a Beneficiary if, for each such Beneficiary, the Participant also designates a percentage of the\nParticipant's Award to be transferred to such Beneficiary upon the Participant's death. Unless otherwise specified by the\nParticipant, any designation by the Participant of multiple Beneficiaries shall be interpreted as a designation by the\nParticipant that each such Beneficiary (to the extent such Beneficiary is alive or in existence as of the Participant's date of\ndeath) should be entitled to an equal percentage of the Participant's Award. Each Beneficiary shall have complete and non-\njoint rights with respect to the portion of a Participant's Award to be transferred to such Beneficiary upon the Participant's\ndeath.\n(d) Contingent Beneficiaries. A Participant may designate one or more contingent Beneficiaries to receive all\nor a portion of the Participant's Award in the event that all of the Participant's original Beneficiaries should predecease the\nParticipant.

The proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the Common Stock subject to the\nOptions granted hereunder will be used for general corporate purposes.\n10.3 Notices. In order for a Participant or other individual to give notice or other communication to the Committee, the\nnotice or other communication shall be in the form specified by the Committee and delivered to the location designated by the\nCommittee in its sole discretion.\n10.4 Compliance with Rule 16b-3. This Plan is intended to be in compliance with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 as\npromulgated under Section 16 of the Exchange Act.\n10.5 Governing Law. The Plan shall be governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of\nAlabama, without regard to any choice of law principles thereof or of any other jurisdiction.\n10.6 Additional Provisions By Committee.

Wherever applicable, the masculine pronoun shall include the feminine pronoun, and the\nsingular shall include the plural.\n10.9 Headings. The titles in this Plan are inserted for convenience of reference; they constitute no part of the Plan and\nare not to be considered in the construction hereof.\n10.10 Legal References. Any reference in this Plan to a provision of law which is later revised, modified, finalized or\nredesignated, shall automatically be considered a reference to such revised, modified, finalized or redesignated provision of law.\n10.11 No Rights to Perform Services. Nothing contained in the Plan, or any modification thereof, shall be construed to\ngive any individual any rights to perform services for the Company or any of its Affiliates.\n10.12 Unfunded Arrangement.

Subject to Section 409A, all Awards granted under the Plan will be subject to clawback,\nrecovery, or recoupment, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, including but not limited to a reacquisition right with\nrespect to previously granted Restricted Stock or other cash or property, (a) as provided in the Company’s forfeiture policy\nimplemented by the Company from time to time and applicable to all officers and Directors of the Company on the same terms and\nconditions, including without limitation, any such policy adopted to comply with the requirements of applicable law or the rules and\nregulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Company, (b) as is required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act, or other applicable law, (c) as provided in the applicable Award Agreement, and/or (d) to the extent that the Committee\ndetermines that the Participant has been involved in the altering, inflating, and/or inappropriate manipulation of performance/financial\nresults or any other infraction of recognized ethical business standards, or that the Participant has willfully engaged in any activity\ninjurious to the Company, or the Participant’s Separation from Service with the Company or its Affiliates is for Cause. Compliance\nwith Section 409A of the Code. Unless otherwise expressly provided for in an Award Agreement, the Plan and Award Agreements will\nbe interpreted to the greatest extent possible in a manner that makes the Plan and the Awards granted hereunder exempt from Section\n409A of the Code, and, to the extent not so exempt, compliant with Section 409A of the Code. If the Committee determines that any\nAward granted hereunder is not exempt from and is therefore subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Award Agreement evidencing\nsuch Award will incorporate the terms and conditions necessary to avoid the consequences specified in Section 409A(a)(1) of the\nCode, and to the extent an Award Agreement is silent on terms necessary for compliance, such terms are hereby incorporated by\nreference into the Award Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan (and unless the Award Agreement\nspecifically provides otherwise), if a Participant holding an Award that constitutes “deferred compensation” under Section 409A of the\nCode is a “specified\nemployee” for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, no distribution or payment of any amount that is due because of a “separation\nfrom service” (as defined in Section 409A of the Code without regard to alternative definitions thereunder) will be issued or paid\nbefore the date that is six (6) months following the date of such Participant’s “separation from service” (as defined in Section 409A of\nthe Code without regard to alternative definitions thereunder) or, if earlier, the date of the Participant’s death, unless such distribution\nor payment can be made in a manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, and any amounts so deferred will be paid in a\nlump sum on the day after such six (6) month period elapses, with the balance paid thereafter on the original schedule.\n*****\nADOPTED BY BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON MARCH 6, 2020,\nEFFECTIVE AS OF MAY 13, 2020,\nAMENDED AND RESTATED EFFECTIVE JANUARY 24, 2023\nExhibit 21\nSUBSIDIARIES OF ADTRAN HOLDINGS, INC.\nDecember 31, 2022\nName of Subsidiary Country or State of Incorporation\nADTRAN Networks Pty.

ADTRAN and\nits representatives may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in this report, our other filings with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and other communications with our stockholders. Any statement that does not directly relate to a historical or\ncurrent fact is a forward-looking statement. Generally, the words “believe”, “expect”, “intend”, “estimate”, “anticipate”, “would”, “will”, “may”, “might”, “could”,\n“should”, “can”, “future”, “assume”, “plan”, “seek”, “predict”, “potential”, “objective”, “expect”, “target”, “project”, “outlook”, “forecast” and similar expressions\nidentify forward-looking statements. We caution you that any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are subject to uncertainties and other factors\nthat could affect the accuracy of such statements. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations as well as certain assumptions and\nestimates made by, and information available to, management at the time the statements are made. Those statements are based on general assumptions and are\nsubject to various risks, and because they also relate to the future they are likewise subject to inherent uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results\nto differ materially from the views, beliefs and projections expressed in such statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to,\nthe risks identified in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this report and those described below:\nRisks related to the Business Combination Agreement with ADVA\n•The consummation of the proposed business combination transaction (the “Business Combination”) pursuant to ADTRAN’s business combination\nagreement with ADVA and Acorn HoldCo (the “Business Combination Agreement”) is subject to a number of conditions, and the Business Combination\nAgreement may be terminated by each of ADTRAN and ADVA under certain circumstances. If the Business Combination is not completed, the price of\nour common stock may be adversely affected.\n•Acorn HoldCo, which will be the holding company of ADTRAN and ADVA following the completion of the Business Combination, may enter into a\ndomination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement with ADVA after the closing of the Business Combination that could be disadvantageous to Acorn\nHoldCo.\n•The pendency of the Business Combination, during which ADTRAN and ADVA are subject to certain operating restrictions, as well as uncertainty about\nthe effects of the Business Combination, could have an adverse effect on ADTRAN’s, ADVA’s and the combined group's businesses and cash flows,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and the market value of Acorn HoldCo's shares following the consummation of the Business Combination.\n•Negative publicity related to the Business Combination, including post-closing integration measures, may adversely affect ADTRAN, ADVA and the\ncombined group after the Business Combination.\n•Certain of our directors and executive officers and certain of the designees to the pre-closing Acorn HoldCo board of directors may have interests in the\nBusiness Combination that may be different from, or in addition to, those of ADTRAN stockholders generally.\n•We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant transaction fees and costs in connection with the Business Combination.\n•Risks relating to the businesses of ADTRAN and ADVA after the completion of the Business Combination may have a significant adverse impact on\nAcorn HoldCo's business and financial performance.\n•The combined group may fail to realize the anticipated strategic and financial benefits sought from the Business Combination.\n•Following the completion of the Business Combination, ADVA will be majority owned by Acorn HoldCo. While Acorn HoldCo may enter into a\ndomination agreement with ADVA, the effectiveness of such agreement may be delayed as a result of litigation or otherwise or may not occur, which may\nhave an adverse effect on the ability to realize synergies and cost reductions and the market value of Acorn HoldCo shares.\n•The combined group may experience a loss of customers or may fail to win new customers in certain countries.\n•ADTRAN, ADVA or the combined group may be unable to retain and motivate their respective personnel successfully while the Business Combination is\npending or following the completion of the Business Combination.\nRisks related to our financial results and Company success\n•Our revenue for a particular period can be difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.\n3\n•The lengthy sales and approval process required by service providers for new products could result in fluctuations in our revenue.\n•We depend heavily on sales to certain customers; the loss of any of these customers would significantly reduce our revenue and net income.\n•Our exposure to the credit risks of our customers and distributors may make it difficult to collect accounts receivable and could adversely affect our\noperating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n•We expect gross margins to vary over time, and our levels of product and services gross margins may not be sustainable.\n•Our dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products, combined with supply shortages, have\nprevented and may continue to prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect\non operating results and could have a material adverse effect on customer relations.\n•We compete in markets that have become increasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and market share.\n•Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, installation and shipment volumes, field service repair\nobligations and other rework costs incurred in correcting product failures. If our estimates change, our liability for warranty obligations may increase or\ndecrease, impacting future cost of revenue.\n•Managing our inventory is complex and may include write-downs of excess or obsolete inventory.\n•The continuing growth of our international operations could expose us to additional risks, increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results,\nfinancial condition and cash flows.\n•If we are unable to integrate future acquisitions successfully, it could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n•Our success depends on attracting and retaining key personnel.\n•If we fail to manage our exposure to worldwide financial and securities markets successfully, our operating results and financial statements could be\nmaterially impacted.\n•The elimination of LIBOR after June 2023 may affect our financial results.\n•There are risks associated with our revolving credit agreement and future indebtedness.\nRisks related to COVID-19\n•The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, particularly our\nsupply chain and workforce.\nRisks related to our control environment\n•We are currently in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") software solution. If we do not effectively implement this\nproject, or any future associated updates, our operations could be significantly disrupted.\n•Breaches of our information systems and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property and cause significant damage to our business and\nreputation.\n•If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting we could have a material weakness in those internal controls, that if not\nremediated, could materially adversely affect us.\nRisks related to the telecommunications industry\n•We must continue to update and improve our products and develop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications\ntechnology.\n•Our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable environmental regulations could adversely impact our results of\noperations.\n•If our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks, installations may be delayed or canceled, which could harm our business.\n4\n•We engage in research and development activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application of developed technologies, and as a\nconsequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially greater research and development efforts and which\nmay focus on more leading edge development.\n•Our strategy of outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing requirements to subcontractors located in various international regions may result in us not\nmeeting our cost, quality or performance standards.\n•Our failure to maintain rights to intellectual property used in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality and commercial value of\nour products.\n•Software under license from third parties for use in certain of our products may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms.\n•Our use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products.\n•We may incur liabilities or become subject to litigation that would have a material effect on our business.\n•If we are unable to successfully develop and maintain relationships with SIs, service providers and enterprise VARs, our revenue may be negatively\naffected.\nRisks related to the regulatory environments in which we do business\n•We are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and standards governing the conduct of our business. Violations of these laws\nand regulations may harm our business, subject us to penalties and to other adverse consequences.\n•Changes in trade policy in the U.S. and other countries, specifically the U.K. and China, including the imposition of additional tariffs and the resulting\nconsequences, may adversely impact our gross profits, gross margins, results of operations and financial condition.\n•New or revised tax regulations, changes in our effective tax rate, recognition of a valuation allowance or assessments arising from tax audits may have an\nadverse impact on our results.\nWe caution investors that other factors may prove to be important in the future in affecting our operating results. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is\nnot possible for us to predict all of these factors, nor can we assess the impact each factor, or a combination of factors, may have on our business.

BUSINESS\nCompany Overview\nADTRAN is a leading global provider of networking and communications platforms, software, and services focused on the broadband access market. Our vision is\nto enable a fully connected world where the power to communicate is available to everyone, everywhere. Our business approach, unmatched industry expertise and\ninnovative solutions enable us to address almost any customer need. Our products and services are utilized by a diverse global customer base of network operators\nthat range from those having regional or national reach and operating as telephone or cable television network operators to alternative network providers such as\nmunicipalities or utilities, as well as, managed service providers who serve small- and medium-sized businesses and distributed enterprises.\nWe operate under two reportable segments: (1) Network Solutions, which includes hardware and software products, and (2) Services & Support, which includes a\nportfolio of network implementation services, support services and cloud-hosted SaaS applications that complement our product portfolio and can be utilized to\nsupport other platforms as well. These two segments span across our three revenue categories: (1) Access & Aggregation, (2) Subscriber Solutions & Experience\nand (3) Traditional & Other Products. These revenue categories are distinguished by the types of products and services offered. Access & Aggregation is focused\non solutions that are used by service providers to connect their network infrastructure to subscribers; Subscriber Solutions & Experience is concentrated on\nsubscriber solutions that terminate broadband access in the home and/or business along with complementary software applications to optimize the subscriber\nexperience; and Traditional & Other Products encompasses prior-generation technologies, products and services and certain other offerings. See below for a\ndetailed discussion of these reportable segments and revenue categories.\nWe are focused on being a top global supplier of fiber-based communications infrastructure and SaaS applications spanning from the cloud edge (data center) to\nthe subscriber edge (customer premise) serving both the residential and enterprise connectivity markets. We offer a broad portfolio of flexible network\ninfrastructure solutions, customer premises equipment, software applications, and global services and support that enable service providers to meet their service\ndemands now and in the future. These products and services enable service providers to transition to a common network supporting the simplified delivery of high-\ncapacity services, regardless of subscriber density, network topology and infrastructure diversity.\nADTRAN began operations in January 1986. Headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama, ADTRAN is located in Cummings Research Park–the second largest research\npark in the U.S. and fourth largest in the world. Our mailing address is 901 Explorer Boulevard, Huntsville, Alabama, 35806. Our telephone number at that location\nis (256) 963-8000. Our website is www.adtran.com. No information contained on our website is intended to be included as part of, or incorporated by reference\ninto, this report.\n9\nBusiness Combination Agreement\nOn August 30, 2021, the Company, Acorn Holdco, ADVA and Acorn MergeCo, Inc (\"Merger Sub”) entered into a business combination agreement (the “Business\nCombination Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company and ADVA agreed to combine their respective businesses and each become subsidiaries of a new\nholding company, Acorn HoldCo, a Delaware corporation and currently a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the Company.\nUnder the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, Merger Sub, a newly formed Delaware corporation and wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Acorn\nHoldCo, will merge with and into ADTRAN, with ADTRAN surviving the merger (the “Merger”) as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Acorn HoldCo. Pursuant\nto the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock of the Company will be converted into the right to receive one share of common stock of Acorn HoldCo.\nAcorn HoldCo has also made a public exchange offer to exchange each issued and outstanding no-par value bearer share of ADVA, pursuant to which each ADVA\nshare tendered and accepted for exchange will be exchanged for 0.8244 shares of common stock of Acorn HoldCo (the “Exchange Offer”, and together with the\nMerger, the “Business Combination”). Upon completion of the Business Combination, and assuming that all of the outstanding ADVA shares are exchanged in the\nExchange Offer, former ADTRAN stockholders and former ADVA shareholders will own approximately 54% and 46%, respectively, of the outstanding Acorn\nHoldCo shares.\nThe Business Combination Agreement was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of the Company and by the supervisory board and management board\nof ADVA. On January 6, 2022, the Company's stockholders approved the Business Combination by an overwhelming majority. The end of the ADVA shareholder\ntender offer acceptance period was on January 26, 2022, which resulted in the acceptance of the Exchange Offer by more than 60% of all shares of ADVA entitled\nto voting rights existing as of October 31, 2021, thus exceeding the required minimum acceptance threshold. According to the rules of the German Securities\nAcquisition and Takeover Act, ADVA shareholders who did not tender their shares during the initial acceptance period could do so during a two-week additional\nacceptance period that began on February 1, 2022 and ended February 14, 2022. This resulted in the acceptance of the Exchange Offer by approximately 66% of all\nshares of ADVA entitled to voting rights existing as of November 30, 2021. On January 24, 2022, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States\n(\"CFIUS\") completed its review of the Business Combination and determined that the transaction was not a “covered transaction” subject to CFIUS’ jurisdiction,\nsatisfying the condition of the Business Combination Agreement related to CFIUS notification. On February 16, 2022, the U.K. Secretary of State for Business,\nEnergy and Industrial Strategy completed its review of the Business Combination and determined that the Secretary of State will be taking no further action under\nthe National Security and Investment Act 2021 (\"NS&I Act\"), satisfying the condition of the Business Combination Agreement related to NS&I Act approval.\nCooperative proceedings continue with the foreign direct investment authority in Germany.\nThe Company anticipates the consummation of the Business Combination around the middle of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, and regulatory\napprovals from the foreign direct investment authority in Germany.\nAdditional information about the Business Combination Agreement and proposed Business Combination is set forth in the Company’s filings with the SEC, as well\nas in the registration statement on Form S-4 that Acorn HoldCo filed with the SEC, which was declared effective December 2, 2021 (the “Acorn HoldCo\nRegistration Statement”).\n10\nReportable Segments\nOur business operates under two reportable segments: (1) Network Solutions and (2) Services & Support. We review our financial performance, specifically\nrevenue and gross profit, based on these two segments.\nNetwork Solutions Segment\nOur Network Solutions segment includes hardware and software products that primarily enable multi-Gigabit service delivery over fiber to homes and businesses.\nIn addition to fiber access, this portfolio also includes several products that enable high-speed broadband delivery over alternative mediums including copper, coax\nand fixed wireless. In the fixed broadband access segment, we offer traditional chassis-based network solutions, such as the Total Access 5000 and hiX 5600, while\nalso accelerating the industry’s transition to open, disaggregated fiber access solutions with our SDX Series. In our subscriber solutions portion of the Network\nSolution segments, ADTRAN offers cloud-managed Wi-Fi gateways and switches that provide a mix of wired and wireless connectivity at the customer premises.\nOur complete portfolio of broadband access and subscriber connectivity solutions are managed and orchestrated by our Mosaic software suite. The Mosaic\nsoftware suite includes a mix of orchestration and management solutions that simplify the deployment of next generation fiber access networks.\nServices & Support Segment\nIn addition to our network connectivity solutions, ADTRAN offers a comprehensive portfolio of network design, implementation and cloud-hosted services to\nassist operators in the deployment of multi-vendor networks while reducing their cost to maintain these networks. The cloud-hosted services include a suite of SaaS\napplications under our Mosaic One platform that manages end-to-end network and service optimization for both fiber access infrastructure and mesh Wi-Fi\nconnectivity. These services are backed by a global support organization that offers on-site and off-site support services with varying SLAs. By pairing our network\nsolutions with our global services and support organization, customers can turn to ADTRAN as their single turnkey partner to assist with the deployment and\nmaintenance of modern fiber access networks to connect homes and businesses.\n11\nRevenue Categories\nIn addition to classifying our operations into two reportable segments, we report revenue across three categories of products and services: (1) Access &\nAggregation, (2) Subscriber Solutions & Experience and (3) Traditional & Other Products.\nOur Access & Aggregation platforms are used by communications service providers to connect their network infrastructure to subscribers. This revenue category\nincludes hardware- and software-based products and services that aggregate and/or originate access technologies. ADTRAN solutions within this category include\na wide array of modular or fixed platforms designed to deliver the best technology and economy based on subscriber density and environmental conditions.\nThe Access & Aggregation category includes the following product, software and service families:\n•Total Access 5000 Series Fiber Access Platform •FTTdp Gfast DPUs\n•Total Access 11xx/12xx/5000 and hiX 5600 FTTN platforms •Cabinet and OSP enclosures and services\n•SFP, SFP+, XFP, QSFP transceivers, cables and other miscellaneous •Mosaic-branded network management and subscriber services\nmaterials control and orchestration software within SD-Access architectures\n•All technology varieties of PON OLTs used in conjunction with the\n•ADTRAN ONE branded packet optical transport\nADTRAN family of ONTs or select third-party ONTs\n•Planning, engineering, program management, maintenance,\ninstallation and commissioning services to implement customer network •MetNet 60 GHz fixed wireless access platform\nsolutions\n•Other products and services that are generally applicable to Access\n•SDX Series of open, disaggregated fiber access platforms & Aggregation\n12\nOur Subscriber Solutions & Experience portfolio is used by service providers to terminate their access services infrastructure at the customer premises while\nproviding an immersive and interactive experience for the subscriber.

Drivers for this network investment include the evolution of government funding programs, regulatory broadband policies, competition,\nincreasing subscriber demand for broadband and merger obligations.\nSubscriber demand for higher bandwidth continues to increase due to increasing numbers of connected devices, shifting working arrangements, OTT video, the\nprevalence of IoT and cloud services and the increasing use of internet applications. Performance is directly related to bandwidth availability. As the demand for\nhigh-definition video streaming services, symmetric bandwidth for video conferencing and collaboration tools, low-latency cloud gaming services and smart home\nvideo surveillance applications continues to increase, so too does the need for higher bandwidth to the home and business. ADTRAN serves as a trusted partner to\nour customers. Working side-by-side with our customers, we enable them to maximize the performance from their network, providing a flexible path for their\nnetworks to evolve cost effectively, and to further monetize their investments.\nOur Strategy\nOur strategy is to provide innovative and cost-effective solutions for our customers that enable them to address their increasing broadband demands. Our solutions\nfocus on technology transformations that are happening in broadband network infrastructure, home and business CPE and software platforms, and services needed\nto help our customers address increasing complexity while scaling to meet increasing consumer demands. We aspire to be one of the top communication\ntechnology players in the world and plan to achieve this goal through innovation in network, home and business technology paired with a customer-focused\norganizational structure that tailors solutions to meet the needs of our target customers. ADTRAN has an approach to our portfolio in which we are focused in\nspecific markets where we can offer competitive differentiation and scale while also having enough diversity and breadth in the portfolio to provide end-to-end\nconnectivity solutions that offer value to our customers.\nCustomers\nWe have a diverse global customer base that includes Tier-1, -2 and -3 service providers, alternative service providers, such as utilities, municipalities and fiber\noverbuilders, cable/MSOs, SMBs and distributed enterprises. Many network operators require product approval before the purchase or installation of a product.\nThe nature of our business involves a dynamic process of submitting new and succeeding generations of products for approval prior to orders being placed.\nOne distribution partner individually comprised more than 10% of our revenue in 2021. Additionally, our revenue in the U.S., Germany and the U.K. comprised\nmore than 10% of our revenue in 2021. The revenue from this distribution partner and these countries is reported in both our Network Solutions and Services &\nSupport segments.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with customers, service providers and approval processes, see “Risk Factors – The lengthy sales and approval process\nrequired by service providers for new products could result in fluctuations in our revenue,” “Risk Factors – We depend heavily on sales to certain customers; the\nloss of any of these customers would significantly reduce our revenue and net income,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nDistribution, Sales and Marketing\nWe sell our products through our direct sales organization and our distribution network. Our direct sales organization supports major accounts and has offices in\ndomestic and international locations. Sales to most smaller and independent telephone companies are fulfilled through a combination of direct sales and\ndistributors. Our services offerings can be purchased directly from us or through one of our service providers, channel partners or distribution partners.\nBefore placing an order, service providers typically require lengthy product qualification and standardization processes that can extend for several months or even\nyears. Once approved, product orders are typically placed under single or multi-year supply agreements that are generally not subject to minimum volume\ncommitments. Service providers generally prefer having two or more suppliers for most products. Therefore, individual orders are usually subject to competition\nbased on some combination of total value, service, price, delivery and other terms.\nOrders for end-user products are fulfilled through a combination of direct sales and distributors. This is supported by a direct sales organization for major accounts\nand a channel-based sales organization to facilitate sales to our partners. MSPs, VARs and SIs may be affiliated with the company as channel partners, or they may\npurchase from a distributor in an unaffiliated fashion. Affiliated partners participate with us at various program levels, based on sales volume and other factors, to\nreceive benefits such as product discounts, market development funds, technical support and training.\n14\nOutside of the U.S., most service provider products are sold through our direct sales organization and end-user products are sold direct or through distribution\narrangements customized for each region. Some regions are supported from a field office that offers sales and support functions, and in some cases, warehousing\nand manufacturing support. Our field sales organizations, distributors and service provider customers receive support from regional-based marketing, sales and\ncustomer support groups.\nOur marketing organization promotes all brands associated with ADTRAN to key stakeholders, including customers, partners and prospects throughout the world.\nMarketing is complemented by product marketing and management teams that work with our engineering teams to develop and promote new products and\nservices, as well as product enhancements.\nResearch and Development\nRapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements and continuing developments in communications service offerings\ncharacterize the markets for our products. Our on-going ability to adapt to these changes and to develop new and enhanced products that meet or anticipate market\ndemand is a significant factor influencing our competitive position and our ability to grow.\nOur product development activities are an important part of our strategy. We plan to maintain our emphasis on product development to enable us to respond to\nrapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. Our research and development and engineering functions are global. We maintain research and\ndevelopment functions at our Huntsville, Alabama headquarters, in Germany and other locations worldwide. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and\n2019, research and development expenditures totaled $108.7 million, $113.3 million and $126.2 million, respectively.\nWe develop our products either internally or by leveraging partners. Additionally, in some cases, we license intellectual property or acquire technologies. Internal\ndevelopment on advanced technology products gives us more control over design and manufacturing issues, while for traditional designs, ODM and/or licensed\nintellectual property provides us with the ability to leverage the economies of scale of our technology partners. This balanced approach ensures we provide best-in-\nclass solutions for our customers.\nAs we continue to create more software-based intellectual property, such as our SDN/NFV portfolio, our use of lean agile practices in research and development\nensures we remain responsive and customer-focused. This enables us to deliver products faster, at higher quality and more economically to our customers and the\nmarket on a continuous basis.\nOur ability to continually reduce product costs, while focusing on delivery and quality, are important parts of our overall business strategy. Our product\ndevelopment efforts are often centered on entering a market with improved technology, enabling us to offer products at competitive prices and compete for market\nshare. We continually re-engineer successive generations of existing products to improve our product performance, costs and value. In 2021 we encountered supply\nchain disruptions and component shortages, which resulted in us re-engineering some of our products to work around component end of life issues. See Backlog\nand Inventory included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding our supply chain disruptions.\nDevelopment activities focus on solutions that support both existing and emerging communications industry technologies in segments that we consider viable\nrevenue opportunities. We are actively engaged in developing and refining technologies to support data, voice and video transport primarily over IP/Ethernet\nnetwork architectures. This includes Ethernet aggregation, fiber-optic transport and access, DSL, access routing, Ethernet switching, wireless LANs, integrated\naccess, converged services, VoIP, network management and professional services. In 2021, we completed the design of certain IoT products, added Wi-Fi 6\ngateways and completed our 10G EPON strand mount OLT. We also enhanced our SaaS delivery abilities and Mosaic One software.\nOur research function supports product development efforts throughout the Company. This function guides our various product design and engineering teams in\ndigital signal processing technologies, computer simulation and modeling, CAD/CAM toolsets, custom semiconductor design, optical transceiver design, industry\nstandards, technological forecasting, product development methods and emerging networks standards.\nMany communication requirements, processes and technologies are governed by SDOs. These SDOs consist of representatives from various manufacturers, service\nproviders and testing laboratories who work to establish specifications and compliance guidelines for emerging communications technologies. We are an active\nparticipant in several SDOs and have assisted with the development of worldwide standards in many technologies.\nOur SDO activities are primarily in the area of broadband access. This includes involvement with the ITU-T, ATIS, ETSI and the BBF. We are involved in the\nevolution of optical access technologies, participating in activities in the ITU-T, FSAN and BBF on next-generation PON. We are also involved in standards\ndevelopment efforts related to maximizing the bandwidth potential of the copper\n15\npair to enable new applications in the ITU-T. We continue to be involved with the industry-wide interoperability, performance-testing and system-level projects\nrelated to those standards in the BBF. We are also members of MEF, TIA, CableLabs and TIP.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with our research and development activities, see “Risk Factors – We must continue to update and improve our products and\ndevelop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology” and “Risk Factors – We engage in research and\ndevelopment activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application of developed technologies, and as a consequence may miss certain\nmarket opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially greater research and development effort and which may focus on more leading edge\ndevelopment,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nManufacturing and Operations\nThe principal steps in our manufacturing process include the purchase and management of materials, assembly, testing, final inspection, packing and shipping. We\npurchase parts and components for the assembly of some products from a large number of suppliers through a worldwide sourcing program. Additionally, we\nmanage a process that identifies the components that are best purchased directly by contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of our products to achieve\nmanufacturing efficiency, quality and cost objectives. Certain key components used in our products are currently available from a single source, and other key\ncomponents are available from only a limited number of sources. In the past, we have experienced delays in the receipt of certain key components, which has\nresulted in delays in related product deliveries. We attempt to manage these risks through developing alternative sources, by staging inventories at strategic\nlocations, through engineering efforts designed to prevent the necessity of certain components and by maintaining close contact and building long-term\nrelationships with our suppliers. With the current global supply chain and transportation constraints, and limited availability of semiconductor chips and other\ncomponents of our products, we have experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times, increased logistics intervals and costs, and lower volume of\nproducts deliveries, which have and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on customer\nrelations and our financial condition. We expect that the supply chain constraints and semiconductor shortage will continue to affect our operating results through\nthe end of 2022, although we cannot predict such factors with certainty. See Backlog and Inventory included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional\ninformation.\nWe rely on subcontractors for assembly and testing of certain printed circuit board assemblies, sub-assemblies, chassis, enclosures and equipment shelves, and to\npurchase some of the raw materials used in such assemblies. We typically manufacture our lower-volume, higher-mix products and build and test product\nprototypes and many of our initial production units at our manufacturing site in Huntsville, Alabama. We later transfer the production of higher-volume, lower-mix\nassemblies to our subcontractors. Subcontract assembly operations can lengthen fulfillment cycle times, but we believe we can respond more rapidly to\nuncertainties in incoming order rates by selecting assembly subcontractors that have significant reserve capacity and flexibility. Our subcontractors have generally\nproven to be flexible and able to meet our quality requirements.\nWe ship the majority of products to our U.S. customers from our facilities in Huntsville, Alabama, although we also fulfill customer orders from other locations\nnear our customers' sites, when possible. The majority of our products shipped to EMEA customers come from locations in that region. We also ship directly from\nsubcontractors to a number of customers in the U.S. and international locations. Most of our facilities are certified pursuant to the most current releases of ISO\n9001, TL 9000, ISO 14001 and ISO 27001. Our Huntsville, Alabama facilities and many of our key suppliers are C-TPAT certified. Our products are also certified\nto certain other customer, industry and privacy standards, including those relating to emission of electromagnetic energy and safety specifications.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with manufacturing activities, see “Risk Factors – Our strategy of outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing requirements to\nsubcontractors located in various international regions may result in us not meeting our cost, quality or performance standards” and “Risk Factors – Our\ndependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products, combined with supply shortages, have prevented and\nmay continue to prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on operating results\nand could have a material adverse effect on customer relations,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nOur dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products, combined with supply shortages, have prevented\nand may continue to prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on operating\nresults and could have a material adverse effect on customer relations.\nCompetition\nWe compete in markets for networking and communications services and solutions for service providers, businesses, government agencies and other organizations\nworldwide. Our products and services provide solutions supporting voice, data and video communications across fiber-, copper-, coaxial- and wireless-based\ninfrastructure, as well as across wide area networks, local area networks and the internet.\n16\nWe compete with a number of companies in the markets we serve. In our Access & Aggregation category, key competitors include Calix, Casa Systems, Ciena,\nCommScope, DZS, Harmonic, Huawei, Nokia, Radisys, Tibit Communications, Vecima Networks and ZTE. In the Subscriber Solutions & Experience category,\nour primary competitors include Calix, Cisco, CommScope, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Juniper Networks, Ribbon Communications, Ubiquiti Networks and\nZyxel. In addition to these OEM vendors, we face increasing competition from various ODM vendors who are being engaged directly by some of our service\nprovider customers. Some of these companies compete in a single product segment, while others compete across multiple product lines. Competitors of our\nServices & Support business include Calix, Fujitsu Network Communications and Nokia.\nFor further discussion of risks associated with our competition, see “Risk Factors – We must continue to update and improve our products and develop new\nproducts to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology” and “Risk Factors – We compete in markets that have become\nincreasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and market share,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nSeasonality\nWe experience quarterly fluctuations in our revenue that occur due to many factors, including the varying budget cycles and seasonal buying patterns of our\ncustomers. More specifically, our customers tend to spend less in the first fiscal quarter as they are finalizing their annual capital spending budgets. These seasonal\neffects may continue to vary and do not always correlate to our operating results. Accordingly, they should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future\nrevenue or operating results.\nForeign Currency\nTransactions with customers that are denominated in foreign currencies are recorded using the appropriate exchange rates from throughout the year. Assets and\nliabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the balance sheet dates using the closing rates of exchange between those foreign currencies and the\nfunctional currency with any transaction gains or losses reported in other income (expense). Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements\nare with our German subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Euro and our Australian subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Australian dollar.\nAdjustments resulting from translating financial statements of international subsidiaries are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss)\nincome.\nBacklog and Inventory\nA substantial portion of our shipments in any fiscal period relates to orders received and shipped within that fiscal period for customers under agreements\ncontaining nonbinding purchase commitments. Further, a significant percentage of orders require delivery within a few days. These factors normally result in a\nvarying order backlog and limited order flow visibility; however, with the current global supply chain and transportation constraints, and limited availability of\nsemiconductor chips and other components of our products, we have experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times, increased logistics intervals\nand costs, and lower volume of products deliveries, which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our operating results, customer relations and our financial condition. The backlog has been increasing due to increased demand and\nsupply chain constraints. Additionally, backlog levels may vary because of seasonal trends, the timing of customer projects and other factors that affect customer\norder lead times.\n17\nTo meet this type of demand, we have enhanced and implemented supply chain management systems and processes to manage the materials planning and\nproduction processes. We maintain substantial inventories of raw materials for long lead time components to support this demand and avoid expedite fees. In the\ncurrent environment, our raw material inventory has grown due to increased purchases in preparation for strategic inventory buffer purchases as well as new\nproduct ramp ups to ensure supply continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect inventory levels to fluctuate as we attempt to maintain sufficient\ninventory in response to COVID-19 uncertainties related to supply chain and supply, seasonal cycles of our business and ensuring competitive lead times while\nmanaging the risk of inventory. We also maintain substantial finished goods inventories. Our practice of maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt\ndelivery of our products and services increases the amount of inventory that may be considered excess and/or obsolete. This excess and obsolete inventory may\nrequire us to write down the value of the inventory, which may have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nFor further discussion of risks associated with managing our inventory, see “Risk Factors – Managing our inventory is complex and may include write-downs of\nexcess or obsolete inventory,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur products must comply with various regulations and standards established by communications authorities in various countries, as well as those of certain\ninternational bodies. Environmental legislation within the EU may increase our cost of doing business as we amend our products to comply with these\nrequirements. For example, the EU issued the RoHS directive, the WEEE directive and the REACH regulation. We continue to implement measures to comply\nwith these and other similar directives and regulations from additional countries.\nWe strive to deliver innovative network access solutions that lower the total cost and reduce the time of deploying services, increase the level of performance\nachievable with established infrastructures, reduce operating and capital expenses for our customers, increase network bandwidth and functionality, and extend\nnetwork reach. Our development process is conducted in accordance with ISO 9001, TL 9000, ISO 14001, and ISO 27001, all of which are international standards\nfor quality and environmental management systems. Our corporate practices also conform to GDPR requirements, which protect digital data for all EU citizens,\nand to other applicable data protection laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to these laws, rules\nand regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.\nFor further discussion of risks associated with government regulation, see “Risk Factors – We are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws,\nregulations and standards governing the conduct of our business. Violations of these laws and regulations may harm our business, subject us to penalties and to\nother adverse consequences.”\nHuman Capital\nWe believe that our most valuable asset is our people. To ensure our Company continues to succeed, our objective is to be able to recruit, hire and retain top talent.\nOur ability to attract and retain a high-quality workforce is dependent on our ability to maintain a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace that provides\nopportunities for our employees to learn and grow in their careers. This is supported by competitive compensation and benefits, along with strong community\nservice and other programs that enable employees to build connections within the community.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 1,335 full-time employees, with 1,036 in the U.S. and 299 in our international subsidiaries located in North America, Latin\nAmerica, EMEA and APAC regions. We also utilized 45 contractors and numerous temporary employees domestically and internationally in various\nmanufacturing, engineering, sales and general and administrative capacities. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. ADTRAN has a diverse\nemployee base located in 17 countries. We pride ourselves on a highly educated workforce, and the majority of our employees serve in engineering, information\ntechnology and technical roles within the organization.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 168 employees (76%) of ADTRAN GmbH were subject to collective bargaining agreements of either the Association of\nMetal and Electrical Industry in Berlin and Brandenburg e.V. or NORDMETALL Association of Metal and Electrical Industry e.V. Although these collective\nbargaining agreements will expire on September 30, 2022, negotiations with the employees of ADTRAN GmbH for a new collective bargaining agreement are\nongoing and we have not experienced any work stoppage. None of our other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.\nAdditionally, we continually work to recruit technical talent in diverse communities through our cooperative education program. This program seeks to identify\ncollege students that major in relevant technology areas and expose them to the work environment at ADTRAN on an alternating semester basis. Our goal is to\nretain as many of these students as possible for full-time employment after graduation, as they are our Company's future.\n18\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe believe that maintaining a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to the success of our business. The Company encourages an environment where\nindividuality is embraced regardless of age, gender, identity, race, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, ethnicity and perspective and where each employee\nis accepted and respected and can, therefore, bring their most authentic self to work. To this end, we have established an employee-driven Diversity, Equity &\nInclusion (“DE&I”) Task Force to spearhead our efforts. The DE&I Task Force is comprised of our Chief Financial Officer and employee volunteers who are\npassionate about DE&I and how it affects our workforce.\nIn addition to diversity in our workforce, we seek to ensure diversity in our Board of Directors with respect to skills, experience, gender, race and ethnicity. Our\nBoard of Directors is comprised of six members, two of which are females and three of which are ethnically diverse. Additionally, the Board of Directors has a\ndiversity of skills and experience with respect to accounting and finance, management and leadership, vision and strategy, business operations, business judgment,\ncrisis management, risk assessment, industry knowledge, corporate governance and global markets.\nHealth, Safety and Wellness\nThe well-being of our employees is paramount to the continued success of our business. To this end, we are committed to each of our employees' health, safety and\nwellness. We provide our employees with access to various health and wellness benefits designed to enable them and their family members to have affordable\naccess to health, dental and vision insurance. Additionally, we offer access to many programs that provide additional monetary support in the event of a qualifying\nincident, including accident insurance, life insurance and hospital indemnity insurance, among others. We understand that mental health is an essential aspect of\nour employees’ wellbeing. As a result, we offer an employee assistance program at no charge to employees and their family members. This program provides\naccess to qualified personnel to address various issues such as grief, financial stress, family and emotional issues.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that were determined to be in the best interest of our employees and the communities\nin which we operate. We introduced enhanced health and safety standards that are in compliance with, or exceed, local, state and federal recommendations and\nregulations in the U.S. and at our international locations. This includes having the vast majority of our global employees work from home when possible. In areas\nwhere it is necessary to have critical, on-site personnel, such as at our manufacturing facilities, additional health and safety measures have been implemented to\nprovide the safest environment possible for these workers.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe continually work to provide a competitive compensation and benefits program as this plays a key role in our ability to attract and retain a highly skilled\nworkforce. In addition to salaries, these programs, which vary by country/region, include long-term equity incentive awards with certain vesting requirements,\ndeferred compensation plans (which are offered to certain members of executive management), a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and\nflexible spending accounts, paid time off, paid volunteer time off, employee assistance program and tuition assistance. Additionally, at our headquarters in\nAlabama, we offer our employees certain on-site services, including nurse practitioner care and a fitness center, among others.\nTalent Development\nWe invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain a market-leading global supplier of broadband infrastructure. We offer numerous training\nopportunities on both technical and professional development topics. We utilize tools and processes to provide performance feedback which helps develop high\npotential employees into becoming our future leaders.\nThe ADTRAN Career Development Program provides an opportunity for employees to shape their career journey. The program provides opportunities for\nemployees to develop competencies in areas including technology, business acumen, emotional intelligence, design and systems thinking. As employees increase\ntheir competencies in these areas and master skills within their individual roles, this program offers a variety of career advancement paths. Employees also have\naccess to the ADTRAN Learning Network. This platform houses all required training, as well as optional training in a variety of areas.\nIntellectual Property\nADTRAN develops and owns a significant amount of intellectual property. We hold over 600 patents worldwide related to our products and over 50 additional\npending patent applications. Our patents expire at various dates between 2022 and 2038. We continue to seek additional patents related to our research and\ndevelopment activities. We do not derive any material amount of revenue from the licensing of our patents.\n19\nThe ADTRAN corporate logo is a registered trademark of ADTRAN, as is the name “ADTRAN”, “SmartRG” and a number of our product identifiers and names.\nWe also claim rights to a number of unregistered trademarks.\nWe protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights in accordance with good legal and business practices. We believe, however, that our competitive success\nwill not fully depend on the ownership of intellectual property, but instead will depend primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing\nabilities of our personnel.\nThe communications industry is characterized by the existence of an ever-increasing volume of patent litigation and licensing activities. We have received, and\nmay continue to receive, notices of claims alleging that we are infringing upon patents or other intellectual property. We cannot predict whether we will prevail in\nany claims or litigation over alleged infringements, or whether we will be able to license any valid and infringed patents, or other intellectual property, on\ncommercially reasonable terms. It is possible that such litigation may result in significant legal costs and judgments and that intellectual property infringement\nclaims, or related litigation against or by us could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property and proprietary rights, see “Risk Factors – Our failure to maintain rights to intellectual\nproperty used in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality, and commercial value of our products” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\n20\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nSet forth below is certain information regarding the current executive officers of ADTRAN.

The SEC maintains an internet website, http://www.sec.gov, that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers,\nincluding ADTRAN, that file electronically with them. Additionally, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-\nK and amendments to those reports, if applicable, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are\navailable free of charge under the Investor Relations section of our website, www.adtran.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them\nwith, or furnish them to, the SEC. The reference to our website address does not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the website,\nwhich information should not be considered part of this report.\n21\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves substantial risks. Any of the risk factors described below or elsewhere in this report could significantly and adversely affect our business\nprospects, financial condition and results of operations. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently\nknown to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to the Business Combination Agreement with ADVA\nThe consummation of the Business Combination is subject to a number of conditions, and the Business Combination Agreement may be terminated by each of\nADTRAN and ADVA under certain circumstances. If the Business Combination is not completed, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nThe consummation of the Business Combination is subject to a number of conditions, including, among others, (i) adoption of the Business Combination\nAgreement by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of ADTRAN common stock, (ii) the tender in the Exchange Offer of at least 60% of the outstanding\nADVA shares, (iii) the declaration of effectiveness by the SEC of the Acorn HoldCo Registration Statement on Form S-4 that Acorn HoldCo filed with the SEC for\nthe shares to be issued in the Merger and the Exchange Offer, with no stop order in effect or being sought with respect thereto, (iv) receipt of certain antitrust and\nforeign direct investment regulatory approvals for the transaction (the “regulatory condition”) and (vi) the absence of any law, regulation, administrative act,\ninjunction, temporary restraining order or preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued by any governmental entity in any relevant jurisdiction\nprohibiting or making illegal (a) the consummation of the Exchange Offer or the Merger or (b) the ownership of ADVA shares or shares of the surviving\ncorporation by Acorn HoldCo. Furthermore, ADTRAN’s obligation to consummate the Business Combination is subject to certain additional customary conditions,\nincluding (i) the absence of a Target Material Adverse Change for ADVA, as defined in the Business Combination Agreement, (ii) the absence of the violation of\nlaw by ADVA related to bribery, corruption or export sanctions, (iii) the absence of an increase or decrease in ADVA’s share capital of more than 1%, subject to\ncertain exceptions and the absence of a loss in the amount of half or more of ADVA’s share capital and (iv) the absence of any insolvency proceedings against\nADVA or circumstances requiring the opening of insolvency proceedings. Except for the regulatory condition, all conditions to the Business Combination have\nbeen satisfied on or prior to the end of the acceptance period for the Exchange Offer. The regulatory condition may remain outstanding for up to twelve months\nfollowing the end of the acceptance period. The completion of the Business Combination will depend on the satisfaction of the regulatory condition. No assurance\ncan be given that the regulatory condition to the Business Combination will be satisfied or, if it is, as to the timing of the closing of the Business Combination.\nFurthermore, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, both we and ADVA may terminate the Business Combination Agreement under certain\ncircumstances, including, among others, the occurrence of a material adverse change affecting ADVA or certain changes in the recommendation to the ADVA\nmanagement or supervisory board.\nIf the regulatory condition to the Business Combination is not satisfied or validly waived in advance, or if termination rights are exercised, the Business\nCombination Agreement will terminate and the Business Combination will not be completed. If the Business Combination is delayed or not completed, the price of\nour common stock may decline.\nAcorn HoldCo, which will be the holding company of ADTRAN and ADVA following the completion of the Business Combination, may enter into a\ndomination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement with ADVA after the closing of the Business Combination that could be disadvantageous to Acorn\nHoldCo.\nFollowing completion of the Business Combination, Acorn HoldCo may enter into a domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement (a “DPLTA”) with\nADVA. Pursuant to applicable provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act, under a DPLTA, Acorn HoldCo would be obligated to compensate any annual net\nloss of ADVA. Further, each ADVA shareholder who did not tender in the Exchange Offer would be offered to elect either (1) to remain an ADVA shareholder\nand receive, in the case of a domination agreement, an adequate fixed or variable annual guaranteed dividend or, in the case of a profit and loss transfer agreement,\nreceive annual recurring compensation pursuant to applicable provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act, or (2) to receive adequate exit compensation in\nexchange for its ADVA shares pursuant to applicable provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act. ADVA shareholders electing the first option may later elect\nthe second option for as long as the offer for the exit compensation is open. Acorn HoldCo’s obligation to pay an adequate fixed or variable annual guaranteed\ndividend or annual recurring compensation would lead to a continuing payment obligation for Acorn HoldCo which could be higher than dividends to be otherwise\ndistributed to its shareholders. This could result in a substantial financial obligation of Acorn HoldCo.\n22\nThe pendency of the Business Combination, during which ADTRAN and ADVA are subject to certain operating restrictions, as well as uncertainty about the\neffects of the Business Combination, could have an adverse effect on ADTRAN’s, ADVA’s and the combined group's businesses and cash flows, financial\ncondition, results of operations and the market value of Acorn HoldCo's shares following the consummation of the Business Combination.\nThe pendency of the Business Combination could disrupt ADTRAN’s and ADVA’s businesses, and uncertainty about the effect of the Business Combination may\nhave an adverse effect on ADTRAN and ADVA. These uncertainties could cause suppliers, vendors, partners, customers and others that deal with ADTRAN or\nADVA to defer entering into contracts with, or making other decisions concerning ADTRAN or ADVA or to seek to change or cancel existing business\nrelationships with the companies. This might have an adverse effect on the revenues and cash flows of ADTRAN and ADVA. In addition, due to this, ADTRAN’s\nand ADVA’s employees may experience uncertainty regarding their roles after the Business Combination. Employees may depart either before or after the\ncompletion of the Business Combination because of uncertainty and issues relating to the difficulty of coordination or because of a desire not to remain following\nthe Business Combination. Therefore, the pendency and uncertainty about the effect of the Business Combination may adversely affect Acorn HoldCo’s,\nADTRAN’s and ADVA’s ability to retain, recruit and motivate key personnel. Additionally, the attention of ADTRAN’s and ADVA’s management may be\ndirected towards the completion of the Business Combination, including obtaining regulatory approvals and/or initiating post-completion integration measures, and\nmay be diverted from the day-to-day business operations of ADTRAN and ADVA. Matters related to the Business Combination may require commitments of time\nand resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might have been beneficial to ADTRAN and ADVA. Additionally, the Business\nCombination Agreement requires ADTRAN and ADVA to refrain from taking certain specified actions, for example significant investments or disposals, while the\nBusiness Combination is pending. These restrictions may prevent ADTRAN and ADVA from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities or capital\nstructure alternatives and from executing certain business strategies prior to the completion of the Business Combination. Further, the Business Combination may\ngive rise to potential liabilities, including those that may result from pending and future stockholder lawsuits relating to the Business Combination or a potential\npost-completion reorganization. Any of these matters could adversely affect the businesses of, or harm the results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of\nADTRAN, ADVA or the combined group following the Business Combination.\nFurther, certain adverse changes in the business of ADVA or ADTRAN in the period prior to the closing of the Business Combination may occur that would not\nresult in ADTRAN, ADVA or Acorn HoldCo having the right to terminate the Business Combination Agreement or the Exchange Offer. If adverse changes occur\nfor ADTRAN and ADVA but the Business Combination is still required to be completed, the market value of ADTRAN shares, ADVA shares or Acorn HoldCo\nshares may decrease. If the Business Combination is not completed, these risks may still materialize and adversely affect the business and financial results of\nADTRAN and/or ADVA.\nNegative publicity related to the Business Combination, including post-closing integration measures, may adversely affect ADTRAN, ADVA and the combined\ngroup after the Business Combination.\nPolitical and public sentiment in connection with the Business Combination and associated post-closing integration measures may result in a significant amount of\nadverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting the parties to the Business Combination. Adverse press coverage and public statements,\nwhether or not driven by political or popular sentiment, may also result in legal claims or in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials.\nResponding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceedings, can divert the time and effort of senior management from\noperating their businesses. Addressing any adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings could be time-consuming and\nexpensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, could have a negative impact on the reputation of ADTRAN, ADVA and Acorn\nHoldCo, on the morale and performance of their employees and on the relationships with regulators, suppliers and customers. It may also have a negative impact\non our ability to take timely advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of\nresponding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on ADTRAN’s, ADVA’s and, after the Business Combination, the combined group's respective\nbusinesses and cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our directors and executive officers and certain of the designees to the pre-closing Acorn HoldCo board of directors may have interests in the\nBusiness Combination that may be different from, or in addition to, those of ADTRAN stockholders generally.\nCertain of our directors and executive officers, as well as certain designees to the pre-closing Acorn HoldCo board of directors, may have interests in the Business\nCombination that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of ADTRAN stockholders. These interests include the continued service of certain directors\nand executive officers following the closing of the Business Combination, the treatment of restricted stock units, performance stock units, stock options and other\nequity-based awards in connection with the Business Combination, and the indemnification of ADTRAN Directors, executive officers and designees to the pre-\nclosing Acorn HoldCo board of directors by Acorn HoldCo.\n23\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant transaction fees and costs in connection with the Business Combination.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur a number of significant non-recurring implementation and restructuring costs associated with combining the\noperations of the two companies. In addition, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant banking, legal, accounting and other transaction fees and\ncosts related to the Business Combination.\nAdditional costs substantially in excess of currently anticipated costs may also be incurred in connection with the integration of the businesses of ADTRAN and\nADVA. For additional information regarding estimates of fees and costs relating to the Business Combination Agreement and proposed Business Combination\nrefer to the Company’s filings with the SEC, as well as the Acorn HoldCo Registration Statement.\nAny cost savings or other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses that could offset these transaction- and combination-related costs over time may\nnot be achieved in the near term, or at all. In addition, the timeline in which cost savings are expected to be realized is lengthy and may not be achieved. Failure to\nrealize these synergies and cost reductions and other efficiencies in a timely manner or at all could have a material adverse effect on Acorn HoldCo’s and\nADTRAN’s respective businesses and cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks relating to the businesses of ADTRAN and ADVA after the completion of the Business Combination may have a significant adverse impact on Acorn\nHoldCo’s business and financial performance.\nDue to the size and geographic reach of Acorn HoldCo’s operations following the completion of the Business Combination, a wide range of factors could\nmaterially affect its operations and financial performance. In addition to the risks described herein, the risks relating to ADVA’s business described in “Risk\nFactors — Risks Relating to the Business of ADVA” in the Acorn HoldCo Registration Statement, may significantly impact Acorn HoldCo’s business and\nfinancial performance after the completion of the Business Combination.\nThe combined group may fail to realize the anticipated strategic and financial benefits sought from the Business Combination.\nThe combined group may not realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination. The success of the Business Combination will depend on,\namong other things, Acorn HoldCo's ability to combine ADTRAN's business with ADVA's business in a manner that facilitates growth and realizes anticipated\ncost savings.\nHowever, Acorn HoldCo must successfully combine the businesses of ADTRAN and ADVA in a manner that permits these anticipated benefits to be realized. In\naddition, the combined group must achieve the anticipated growth and cost savings without adversely affecting current revenue and investments in future growth.\nIn addition, the actual integration of ADTRAN and ADVA will involve complex operational, technological and personnel-related challenges. This process will be\ntime-consuming and expensive, and it may be disruptive to the combined businesses. Acorn HoldCo may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Business\nCombination. Difficulties in the integration of the businesses, which may result in significant costs and delays, include:\n•managing a significantly larger combined group;\n•aligning and executing the strategy of the combined group;\n•integrating and unifying the offerings and services available to customers and coordinating distribution and marketing efforts in geographically separate\norganizations;\n•coordinating corporate and administrative infrastructures and aligning insurance coverage;\n•coordinating accounting, information technology, communications, administration and other systems;\n•addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n•coordinating the compliance program and creating uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n•the implementation, ultimate impact and outcome of potential post-completion reorganization transactions, which may be delayed or not take effect as a\nresult of litigation or otherwise;\n•unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the Business Combination or the combined group's business after the Business Combination;\n•managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined group;\n•identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming functions and assets;\n•effecting actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals;\n24\n•a deterioration of credit ratings; and\n•dual stock market regulatory reporting requirements.\nThese and other factors could result in increased costs and diversion of management’s time and energy, as well as decreases in the amount of expected revenue and\nearnings, which could materially impact the combined group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The integration process and other disruptions\nresulting from the Business Combination may also adversely affect the combined group’s relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, distributors, licensors\nand others with whom ADTRAN and ADVA have business or other dealings, and difficulties in integrating the businesses of ADTRAN and ADVA could harm the\nreputation of the combined group.\nIf the combined group is not able to successfully combine the businesses of ADTRAN and ADVA in an efficient, cost-effective and timely manner, the anticipated\nbenefits and cost savings of the Business Combination may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nFollowing the completion of the Business Combination, ADVA will be majority owned by Acorn HoldCo. While Acorn HoldCo may enter into a domination\nagreement with ADVA, the effectiveness of such agreement may be delayed as a result of litigation or otherwise or may not occur, which may have an adverse\neffect on the ability to realize synergies and cost reductions and the market value of Acorn HoldCo shares.\nFollowing the completion of the Business Combination, ADVA will be directly majority owned by Acorn HoldCo and, thus, become a dependent company of\nAcorn HoldCo within the meaning of the German Stock Corporation Act. The legal framework for this dependency between Acorn HoldCo and ADVA is, subject\nto other applicable law, set forth in applicable provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act, which may prevent or impede the realization of synergies and cost\nreductions absent a domination agreement. If Acorn HoldCo pursues a domination agreement but does not hold enough of ADVA’s outstanding shares after the\ncompletion of the Business Combination or such approval is contested or the effectiveness of such agreement is delayed as a result of litigation or otherwise or\ndoes not occur, Acorn HoldCo may be unable to initiate any transactions or measures that are disadvantageous to ADVA, unless Acorn HoldCo provides adequate\ncompensation to ADVA. If the disadvantage caused by any transaction or other measure cannot be assessed or compensated, Acorn HoldCo will be unable to\ninitiate such transaction or measure, which may preclude Acorn HoldCo from implementing certain transactions related to the integration of ADVA into the\ncombined group, including realizing synergies. The failure to realize synergies may lead to a decline of the value of Acorn HoldCo shares. At the same time, any\ndisadvantageous corporate actions under a DPLTA may result in a decline in the business and earnings power of ADVA, and could also adversely affect the market\nvalue of the remaining ADVA shares.\nThe combined group may experience a loss of customers or may fail to win new customers in certain countries.\nFollowing the Business Combination, third parties with whom ADTRAN or ADVA currently have relationships with may terminate or otherwise reduce the scope\nof their relationship with either party in anticipation or after the completion of the Business Combination. In addition, the combined group may face difficulties to\nacquire new customers in certain countries. Any such loss of business or the inability to win new customers could limit the combined group’s ability to achieve the\nanticipated benefits of the Business Combination. Such risks could also be exacerbated by a delay in the settlement of the exchange offer and the Business\nCombination.\nADTRAN, ADVA or the combined group may be unable to retain and motivate their respective personnel successfully while the Business Combination is\npending or following the completion of the Business Combination.\nThe success of the Business Combination will depend, in part, on the combined group’s ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees, including key\ndecision-makers, currently employed by ADTRAN and ADVA. Such employees may decide not to remain with ADTRAN and ADVA, as applicable, while the\nBusiness Combination is pending or with the combined group after the Business Combination is completed. If key employees terminate their employment, or if an\ninsufficient number of employees are retained to maintain effective operations, the combined group’s business activities may be adversely affected and\nmanagement’s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating ADTRAN and ADVA to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause Acorn\nHoldCo’s business to deteriorate. ADTRAN and ADVA may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company or offer\nemployment to potential replacements on reasonable terms. In addition, Acorn HoldCo, ADTRAN and ADVA may not be able to motivate certain key employees\nfollowing the completion of the Business Combination due to organizational changes, reassignments of responsibilities, the perceived lack of appropriate\nopportunities for advancement or other reasons. If the combined group fails to successfully retain and motivate the employees of ADTRAN and/or ADVA, relevant\ncapabilities and expertise may be lost which may have an adverse effect on the cash flows, the financial condition and results of operations and the successful\nbusiness operations of the combined group, ADTRAN and ADVA in general.\n25\nRisks related to our financial results and Company success\nOur revenue for a particular period can be difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.\nAs a result of the many factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict and will fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nTypically, our customers request product delivery within a short period following our receipt of an order. Consequently, we do not typically carry a significant\norder backlog and are dependent upon obtaining orders and completing delivery in accordance with shipping terms that are predominantly within each quarter to\nachieve our targeted revenue. Supply of semiconductor chips and other components of our products has become constrained resulting in extended lead times and\nincreased costs. Transportation constraints, including shortages for both air and surface freight, as well as labor shortages in the transportation industry, have also\naffected the timing and the cost of obtaining raw materials and production supplies. As a result, our gross margin percentage declined in the second half of 2021. If\nsupply chain constraints and transportation constraints continue, it could cause our net revenue and gross profit to decline or to grow at a slower rate than in\nprevious quarters. Our deployment/installation cycle can also vary depending on the customer’s schedule, site readiness, network size and complexity and other\nfactors, which can cause our revenue to fluctuate from period to period. Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be affected if the variable revenue\npatterns seen in prior quarters recur in future quarters. We have experienced periods of time during which manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading to\nvariable shipping patterns. In addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages continue to result in delayed shipments in the\nfuture, and particularly in quarters in which we and our subcontractors are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be\nadversely affected, and we may not be able to remediate the conditions within the same quarter. Currently, our revenue growth and profitability in the near-term are\nbeing impacted by supply chain constraint issues. While we are working closely with our suppliers and customers to address the near-term supply chain challenges\nfacing the industry and believe these challenges are peaking and will begin to normalize by mid-2022, there can be no assurance this will be the case.\nIn the past, under certain market conditions, long manufacturing lead times have caused our customers to place the same order multiple times. When multiple\nordering occurs, along with other factors, it may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and, as a result, could impair our ability to manage inventory effectively.\nWe plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed\nin the short term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed\nexpenses in response to short-term business changes.\nThe lengthy sales and approval process required by service providers for new products could result in fluctuations in our revenue.\nIn the industry in which we compete, sales and approval cycles are often lengthy. Selling efforts often involve a significant commitment of time and resources by\nus and our customers that may include extensive product testing, laboratory or network certification, or region-specific product certification and homologation\nrequirements for deployment in networks. Additionally, a supplier must first obtain product approval from a major or other service provider to sell its products to\nthese service providers. This process can last from six to eighteen months, or longer, depending on the technology, the service provider and the demand for the\nproduct from the service provider’s subscribers. Consequently, we are involved in a constant process of submitting for approval succeeding generations of\nproducts, as well as products that deploy new technology or respond to new technology demands from a major or other service provider. We have been successful\nin the past in obtaining these approvals; however, we cannot be certain that we will obtain these approvals in the future or that sales of these products will continue\nto occur. Any attempt by a major or other service provider to seek out additional or alternative suppliers, or to undertake, as permitted under applicable regulations,\nthe production of these products internally, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Furthermore, the delay in sales until the completion of the\napproval process, the length of which is difficult to predict, could result in fluctuations of revenue and uneven operating results from quarter to quarter or year to\nyear. Further, once customer approval or certifications are met, our supply chain customers typically do not guarantee us a minimum, or any, volume of sales. We\nare dependent on individual purchase orders as discussed elsewhere in this report.\nWe depend heavily on sales to certain customers; the loss of any of these customers would significantly reduce our revenue and net income.\nHistorically, a large percentage of our revenue have been made to major service providers and larger independent communications companies. In 2021, these\ncustomers continued to comprise over half of our revenue. As long as the major and larger independent communications companies represent such a substantial\npercentage of our total revenue, our future success will significantly depend upon certain factors which are not within our control, including:\n•the timing and size of future purchase orders, if any, from these customers;\n•changes in strategic plans and capital budgets of these customers;\n•the product requirements of these customers;\n•the subscriber take rate, including subscriber loss or churn, of our customers;\n•the financial and operational success of these customers;\n26\n•the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on these customers;\n•consolidation, acquisition of, or corporate reorganization among these customers;\n•the success of these customers' services deployed using our products; and\n•the impact of work stoppages at these customers.\nIn the past, revenue to our large customers have fluctuated, and may fluctuate in the future, significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. The loss of, or a\nsignificant reduction or delay in, revenue to any such customer or the occurrence of revenue fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and\nresults of operations. Further, any attempt by a major or other service provider to seek out additional or alternative suppliers or to undertake, as permitted under\napplicable regulations, the production of these products internally, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold\ntheir market positions or are unable to continue operations. This could lead to variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operating results, financial condition and cash flow. In addition, particularly in the service provider market, rapid consolidation will lead to fewer\ncustomers, with the effect that a loss of a major customer could have a material impact on our results that we would not have anticipated in a marketplace\ncomposed of more numerous participants.\nOur exposure to the credit risks of our customers and distributors may make it difficult to collect accounts receivable and could adversely affect our operating\nresults, financial condition and cash flows.\nMost of our revenue is made on an open credit basis, generally with payment terms of 30 days in the U.S. and typically longer in many geographic markets outside\nthe U.S. As our international revenue grows, our total accounts receivable balance will likely increase. Our DSO could also increase as a result of a greater mix of\ninternational revenue. Additionally, international laws may not provide the same degree of protection against defaults on accounts receivable as provided under\nU.S. laws governing domestic transactions; therefore, as our international business grows, we may be subject to higher bad debt expense compared to historical\ntrends. Overall, we monitor individual customer and distributor payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to\namounts that we believe customers and distributors can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for credit losses and other\nmacroeconomic indicators. In the course of our sales to customers and distributors, we may encounter difficulty collecting accounts receivable and could be\nexposed to risks associated with uncollectible accounts receivable due to various reasons, including potential declining operating cash flows or bankruptcy filings.\nWhile we attempt to monitor these situations carefully and attempt to take appropriate measures to collect accounts receivable balances, there are no assurances we\ncan avoid write-downs and/or write-offs of accounts receivable as a result of declining financial conditions for our customers, including bankruptcy. Such write-\ndowns or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur and could potentially have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe expect gross margins to vary over time, and our levels of product and services gross margins may not be sustainable.\nOur level of gross margins may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected by numerous factors, including:\n•changes in customer, geographic or product or services mix, including software and the mix of configurations and professional services revenue within\neach product segment;\n•mix of domestic versus international revenue;\n•introduction of new products by competitors, including products with price-performance advantages;\n•our ability to reduce product cost;\n•increases in labor or material cost, including increases in material costs resulting from tariffs;\n•foreign currency exchange rate movements;\n•expediting costs incurred to meet customer delivery requirements;\n•excess inventory and inventory holding charges;\n•excess and obsolescence charges;\n•changes in shipment volume;\n•our ability to absorb fixed manufacturing costs during short-term fluctuations in customer demand;\n•loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate\nproduct demand;\n•lower than expected benefits from value engineering;\n27\n•increased price competition, including competitors from Asia, specifically China;\n•changes in distribution channels;\n•increased warranty cost;\n•liquidated damages costs relating to customer contractual terms; and\n•our ability to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations relating to our revenue or cost of revenue.\nOur dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products, combined with supply shortages, have\nprevented and may continue to prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on\noperating results and could have a material adverse effect on customer relations.\nCertain raw materials and key components used in our products are currently available from only one source, and others are available from only a limited number\nof sources. The availability of these raw materials and supplies may be subject to market forces beyond our control, such as merger and acquisition activity of our\nsuppliers and consolidation in some segments of our supplier base. From time to time, there may not be sufficient quantities of raw materials and supplies in the\nmarketplace to meet customer demand. For example, wafer foundries that support chipmakers have not invested enough in recent years to increase capacities to the\nlevels need to support demand from all of their customers and wafers have a long lead time for production, in some cases up to 30 weeks, which has led to a recent\nshortage in chip supplies. Many companies utilize the same raw materials and supplies that we do in the production of their products. Companies with more\nresources than our own may have a competitive advantage in obtaining raw materials and supplies due to greater buying power. These factors have resulted in\nreduced supply, higher prices of raw materials and delays in the receipt of certain of our key components, which in turn has generated increased costs, lower\nmargins and delays in product delivery, with a corresponding adverse effect on revenue. Delays in product deliveries and corresponding product price increases\nmay likewise have an adverse effect on customer relationships. We attempt to manage these risks through developing alternative sources, by staging inventories at\nstrategic locations, through engineering efforts designed to obviate the necessity of certain components and by building long-term relationships and close contact\nwith each of our key suppliers; however, we cannot assure that delays in or failures of deliveries of key components, either to us or to our contract manufacturers,\nand consequent delays in product deliveries, will not continue to occur in the future. For a discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our supply\nchain, see “- The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, particularly\nour supply chain and workforce.”\nWe compete in markets that have become increasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and market share.\nThe markets for our products are intensely competitive. New manufacturers have entered the markets in recent years to offer products in competition with us.\nAdditionally, certain companies have, in recent years, developed the ability to deliver competing products using coaxial cable and cellular transmission, especially\nin high-density metropolitan areas. Competition will further increase if new companies enter the market or existing competitors expand their product lines. Some of\nthese potential competitors may have greater financial, technological, manufacturing, sales and marketing, and personnel resources. As a result, these competitors\nmay be able to respond more rapidly or effectively to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, withstand significant price decreases,\nor devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products.\nIn addition, our present and future competitors may be able to enter our existing or future markets with products or technologies comparable or superior to those\nthat we offer. An increase in competition could cause us to reduce prices, decrease our market share, require increased spending by us on product development and\nsales and marketing, or cause delays or cancellations in customer orders, any one of which could reduce our gross profit margins and adversely affect our business\nand results of operations.\nOur estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, installation and shipment volumes, field service repair\nobligations and other rework costs incurred in correcting product failures. If our estimates change, our liability for warranty obligations may increase or\ndecrease, impacting future cost of revenue.\nOur products are highly complex, and we cannot ensure that our extensive product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect\nall defects, errors, failures and quality issues. Quality or performance problems for products covered under warranty could adversely impact our reputation and\nnegatively affect our operating results, financial position and cash flows. The development and production of new products with high complexity often involves\nproblems with software, components and manufacturing methods. If significant warranty obligations arise due to reliability or quality issues arising from defects in\nsoftware, faulty components or manufacturing methods, our operating results, financial position and cash flows could be negatively impacted by:\n•costs associated with fixing software or hardware defects;\n•costs associated with internal or third-party installation errors;\n•high service and warranty expenses;\n•costs associated with recalling and replacing products with software or hardware defects, including costs from writing-off\n28\ndefective products recalled;\n•high inventory obsolescence expense;\n•delays in collecting accounts receivable;\n•payment of liquidated damages for performance failures;\n•extended performance bond expenses; and\n•a decline in revenue to existing customers.\nManaging our inventory is complex and may include write-downs of excess or obsolete inventory.\nManaging our inventory of components and finished products is complicated by a number of factors, including the need to maintain a significant inventory of\ncertain components that are in short supply, that have been discontinued by the component manufacturer, that must be purchased in bulk to obtain favorable pricing\nor that require long lead times. These issues may result in our purchasing and maintaining significant amounts of inventory, which if not used or expected to be\nused based on anticipated production requirements, may become excess or obsolete. Any excess or obsolete inventory could also result in sales price reductions\nand/or inventory write- downs, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe continuing growth of our international operations could expose us to additional risks, increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results,\nfinancial condition and cash flows.\nWe are expanding our presence in international markets, which represented 33.5% and 30.5% of our net revenue for 2021 and for 2020, respectively, and as a\nresult, we anticipate increased revenue and operating costs in these markets. This international expansion has increased and may continue to increase our\noperational risks and impact our results of operations, including:\n•exposure to unfavorable commercial terms in certain countries;\n•the time and cost to staff and manage foreign operations, including the time and cost to maintain good relationships with employee associations and work\ncouncils;\n•exposure to unfavorable commercial terms in certain countries;\n•the time and cost to ensure adequate business interruption controls, processes and facilities;\n•the time and cost to manage and evolve financial reporting systems, maintain effective financial disclosure controls and procedures, and comply with\ncorporate governance requirements in multiple jurisdictions;\n•the cost to collect accounts receivable and extension of collection periods;\n•the cost and potential disruption of facilities transitions required in some business acquisitions;\n•risks as a result of less regulation of patents or other safeguards of intellectual property in certain countries;\n•the potential impact of adverse tax, customs regulations and transfer-pricing issues;\n•exposure to increased price competition from additional competitors in some countries;\n•exposure to global social, political and economic instability, changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rate movements;\n•potential exposure to liability or damage of reputation resulting from a higher incidence of corruption or unethical business practices in some countries;\n•potential regulations on data protection, regarding the collection, use, disclosure and security of data;\n•potential trade protection measures, export compliance issues, domestic preference procurement requirements, qualification to transact business and\nadditional regulatory requirements;\n•potential exposure to natural disasters, epidemics and pandemics (and government regulations in response thereto) and acts of war or terrorism; and\n•potential exposure to escalating tensions along the Russia-Ukraine border. The U.S. and certain other countries imposed sanctions on Russia and could\nimpose further sanctions against it, which could damage or disrupt international commerce and the global economy.\nIf we are unable to successfully address the potential risks associated with our overall international expansion, our operating results, financial condition and cash\nflows may be negatively impacted.\n29\nIf we are unable to integrate future acquisitions successfully, it could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may make acquisitions to improve or expand our product offerings, customer base, talent or intellectual property. Our current and future acquisition strategy\nwill depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate acquisitions. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:\n•difficulties integrating and managing the operations, technologies and products of the companies we acquire;\n•our inability to maintain the key business relationships and the brand equity of businesses we acquire;\n•our inability to retain key personnel of the acquired business; and\n•our responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire, some of which we may not anticipate, including costs of third-party advisors to resolve\ndisputes.\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining key personnel.\nOur business has grown significantly since its inception. Our success is dependent in large part on the continued employment of our executive officers, including\nThomas R. Stanton, our Chief Executive Officer, and other key management personnel. The unplanned departure of one or more of these individuals could\nadversely affect our business. In addition, for ADTRAN to continue as a successful entity we must also be able to attract and retain key engineers and software\ndevelopers and architects whose expertise helps us maintain competitive advantages. We believe that our future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability\nto continue to attract, retain, train and motivate highly-skilled employees who are in great demand. Stock awards are designed to reward employees for their long-\nterm contributions and to provide incentives for them to remain with us. Changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, may\nadversely affect our ability to retain key employees. Properly managing our continued growth, avoiding the problems often resulting from such growth and\nexpansion and continuing to operate in the manner which has proven successful to us to date will be critical to the future success of our business.\nIf we fail to manage our exposure to worldwide financial and securities markets successfully, our operating results and financial statements could be\nmaterially impacted.\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and prices of marketable equity and fixed-income securities. The global\nmacroeconomic environment has been challenging and inconsistent due to uncertainty in the global central bank monetary policy and uncertainty in global credit\nmarkets and the geopolitical environment in many areas of the world. The primary objective of the majority of our investment activities is to preserve principal\nwhile at the same time achieving appropriate yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, a majority of our marketable securities are\ninvestment grade corporate and municipal fixed-rate bonds, U.S. government bonds and municipal money market instruments denominated in U.S. dollars. While\nwe do invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equities, which are subject to market risks, including the loss of principal, our equity investments are generally\ninvested in professionally-managed portfolios with the objective of exceeding the performance of their underlying benchmarks.\nWe have significant investments in corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, U.S. government bonds and\nforeign government bonds. Through December 31, 2021, we have not been required to impair any of these investments; however, we may experience a reduction in\nvalue or loss of liquidity in these investments, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Fixed-rate interest\nsecurities may have their fair value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while variable-rate securities may produce less income than expected if\ninterest rates fall. Our investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may increase because of conditions in the financial\nmarkets and related credit liquidity issues. Consequently, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates, or we may\nsuffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in fair value due to changes in interest rates.\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Part II, Item 7 of this report,\n“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of this report and Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in\nPart II, Item 8 of this report for more information about our investments.\nThe elimination of LIBOR after June 2023 may affect our financial results.\nAll LIBOR tenors, which are relevant to the Company will cease to be published or will no longer be representative after June 30, 2023, and therefore, any of our\nLIBOR-based borrowings that extend beyond June 30, 2023 will need to be converted to a replacement rate. U.S. bank regulators advised banks to cease writing,\nsubject to certain limited exceptions, new U.S. Dollar LIBOR contracts by the end of 2021 and the Alternative Reference Rates Committee has recommended\nSOFR plus a recommended spread adjustment as LIBOR’s replacement. There are significant differences between LIBOR and SOFR, such as LIBOR being an\nunsecured lending rate while SOFR is a secured lending rate, and SOFR is an overnight rate while LIBOR reflects term rates at different maturities. If our LIBOR-\nbased\n30\nborrowings are converted to SOFR, the differences between LIBOR and SOFR, plus the recommended spread adjustment, could result in interest costs that are\nhigher than if LIBOR remained available, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Although SOFR is the ARRC's recommended\nreplacement rate, it is also possible that lenders may instead choose alternative replacement rates that may differ from LIBOR in ways similar to SOFR or in other\nways that would result in higher interest costs for us. It is not yet possible to predict the magnitude of LIBOR's end on our borrowing costs given the remaining\nuncertainty about which rates will replace LIBOR. As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any borrowing agreements that will be outstanding after\nthe LIBOR cessation date.\nThere are risks associated with our revolving credit agreement and future indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had a revolving credit agreement that provides a $10.0 million secured credit facility. As of December 31, 2021 the Company did not\nhave any outstanding draws under the revolving credit facility.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to satisfy any indebtedness that could be under the credit agreement. Our ability to satisfy debt\nobligations and renew our credit agreement is dependent upon our future performance and other factors discussed in this section. However, there can be no\nassurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.\nRisks related to COVID-19\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, particularly our\nsupply chain and workforce.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of COVID-19\ndisrupted economic activity, resulting in reduced commercial and consumer confidence and spending, increased unemployment, closure or restricted operating\nconditions for businesses, volatility in the global capital markets, instability in the credit and financial markets, labor shortages, regulatory relief for impacted\nconsumers and disruption in supply chains. While the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines throughout 2021 mitigated mortality risk, new COVID-19 variants,\nparticularly the Delta and Omicron variants, proved to remain a threat. The lifting of lockdowns in certain areas started a slow economic recovery. The resulting\nincrease in consumer demand has created significant challenges for supply chains as a result of labor and raw material shortages, which could lead to reduced\nearnings for many industries.\nIn addition, due to the ongoing pandemic and global semiconductor chip shortage, we have experienced disruption and delays in our supply chain and significant\nprice increases with certain of our manufacturing partners, and those disruptions, delays and price increases may continue. For example, in the second half of 2021,\nour results of operations were negatively impacted by increased expenses resulting from supply chain disruptions. There are also restrictions and delays on\nlogistics, such as air cargo carriers, as well as increased logistics costs due to limited capacity and high demands for freight forwarders. Although we continue to\nwork with our supply chain and dual source partners to take the necessary steps to resolve these disruptions, there can be no assurance that the ongoing disruptions\ndue to COVID-19, the related global semiconductor chip shortage or other supply chain constraints or price increases will be resolved in the near term, which could\ncontinue to result in longer lead times, inventory supply challenges and further increased costs, all of which could continue to adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nAlthough vaccines have been approved and are being distributed, it cannot be predicted how long it will take before market conditions return to normal and there\ncan be no assurance that the economic recovery will occur or offset the uncertainty and instability triggered by the pandemic. Additionally, as vaccinations become\nreadily available, we cannot predict what restrictions may be imposed in the event of vaccine mandates for travel to and from particular destinations. New and\npotentially more contagious variants of the COVID-19 virus are developing in several countries, including regions in which we have significant operations. The\nCOVID-19 variants could further amplify the impact of the pandemic.\nTo support the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and communities, many of our employees are working remotely as of the date of filing\nthis report. However, there is risk that a number of our employees could be infected with COVID-19, including our key personnel. In addition, actions that have\nbeen taken and that may be taken by the Company, its customers, suppliers and counterparties in response to the pandemic, including the implementation of\nalternative work arrangements for certain employees, as well as the impacts to our supply chain, including delays in supply chain deliveries and the related global\nsemiconductor chip shortage, have delayed and may continue to delay the timing of some orders and expected deliveries. The disruptions to our operations caused\nby COVID-19, the related global semiconductor chip shortage and actions by other parties have resulted in and may continue to result in inefficiencies and\nadditional costs in our product development, sales, marketing and customer service efforts that we cannot fully mitigate. These additional costs may be partially\noffset by reduced travel expenses as a result of travel restrictions that we have in place, as well as lower marketing-related costs.\nWe will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business.\n31\nRisks related to our control environment\nWe are currently in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) software solution. If we do not effectively implement this project,\nor any future associated updates, our operations could be significantly disrupted.\nWe are currently in the process of implementing a new ERP software solution. This project requires us to migrate and reconfigure all of our current system\nprocesses, transactions, data and controls to a new cloud-based platform and is expected to have a significant impact on our business processes, financial reporting,\ninformation systems and internal controls. This has required, and will continue to require, significant change management, meaningful investment in capital and\npersonnel resources and coordination of numerous software and system providers and internal business teams. We may experience difficulties, including delays\nand higher than anticipated costs related to personnel and capital resources, as we manage these changes and transition to this new ERP solution, including loss or\ncorruption of data, delayed shipments, delayed financial reporting, decreases in productivity as our personnel implement and become familiar with the new systems\nand processes, unanticipated expenses (including increased costs of implementation, costs of conducting business or the potential impairment of previously\ncapitalized ERP implementation costs) and lost revenue. Once implemented, we will have cloud driven quarterly updates. Although we will conduct design\nvalidations and user testing, these may cause delays in transacting our business due to system challenges, limitations in functionality, inadequate change\nmanagement or process deficiencies in the production and use of the system. Difficulties in implementing or inability to implement this new ERP solution or the\nrelated quarterly updates could disrupt our operations, divert management’s attention from key strategic initiatives and have an adverse effect on our results of\noperations, financial condition and cash flows.\nBreaches of our information systems and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property and cause significant damage to our business and\nreputation.\nWe maintain sensitive data on our information systems and the networks of third-party providers, including intellectual property, financial data and proprietary or\nconfidential business information relating to our business, customers, suppliers and business partners. We also produce networking equipment solutions and\nsoftware used by network operators to ensure security and reliability in their management and transmission of data. Our customers, particularly those in regulated\nindustries, are increasingly focused on the security features of our technology solutions. Maintaining the security of information sensitive to us and our business\npartners is critical to our business and reputation. We rely upon several internal business processes and information systems to support key operations and financial\nfunctions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical. Companies are increasingly subjected to cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain\nunauthorized access. We have a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity, which includes prevention, detection, containment and response. Our layered defense\napproach encompasses proactive security monitoring of our global infrastructure by both internal solutions and multiple third-party Security Operation Centers.\nAdditionally, we routinely perform patch management, vulnerability scans, penetration tests and continuous monitoring across our entire enterprise. Our security\npolicy framework includes meaningful and enforceable Information Security policies and procedures. The cybersecurity program is aligned with our mission and\nbusiness objectives, reviewed periodically for improvements and is supported by experienced and certified security professionals. This is supplemented by an\ninformation security awareness program spanning our global workforce. Despite this, our network and storage applications and those systems and applications\nmaintained by our third-party providers may be targeted by cyber-attacks or potentially breached due to operator error, fraudulent activity or other system\ndisruptions. For example, although no indicators of compromise were identified by the Company in response to the Log4j2.x vulnerability, we cannot absolutely\nassure that future vulnerabilities or malware attacks will not be successful in breaching our system and in turn, have a material impact to the Company.\nUnauthorized access or disclosure of our information could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. Our information\nsystems are designed to appropriate industry standards and resiliently engineered to reduce downtime in the event of power outages, weather or climate events and\ncybersecurity issues. The Company carries cybersecurity insurance policies meant to limit its risk and exposure should one of these cybersecurity issues occur.\nHowever, a significant failure of our systems due to these issues could result in significant remediation costs, disrupt business operations and divert management\nattention, which could result in harm to our business reputation, operating results, financial condition and cash flow.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting we could have a material weakness in those internal controls, that if not\nremediated, could materially adversely affect us.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”) requires us to include in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K an assessment by the Company’s\nmanagement of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a report from our independent registered public accounting firm on the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial\nreporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting,\nas required by Section 404. Our compliance with Section 404 may require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts.\nIn addition, if management or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective,\nwe could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price or lead to\nlitigation claims.\n32\nRisks related to the telecommunications industry\nWe must continue to update and improve our products and develop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications\ntechnology.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and continuing improvements in the communications\nservice offerings of service providers. If technologies or standards applicable to our products, or service provider offerings based on our products, become obsolete\nor fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our existing products or products under development may become obsolete or unmarketable. Moreover, the\nintroduction of products embodying new technologies, the emergence of new industry standards, or changes in service provider offerings could adversely affect our\nability to sell our products. For instance, we offer a large number of products that apply primarily to the delivery of high-speed digital communications over the\nlocal loop utilizing copper wire. We compete favorably with our competitors by developing a high-performance line of these products. We market products that\napply to fiber optic transport in the local loop. We expect, however, that use of coaxial cable and fixed and mobile wireless access in place of local loop access will\nincrease. Also, MSOs are increasing their presence in the local loop. To meet the requirements of these new delivery systems and to maintain our market position,\nwe expect to continue to develop new products and/or modify existing products. We expect that the addition of fiber-based products focused on the cable MSO\noperators, using EPON and fixed wireless access solutions will better position us to benefit from spending in these adjacent markets.\nOur revenue and profitability in the past have, to a significant extent, resulted from our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards and service\nprovider offerings, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products. Our continued ability to adapt will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving\nour competitive position and our prospects for growth. We cannot assure that we will be able to respond effectively to changes in technology, industry standards,\nservice provider offerings or new product announcements by our competitors. We also cannot assure that we will be able to successfully develop and market new\nproducts or product enhancements, or that these products or enhancements will achieve market acceptance. Any failure by us to continue to anticipate or respond in\na cost-effective and timely manner to changes in technology, industry standards, service provider offerings or new product announcements by our competitors, or\nany significant delays in product development or introduction, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to competitively market our products and on our\nrevenue, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable environmental regulations could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe manufacture, assembly and testing of our products may require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to environmental, health and safety regulations.\nOur failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with any of these applicable requirements could result in regulatory penalties, legal claims or\ndisruption of production. In addition, our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to properly manage the use, transportation, emission, discharge,\nstorage, recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could subject us to increased costs or liabilities. Existing and future environmental regulations may restrict our\nuse of certain materials to manufacture, assemble and test products. Any of these consequences could adversely impact our results of operations by increasing our\nexpenses and/or requiring us to alter our manufacturing processes.\nIf our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks, installations may be delayed or canceled, which could harm our business.\nOur products must interface with existing networks, each of which may have different specifications, utilize multiple protocol standards and incorporate products\nfrom other vendors. Many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and\nevolved. Our products may be required to interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks, as well as future products to meet our customers’\nrequirements. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks, we may have to modify our software or\nhardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate with the existing software and hardware. Implementation of product corrections\ninvolving interoperability issues could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations. Such issues may affect our ability to obtain product\nacceptance from other customers.\nWe engage in research and development activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application of developed technologies, and as a\nconsequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially greater research and development efforts and which may\nfocus on more leading edge development.\nA portion of our research and development activities are focused on the continued innovation of currently accepted access technologies in order to deliver faster\ninternet speeds, more capacity, better quality of service and operational efficiency. These research and development efforts result in improved applications of\ntechnologies for which demand already exists or is latent. We also focus our research and development efforts on developing software, solutions and platforms that\nenable service providers to increase revenue-generating service velocity, reducing operational costs, increasing scale and providing service agility. We rarely\nengage in research projects that represent a vast departure from the current business practices of our key customers. While we believe our strategy provides a\nhigher likelihood of producing nearer term or more sustainable revenue streams, this strategy could result in lost revenue opportunities\n33\nand higher operating expenses should a new technology achieve rapid and widespread market acceptance. When we do engage in research and development\nactivities for new, leading-edge technologies and market approaches, there is no guarantee that those technologies or market approaches will be successful or that\nthey will be adopted and purchased by our customers.\nOur strategy of outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing requirements to subcontractors located in various international regions may result in us not\nmeeting our cost, quality or performance standards.\nWe are heavily dependent on subcontractors for the assembly and testing of certain printed circuit board assemblies, subassemblies, chassis, enclosures and\nequipment shelves, and the purchase of some raw materials used in such assemblies. This reliance involves several risks, including the unavailability of, or\ninterruptions in, access to certain process technologies and reduced control over product quality, delivery schedules, transportation, manufacturing yields and costs.\nWe may not be able to provide product order volumes to our subcontractors that are high enough to achieve sufficient cost savings. If shipments fall below\nforecasted levels, we may incur increased costs or be required to take ownership of excess inventory. Changes in international tariff structures could adversely\nimpact our product costs. In addition, a significant component of maintaining cost competitiveness is the ability of our subcontractors to adjust their costs to\ncompensate for possible adverse exchange rate movements. To the extent that the subcontractors are unable to do so, and we are unable to procure alternative\nproduct supplies, then our competitiveness and results of operations could be adversely impaired. These risks may be exacerbated by economic, regulatory or\npolitical changes or uncertainties, terrorist actions, acts of war, the effects of climate change, natural disasters or pandemics in the foreign countries in which our\nsubcontractors are located. We do not utilize contract manufacturing for our products in China, though we do source some ODM products from China which are, or\nmay become, subject to import tariffs.\nTo date, we believe that we have successfully managed the risks of our dependence on these subcontractors through a variety of efforts, which include seeking and\ndeveloping alternative subcontractors while maintaining existing relationships; however, we cannot be assured that delays in product deliveries will not occur in the\nfuture because of shortages resulting from this limited number of subcontractors or from the financial or other difficulties of these parties. Our inability to develop\nalternative subcontractors if and as required in the future, or the need to undertake required retraining and other activities related to establishing and developing a\nnew subcontractor relationship, could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which, in turn, could have a negative effect on our customer relationships\nand operating results.\nOur failure to maintain rights to intellectual property used in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality and commercial value of our\nproducts.\nOur future success depends in part upon our proprietary technology. Although we attempt to protect our proprietary technology by contract, trademark, copyright\nand patent registration and internal security, including trade secret protection, these protections may not be adequate. Furthermore, our competitors can develop\nsimilar technology independently without violating our proprietary rights. From time to time, we receive and may continue to receive notices of claims alleging\nthat we are infringing upon patents or other intellectual property. Any of these claims, whether with or without merit, could result in significant legal fees, divert\nour management’s time, attention and resources, delay our product shipments or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. We cannot predict whether\nwe will prevail in any claims or litigation over alleged infringements, or whether we will be able to license any valid and infringed patents, or other intellectual\nproperty, on commercially reasonable terms. If a claim of intellectual property infringement against us is successful and we fail to obtain a license or develop or\nlicense non-infringing technology, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be affected adversely.\nSoftware under license from third parties for use in certain of our products may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe integrate third-party software into certain of our products. Licenses for this technology may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially\nreasonable terms. Difficulties with third-party technology licensors could result in the termination of such licenses, which may result in increased costs or require\nus to purchase or develop a substitute technology. Difficulty obtaining and maintaining third-party technology licenses may disrupt the development of our\nproducts and increase our costs, which could harm our business.\nOur use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products.\nSeveral of our solutions utilize elements of open source or publicly available software. Although we closely monitor our use of open source software, the terms of\nmany open source software licenses have not been interpreted by the courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose\nunanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to sell our products. In such event, we could be required to make our proprietary software generally available\nto third parties, including competitors, at no cost, to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to\ndiscontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or at all, any of which could adversely affect our revenue\nand operating expenses.\n34\nWe may incur liabilities or become subject to litigation that would have a material effect on our business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we accept purchase orders, and enter into sales and other related contracts, for the marketing, sale, manufacture, distribution or\nuse of our products and services. We may incur liabilities relating to our performance under such agreements, or which result from damage claims arising from\ncertain events as outlined within the particular contract. While we attempt to include reasonable limitations of liability and other protective measures to all\nagreements, such agreements may not always contain, or be subject to, maximum loss clauses and liabilities arising from them may result in significant adverse\nchanges to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including employment disputes, patent claims, disputes over contract\nagreements and other commercial disputes. In some cases, claimants seek monetary recovery, or other relief, including damages such as royalty payments related to\npatents, lost profits or injunctive relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. Any such disputes may be resolved before trial, or if tried, may be\nresolved in our favor; however, the cost of claims sustained in litigation, and costs associated with the litigation process, may not be covered by our insurance.\nSuch costs, and the demands on management time during such an event, could harm our business, reputation and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity,\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and maintain relationships with SIs, service providers and enterprise VARs, our revenue may be negatively affected.\nAs part of our sales strategy, we are targeting SIs, service providers and enterprise VARs. In addition to specialized technical expertise, SIs, service providers and\nVARs typically offer sophisticated service capabilities that are frequently desired by enterprise customers. To expand our distribution channel to include resellers\nwith such capabilities, we must be able to provide effective support to these resellers. If our sales, marketing or service capabilities are not sufficient to provide\neffective support to such SIs, service providers and VARs, our revenue may be negatively affected, and current SI, service provider and VAR partners may\nterminate their relationships with us, which would adversely impact our revenue and overall results of operations.\nRisks related to the Company’s stock price\nOur operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price.\nOur operating results have been, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors. These factors include, but are\nnot limited to:\n•fluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially with respect to significant network expansion projects undertaken by service providers;\n•continued growth of communications network traffic and the adoption of communication services and applications by enterprise and consumer end users;\n•changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers’ spending plans and associated revenue, especially\nshould a slowdown in communications industry spending occur due to economic downturns, tight capital markets, or declining liquidity trends;\n•reductions in demand for our traditional products as new technologies gain acceptance;\n•our ability, and that of our distributors, to maintain appropriate inventory levels and related purchase commitments;\n•price and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change rapidly due to technological innovation;\n•the overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers;\n•our dependence on sales of our products by channel partners, the timing of their replenishment orders, the potential for conflicts and competition involving\nour channel partners and large end-user customers and the potential for consolidation among our channel partners;\n•variations in sales channels, product cost or mix of products and services sold;\n•delays in receiving acceptance, as defined under contract, from certain customers for shipments or services performed near the end of a reporting period;\n•our ability to maintain high levels of product support and professional services;\n•manufacturing and customer order lead times, and potential restrictions in the supply of key components;\n•fluctuations in our gross margin and the factors that contribute to this (as described above);\n35\n•our ability to achieve cost reductions;\n•the ability of our customers, channel partners and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures;\n•our ability to execute on our strategy and operating plans;\n•benefits anticipated from our investments in engineering, sales and marketing activities;\n•the effects of climate change and other natural events;\n•the effect of political or economic conditions, including the effect of tariffs or so-called “trade wars” on us and our supply chain, acts of war, terrorist\nattacks or other unrest in certain international markets;\n•the effect of escalating tensions along the Russia-Ukraine border. The U.S. and certain other countries imposed sanctions on Russia and could impose\nfurther sanctions against it, which could damage or disrupt international commerce and the global economy; and\n•changes in tax laws and regulations or accounting pronouncements.\nAs a result, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future\nperiods. Any of the above-mentioned factors, or other factors discussed elsewhere in this report, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, financial condition and cash flows that could adversely affect our stock price.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ADTN. Since our initial public offering in August 1994, there has been, and\nmay continue to be, significant volatility in the market for our common stock, based on a variety of factors, including factors listed in this section, some of which\nare beyond our control.\n36\nRisks related to the regulatory environments in which we do business\nWe are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and standards governing the conduct of our business. Violations of these laws and\nregulations may harm our business, subject us to penalties and to other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that govern conduct by our Company, our employees and agents and the manufacture, sale and use of our products. Our\ninability to comply with current and evolving laws and regulations governing our business domestically and internationally may adversely affect our revenue,\nresults of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. New and changing laws, regulations and industry practices could require us to modify our business,\nproducts or services offered, potentially in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new products, services and features. If we violate these laws and\nregulations, governmental authorities in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions could seek to impose civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have an\nadverse effect on our reputation, as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThese laws and regulations include, but are not limited to:\n•Various regulations and regional standards established by communications authorities and import/export control authorities that govern the manufacture,\nsale and use of our products. Changes in domestic or international communications regulations, tariffs, potential changes in trade policies by the U.S. and\nother nations, application requirements, import/export controls or expansion of regulation to new areas, including access, communications or commerce\nover the internet, may affect customer demand for our products or slow the adoption of new technologies which may affect our revenue. Further, the cost of\ncomplying with the evolving standards and regulations, including the cost of product re-design if necessary, or the failure to obtain timely domestic or\nforeign regulatory approvals or certification such that we may not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply, may adversely\naffect our revenue, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n•Compliance with a wide variety of provincial, state, national and international laws and regulations applicable to the collection, use, retention, protection,\ndisclosure, transfer and other processing of data, including personal data. Foreign data protection, privacy and other laws and regulations, including GDPR,\nare often more restrictive than those in the U.S. These data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are varied, evolving, can be subject to\nsignificant change, may be augmented or replaced by new or additional laws and regulations and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public\nscrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. For example, California’s Consumer Privacy Act became effective in January 2020 (amended,\neffective January 1, 2023, as the California Privacy Rights Act), providing new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for\ncompanies, and, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a decision that invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework as a\nbasis for transfers of personal data from the EU to the U.S., resulting in uncertainty and potential additional compliance obligations to ensure that a valid\nbasis under the GDPR exists for these data transfers. There is also a risk that we, directly or as the result of a third-party service provider we use, could be\nfound to have failed to comply with the laws and regulations applicable in a jurisdiction regarding the collection, consent, handling, transfer or disposal of\npersonal data.\n•The FCPA, which prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of directing,\nobtaining or keeping business, and requires companies to maintain reasonable books and records and a system of internal accounting controls. The FCPA\napplies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken\nby employees, strategic or local partners or other representatives. Because a significant portion of our total revenue is generated from revenue outside of the\nU.S., we have proactively implemented internally and externally focused measures and controls to address this risk. We help ensure that our employees\nunderstand the key requirements of FCPA compliance and the consequences of non-compliance through training courses and detective controls. ADTRAN\nsenior management and employees whose responsibilities include international activities are required to complete an online training program and pass an\nexam every two years. We have put processes in place to help detect non-compliance through providing our employees access to a worldwide reporting\n“hotline,” available by phone and online, that is maintained by a third-party provider. Finally, we perform annual reviews of our employees’ expense reports\nand corporate credit card activity to identify possible corruption concerns. We have also implemented controls to help ensure our third-party partners and\ncustomers observe FCPA requirements. Prior to selling to new international distributors, resellers or agents, we review third-party data and check them\nagainst over 200 denied party lists from government institutions worldwide for potential FCPA concerns. We also require international distributors, resellers\nand agents to complete an Anti-Corruption Due Diligence Questionnaire, which is reviewed and assessed by a cross-functional compliance committee and\nour export-compliance function.\n37\n•Environmental, health and safety regulation governing the manufacture, assembly and testing of our products, including without limitation regulations\ngoverning the use of hazardous materials. Our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to properly manage the use, transportation, emission,\ndischarge, storage, recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could subject us to increased costs or liabilities. Existing and future environmental\nregulations may restrict our use of certain materials to manufacture, assemble and test products.\n•Requirements by the SEC governing the disclosure of the use of “conflict minerals” mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining\ncountries and procedures to identify the source of such minerals included in manufactured products. The disclosures will require us to incur additional costs\nto verify the origins of the identified minerals used and comply with disclosure requirements. These requirements could affect the availability of minerals\nused in the manufacture of a limited number of parts contained in our products. This may reduce the number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals\nand may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Our material sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered. While\nwe are taking steps to identify sourcing based on recommended standards for our industry, we may not be able to conclusively verify the origins for all\nminerals used in our products. An inability to make a sourcing determination of minerals in our products could impact our revenue and harm our financial\ncondition should our customers require that we certify that all components used in our products are free of minerals from this region.\nChanges in trade policy in the U.S. and other countries, specifically the U.K. and China, including the imposition of additional tariffs and the resulting\nconsequences, may adversely impact our gross profits, gross margins, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn recent years, international market conditions and the international regulatory environment have been increasingly affected by competition among countries and\ngeopolitical frictions. In particular, the U.S. administration has advocated for and taken steps toward restricting trade in certain goods, particularly from China.\nFrom 2018 to late 2019, the United States announced several tariff increases that applied to products imported from China, totaling over $550 billion. By the end of\n2019, the two countries had reached a phase one trade deal to roll back tariffs and suspend certain tariff increases by the United States that were scheduled to take\neffect from December 2019, and in January 2020, the two sides entered into a formal phase one agreement on trade. The progress of trade talks between China and\nthe United States is subject to uncertainties, and there can be no assurance as to whether the United States will maintain or reduce tariffs or impose additional tariffs\non Chinese products in the near future. Furthermore, in August 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department labelled China as a currency manipulator, which label was\nofficially dropped by the U.S. Treasury Department in January 2020. However, it is uncertain whether the U.S. government may issue any similar announcement in\nthe future. China and other countries have retaliated and may further retaliate in response to new trade policies, treaties and tariffs implemented by the United\nStates. Any potential changes in trade policies in the U.S. and the potential actions of other countries in which we do business could adversely impact our financial\nperformance.\nIn June 2016, the U.K. held a referendum, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” in which the majority of voters elected to withdraw from the EU. The U.K. formally\ndeparted from the EU on January 31, 2020. The U.K. and the EU have signed an EU-U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which became provisionally\napplicable on January 1, 2021 and went into force permanently on May 1, 2021, following formal approval by the U.K. and the EU. The agreement is limited in its\nscope primarily to the trade of goods, transport, energy links and fishing, and uncertainties remain relating to certain aspects of the U.K.'s future economic, trading\nand legal relationships with the EU and with other countries. The actual or potential consequences of Brexit, and the associated uncertainty, could adversely affect\neconomic and market conditions in the U.K., the EU and its member states, and elsewhere, and could contribute to instability in global financial markets.\nThe past two years have been challenging for the credit markets due to a shift from a time of quantitative easing to a time of quantitative tightening by central\nbanks around the world. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or further deteriorate, we may\nexperience material impacts on our business and operating results. We may also be adversely affected in ways that we do not currently anticipate.\nNew or revised tax regulations, changes in our effective tax rate, recognition of a valuation allowance or assessments arising from tax audits may have an\nadverse impact on our results.\n38\nWe are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions, both domestically and internationally, in which we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in the\ndetermination of our provision for income taxes, and this determination requires the interpretation and application of complex and sometimes uncertain tax laws\nand regulations. Our effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by changes in the mix of earnings between jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, in the\nvaluation of our deferred tax assets, and by changes in tax rules and regulations. We continually monitor our deferred tax assets and when it becomes more likely\nthan not that a tax benefit will not be recognized, a valuation allowance is recorded against those assets. In addition, we are subject to examination of our income\ntax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and various other jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes\nresulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous\nexaminations will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Additionally, we continually review the adequacy of\nthe valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets\nwill be recognized. As such, we may release a portion of the valuation allowance or establish a new valuation allowance based on operations in the jurisdictions in\nwhich these assets arose. Management continues to evaluate all evidence including historical operating results, the existence of losses in the most recent year,\nforecasted earnings, future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Should management determine that a valuation allowance is needed in the future due to not\nbeing able to absorb deferred tax assets, it would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n39\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur headquarters and principal administrative, engineering and manufacturing facilities are located on an 82-acre campus in Cummings Research Park in\nHuntsville, Alabama. Two office buildings serve both our Network Solutions and our Services & Support segments. We lease engineering facilities in the U.S. and\nEurope that are used to develop products sold by our Network Solutions segment. In addition, we lease office space in North America, LATAM, EMEA and\nAPAC, providing sales and service support for both of our segments. These cancelable and non-cancelable leases expire at various times through 2025. For more\ninformation, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nWe also have numerous sales and support staff operating from home-based offices serving both our Network Solutions and our Services & Support segments,\nwhich are located within the U.S. and abroad.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nShareholder Derivative Lawsuit\nOn March 31, 2020, a shareholder derivative suit, captioned Johnson (Derivatively on behalf of ADTRAN) v. T. Stanton, M. Foliano, R. Shannon, and Board of\nDirectors, case no. 5:20-cv-00447, was filed in the U.S. District Court of Northern Alabama against two of the Company’s current executive officers, one of its\nformer executive officers and certain current and former members of its Board of Directors. The derivative suit alleges, among other things, that the defendants\nmade or caused the Company to make materially false and misleading statements regarding, and/or failed to disclose material adverse facts about, the Company’s\nbusiness, operations and prospects, specifically relating to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, excess and obsolete inventory reserves,\nfinancial results and demand from certain customers. The case was temporarily stayed pending an order on the defendants’ motion to dismiss in a separate\nsecurities class action case that included similar factual allegations, Burbridge v. ADTRAN, Inc., et al., Case No. 5:20-cv-00050-LCB (N.D. Ala.). The Burbridge\ncase was dismissed on March 31, 2021, and the time to appeal the dismissal has expired, such that the dismissal is now final. Following the dismissal, the plaintiff\nin the shareholder derivative suit sent a demand letter dated June 29, 2021 to ADTRAN’s Board of Directors. The letter contains similar allegations to those made\nin the plaintiff’s filed complaint and in the now dismissed securities class action, and it demands, among other things, that the Board of Directors commence an\ninvestigation into the alleged wrongdoing. On December 10, 2021, after investigating the allegations in the demand with the assistance of independent counsel, the\ndirectors (Mr. Stanton abstaining) concluded that pursuing the claims asserted in the demand would not be in the Company's best interests and exercised their\nbusiness judgment to refuse the demand. Since that time, the parties to the derivative litigation have stipulated that plaintiff will either dismiss his complaint or\nseek to amend it pursuant to a schedule to be ordered by the Court. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of\nloss, if any, associated with the derivative lawsuit or the demand letter.\nOther Legal Matters\nIn addition to the litigation described above, from time to time we are subject to or otherwise involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and legal\nproceedings that arise out of or are incidental to the conduct of our business (collectively, “Legal Matters”), including those relating to employment matters, patent\nrights, regulatory compliance matters, stockholder claims, and contractual and other commercial disputes. Such Legal Matters, even if not meritorious, could result\nin the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Additionally, an unfavorable outcome in a legal matter, including in a patent dispute, could\nrequire the Company to pay damages, entitle claimants to other relief, such as royalties, or could prevent the Company from selling some of its products in certain\njurisdictions. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these legal matters.\nITEM 4.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this\nreport. We have omitted discussion of the earliest of the three years of financial condition and results of operations and this information can be found in Part I,\nItem 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov and on our website at\nwww.adtran.com.\nThis discussion is designed to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements, the changes in certain\nkey items in those financial statements from period to period, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting\nprinciples affect our consolidated financial statements. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” on page 2 of this report for a description\nof important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected results. See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nADTRAN is a leading global provider of networking and communications platforms, systems and services focused on the broadband access market, serving a\ndiverse domestic and international customer base in multiple countries that includes Tier-1, -2 and -3 service providers, alternative service providers, such as\nutilities, municipalities and fiber overbuilders, cable/MSOs, SMBs and distributed enterprises. Our innovative solutions and services enable voice, data, video and\ninternet-communications across a variety of network infrastructures and are currently in use by millions worldwide. We support our customers through our direct\nglobal sales organization and our distribution networks. Our success depends upon our ability to increase unit volume and market share through the introduction of\nnew products and succeeding generations of products having optimal selling prices and increased functionality as compared to both the prior generation of a\nproduct and to the products of competitors in order to gain market share. In order to service our customers and grow revenue, we are continually conducting\nresearch and development of new products addressing customer needs and testing those products for the specific requirements of the particular customers. We are\nfocused on being a top global supplier of access infrastructure and related value-added solutions from the cloud edge to the subscriber edge. We offer a broad\nportfolio of flexible software and hardware network solutions and services that enable service providers to meet today’s service demands, while enabling them to\ntransition to the fully-converged, scalable, highly-automated, cloud-controlled voice, data, internet and video network of the future. In addition to our corporate\nheadquarters in Huntsville, Alabama, we have sales and research and development facilities in strategic global locations.\nWe ended 2021 with a year-over-year revenue increase of 11.2%, driven by increased shipments to a diverse mix of global Tier-1 and regional service providers.\nDuring 2021, we had one 10% revenue customer which was a distributor located in the U.S. Our year-over-year domestic revenue increased by 6.4%, driven by\nincreased volume of network termination and Fiber CPE in our Network Solutions segment. Internationally, our revenue increased by 22.0% compared to the prior\nyear period, primarily driven by increased shipments to alternative network operators and a Tier-1 operator in Europe. We experienced strong demand for our\nsolutions in the second half of 2021 and achieved significant year-over-year bookings growth. Bookings are defined as orders received for a product or service\nduring a fiscal period that will be delivered or performed sometime in the future and is a forward looking metric that we utilize to help us understand future revenue\ngrowth for the Company. Bookings are generally subject to modification and or cancellation per the terms of the order. A substantial portion of our shipments in\nany fiscal period relates to orders received and shipped within that fiscal period for customers under agreements containing nonbinding purchase commitments.\nOur increase in demand comes from service providers planning to deploy our fiber access platforms, in-home service delivery platforms and SaaS applications. We\nexpect this growth to accelerate. During 2021, we secured several Tier-1 next-generation fiber customers, and previously announced Tier-1 fiber customers\nsignificantly increased their bookings for our fiber access platforms. Although we expect our revenue growth and profitability in the near-term to continue to be\nnegatively impacted by supply chain issues, our outlook continues to strengthen given the record demand for our products and our expectation of an improving\nsupply chain over the long-term.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (or\nvariants of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, including the Delta and Omicron variant) continues to spread throughout the U.S. and the world and has resulted in\nauthorities implementing varying measures to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations\nand shutdowns. While the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines throughout 2021 mitigated mortality risk, new COVID-19 variants proved to remain a threat. The lifting\nof lockdowns in certain areas started a slow economic recovery, but it cannot be predicted how long it will take before market conditions return to normal and there\ncan be no assurance that the economic recovery will offset the uncertainty and instability triggered by the pandemic. New and potentially more contagious variants\nof the COVID-19 virus are developing in several countries, including regions in which we have significant operations. The COVID-19 variants could further\namplify the impact of the pandemic. While we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the COVID-19 global pandemic will have on our results of\noperations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment\nmeasures, our compliance with these measures has impacted our day-to-day operations and could disrupt our business and operations, as well as that of our key\ncustomers, suppliers and other counterparties, for an indefinite period of time.\n44\nWe have experienced a significant impact to our supply chain given COVID-19 and the related global semiconductor chip shortage, including delays in supply\nchain deliveries, extended lead times and shortages of some key components, some raw material cost increases and slowdowns at certain production facilities. We\nhave also had to increase our volume of inventory to ensure supply continuity during the pandemic. In addition, we have experienced significant increases in\nfreight-related costs due to the global shipping crisis. During the second half of 2021, the Company incurred supply chain constraint expenses which lowered our\ngross margins and decreased our profitability. While throughout the pandemic we have seen increased demand in networking requirements and utilization due to\nsocial distancing guidelines issued by governments, as well as COVID-19 related reductions in travel and infrastructure expenses, it is possible that we could\nexperience some slowdown in demand, further supply chain issues and an increased impact from the ongoing semiconductor shortage and shortages of certain other\nkey components as the pandemic continues. If the impacts of this shortage are more severe than we expect, it could result in longer lead times, inventory supply\nchallenges and further increased costs, all of which could result in the deterioration of our results, potentially for a longer period than currently anticipated. To\nsupport the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and communities, many of our employees are working remotely as of the date of filing this\nreport. However, there is risk that a number of our employees could be infected with COVID-19, including our key personnel. In addition, actions that have been\ntaken and that may be taken by the Company, its customers, suppliers and counterparties in response to the pandemic, including the implementation of alternative\nwork arrangements for certain employees, as well as the impacts to our supply chain, including delays in supply chain deliveries and the related global\nsemiconductor chip shortage, have delayed and may continue to delay the timing of some orders and expected deliveries. Lastly, even after the COVID-19\npandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession that has occurred or may occur in the\nfuture as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAmong our customers, we made progress with our fiber, fiber-extension, in-home service delivery platforms and cloud services while also continuing to engage in\nvalue-added service opportunities that we expect will contribute to 2022 revenue and beyond. In addition, we believe that we are at the beginning of a significant\ninvestment cycle for fiber deployment and in-home Wi-Fi connectivity driven by technology advancements and regulatory influences. The transition to next-\ngeneration network architectures is beginning, and we are seeing demand for our next-generation fiber access and connected home solutions. In 2021, FCC RDOF\ngovernment funding programs commenced with our service providers and we believe that we are well positioned in 2022 to receive orders.\nIn addition to classifying our operations into two reportable segments, we report revenue across three categories of products and services – (1) Access &\nAggregation, (2) Subscriber Solutions & Experience and (3) Traditional & Other Products.\nOur Access & Aggregation platforms are used by CSPs to connect their network infrastructure to subscribers. This revenue category includes hardware- and\nsoftware-based products and services that aggregate and/or originate access technologies. ADTRAN solutions within this category include a wide array of modular\nor fixed platforms designed to deliver the best technology and economy based on subscriber density and environmental conditions.\nOur Subscriber Solutions & Experience portfolio is used by service providers to terminate their infrastructure at the customer’s premises while providing an\nimmersive and interactive experience for the subscriber. These solutions include copper and fiber WAN termination, LAN switching, Wi-Fi access, and cloud\nsoftware services, for both residential and business markets.\nOur Traditional & Other Products category generally includes a mix of prior-generation technologies’ products and services, as well as other products and services\nthat do not fit within the other revenue categories.\nOur operating results have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, on a quarterly basis due to several factors, including customer order activity, supply chain\nconstraints, component availability, and backlog. A substantial portion of our shipments in any fiscal period relates to orders received and shipped within that fiscal\nperiod for customers under agreements containing non-binding purchase commitments. Further, a significant percentage of orders require delivery within a few\ndays requiring us to maintain higher inventory levels. These factors normally result in a varying order backlog and limited order flow visibility; however, with the\ncurrent global supply chain and transportation constraints, and limited availability of semiconductor chips and other components of our products, we have\nexperienced and may continue to experience extended lead times, increased logistics intervals and costs, and lower volume of products deliveries, which have and\nmay continue to have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on customer relations and our financial condition.\nWe expect that the supply chain constraints and semiconductor shortage will continue to affect our operating results through the end of 2022, although we cannot\npredict such factors with certainty. Normal operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term; therefore, a shortfall in quarterly revenue could significantly\nimpact our financial results in a given quarter.\nWe continue to support our customer demand for our products by working with our suppliers, contract manufacturers, ODMs, distributors, and customers to\naddress and to limit the disruption to our operations and order fulfillment.\n45\nOur operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors, including a decline in general economic and market conditions, specifically the\ndecline that initially resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic and that may recur, foreign currency exchange rate movements, increased competition, customer order\npatterns, changes in product and services mix, domestic and international geographical mix, timing differences between price decreases and product cost\nreductions, product warranty returns, expediting costs, tariffs and announcements of new products by us or our competitors. Additionally, maintaining sufficient\ninventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory that may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence\nof this inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. Also, not maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of\nour products may cause us to incur expediting costs to meet customer delivery requirements, which may negatively impact our operating results. In recent years,\nthe Company initiated restructuring plans to realign its expense structure with the reduction in revenue experienced and with overall Company objectives.\nManagement assessed the efficiency of our operations and consolidated locations and personnel, among other things, and implemented certain cost savings\ninitiatives, where possible. See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 1I, Item 8 of this report for additional information on\nthis restructuring.\nOur historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results, and, in general, management expects that our financial results may\nvary from period to period. See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report, for additional information on\nquarterly results for 2021 and 2020. For a discussion of risks associated with our operating results, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this report.\nBusiness Combination Agreement\nOn August 30, 2021, the Company and ADVA, entered into a business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”), pursuant to which both\ncompanies agreed to combine their respective businesses and each become subsidiaries of a new holding company, Acorn HoldCo, a Delaware corporation and\ncurrently a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the Company.\nUnder the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, Acorn MergeCo, Inc., a newly formed Delaware corporation and wholly-owned direct subsidiary of\nAcorn HoldCo (“Merger Sub”), will merge with and into ADTRAN, with ADTRAN surviving the merger (the “Merger”) as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of\nAcorn HoldCo. Pursuant to the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock of the Company will be converted into the right to receive one share of common\nstock of Acorn HoldCo. Acorn HoldCo has also made a public exchange offer to exchange each issued and outstanding no-par value bearer share of ADVA,\npursuant to which each ADVA share tendered and accepted for exchange will be exchanged for 0.8244 shares of common stock of Acorn HoldCo (the “Exchange\nOffer”, and together with the Merger, the “Business Combination”). Upon completion of the Business Combination, and assuming that all of the outstanding\nADVA shares are exchanged in the Exchange Offer, former ADTRAN stockholders and former ADVA shareholders will own approximately 54% and 46%,\nrespectively, of the outstanding Acorn HoldCo shares.\nThe Business Combination Agreement was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of the Company and by the supervisory board and management board\nof ADVA. On January 6, 2022, the Company's stockholders approved the Business Combination by an overwhelming majority. The end of the ADVA shareholder\ntender offer acceptance period was on January 26, 2022, which resulted in the acceptance of the Exchange Offer by more than 60% of all shares of ADVA entitled\nto voting rights existing as of October 31, 2021, thus exceeding the required minimum acceptance threshold. According to the rules of the German Securities\nAcquisition and Takeover Act, ADVA shareholders who did not tender their shares during the initial acceptance period could do so during a two-week additional\nacceptance period that began on February 1, 2022 and ended February 14, 2022. This resulted in the acceptance of the Exchange Offer by approximately 66% of all\nshares of ADVA entitled to voting rights existing as of November 30, 2021. On January 24, 2022, the CFIUS completed its review of the Business Combination\nand determined that the transaction was not a “covered transaction” subject to CFIUS’ jurisdiction, satisfying the condition of the Business Combination\nAgreement related to CFIUS notification. On February 16, 2022, the U.K. Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy completed its review of\nthe Business Combination and determined that the Secretary of State will be taking no further action under the NS&I Act, satisfying the condition of the Business\nCombination Agreement related to NS&I approval. Cooperative proceedings continue with the foreign direct investment authority in Germany.\nThe Company anticipates the consummation of the Business Combination around the middle of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, and regulatory\napprovals from the foreign direct investment authority in Germany.\nAdditional information about the Business Combination Agreement and proposed Business Combination is set forth in the Company’s filings with the SEC, as well\nas in the registration statement on Form S-4 that Acorn HoldCo filed with the SEC, which was declared effective December 2, 2021 (the “Acorn HoldCo\nRegistration Statement”).\n46\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents selected financial information derived from our Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income expressed as a percentage of revenue for\nthe years indicated.

The emphasis of the discussion is a comparison of the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. For a discussion of a comparison of the\nyears ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nincluded in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020\nRevenue\nOur revenue increased 11.2% from $506.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $563.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our Network\nSolutions revenue increased by $60.8 million compared to 2020 and our Services & Support revenue decreased by $4.3 million versus the prior year. The increase\nin our 2021 revenue was primarily attributable to increases in Access & Aggregation revenue of $31.1 million and Subscriber Solutions & Experience revenue of\n$28.5 million, partially offset by decreases in Traditional & Other Products revenue of $3.1 million. Although our revenue increased, supply of semiconductor\nchips and other components of our products has become constrained resulting in extended lead times and increased costs. Transportation constraints, including\nshortages for both air and surface freight, as well as labor shortages in the transportation industry, have also affected the timing and the cost of obtaining raw\nmaterials and production supplies. Although our revenue growth and profitability in the near-term may be impacted by these global supply chain issues, our long-\nterm outlook continues to strengthen given the strong customer order bookings during the last half of 2021.\nNetwork Solutions revenue increased by 13.9% from $438.0 million in 2020 to $498.8 million in 2021, due primarily to increases in Access & Aggregation\nrevenue and Subscriber Solutions & Experience revenue, partially offset by a decrease in Traditional & Other Products revenue. The increase in revenue of 9.9% of\nour Access & Aggregation products for 2021 was due to increased volume of fiber access. The increase of 16.7% in 2021 for revenue of our Subscriber Solutions\n& Experience products was primarily attributable to increased volume of network termination and fiber CPE. While we expect that revenue from Traditional &\nOther Products will continue to decline over time, this revenue may fluctuate, and continue to fluctuate, for years because of the time required for our customers to\ntransition to newer technologies.\n47\nServices & Support revenue decreased by 6.3% from $68.5 million in 2020 to $64.2 million in 2021. The decrease in revenue for 2021 was primarily attributable to\ndecreased network planning and implementation services partially offset by an increase in maintenance and managed services.\nDomestic revenue increased by 6.4% from $352.1 million in 2020 to $374.6 million in 2021, driven by increased volume of network termination and fiber CPE in\nour Network Solutions segment. In addition, such growth was a result of increased revenue to Tier-2 and Tier-3 customers with diversified business among our\nfiber access and CPE, service provider CPE and services.\nInternational revenue, which is included in the amounts for the Network Solutions and Services & Support segments discussed above, increased by 22.0% from\n$154.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $188.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. International revenue, as a percentage of total\nrevenue, increased from 30.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 33.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in international revenue for\n2021 was primarily driven by increased shipments to alternative network operators and a Tier-1 operator in Europe.\nOur international revenue is largely focused on broadband infrastructure and is affected by the decisions of our customers as to timing for installation of new\ntechnologies, expansion of their networks and/or network upgrades. Our international customers must make these decisions in the regulatory and political\nenvironment in which they operate – both nationally and in some instances, regionally – whether of a multi-country region or a more local region within a country.\nAs a result of our global operations, our revenue and operating income in some international markets can be affected by foreign currency fluctuations.\nConsequently, while we expect the global trend towards deployment of more robust broadband speeds and access to continue creating additional market\nopportunities for us, the factors described above may result in pressure on revenue and operating income. However, for the year ended December 31, 2021, foreign\ncurrency fluctuations did not materially impact the Company's results of operations.\nCost of Revenue\nAs a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue increased from 57.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 61.2% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The\nincrease was primarily attributable to supply chain constraint related expenses and to a lesser extent changes in customer and product mix and a regional revenue\nshift.\nNetwork Solutions cost of revenue, as a percentage of that segment’s revenue, increased from 55.8% of revenue in 2020 to 61.7% of revenue in 2021. The increase\nin Network Solutions cost of revenue as a percentage of that segment’s revenue was primarily attributable to supply chain constraint related expenses and to a\nlesser extent changes in customer and product mix and a regional revenue shift.\nServices & Support cost of revenue, as a percentage of that segment’s revenue, decreased from 65.3% of revenue in 2020 to 57.3% of revenue in 2021. The\ndecrease in Services & Support cost of revenue as a percentage of that segment’s revenue in 2021 was primarily attributable to customer mix, changes in services\nand support mix.\nServices & Support revenue is comprised of network planning and implementation, maintenance, support and cloud-based management services, with network\nplanning and implementation being the largest and fastest growing component in the long-term. Compared to our other services, such as maintenance, support and\ncloud-based management services, our network planning and implementation services typically utilize a higher percentage of internal and subcontracted engineers,\nprofessionals and contractors to perform the work for customers. The additional costs incurred to perform these infrastructure and labor-intensive services\ninherently result in lower average gross margins as compared to maintenance and support services. Within the Services & Support segment, we do expect\nvariability in gross margins from quarter-to-quarter based on the mix of the services recognized.\n48\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 22.1% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will generally fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in\nrevenue for the periods being compared as these costs are relatively fixed in the short term.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by 9.2% from $114.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $124.4 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. Selling, general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for management, accounting, information technology, human resources,\nsales and marketing, as well as independent auditor, tax and other professional fees, contract services and legal and litigation related costs. The increase in selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased acquisition expenses, deferred compensation related costs and insurance expense,\npartially offset by decreases in restructuring expenses, travel related expense and legal expense.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 22.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 19.3% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate whenever there are incremental product development activities\nor significant fluctuations in revenue for the periods being compared as these costs are relatively fixed in the short term.\nResearch and development expenses decreased by 4.1% from $113.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $108.7 million for the year ended December\n31, 2021. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to lower personnel costs which were mainly the result of our restructuring\nprograms, partially offset by increased contract services.\nWe expect to continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with our new and existing products and our expansion into international markets.\nWe continually evaluate new product and market opportunities and engage in significant research and development efforts which provide for new product\ndevelopment, enhancement of existing products and product cost reductions. We may incur significant research and development expenses prior to the receipt of\nrevenue from a major new product group.\nAsset Impairments\nAsset impairments relate to the abandonment of certain information technology implementation projects in which we had previously capitalized costs. No\nimpairments incurred in the year ended December 31, 2021. Impairments were less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest and Dividend Income\nInterest and dividend income increased by 46.9% from $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe increase in interest and dividend income was primarily attributable to an increase in the rate of return on our investments. Our investments decreased from\n$83.3 million as of December 31, 2020 to $71.0 million as of December 31, 2021.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was less than $0.1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Interest expense during 2021 was primarily related to our\nRevolving Credit Agreement that we entered into during the fourth quarter of 2020. See “Financing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for\nadditional information on our revolving credit agreement.\nNet Investment Gain\nWe recognized a net investment gain of $4.9 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The fluctuations in our net\ninvestments were primarily attributable to changes in the fair value of our securities recognized during the period. We expect that any future market volatility could\nresult in continued fluctuations in our investment portfolio. See “Investing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” of this report and Note 1 and Note 6 of\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net, increased from expense of $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to income of $3.8 million for the year ended December\n31, 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, other income (expense), net, is comprised primarily of gains and losses on foreign currency\ntransactions and income from excess material sales.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit\n49\nOur effective tax rate decreased from a benefit of 138.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 to an expense of 37.0% for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe change in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by a tax benefit in the amount of $10.8 million during 2020, $7.9\nmillion of which related to the utilization of deferred tax assets which had previously been offset with a valuation allowance and $2.9 million primarily related to\nthe tax rate differential on carrying back losses from 2018 and 2019 tax years to prior years in which the U.S. Corporate tax rate was 35% versus the current 21%\nfederal tax rate. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nNet (Loss) Income\nAs a result of the above factors, our net income decreased from $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to a net loss of $8.6 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. As a percentage of revenue, net income was 0.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and net loss was 1.5% for the year ended December\n31, 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nWe have historically financed, and currently expect to continue to finance, our ongoing business with existing cash, investments and cash flow from operations. We\nhave used, and expect to continue to use, existing cash, investments and cash generated from operations for working capital, business acquisitions, purchases of\ntreasury stock, shareholder dividends and other general corporate purposes, including product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop\nnew products, expand our sales and marketing activities and fund capital expenditures. Under the Business Combination Agreement, the Company will bear the\ntransaction costs of the Business Combination attributable to Acorn HoldCo and the Company. As of December 31, 2021, the Company will incur an estimated\n$9.5 million of additional transaction costs related to the Business Combination Agreement. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash\ngenerated from operations will be adequate to meet our operating needs, capital needs and obligations under the Business Combination for at least the next 12\nmonths.\nAs of December 31, 2021, cash on hand was $56.6 million and short-term investments were $0.4 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $57.0\nmillion, of which $47.7 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, cash on hand was $60.2 million and short-term investments were\n$3.1 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $63.3 million, of which $49.7 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. The decrease in short-\nterm liquidity from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to the sale of certain equity and fixed income investments for working\ncapital and other purposes.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $19.5 million compared to net cash used of $16.5\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to net cash inflows from working capital, specifically, an increase in the average\nnumber days payable to our trade suppliers and a decrease in other receivables, partially offset by an inventory build related to component availability, an increase\nin accounts receivable, and an increase in the average number of days it takes the Company to collect cash payment for sales. Additional details related to our\nworking capital and its drivers are discussed below.\nNet accounts receivable increased 60.6% from $98.8 million as of December 31, 2020 to $158.7 million as of December 31, 2021. We had no allowance for credit\nlosses as of December 31, 2021 and less than $0.1 million as of December 31, 2020. Quarterly accounts receivable DSO increased from 70 days as of December\n31, 2020 to 95 days as of December 31, 2021. The increase in DSO was due to the higher sales volume and timing of shipments late in the quarter tied to supply\nchain constraints and customer mix.\nOther receivables decreased 47.9% from $21.5 million as of December 31, 2020 to $11.2 million as of December 31, 2021. The decrease in other receivables was\nprimarily attributable to decreases in income tax receivables related to the CARES Act.\n50\nAnnual inventory turnover increased from 2.58 turns as of December 31, 2020 to 2.60 turns as of December 31, 2021. Inventory increased 11.5% from $125.5\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 to $139.9 million as of December 31, 2021. The increase in inventory was due to increased purchases in preparation for strategic\ninventory buffer purchases as well as new product ramp ups to ensure supply continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect inventory levels to fluctuate as\nwe attempt to maintain sufficient inventory in response to COVID-19 uncertainties related to supply chain and supply, seasonal cycles of our business and ensuring\ncompetitive lead times while managing the risk of inventory.\nAccounts payable increased 105.3% from $49.9 million as of December 31, 2020 to $102.5 million as of December 31, 2021. Accounts payable will fluctuate due\nto variations in the timing of the receipt of inventory, supplies and services and our subsequent payments for these purchases. The significant increase in the fourth\nquarter was due to higher sales volume and additional purchases of raw material inventory buffer stock.\nInvesting Activities\nCapital expenditures totaled approximately $5.7 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These expenditures were\nprimarily used to purchase manufacturing and test equipment, software, computer hardware and building improvements.\nOur combined short-term and long-term investments decreased $12.3 million from $83.3 million as of December 31, 2020 to $71.0 million as of December 31,\n2021. This decrease reflects the sale of certain fixed income investments for working capital and other purposes.\nWe typically invest all available cash not required for immediate use in operations, primarily in securities that we believe bear minimal risk of loss. See Note 6 of\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, U.S. government bonds, and\nforeign government bonds were classified as available-for-sale and had a combined duration of 1.61 years with an average Standard & Poor’s credit rating of AA.\nBecause our investment portfolio has a high-quality rating and contractual maturities of short duration, we are able to obtain prices for these bonds derived from\nobservable market inputs, or for similar securities traded in an active market, on a daily basis.\nOur long-term investments decreased 11.9% from $80.1 million as of December 31, 2020 to $70.6 million as of December 31, 2021. Our investments include\nvarious marketable equity securities classified as long-term investments with a fair market value of $12.6 million and $11.0 million, as of December 31, 2021 and\n2020, respectively. Long-term investments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 also included $26.9 million and $23.9 million, respectively, related to our deferred\ncompensation plan, and $0.2 million of other investments, consisting of interests in a private equity fund, as of December 31, 2020.\n51\nFinancing Activities\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nOn November 2, 2021, the Company renewed its Revolving Credit and Security Agreement and related Promissory Note (together, the “Revolving Credit\nAgreement”) with Cadence Bank, N.A., as lender (the “Lender”). The Revolving Credit Agreement provides the Company with a $10.0 million secured revolving\ncredit facility. Loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to 1.50% over the screen rate as obtained by Reuter’s, Bloomberg or\nanother commercially available source as may be designated by the Lender from time to time; provided, however, that in no event shall the applicable rate of\ninterest under the Revolving Credit Agreement be less than 1.50% per annum. Such loans are secured by all of the cash, securities, securities entitlements and\ninvestment property in a certain bank account, as outlined in the Revolving Credit Agreement, at a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75% determined by dividing the\nfull commitment amount under the Revolving Credit Agreement on the date of testing, determined by the Lender each fiscal quarter, by the market value of the\ncollateral. The Revolving Credit Agreement matures on November 3, 2022, subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain events of default. The\nCompany entered into the Revolving Credit Agreement in order to increase the flexibility and management of its short-term liquidity. During the fourth quarter of\n2021, the Company made draws totaling $10.0 million under the Revolving Credit Agreement all of which had been repaid as of December 31, 2021. The\nCompany agreed to certain negative covenants that are customary for credit arrangements of this type, including, among other things, restrictions on the\nCompany’s ability to enter into mergers, acquisitions or other business combination transactions, grant liens or suffer a material adverse change in the condition or\naffairs (financial or otherwise) of the Company. The Company must be in compliance with all covenants to be able to draw on the line of credit. As of December\n31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all covenants. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report\nfor additional information.\nAlabama State Industrial Development Authority Financing\nIn conjunction with the 1995 expansion of our Huntsville, Alabama facility, we were approved for participation in an incentive program offered by the State of\nAlabama Industrial Development Authority (the “Authority”). Pursuant to the program, in January 1995, the Authority issued $20.0 million of its taxable revenue\nbonds (the “Taxable Revenue Bonds”) and loaned the proceeds from the sale of the Taxable Revenue Bonds to the Company. Further advances on the Taxable\nRevenue Bonds were made by the Authority, bringing the total amount to $50.0 million. The Taxable Revenue Bonds bore interest, payable monthly with an\ninterest rate of 2% per annum. The Taxable Revenue Bonds aggregate principal amount of $24.6 million matured on January 1, 2020 and was repaid in full on\nJanuary 2, 2020, using the funds held in a certificate of deposit by the Company. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II,\nItem 8 of this report for additional information.\nDividends\nDuring 2021 and 2020, we paid shareholder dividends totaling $17.5 million and $17.3 million, respectively. The Board of Directors presently anticipates that it\nwill declare a regular quarterly dividend so long as the present tax treatment of dividends exists and adequate levels of liquidity are maintained. The following table\nshows dividends per common share paid to our shareholders in each quarter of 2021 and 2020:\nDividends per Common Share\n2021 2020\nFirst Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nSecond Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nThird Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nFourth Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nStock Repurchase Program\nSince 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of our common\nstock, which are implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant. There were no stock repurchases during the years\nended December 31, 2021 and 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased less than 0.1 million shares for $0.2 million at an average price of\n$14.06 per share. We currently have authorization to repurchase an additional 2.5 million shares of our common stock under the current authorization of up to 5.0\nmillion shares.\nStock Option Exercises\nTo accommodate employee stock option exercises, we issued 0.4 million shares of treasury stock for $6.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 and\nless than 0.1 million shares of treasury stock for $0.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. There\n52\nwere no stock option exercises during the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in stock option exercises in 2021 is related to the increase in the Company's\nstock price.\nEmployee Pension Plan\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries. Pension benefit plan obligations are based on various assumptions\nused by our actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, compensation rate increases, expected return on plan assets,\nretirement rates and mortality rates. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in assumptions could affect future expenses and obligations.\nOur defined benefit plan assets consist of a balanced portfolio of equity funds, bond funds, real estate funds and managed futures. Our investment policy includes\nvarious guidelines and procedures designed to ensure assets are invested in a manner necessary to meet expected future benefits earned by participants and consider\na broad range of economic conditions. Central to the policy are target allocation ranges by asset class, which is currently 50% for bond funds, 40% for equity funds\nand 10% cash, real estate and managed futures. The objectives of the target allocations are to maintain investment portfolios that diversify risk through prudent\nasset allocation parameters, achieve asset returns that meet or exceed the plans’ actuarial assumptions and achieve asset returns that are competitive with like\ninstitutions employing similar investment strategies. The investment policy is periodically reviewed by us and a designated third-party fiduciary for investment\nmatters. The policy is established and administered in a manner that is compliant at all times with applicable government regulations. At December 31, 2021, the\nestimated fair market value of our defined benefit pension plans assets increased to $32.7 million from $32.3 million at December 31, 2020.\nThe defined benefit pension plan is accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the use of various assumptions, including an expected rate of return on plan\nassets and a discount rate. The expected return on our German plan assets that is utilized in determining the benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost is\nderived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using\nstandard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent\nplan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return. The discount rate has been derived from the returns of\nhigh-quality, corporate bonds denominated in Euro currency with durations close to the duration of our pension obligations. The projected benefit obligation for\nour defined benefit pension plans was $44.2 million and $50.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe components of net periodic pension cost, other than the service cost component, are included in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of\n(Loss) Income. The components of net periodic pension cost and amounts recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2021\nand 2020 were ($5.0) million and $1.6 million, respectively.\nActuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. To the extent unamortized gains and losses exceed 10% of the higher of\nthe market-related value of assets or the projected benefit obligation, the excess is amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost over the remaining\nservice period of active participants. We estimate that $0.3 million will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income into net periodic\npension cost in 2022 for the net actuarial loss. The net actuarial loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as of December 31, 2021 and\n2020 was $7.7 million and $13.5 million, respectively.\nSee Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\n53\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or\nother persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or the\navailability of, or requirements for, capital resources.\nCash Requirements\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s material short- and long-term cash requirements from known obligations pursuant to certain contracts and\ncommitments as of December 31, 2021, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations and payments are expected to be satisfied.\n(In thousands) Total 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 After 2026\nPledged collateral(1) $ 15,000 $ 15,000 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nPurchase obligations(2) 361,626 340,770 15,859 4,997 — — —\nOperating lease obligations(3) 5,084 1,767 1,419 1,188 710 — —\nBusiness combination transaction\ncosts(4) 9,540 9,540 — — — — —\nTotals $ 391,250 $ 367,077 $ 17,278 $ 6,185 $ 710 $ — $ —\n(1) We are required to maintain a pledged collateral amount related to a letter of credit agreement with a bank to guarantee performance obligations under a\ncontract with a certain customer. The obligations under this customer contract will be performed over multiple years. We reached the maximum value of our\nminimum collateral requirement of $15.0 million during the first quarter of 2021 as outlined in the customer contract. The letter of credit was secured by a pledge\nof a portion of the Company’s fixed-income securities, which totaled $18.3 million as of December 31, 2021, of which $0.2 million is included in restricted cash\nand $18.1 million is included in long-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This pledged collateral value will fluctuate as the Company changes the\nmix of the pledged collateral between restricted cash and investments. Any shortfalls in the minimum collateral value are required to be restored by the Company\nfrom available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and/or long-term investments. The collateral under the letter of credit will be released when all\nobligations under the customer contract have been met. As of December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all contractual requirements under the\nletter of credit.\n(2) We have purchase obligations related to open purchase orders to our contract manufacturers, ODMs, component suppliers, service partners and other vendors,\nincluding those assisting with the implementation of our new ERP system. The settlement of our purchase obligations will occur at various dates beginning in 2022\nand going through 2024.\n(3) We have operating leases for office space, automobiles and various other equipment in the U.S. and in certain international locations. Our operating leases had\nremaining lease terms of one month to 44 months as of December 31, 2021, The remaining future minimum rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases,\nincluding renewals determined to be reasonably assured, with original maturities of greater than 12 months totaled $5.1 million as of December 31, 2021. See Note\n9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\n(4) Under the Business Combination Agreement, the Company will bear the transaction costs of the Business Combination attributable to Acorn HoldCo and the\nCompany. For additional information on the Business Combination, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 and Part\nI, Item 1 of this report.\n54\nWe have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $5.0 million in a private equity fund, of which $4.9 million has been applied to these commitments. We are\nuncertain as to when the additional $0.1 million commitment will be applied.\nCertain contracts, customers and/or jurisdictions in which we do business require us to provide various guarantees of performance such as bid bonds, performance\nbonds and customs bonds. As of December 31, 2021, we had commitments related to these bonds totaling $22.9 million, which expire at various dates through\nAugust 2024. Although the triggering events vary from contract to contract, in general we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of\ndefault in our performance under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote.\nWe also have obligations related to uncertain income tax positions that have uncertainty as to when the related expense will be recognized. See Note 14 of Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nOn November 2, 2021, the Company renewed its Revolving Credit Agreement with Cadence Bank, N.A., as lender. See Liquidity and Capital Resources –\nLiquidity for further information.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the\ntime the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could\nmaterially impact the results of financial operations. Several accounting policies, as described in Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included\nin Part II, Item 8 of this report, require material subjective or complex judgment and have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations,\nas applicable. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated\nFinancial Statements:\n55\nRevenue\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a customer and as performance\nobligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied. Generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of a product to the customer. Review of contracts with\ncustomers, for both direct customers and distributors, are performed and assessed for principal versus agent considerations to determine primary responsibility for\ndelivery of performance obligation, presumed inventory risk, and discretion in establishing pricing, when applicable. For transactions where there are multiple\nperformance obligations, individual products and services are accounted for separately if they are distinct (if a product or service is separately identifiable from\nother items and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer). The consideration, including any\ndiscounts, is allocated between separate products and services based on their stand-alone selling prices. Stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the\nprices at which the separate products and services are sold and are allocated based on each item’s relative value to the total value of the products and services in the\narrangement. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate stand-alone selling prices primarily using the “expected cost plus a margin” approach. Payment\nterms are generally 30 days in the U.S. and typically longer in many geographic markets outside the U.S. Shipping fees are recorded as revenue and the related cost\nwhich we have elected to account for as a cost of fulfilling the related contract is included in cost of revenue. Revenue, value-added and other taxes collected\nconcurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Costs of obtaining a contract, if material, are capitalized and amortized over the period\nthat the related revenue is recognized if greater than one year. We have also elected to apply the practical expedient related to the incremental costs of obtaining\ncontracts and recognize those costs as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets is one year or less. These costs are included in selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses. Capitalized costs with an amortization period greater than one year were immaterial.\nRevenue is generated by two reportable segments: Network Solutions and Services & Support.\nNetwork Solutions Segment - Includes hardware products and software defined next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or business networks,\nas well as prior generation products. The majority of the revenue from this segment is from hardware sales.\nHardware and Software Revenue\nRevenue from hardware sales is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally when the products are shipped. Shipping terms are\ngenerally FOB shipping point. Revenue from software license sales is recognized at delivery and transfer of control to the customer. Revenue is recorded net of\nestimated discounts and rebates using historical trends. Customers are typically invoiced when control is transferred and revenue is recognized. Our products\ngenerally include assurance-based warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects.\nIn certain transactions, we are also the lessor in sales-type lease arrangements for network equipment that have terms of 18 months to five years. These\narrangements typically include network equipment, network implementation services and maintenance services.\nServices & Support Segment – Includes a complete portfolio of maintenance, network implementation and solutions integration and managed services, including\nhosted cloud services and subscription services which complement our Network Solutions segment.\nMaintenance Revenue\nOur maintenance service periods range from one month to five years. Customers are typically invoiced and pay for maintenance services at the beginning of the\nmaintenance period. We recognize revenue for maintenance services on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period as our customers benefit evenly\nthroughout the contract term and deferred revenue, when applicable, is recorded in unearned revenue and non-current unearned revenue. The total balance of our\nunearned revenue was $27.0 million and $21.0 million as of December 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nNetwork Implementation Revenue\nWe recognize revenue for network implementation, which primarily consists of engineering, execution and enablement services at a point in time when each\nperformance obligation is complete. If we have recognized revenue but have not billed the customer, the right to consideration is recognized as a contract asset that\nis included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when the completed performance\nobligation is invoiced to the customer.\n56\nInventory\nWe carry our inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost being determined using the first-in, first-out method. Standard costs for material,\nlabor, and manufacturing overhead are used to value inventory and are updated at least quarterly. Most variances are expensed in the current period; therefore, our\ninventory costs approximate actual costs at the end of each reporting period. We establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the\ndifference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on estimated reserve percentages, which consider\nhistorical usage, known trends, inventory age and market conditions. If actual trends and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management,\nwe may be required to make additional inventory write-downs. Our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $44.6 million and $39.6 million at December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively. Inventory disposals charged against the reserve were $1.0 million and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nFor purposes of determining the estimated fair value of market-based PSU awards on the date of grant, the Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method is used.\nThese PSUs are subject to a market condition based on the relative total shareholder return of ADTRAN against all of the companies in the NASDAQ\nTelecommunications Index and vest at the end of a three-year performance period. The fair value of performance-based PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock is equal to\nthe closing price of our stock on the business day immediately preceding the grant date. Compensation expense related to unvested performance-based PSUs is\nrecognized over the requisite service period of two to three years as the achievement of the performance obligation becomes probable. For purposes of determining\nthe estimated fair value of our stock option awards on the date of grant, we use the Black-Scholes Model. This model requires the input of certain assumptions that\nrequire subjective judgment. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected\nemployee stock option exercise behaviors. Because our stock option awards have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because\nchanges in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the existing model may not provide a reliable, single measure of the fair value of our\nstock option awards. Management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based\ncompensation. Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to these assumptions and\nmethodologies and thereby materially impact our fair value determination. If factors change in future periods, the compensation expense that we record may differ\nsignificantly from what we have recorded in the current period. As of December 31, 2021, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the non-vested\nportion of market-based PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock was approximately $17.5 million.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We qualitatively assess the carrying value of goodwill each reporting\nperiod for events or circumstance changes that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Based on our\nassessment of certain qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions, industry and market considerations, costs factors and overall financial performance,\nmanagement concluded that the fair value of the goodwill was more likely than not greater than its carrying amount as of December 31, 2021. No impairment\ncharges on goodwill were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The balance of our goodwill was $7.0 million as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nIncome Taxes\nWe estimate our income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing\nauthorities. We also make judgments regarding the realization of deferred tax assets and establish valuation allowances where we believe it is more likely than not\nthat future taxable income in certain jurisdictions will be insufficient to realize these deferred tax assets. Our estimates regarding future taxable income and income\ntax provision or benefit may vary due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws, or other factors. If our assumptions, and consequently our estimates,\nchange in the future, the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased, impacting future income tax expense. We continually review the\nadequacy of our valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the\ndeferred tax assets will be realized in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Due to a decrease in revenue and profitability for 2019, and all other positive and\nnegative objective evidence considered as part of our analysis, our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as projections for future growth is limited\nwhen evaluating whether our deferred tax assets will be realized. As such, the Company was and is no longer able to conclude that it is more likely than not that\nour domestic deferred tax assets will be realized and a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets was established in 2019. However, the amount\nof the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be adjusted in future periods in the event sufficient evidence is present to support a conclusion that it is more\nlikely than not that all or a portion of our domestic deferred tax assets will be realized.\n57\nWe establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain. We adjust\nthese reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, as facts and circumstances change.\nLiability for Warranty\nOur products generally include warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the time of product shipment based on our\nhistorical return rate and an estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products. We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes,\nincluding actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. Our products continue to become more complex in both size and functionality\nas many of our product offerings migrate from line card applications to total systems. The increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences,\nwhen they arise, to be more costly. Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage, and other rework\ncosts incurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise. Should our\nactual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to record additional warranty expense. The liability for warranty\nobligations totaled $5.4 million and $7.1 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other\nliabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPension Benefit Plan Obligations\nPension benefit plan obligations are based on various assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates,\ncompensation rate increases, expected return on plan assets, retirement rates and mortality rates. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in\nassumptions could affect future expenses and obligations. Our net pension liability totaled $11.4 million and $18.7 million at December 31, 2021 and December\n31, 2020, respectively. This liability is included in pension liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report\nfor additional information.\nSubsequent Events\nOn February 2, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common share to be paid to the\nCompany’s stockholders of record at the close of business on February 17, 2022. The dividends will be paid on March 3, 2022 in the aggregate amount of\napproximately $4.4 million.\nOn January 6, 2022, the Company's stockholders approved the Business Combination by an overwhelming majority. On January 26, 2022, the ADVA shareholder\ntender offer acceptance period ended, with the required minimum acceptance threshold having been met. According to the rules of the German Securities\nAcquisition and Takeover Act, ADVA shareholders who did not tender their shares during the initial acceptance period could do so during a two-week additional\nacceptance period that began on February 1, 2022 and ended February 14, 2022. This resulted in the acceptance of the Exchange Offer by approximately 66% of all\nshares of ADVA entitled to voting rights existing as of November 30, 2021. On January 24, 2022, CFIUS completed its review of the Business Combination and\ndetermined that the transaction was not a “covered transaction” subject to CFIUS’ jurisdiction, satisfying the condition of the Business Combination Agreement\nrelated to CFIUS notification. On February 16, 2022, the U.K. Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy completed its review of the Business\nCombination and determined that the Secretary of State will be taking no further action under NS&I Act, satisfying the condition of the Business Combination\nAgreement related to NS&I Act approval. For additional information on the Business Combination, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 and Part I, Item 1 of this report.\n58\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency rates and prices of marketable equity and fixed-income securities. In addition, the\nongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused an economic downturn and volatility in financial markets. The primary objective of the large majority of our investment\nactivities is to preserve principal while at the same time achieve appropriate yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, a majority of our\nmarketable securities are investment grade, fixed-rate bonds and municipal money market instruments denominated in U.S. dollars. Our investment policy provides\nlimitations for issuer concentration, which limits, at the time of purchase, the concentration in any one issuer to 5% of the market value of our total investment\nportfolio.\nWe maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions. As of December 31, 2021, $52.5 million of our cash and cash equivalents, primarily certain\ndomestic money market funds and foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government provided insured depository limits. Although these depository\ninvestments exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit-worthiness of these financial institutions and determined the risk of\nmaterial financial loss due to exposure of such credit risk to be minimal.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately $31.7 million of our cash and investments may be directly affected by changes in interest rates. As of December 31,\n2021, we held $6.3 million of cash and variable-rate investments where a change in interest rates would impact our interest income. A hypothetical 50 basis point\ndecline in interest rates as of December 31, 2021, assuming all other variables remain constant, would reduce annualized interest income on our cash and\ninvestments by less than $0.1 million. In addition, we held $25.3 million of fixed-rate bonds whose fair values may be directly affected by a change in interest\nrates. A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2021, assuming all other variables remain constant, would reduce the fair value of\nour fixed-rate bonds by approximately $0.2 million.\nWe are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent that such changes affect our revenue and gross margin on revenue derived from some\ninternational customers, expenses, and assets and liabilities held in non-functional currencies related to our foreign subsidiaries. Our primary exposures to foreign\ncurrency exchange rate movements are with our German subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Euro and our Australian subsidiary, whose functional\ncurrency is the Australian dollar. Our revenue is primarily denominated in the respective functional currency of the subsidiary. Our global supply chain\npredominately invoices us in U.S. dollars and some of our operating expenses are paid in certain local currencies (approximately 11.3% of total operating expense\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively). Therefore, our revenue, gross margins, operating expenses and operating income are all subject to foreign\ncurrency fluctuations. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates could cause variations in our operating income.\nWe have certain customers and suppliers who are invoiced or pay in a non-functional currency. Changes in the monetary exchange rates used to invoice such\ncustomers versus the functional currency of the entity billing such customers may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. To manage the\nvolatility relating to these typical business exposures, we may enter into various derivative transactions, when appropriate. We do not hold or issue derivative\ninstruments for trading or other speculative purposes. All non-functional currencies billed would result in a combined hypothetical gain or loss of $6.2 million if\nthe U.S. dollar weakened or strengthened 10% against the billing currencies. All non-functional currencies invoiced by suppliers would result in a combined\nhypothetical gain or loss of $1.4 million if the U.S. dollar weakened or strengthened 10% against the billing currencies. This change represents an increase in the\namount of hypothetical gain or loss compared to prior periods and is mainly due to an increase in U.S. dollar denominated billings in a non-U.S. dollar\ndenominated subsidiary. Although we do not currently hold any derivative instruments, any gain or loss would be partially mitigated by any derivative instruments\nheld.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had certain material contracts subject to currency revaluation, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and lease liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2021, we did not have any forward contracts outstanding.\nFor further information about the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2021, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part\nII, Item 8 of this report.\n59\nITEM 8.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December\n31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nappearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions\nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n61\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii)\ninvolved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical\naudit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nExcess and Obsolete Inventory Reserve\nAs described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated net inventory and inventory reserve as of December 31, 2021 were\n$139.9 million and $44.6 million, respectively. Management establishes reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the\ncost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on estimated reserve percentages, which consider historical usage, known trends,\ninventory age, and market conditions.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the excess and obsolete inventory reserve is a critical audit matter are (i)\nthe significant judgment by management in estimating the excess and obsolete inventory reserve, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment,\nsubjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to the estimated reserve percentages.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the excess and obsolete inventory reserve. These procedures also included,\namong others, testing management’s process for developing the excess and obsolete inventory reserve; evaluating the appropriateness of the approach; testing the\ncompleteness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach, including historical usage and inventory age; and evaluating the reasonableness of the\nestimated reserve percentages used by management to determine the excess and obsolete inventory reserve. Evaluating the reasonableness of the estimated reserve\npercentages involved assessing whether they were consistent with the historical data and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n/s/

Business\nADTRAN, Inc. (“ADTRAN” or the “Company”) is a leading global provider of networking and communications platforms, software and services focused on the\nbroadband access market. Our vision is to enable a fully connected world where the power to communicate is available to everyone, everywhere. Our business\napproach, unmatched industry expertise and innovative solutions enable us to address almost any customer need. Our products and services are utilized by a diverse\nglobal customer base of network operators that range from those having regional or national reach and operating as telephone or cable television network operators\nto alternative network providers such as municipalities or utilities, as well as, managed service providers who serve small- and medium-sized businesses and\ndistributed enterprises.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”)\nand include the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, changes in equity and cash flows of ADTRAN and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Significant estimates include excess and obsolete inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates, determination and accrual of\nthe deferred revenue related to performance obligations under contracts with customers, estimated costs to complete obligations associated with deferred and\naccrued revenue and network installations, estimated income tax provision and income tax contingencies, fair value of stock-based compensation, assessment of\ngoodwill and other intangibles for impairment, estimated lives of intangible assets, estimated pension liability, fair value of investments, evaluation of other-than-\ntemporary declines in the value of investments and our allowance for current expected credit losses. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates.\nWe assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available\nto us and the unknown future impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus/COVID-19 global pandemic (or variants of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, including the\nOmicron and Delta variants) as well as supply chain constraints as of December 31, 2021 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed\nincluded, but were not limited to, the allowance for expected credit losses, stock-based compensation, carrying value of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived\nassets, financial assets, valuation allowances for tax assets, revenue recognition and costs of revenue. Future conditions related to the magnitude and duration of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors, including supply chain constraints, could result in further impacts to our consolidated financial statements in future\nreporting periods.\nCorrection of Immaterial Misstatements\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company determined that there was an immaterial misstatement of its excess and obsolete inventory reserves in\nits previously issued annual and interim financial statements. The Company corrected this misstatement by recognizing a $0.8 million out-of-period adjustment\nduring the three months ended June 30, 2019, which increased its excess and obsolete inventory reserve and cost of revenue for the period. For the six and twelve\nmonths ended June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2019, respectively, the out-of-period adjustment was a cumulative $0.2 million reduction in its excess and obsolete\ninventory reserve and cost of revenue. Management determined that the correction of this misstatement was not material to any of its previously issued financial\nstatements on both a quantitative and qualitative basis.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, it was determined that certain investments held in the Company’s stock for a deferred compensation plan accounted for as a Rabbi\ntrust were incorrectly classified as long-term investments with the fair value of such investments incorrectly marked to market at each period end rather than\nclassified as treasury stock held at historical cost. This plan has been in existence since 2011. The Company corrected this misstatement as an out-of-period\nadjustment in the three months ended March 31, 2020 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, by remeasuring the investment assets to their historical\ncost basis through the recording of a net investment gain of $1.5 million in the Consolidated Statement of (Loss) Income and then correcting the classification by\ndecreasing the long-term investment balance at its remeasured cost basis of $2.8 million to treasury stock in the Consolidated 2020 Balance Sheet. Management\nhas determined that this misstatement was not material to any of its previously issued financial statements and that correction of the misstatement was not material\nto the 2020 annual financial results on either a quantitative or qualitative basis.\n68\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents represent demand deposits, money market funds and short-term investments classified as available-for-sale with original maturities of\nthree months or less. We maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions. As of December 31, 2021, $52.5 million of our cash and cash\nequivalents, primarily certain domestic money market funds and foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government provided insured depository limits.\nAlthough these depository investments may exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit worthiness of these applicable financial\ninstitutions and determined the risk of material financial loss due to the exposure of such credit risk to be minimal.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash consists of certain collateral which secures the Company’s performance obligation under a contract with a certain customer.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value\ndue to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.\nInvestments with contractual maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities\nrepresent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Despite the long-term nature of their stated contractual maturities, we routinely buy and sell\nthese securities and we believe we have the ability to quickly sell them to the remarketing agent, tender agent or issuer at par value plus accrued interest in the\nevent we decide to liquidate our investment in a particular variable rate demand note. All income generated from these investments is recorded as interest income.\nWe have not recorded any losses relating to variable rate demand notes.\nLong-term investments is comprised of deferred compensation plan assets, corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-\nbacked bonds, U.S. and foreign government bonds, marketable equity securities and other equity investments. Marketable equity securities are reported at fair\nvalue as determined by the most recently traded price of the securities at the balance sheet date, although the securities may not be readily marketable due to the\nsize of the available market. Any changes in fair value are recognized in net investment gain (loss). Realized gains and losses on sales of debt securities are\ncomputed under the specific identification method and are included in other income (expense). See Note 6 for additional information.\nFor financing receivables, the Company does not measure the allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables, as the uncollectable accrued interest\nreceivable is written off by reversing any previously recorded interest income in a timely manner (as soon as these amounts are determined to be uncollectable).\nAccounts Receivable\nWe record accounts receivable at amortized cost. Prior to establishing payment terms for a new customer, we evaluate the credit risk of the customer. Credit limits\nand payment terms established for new customers are re-evaluated periodically based on customer collection experience and other financial factors. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, single customers comprising more than 10% of our total accounts receivable balance included three customers, which accounted for 59.9% of\nour total accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2021, these three customers individually accounted for 35.8%, 12.1% and 12.0%, respectively, of our total\naccounts receivable. As of December 31, 2020, single customers comprising more than 10% of our total accounts receivable balance included three customers,\nwhich accounted for 41.5% of our total accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2020, these three customers individually accounted for 15.6%, 14.5% and 11.4%,\nrespectively, of our total accounts receivable.\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\n69\nAccounting Policy Under Topic 326\nWe regularly review the need for an allowance for credit losses related to our outstanding accounts receivable balances using the historical loss-rate method as well\nas assessing asset-specific risks. The assessment of asset-specific risks included the evaluation of relevant available information, from internal and external sources,\nrelating to current conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay, such as the customer’s current financial condition or credit rating by geographic location,\nas provided by a third party and/or by customer, if needed, and overall macro-economic conditions in which the customer operates. Based on this assessment, an\nallowance for credit losses would be recorded if the Company determined that, based on our historical write-offs, which have been immaterial, and such asset\nspecific risks, there was risk in collectability of the full amount of any accounts receivable.\nAccounting Policy Prior to Adoption of Topic 326\nPrior to adoption of Topic 326 on January 1, 2020, we regularly reviewed the need to maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and considered factors such as\nthe age of accounts receivable balances, the current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay, significant one-time events impacting these\ncustomers and our historical experience. If the financial condition of a customer deteriorated, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, we may\nhave been required to record an allowance for credit losses.\nInventory\nInventory is carried at the lower of cost and estimated net realizable value, with cost being determined using the first-in, first-out method. Standard costs for\nmaterial, labor and manufacturing overhead are used to value inventory and are updated at least quarterly. We establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete\ninventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on estimated reserve percentages,\nwhich consider historical usage, known trends, inventory age and market conditions. When we dispose of excess and obsolete inventories, the related disposals are\ncharged against the inventory reserve. See Note 7 for additional information.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment, which is stated at cost, is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We depreciate\nbuilding and land improvements from five to 39 years, office machinery and equipment from three to seven years, engineering machinery and equipment from\nthree to seven years, and computer software from three to five years. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Major\nimprovements that materially prolong the lives of the assets are capitalized. Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are recorded in\noperating loss. See Note 8 for additional information.\nIntangible Assets\nPurchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives of the\nrespective assets, which is two to 14 years. See Note 11 for additional information.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles\nLong-lived assets used in operations and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount of an asset may not be recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value. An\nimpairment loss would be recognized in the amount by which the recorded value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, measured by the quoted market\nprice of an asset or an estimate based on the best information available in the circumstances. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized an\nimpairment loss of less than $0.1 million related to the abandonment of certain information technology implementation projects for which we had previously\ncapitalized expenses. There were no impairment losses for long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2019, or for intangible assets\nrecognized during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.\n70\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We qualitatively assess the carrying value of goodwill each reporting\nperiod for events or circumstance changes that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. During the fourth\nquarter of 2021, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test. Based on our assessment of certain qualitative factors such as macro-economic\nconditions, industry and market considerations, costs factors and overall financial performance, management concluded that the fair value of the goodwill was\nmore likely than not greater than its carrying amount as of December 31, 2021. No impairment charges related to goodwill were recognized during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nOther Non-Current Assets\nImplementation costs incurred for hosting arrangements that are related to service contracts are capitalized and amortized over the term of the arrangement.\nCapitalized implementation costs totaled $21.0 million and $13.5 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively and are included in other non-current\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We depreciate capitalized implementation costs on a straight-line basis over ten years. Amortization expense was $1.0\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is recorded almost entirely in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of\n(Loss) Income. No amortization expense was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nLiability for Warranty\nOur products generally include warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the time of product shipment based on our\nhistorical return rate and estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products. We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including\nactively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. The increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences, when they\narise, to be more costly. Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage and other rework costs\nincurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise. Should our actual\nexperience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to record additional warranty expense. The liability for warranty obligations\ntotaled $5.4 million and $7.1 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the\naccompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nA summary of warranty expense and write-off activity for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2021 2020 2019\nBalance at beginning of period $ 7,146 $ 8,394 $ 8,623\nPlus: Amounts charged to cost and expenses 855 1,538 4,569\nLess: Deductions (2,598) (2,786) (4,798)\nBalance at end of period $ 5,403 $ 7,146 $ 8,394\nPension Benefit Plan Obligations\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries. Pension benefit plan obligations are based on various assumptions\nused by our actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, compensation rate increases, expected return on plan assets,\nretirement rates and mortality rates. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in assumptions could affect future expenses and obligations. Our\nnet pension liability totaled $11.4 million and $18.7 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have two stock incentive plans from which stock options, performance stock units (“PSUs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock are available\nfor grant to employees and directors. Costs related to these awards are recognized over their vesting periods.\nStock-based compensation expense recognized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $7.5 million, $6.8 million, and $7.0\nmillion, respectively. See Note 5 for additional information.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs include compensation for engineers and support personnel, contracted services, depreciation and material costs associated with\nnew product development, enhancement of current products and product cost reductions. We continually evaluate new product opportunities and engage in\nintensive research for product and software development efforts. Research and\n71\ndevelopment costs totaled $108.7 million, $113.3 million and $126.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOther Comprehensive (Loss) Income\nThe following table presents changes in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax, by components of accumulated other comprehensive (loss)\nincome for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nUnrealized\nGains (Losses)\non Available- Defined Foreign\nfor-Sale Benefit Plan Currency ASU 2018-02\n(In thousands) Securities Adjustments Adjustments Adoption (1) Total\nBalance as of December 31, 2018 $ (563) $ (8,041) $ (5,812) $ — $ (14,416)\nOther comprehensive (loss) income before\nreclassifications 573 (1,717) (1,480) — (2,624)\nAmounts reclassified to retained earnings — — — 385 385\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other\ncomprehensive (loss) income (294) 532 — — 238\nBalance as of December 31, 2019 (284) (9,226) (7,292) 385 (16,417)\nOther comprehensive (loss) income before\nreclassifications 749 (1,231) 4,857 — 4,375\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other\ncomprehensive (loss) income (433) 836 — — 403\nBalance as of December 31, 2020 32 (9,621) (2,435) 385 (11,639)\nOther comprehensive (loss) income before\nreclassifications (705) 3,439 (3,699) — (965)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other\ncomprehensive (loss) income 121 569 — — 690\nBalance as of December 31, 2021 $ (552) $ (5,613) $ (6,134) $ 385 $ (11,914)\n(1)With the adoption of ASU 2018-02 on January 1, 2019, stranded tax effects related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 were reclassified to retained\nearnings.\nThe following tables present the details of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020\nand 2019:\n(In thousands) For the year ended December 31,\nAffected Line Item in the\nDetails about Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Statement Where Net (Loss)\nIncome Components 2021 2020 2019 Income Is Presented\nUnrealized (loss) gains on available-for-sale securities:\nNet realized (loss) gain on sales of securities $ (164) $ 585 $ 397 Net investment gain\n(1)\nDefined benefit plan adjustments – actuarial losses (825) (1,212) (771)\nTotal reclassifications for the period, before tax (989) (627) (374)\nTax benefit 299 224 136\nTotal reclassifications for the period, net of tax $ (690) $ (403) $ (238)\n72\n(1)Included in the computation of net periodic pension cost.

Under this approach, deferred taxes\nrepresent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes\nrepresents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from the difference between\nfinancial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when such changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are\nrecorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.\nWe establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain. We adjust\nthese reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, as facts and circumstances change.\n73\nForeign Currency\nTransactions with customers that are denominated in foreign currencies are recorded using the appropriate exchange rates from throughout the year. Assets and\nliabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the balance sheet dates using the closing rates of exchange between those foreign currencies and the\nfunctional currency with any transaction gains or losses reported in other income (expense). Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements\nare with our German subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Euro and our Australian subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Australian dollar.\nAdjustments resulting from translating financial statements of international subsidiaries are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss)\nincome.\nRevenue\nAccounting Policy under Topic 606\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a customer and as performance\nobligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied. Generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of a product to the customer. Review of contracts with\ncustomers, for both direct customers and distributors, are performed and assessment made regarding principal versus agent considerations to determine primary\nresponsibility for delivery of performance obligation, presumed inventory risk, and discretion in establishing pricing, when applicable. For transactions where there\nare multiple performance obligations, individual products and services are accounted for separately if they are distinct (if a product or service is separately\nidentifiable from other items and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer). The consideration,\nincluding any discounts, is allocated between separate products and services based on their stand-alone selling prices. Stand-alone selling prices are determined\nbased on the prices at which the separate products and services are sold and are allocated based on each item’s relative value to the total value of the products and\nservices in the arrangement. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate stand-alone selling prices primarily using the “expected cost plus a margin”\napproach. Payment terms are generally 30 days in the U.S. and typically longer in many geographic markets outside the U.S. Shipping fees are recorded as revenue\nand the related cost is included in cost of revenue. Revenue, value-added and other taxes collected concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded\nfrom revenue. Costs of obtaining a contract, if material, are capitalized and amortized over the period that the related revenue is recognized if greater than one year.\nWe have elected to account for shipping fees as a cost of fulfilling the related contract. We have also elected to apply the practical expedient related to the\nincremental costs of obtaining contracts and recognize those costs as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets is one year or less. These\ncosts are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Capitalized costs with an amortization period greater than one year were immaterial.\nRevenue is generated by two reportable segments: Network Solutions and Services & Support.\nNetwork Solutions Segment - Includes hardware products and software defined next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or business networks,\nas well as prior generation products. The majority of the revenue from this segment is from hardware revenue.\nHardware and Software Revenue\nRevenue from hardware sales is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally when the products are shipped. Shipping terms are\ngenerally FOB shipping point. Revenue from software license sales is recognized at delivery and transfer of control to the customer. Revenue is recorded net of\nestimated discounts and rebates using historical trends. Customers are typically invoiced when control is transferred and revenue is recognized. Our products\ngenerally include assurance-based warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects, which are accrued at the time products are delivered.\nServices & Support Segment - Includes a complete portfolio of maintenance, network implementation and solutions integration and managed services, which\ninclude hosted cloud services and subscription services to complement our Network Solutions segment.\nMaintenance Revenue\nOur maintenance service periods range from one month to five years. Customers are typically invoiced and pay for maintenance services at the beginning of the\nmaintenance period. We recognize revenue for maintenance services on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period as our customers benefit evenly\nthroughout the contract term and deferred revenue, when applicable, are recorded in current and non-current unearned revenue.\n74\nNetwork Implementation Revenue\nWe recognize revenue for network implementation, which primarily consists of engineering, execution and enablement services at a point in time when each\nperformance obligation is complete. If we have recognized revenue but have not billed the customer, the right to consideration is recognized as a contract asset that\nis included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when the completed performance\nobligation is invoiced to the customer.\nSee Notes 4 and 16 for additional information on reportable segments.\nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue primarily represents customer billings on maintenance service programs and unearned revenue related to multiple element contracts where we\nstill have contractual obligations to our customers. We currently offer maintenance contracts ranging from one month to five years. Revenue attributable to\nmaintenance contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over the related contract term. In addition, we provide software maintenance and a variety of hardware\nmaintenance services to customers under contracts with terms up to ten years. When we defer revenue related to multiple performance obligations where we still\nhave contractual obligations, we also defer the related costs. Current deferred costs are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the accompanying\nConsolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $0.7 million and $1.1 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Non-current deferred costs are included in\nother non-current assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $0.1 million as of December 31, 2021 and less than $0.1 million as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\n(Loss) Earnings per Share\n(Loss) earnings per common share and (loss) earnings per common share assuming dilution, are based on the weighted average number of common shares and,\nwhen dilutive, common equivalent shares outstanding during the year. See Note 19 for additional information.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company records assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, when applicable, and intangible assets recognized as part of business\ncombinations based on their fair values on the date of acquisition subject to purchase accounting adjustments. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated\nfair values of the net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed or acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the estimated fair values of net tangible and\nintangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceed the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recorded. The Company’s estimates of fair value are based\non historical experience, industry knowledge, certain information obtained from the management of the acquired company and, in some cases, valuations\nperformed by independent third-party firms. The results of operations of acquired companies are included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of (Loss)\nIncome since their dates of acquisition. Costs incurred to complete the Business Combination, such as legal, accounting or other professional fees are charged to\nselling, general and administrative expenses as incurred.\n75\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805)\nAccounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which would require an acquirer to recognize and measure acquired\ncontract assets and contract liabilities in a manner consistent with how the acquiree recognized and measured them in its pre-acquisition financial statements in\naccordance with Topic 606, Revenue Recognition. ASU 2021-08 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods\nwithin those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If early\nadopted, the amendments are applied retrospectively to all business combinations for which the acquisition date occurred during the fiscal year of adoption. We are\ncurrently assessing whether to early adopt ASU 2021-08 in anticipation of the closing of the Business Combination Agreement with ADVA. However, we are\nunable to estimate the effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the date of this report. For additional information on the Business Combination\nAgreement, see Note 3.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2018-14, Compensation – Retirement Benefits – Defined Benefit Plans – General (Subtopic\n715-20): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans, which makes changes to and clarifies the disclosure\nrequirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. ASU 2018-14 requires additional disclosures related to the reasons for significant\ngains and losses affecting the benefit obligation and an explanation of any other significant changes in the benefit obligation or plan assets that are not otherwise\napparent in other disclosures required by ASC 715. ASU 2018-14 also clarifies the guidance in ASC 715 to require disclosure of the projected benefit obligation\n(“PBO”) and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with PBOs in excess of plan assets and the accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) and fair value of plan\nassets for pension plans with ABOs in excess of plan assets. ASU 2018-14 was effective for public business entities for fiscal years ending after December 15,\n2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 15 for additional\ninformation.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which simplifies the accounting for\nincome taxes by removing various exceptions, such as the exception to the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing\noperations and income or a gain from other items. The amendments in this update also simplify the accounting for income taxes related to income-based franchise\ntaxes and require that an entity reflect enacted tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company early adopted ASU 2019-12 on April 1, 2020, which was applied on a prospective basis as if the Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2020.\nThe Company early adopted the standard to take advantage of the simplification of rules for income taxes on intra-period tax allocations. Specifically, the adoption\nof this standard resulted in the recognition of approximately $0.1 million of tax benefit in other comprehensive (loss) income, that otherwise would have been\nrecognized in continuing operations had the intra-period tax allocation been completed. There were no other impacts from this standard on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nNote 2 – Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the Consolidated Balance Sheet that sum to the total of\nthe same such amounts shown in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:\n(In thousands) December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\nCash and cash equivalents $ 56,603 $ 60,161\nRestricted cash 215 18\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 56,818 $ 60,179\nSee Note 17 for additional information regarding restricted cash.\n76\nNote 3 – Business Combination Agreement\nOn August 30, 2021, the Company and ADVA, entered into a business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”), pursuant to which both\ncompanies agreed to combine their respective businesses and each become subsidiaries of a new holding company, Acorn HoldCo, a Delaware corporation and\ncurrently a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the Company.\nUnder the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, Acorn MergeCo, Inc., a newly formed Delaware corporation and wholly-owned direct subsidiary of\nAcorn HoldCo (“Merger Sub”), will merge with and into ADTRAN, with ADTRAN surviving the merger (the “Merger”) as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of\nAcorn HoldCo. Pursuant to the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock of the Company will be converted into the right to receive one share of common\nstock of Acorn HoldCo. Acorn HoldCo has also made a public exchange offer to exchange each issued and outstanding no-par value bearer share of ADVA,\npursuant to which each ADVA share tendered and accepted for exchange will be exchanged for 0.8244 shares of common stock of Acorn HoldCo (the “Exchange\nOffer”, and together with the Merger, the “Business Combination”). Upon completion of the Business Combination, and assuming that all of the outstanding\nADVA shares are exchanged in the Exchange Offer, former ADTRAN stockholders and former ADVA shareholders will own approximately 54% and 46%,\nrespectively, of the outstanding Acorn HoldCo shares.\nThe Business Combination Agreement was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of the Company and by the supervisory board and management board\nof ADVA. On January 6, 2022, the Company's stockholders approved the Business Combination by an overwhelming majority. The end of the ADVA shareholder\ntender offer acceptance period was on January 26, 2022, which resulted in the acceptance of the Exchange Offer by more than 60% of all shares of ADVA entitled\nto voting rights existing as of October 31, 2021, thus exceeding the required minimum acceptance threshold. According to the rules of the German Securities\nAcquisition and Takeover Act, ADVA shareholders who did not tender their shares during the initial acceptance period could do so during a two-week additional\nacceptance period that began on February 1, 2022 and ended February 14, 2022. This resulted in the acceptance of the Exchange Offer by approximately 66% of all\nshares of ADVA entitled to voting rights existing as of November 30, 2021. On January 24, 2022, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States\n(\"CFIUS\") completed its review of the Business Combination and determined that the transaction was not a “covered transaction” subject to CFIUS’ jurisdiction,\nsatisfying the condition of the Business Combination Agreement related to CFIUS notification. On February 16, 2022, the U.K. Secretary of State for Business,\nEnergy and Industrial Strategy completed its review of the Business Combination and determined that the Secretary of State will be taking no further action under\nthe NS&I Act, satisfying the condition of the Business Combination Agreement related to NS&I Act approval.

No additional awards will be granted under the Company’s previous stock incentive plans, the ADTRAN, Inc. 2015 Employee Stock Incentive\nPlan (the “2015 Employee Plan”) or the 2010 Directors Stock Plan (the “2010 Directors Plan”) subsequent to the stockholders’ approval of these new stock plans.\nOutstanding awards granted under the 2015 Employee Plan and the 2010 Directors Plan will remain subject to the terms of such plans, and shares underlying\nawards granted under such plans that are cancelled or forfeited will be available for issuance under the 2020 Employee Plan or the 2020 Directors Plan, as\napplicable.\nUnder the 2020 Employee Plan, the Company is authorized to issue 2.8 million shares of common stock to certain employees, key service providers and advisors\nthrough incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs and restricted stock, any of which may be subject to performance-\nbased conditions. RSUs and restricted stock granted under the 2020 Employee Plan will typically vest pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning on the\nfirst anniversary of the grant date. Stock options granted under the 2020 Employee Plan will typically become exercisable beginning after one year of continued\nemployment, normally pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and have a ten-year contractual term. Stock\noptions, RSUs and restricted stock granted under the 2020 Employee Plan reduce the shares authorized for issuance under the 2020 Employee Plan by one share of\ncommon stock for each share underlying the award. Forfeitures, cancellations or expirations of awards granted under the 2015 Employee Plan increase the shares\nauthorized for issuance under the 2020 Employee Plan, with forfeitures, cancellations or expirations of RSUs and restricted stock increasing the shares authorized\nfor issuance by 2.5 shares of common stock for each share underlying the award. Forfeitures, cancellations or expirations of stock options from the 2015 Employee\nPlan increase the shares authorized for issuance under the 2020 Employee Plan by one share of common stock for each share underlying the award.\nUnder the 2020 Directors Plan, the Company is authorized to issue 0.4 million shares of common stock through stock options, restricted stock and RSUs to non-\nemployee directors. Stock awards issued under the 2020 Directors Plan typically will become vested in full on the first anniversary of the grant date. Stock options\nissued under the 2020 Directors Plan will have a ten-year contractual term. Stock options, restricted stock and RSUs granted under the 2020 Directors Plan reduce\nthe shares authorized for issuance under the 2020 Directors Plan by one share of common stock for each share underlying the award. Forfeitures, cancellations and\nexpirations of awards granted under the 2010 Directors Stock Plan increase the shares authorized for issuance under the 2020 Directors Plan by one share of\ncommon stock for each share underlying the award.\nPrevious Stock Incentive Plans\nIn January 2015, the Board of Directors adopted the 2015 Employee Plan, which authorized 7.7 million shares of common stock for issuance to certain employees\nand officers through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock. The 2015 Employee Plan\nwas adopted by stockholder approval at our annual meeting of stockholders held in May 2015. PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock granted under the 2015 Plan reduce\nthe shares authorized for issuance under the 2015 Employee Plan by 2.5 shares of common stock for each share underlying the award. Options granted under the\n2015 Employee Plan typically become exercisable beginning after one year of continued employment, normally pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning\non the first anniversary of the grant date and have a ten-year contractual term. Expiration dates of options outstanding as of December 31, 2021 under the 2015\nEmployee Plan range from 2025 to 2026.\n79\nIn January 2006, the Board of Directors adopted the ADTRAN, Inc. 2006 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”), which authorized 13.0 million shares\nof common stock for issuance to officers and certain employees through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs\nand restricted stock. Options granted under the 2006 Plan typically become exercisable beginning after one year of continued employment, normally pursuant to a\nfour-year vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and had a ten-year contractual term. The 2006 Plan was replaced in May 2015 by the\n2015 Employee Plan. Expiration dates of options outstanding as of December 31, 2021 under the 2006 Plan range from 2022 to 2024.\nIn May 2010, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2010 Directors Plan, under which 0.5 million shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance.\nThis plan replaced the 2005 Directors Stock Option Plan. Under the 2010 Directors Plan, the Company may issue stock options, restricted stock and RSUs to our\nnon-employee directors. Stock awards issued under the 2010 Directors Plan become vested in full on the first anniversary of the grant date. Options issued under\nthe 2010 Directors Plan had a ten-year contractual term. All remaining options under the 2010 Directors Plan expired in 2019.\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock\nThe following table is a summary of our PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 and the changes that occurred during\n2021:\nWeighted\nNumber of Average Grant\nshares (In thousands) Date Fair Value\nUnvested PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding, December 31, 2020 1,846 $ 11.49\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock granted 748 $ 20.17\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock vested (552) $ 13.67\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock forfeited (112) $ 11.70\nUnvested PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding, December 31, 2021 1,930 $ 14.11\nThe following table details the significant assumptions that impact the fair value estimate of the market-based PSUs:\n2021 2020 2019\nEstimated fair value per share $26.07 $14.43 $9.53 to $18.05\nExpected volatility 53.27% 51.88% 32.7% to 38.9%\nRisk-free interest rate 0.85% 0.24% 1.6% to 2.46%\nExpected dividend yield 1.63% 2.85% 2.3% to 4.09%\n80\nFor market-based PSUs, the number of shares of common stock earned by a recipient is subject to a market condition based on ADTRAN’s relative total\nshareholder return against all companies in the NASDAQ Telecommunications Index at the end of a three-year performance period. Depending on the relative total\nshareholder return over the performance period, the recipient may earn from 0% to 150% of the shares underlying the PSUs, with the shares earned distributed\nupon the vesting. The fair value of the award is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the expected outcome of the\nimpact of market conditions using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method. A portion of the granted PSUs vests and the underlying shares become deliverable\nupon the death or disability of the recipient or upon a change of control of ADTRAN, as defined by the 2020 Employee Plan. The recipients of the PSUs receive\ndividend credits based on the shares of common stock underlying the PSUs. The dividend credits vest and are earned in the same manner as the PSUs and are paid\nin cash upon the issuance of common stock for the PSUs.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021 and 2020, the Company issued 0.6 million performance-based PSUs under the 2015 Employee Plan to its executive officers and\ncertain other employees as noted. The grant-date fair value of these performance-based awards is based on the closing price of the Company’s stock on the date of\ngrant. Subject to the grantee’s continued employment, the grantee has the ability to earn shares in a range of 0% to 142.8% of the awarded number of PSUs based\non the achievement of a defined performance target at the end of a three-year period. If the Company achieves the performance target at the end of the first or\nsecond year during the vesting period, the grantee will be entitled to the target number of performance shares, which will be issued at the end of the three-year\nperiod. Equity-based compensation expense with respect to these awards will be adjusted over the vesting period to reflect the probability of achievement of the\nperformance target defined in the award agreements.\nThe fair value of RSUs and restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the grant date. RSUs and restricted stock vest ratably over four-year and\none-year periods, respectively.\nWe will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation. If circumstances change, and\nadditional data becomes available over time, we may change our assumptions and methodologies, which may materially impact our fair value determination.\nAs of December 31, 2021, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the non-vested portion of market-based PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock was\napproximately $17.5 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 2.9 years and will be adjusted for actual\nforfeitures as they occur.\nAs of December 31, 2021, 3.8 million shares were available for issuance under shareholder-approved equity plans in connection with the grant and exercise of\nstock options, PSU’s, RSU’s or restricted stock.\nStock Options\nThe following table is a summary of stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the changes that occurred during 2021:\nWeighted Weighted Avg.\nNumber of Average Remaining Aggregate\nOptions Exercise Price Contractual Life Intrinsic Value\n(In thousands) (Per share) in Years (In thousands)\nStock options outstanding, December 31, 2020 2,718 $ 21.17 2.86 $ —\nStock options granted — $ — $ —\nStock options exercised (382) $ 16.82 $ 1,491\nStock options forfeited — $ — $ —\nStock options expired (615) $ 28.89 $ 21\nStock options outstanding, December 31, 2021 1,721 $ 19.37 2.39 $ 6,669\nStock options exercisable, December 31, 2021 1,721 $ 19.37 2.39 $ 6,669\nAll of these stock options were issued at exercise prices that approximated fair market value at the date of grant. As of December 31, 2021, there was no\nunrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options.\nThe aggregate intrinsic values represent the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between ADTRAN’s closing stock price on the last trading day of 2021 and\nthe exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their\noptions on December 31, 2021. The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of ADTRAN’s stock and was $6.7 million as of\nDecember 31, 2021.\nThe total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $1.5 million, $0 and $0.1 million, respectively. The fair value of options fully\nvesting during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $0, less than $0.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively.\n81\nThe following table further describes our stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2021:\nOptions Outstanding Options Exercisable\nOptions Weighted Avg.

The\nBlack-Scholes Model requires the input of certain assumptions that involve judgment. Because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from\nthose of traded options, and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, existing models may not provide reliable\nmeasures of fair value of our stock options. The stock option pricing model requires the use of several assumptions that impact the fair value estimate. These\nvariables include, but are not limited to, the volatility of our stock price and employee exercise behaviors.\nThere were no stock options granted in during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nNote 6 – Investments\nDebt Securities and Other Investments\nAs of December 31, 2021, the following debt securities and other investments were included in short-term investments and long-term investments on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet and recorded at fair value:\nAmortized Gross Unrealized Fair\n(In thousands) Cost Gains Losses Value\nCorporate bonds $ 10,776 $ 6 $ (35) $ 10,747\nMunicipal fixed-rate bonds 1,553 2 (4) 1,551\nAsset-backed bonds 322 3 (3) 322\nMortgage/Agency-backed bonds 4,754 15 (33) 4,736\nU.S. government bonds 12,251 12 (92) 12,171\nForeign government bonds 543 — (4) 539\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities held at fair value $ 30,199 $ 38 $ (171) $ 30,066\nAs of December 31, 2020, the following debt securities and other investments were included in short-term investments and long-term investments on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet and recorded at fair value:\nAmortized Gross Unrealized Fair\n(In thousands) Cost Gains Losses Value\nCorporate bonds $ 11,762 $ 123 $ — $ 11,885\nMunicipal fixed-rate bonds 2,854 30 — 2,884\nAsset-backed bonds 6,634 74 — 6,708\nMortgage/Agency-backed bonds 11,536 114 (6) 11,644\nU.S. government bonds 9,763 112 — 9,875\nForeign government bonds 1,334 4 (1) 1,337\nCommercial Paper 250 — — 250\nOther 533 — — 533\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities held at fair value $ 44,666 $ 457 $ (7) $ 45,116\n82\nAs of December 31, 2021, our debt securities had the following contractual maturities:\nMunicipal Mortgage / U.S. Foreign\nCorporate fixed-rate Asset-backed Agency-backed government government\n(In thousands) bonds bonds bonds bonds bonds bonds\nLess than one year $ 681 $ 150 $ — $ 801 $ 1,884 $ —\nOne to two years 4,902 1,018 — 868 5,320 245\nTwo to three years 4,333 265 29 — 4,421 294\nThree to five years 831 118 — 324 546 —\nFive to ten years — — — 1,125 — —\nMore than ten years — — 293 1,618 — —\nTotal $ 10,747 $ 1,551 $ 322 $ 4,736 $ 12,171 $ 539\nActual maturities may differ from contractual maturities as some borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment\npenalties.\nRealized gains and losses on sales of securities are computed under the specific identification method.

Market prices are obtained from a variety of industry\nstandard data providers, large financial institutions and other third-party sources. These multiple market prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based\nalgorithm to determine the daily market value of each security.\nThe fair value of Level 3 securities is calculated based on unobservable inputs. Quantitative information with respect to unobservable inputs consisted of third-\nparty valuations performed in accordance with ASC 820 – Fair Value Measurement. Inputs used in preparing the third-party valuation included the following\nassumptions, among others: estimated discount rates and fair market yields.\nOur variable rate demand notes have a structure that implies a standard expected market price. The frequent interest rate resets make it reasonable to expect the\nprice to stay at par. These securities are priced at the expected market price.\nNote 7 – Inventory\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, inventory, net was comprised of the following:\n(In thousands) 2021 2020\nRaw materials $ 74,709 $ 47,026\nWork in process 2,143 776\nFinished goods 63,039 77,655\nTotal Inventory, net $ 139,891 $ 125,457\nInventory reserves are established for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net\nrealizable value of the inventory based on estimated reserve percentages, which consider historical usage, known trends, inventory age and market conditions. As\nof December 31, 2021 and 2020, our inventory reserve was $44.6 million and $39.6 million, respectively.\nNote 8 – Property, Plant and Equipment\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, property, plant and equipment, net was comprised of the following:\n(In thousands) 2021 2020\nLand $ 4,575 $ 4,575\nBuilding and land improvements 35,578 35,142\nBuilding 68,157 68,169\nFurniture and fixtures 19,917 19,965\nComputer hardware and software 72,274 70,942\nEngineering and other equipment 134,771 132,920\nTotal Property, Plant and Equipment 335,272 331,713\nLess: accumulated depreciation (279,506) (269,314)\nTotal Property, Plant and Equipment, net $ 55,766 $ 62,399\nLong-lived assets used in operations are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may\nnot be recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value. No impairment charges were\nrecognized during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company recognized impairment\ncharges of $0.1 million and $3.9 million, respectively, related to the abandonment of certain information technology projects in which we had previously\ncapitalized expenses related to these projects. The impairment charges were determined based on actual costs incurred as part of the projects.\nDepreciation expense was $12.0 million, $12.2 million and $12.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which is recorded\nin cost of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income.\n86\nNote 9 – Leases\nWe have operating leases for office space, automobiles and various other equipment in the U.S. and in certain international locations. Other contracts, such as\nmanufacturing agreements and service agreements, are reviewed to determine if they contain potential embedded leases. These other contracts are specifically\nreviewed to determine whether we have the right to substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of any specified assets or the right to direct the use of any\nspecified assets, either of which would indicate the existence of a lease.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our operating leases had remaining lease terms of one month to forty four months, some of which included options to extend the leases\nfor up to two years, and some of which included options to terminate the leases within three months. For those leases that are reasonably assured to be renewed, we\nhave included the option to extend as part of our right of use asset and lease liability. Supplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases is as\nfollows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n(In thousands) Classification 2021 2020\nAssets\nOperating lease assets Other non-current assets $ 4,922 $ 5,309\nTotal lease asset $ 4,922 $ 5,309\nLiabilities\nCurrent operating lease liability Accrued expenses and other liabilities $ 1,730 $ 1,806\nNon-current operating lease liability Other non-current liabilities 3,269 3,574\nTotal lease liability $ 4,999 $ 5,380\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over\nthe lease term. Lease expense related to these short-term leases was less than $0.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and was $0.4\nmillion of the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, and is included in cost of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and\ndevelopment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income. Lease expense related to variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate,\nsuch as real estate taxes and insurance reimbursements, was $0.5 million, $0.7 million and $0.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and\n2019, respectively. For lease agreements entered into or reassessed after the adoption of Topic 842, we elected to not separate lease and non-lease components. Our\nlease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nThe components of lease expense included in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income were as follows:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2021 2020 2019\nCost of revenue $ 51 $ 113 $ 64\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 883 1,311 1,400\nResearch and development expenses 1,071 1,121 2,417\nTotal operating lease expense $ 2,005 $ 2,545 $ 3,881\nAs of December 31, 2021, operating lease liabilities included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet by future maturity were as follows:\n(In thousands) Amount\n2022 1,767\n2023 1,419\n2024 1,188\n2025 710\nThereafter —\nTotal lease payments 5,084\nLess: Interest (85)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 4,999\nFuture operating lease payments include $1.6 million related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised. There are no legally\nbinding leases that have not yet commenced.\n87\nAn incremental borrowing rate is used based on information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The\nincremental borrowing rate is determined on a portfolio basis by grouping leases with similar terms as well as grouping leases based on a U.S. dollar or Euro\nfunctional currency. The actual rate is then determined based on a credit spread over LIBOR as well as the Bloomberg Curve Matrix for the U.S. Communications\nsection. The following table provides information about our weighted average lease terms and weighted average discount rates:\nAs of December 31,\nWeighted average remaining lease term (years) 2021 2020\nOperating leases with USD functional currency 1.8 2.4\nOperating leases with Euro functional currency 3.5 3.6\nWeighted average discount rate\nOperating leases with USD functional currency 3.49% 4.47%\nOperating leases with Euro functional currency 1.22% 1.37%\nSupplemental cash flow information related to operating leases is as follows:\nFor the year ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2021 2020 2019\nCash used in operating activities related to operating leases $ 1,892 $ 2,632 $ 3,439\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations $ 1,875 $ 324 $ 11,615\nSales-Type Leases\nWe are the lessor in sales-type lease arrangements for network equipment, which have initial terms of up to five years. Our sales-type lease arrangements contain\neither a provision whereby the network equipment reverts back to us upon the expiration of the lease or a provision that allows the lessee to purchase the network\nequipment at a bargain purchase amount at the end of the lease. In addition, our sales-type lease arrangements do not contain any residual value guarantees or\nmaterial restrictive covenants. The allocation of the consideration between lease and non-lease components is determined by stand-alone selling price by\ncomponent. The net investment in sales-type leases consists of lease receivables less unearned income. Collectability of sales-type leases is evaluated periodically\nat an individual customer level. The Company has elected to exclude taxes related to sales-type leases from revenue and the associated expense of such taxes. As of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not have an allowance for credit losses for our net investment in sales-type leases. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the\ncomponents of the net investment in sales-type leases were as follows:\nAs of December 31,\n(In thousands) 2021 2020\nCurrent minimum lease payments receivable(1) $ 92 $ 702\nNon-current minimum lease payments receivable(2) 4 347\nTotal minimum lease payments receivable 96 1,049\nLess: Current unearned revenue(1) 70 218\nLess: Non-current unearned revenue(2) 1 50\nNet investment in sales-type leases $ 25 $ 781\n(1)Included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(2)Included in other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nComponents of gross profit related to sales-type lease recognized at the lease commencement date and interest and dividend income, included in the Consolidated\nStatements of (Loss) Income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\nFor the year ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2021 2020 2019\nRevenue - Network Solutions $ 22 $ 78 $ 1,723\nCost of revenue - Network Solutions 5 32 675\nGross profit $ 17 $ 46 $ 1,048\nInterest and dividend income $ 27 $ 42 $ 357\n88\nAs of December 31, 2021 future minimum lease payments to be received from sales-type leases were as follows:\n(In thousands) Amount\n2022 $ 92\n2023 4\n2024 —\n2025 —\n2026 —\nThereafter —\nTotal $ 96\nNote 10 – Goodwill\nGoodwill was $7.0 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 of which $6.6 million and $0.4 million was allocated to our Network Solutions and\nServices & Support reportable segments, respectively.\nNote 11 – Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, consisted of the following:\n2021 2020\nAccumulated Accumulated\n(In thousands) Gross Value Amortization Net Value Gross Value Amortization Net Value\nCustomer relationships $ 20,796 $ (9,906) $ 10,890 $ 21,123 $ (8,055) $ 13,068\nDeveloped technology 8,200 (3,683) 4,517 8,200 (2,546) 5,654\nLicensed technology 5,900 (2,486) 3,414 5,900 (1,830) 4,070\nSupplier relationships — — — 2,800 (2,800) —\nLicensing agreements 560 (225) 335 560 (152) 408\nPatents 500 (363) 137 500 (294) 206\nTrade names 210 (210) — 210 (146) 64\nTotal $ 36,166 $ (16,873) $ 19,293 $ 39,293 $ (15,823) $ 23,470\nThe Company evaluates the carrying value of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not\nbe recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value.

The Revolving Credit Agreement provides the Company with a $10.0 million secured\nrevolving credit facility. Loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to 1.50% over the screen rate as obtained by Reuter’s,\nBloomberg or another commercially available source as may be designated by the Lender from time to time; provided, however, that in no event shall the\napplicable rate of interest under the Revolving Credit Agreement be less than 1.50% per annum. Such loans are secured by all of the cash, securities, securities\nentitlements and investment property in a certain bank account, as outlined in the Revolving Credit Agreement, at a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75%\ndetermined by dividing the full commitment amount under the Revolving Credit Agreement on the date of testing, determined by the Lender each fiscal quarter, by\nthe market value of the collateral. The Revolving Credit Agreement matures on November 3, 2022, subject to earlier termination upon the concurrence of certain\nevents of default. The Company entered into the Revolving Credit Agreement in order to increase the flexibility and management of its short-term liquidity. During\nthe fourth quarter of 2021, the Company made draws totaling $10.0 million under the Revolving Credit Agreement all of which had been repaid as of December\n31, 2021. The Company agreed to certain negative covenants that are customary for credit arrangements of this type, including, among other things, restrictions on\nthe Company’s ability to enter into mergers, acquisitions or other business combination transactions, grant liens or suffer a material adverse change in the condition\nor affairs (financial or otherwise) of the Company. The Company must be in compliance with all covenants to be able to draw on the line of credit.\nNote 13 – Alabama State Industrial Development Authority Financing\nIn conjunction with the 1995 expansion of our Huntsville, Alabama facility, we were approved for participation in an incentive program offered by the State of\nAlabama Industrial Development Authority (the “Authority”). Pursuant to the program, in January 1995, the Authority issued $20.0 million of its taxable revenue\nbonds (the “Taxable Revenue Bonds”) and loaned the proceeds from the sale of the Taxable Revenue Bonds to the Company. Further advances on the Taxable\nRevenue Bonds were made by the Authority, bringing the total amount to $50.0 million. The Taxable Revenue Bonds bore interest, payable monthly with an\ninterest rate of 2% per annum. The Taxable Revenue Bonds aggregate principal amount of $24.6 million matured on January 1, 2020 and was repaid in full on\nJanuary 2, 2020, using the funds held in a certificate of deposit by the Company.\nNote 14 – Income Taxes\nThe components of income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\n(In thousands) 2021 2020 2019\nCurrent\nFederal $ 11 $ (10,574) $ (518)\nState (63) (329) (1,065)\nInternational 4,166 3,635 (282)\nTotal Current 4,114 (7,268) (1,865)\nDeferred\nFederal — — 24,801\nState — — 5,815\nInternational (1,784) (1,356) (546)\nTotal Deferred (1,784) (1,356) 30,070\nTotal Income Tax Expense (Benefit) $ 2,330 $ (8,624) $ 28,205\n90\nThe effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate due to the following:\n2021 2020 2019\nTax provision computed at the federal statutory rate 21.00% 21.00% 21.00%\nState income tax provision, net of federal benefit 13.33 11.10 6.97\nFederal research credits 53.77 57.63 15.53\nForeign taxes (4.69) (17.83) 2.83\nTax-exempt income 3.75 1.93 0.49\nState tax incentives — — 3.85\nChange in valuation allowance (75.26) 44.79 (172.82)\nNon-deductible transaction costs (39.48) — —\nForeign tax credits 0.14 17.90 16.69\nStock-based compensation 10.74 (23.36) (6.01)\nWithholding taxes 0.14 (20.83) —\nAlabama law change (25.39) — —\nImpact of CARES Act — 45.65 —\nReturn to accrual 9.48 — —\nGlobal intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") (4.29) (0.49) (1.87)\nOther, net (0.19) 0.56 (0.49)\nEffective Tax Rate (36.95)% 138.05% (113.83)%\n(Loss) income before expense (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\n(In thousands) 2021 2020 2019\nU.S. entities $ (14,982) $ (12,833) $ (29,829)\nInternational entities 8,677 6,587 5,052\nTotal $ (6,305) $ (6,246) $ (24,777)\n(Loss) income before expense (benefit) for income taxes for international entities reflects (loss) income based on statutory transfer pricing agreements.

Subsequently, the Internal Revenue Service\n(“IRS”) released its final GILTI regulations on July 9, 2020. The passage of the CARES Act and subsequent issuance of the GILTI final regulations together\nresulted in the Company’s recognition of a tax benefit in the amount of $10.8 million during 2020, $7.9 million of which related to the utilization of deferred tax\nassets which had previously been offset with a valuation allowance and $2.9 million primarily related to the tax rate differential on carrying back losses from 2018\nand 2019 tax years to prior years in which the U.S. Corporate tax rate was 35% versus the current 21% federal tax rate.\nOn February 12, 2021, the Alabama Business Tax Competitiveness Act (the \"Act\") was signed into law. As a result of the Act, we recognized an expense of $1.6\nmillion in the three months ended March 31, 2021 related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets, which was offset by changes in our valuation allowance\npreviously recorded against our domestic deferred tax assets.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2021, Management decided to pursue a claim for refund related to the revocation of our IRC Section 59(e) election\nthat was made on our originally filed 2018 U.S. federal tax return. The Company filed a related carryback claim of net operating losses generated in 2018 to prior\nyears as allowed under the CARES Act that was passed in 2020. An IRS Section 59(e) election is generally non-revocable except in cases for which IRS\nCommissioner’s approval is given. Approval is granted only in rare and unusual circumstances. We filed a private letter ruling (“PLR”) request to revoke our\nelection. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, a response to our PLR was published denying our request to revoke the previously made 59(e). As a\nresult of these filings, and Management’s position to pursue them through appeals, we have established a receivable in the amount of $15.2 million and a deferred\ntax asset related to additional research and development credit carryforward in the amount of $1.8 million that would be available if our revocation request is\nsuccessful, offset with an uncertain tax liability of $17.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, non-current deferred taxes reflected deferred taxes on net unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments and\ndeferred taxes on unrealized losses in our pension plan. The net change in non-current deferred taxes associated with these items, which resulted in a deferred tax\nexpense of $1.6 million and a deferred tax benefit of $0.1 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, was recorded as an adjustment to other comprehensive (loss)\nincome, presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income.\n92\nThe Company continually reviews the adequacy of its valuation allowance and recognizes the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that\nit is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recognized in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Our assessment of the realizability of our\ndeferred tax assets includes the evaluation of evidence, some of which requires significant judgment, including historical operating results, the evaluation of a\nthree-year cumulative income position, future taxable income projections and tax planning strategies. Should management’s conclusion change in the future and\nadditional valuation allowance or a partial or full release of the valuation allowance become necessary, it could have a material effect on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had gross deferred tax assets totaling $59.6 million offset by a valuation allowance totaling $50.6 million and\ngross deferred tax assets totaling $55.7 million offset by a valuation allowance of $45.8 million, respectively. Of the current valuation allowance, $48.3 million was\nestablished against our domestic deferred tax assets and the remaining $2.3 million is related to foreign net operating loss and research and development credit\ncarryforwards where we lacked sufficient activity to realize those deferred tax assets. The change in our valuation allowance for the year ending December 31,\n2021 was an increase of $4.7 million. The change in the valuation allowance was primarily related to increases in our deferred tax assets during the year related to\ngenerated federal research and development credit carryforwards. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining $9.1 million in deferred tax assets that were not offset\nby a valuation allowance were located in various foreign jurisdictions where the Company believed it was more likely than not it will realize these deferred tax\nassets.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2021\n(In thousands) Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance Deferred Tax Assets, net\nDomestic $ 48,265 $ (48,265) $ —\nInternational 11,378 (2,299) 9,079\nTotal $ 59,643 $ (50,564) $ 9,079\nDecember 31, 2020\n(In thousands) Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance Deferred Tax Assets, net\nDomestic $ 43,791 $ (43,791) $ —\nInternational 11,896 (2,027) 9,869\nTotal $ 55,687 $ (45,818) $ 9,869\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the deferred tax assets for foreign and domestic loss carry-forwards, research and development tax credits, unamortized\nresearch and development costs and state credit carry-forwards totaled $39.7 million and $37.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, $27.3 million of\nthese deferred tax assets will expire at various times between 2022 and 2041. The remaining deferred tax assets will either amortize through 2029 or carryforward\nindefinitely.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, our cash and cash equivalents were $56.6 million and $60.2 million and short-term investments were $0.4 million\nand $3.1 million, which provided available short-term liquidity of $57.0 million and $63.3 million. Of these amounts, our foreign subsidiaries held cash of $47.7\nmillion and $49.7 million, respectively, representing approximately 83.5% and 78.5% of available short-term liquidity, which is used to fund ongoing liquidity\nneeds of these subsidiaries. As part of our restructuring plan, the Company’s assertion on being indefinitely reinvested changed in a particular jurisdiction in a\nprevious year. The Company has a withholding tax liability of $0.7 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company maintains its assertion in all other\njurisdictions that it is indefinitely reinvesting its funds held in foreign jurisdictions outside of the U.S., except to the extent any of these funds can be repatriated\nwithout withholding tax. However, if all of these funds were repatriated to the U.S., or used for U.S. operations, certain amounts could be subject to tax. Due to the\ntiming and circumstances of repatriation of such earnings, if any, it is not practicable to determine the amount of funds subject to unrecognized deferred tax\nliability.\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, no income tax benefit or expense was recorded for stock options exercised as an adjustment to equity.\n93\nThe change in the unrecognized income tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2021 2020 2019\nBalance at beginning of period $ 1,078 $ 1,487 $ 1,868\nIncreases for tax position related to:\nPrior years 17,025 4 —\nCurrent year 136 165 161\nDecreases for tax positions related to:\nPrior years (27) — (71)\nExpiration of applicable statute of limitations (376) (578) (471)\nBalance at end of period $ 17,836 $ 1,078 $ 1,487\nAs of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our total liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $17.8 million, $1.1 million and $1.5 million, respectively, of which\n$17.8 million, $1.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively, would reduce our effective tax rate if we were successful in upholding all of the uncertain positions and\nrecognized the amounts recorded. We classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the balances of accrued interest and penalties were $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively.\nWe do not anticipate a single tax position generating a significant increase or decrease in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of this\nreporting date, unless a resolution is reached regarding the appeal of our PLR denial noted above. We file income tax returns in the U.S. for federal and various\nstate jurisdictions and several foreign jurisdictions. We are not currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. Generally, we are not subject to changes in\nincome taxes by any taxing jurisdiction for the years prior to 2018.\nNote 15 – Employee Benefit Plans\nPension Benefit Plan\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries.\nThe pension benefit plan obligations and funded status as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2021 2020\nChange in projected benefit obligation:\nProjected benefit obligation at beginning of period $ 50,927 $ 43,902\nService cost 1,229 1,270\nInterest cost 339 444\nActuarial gain - experience (750) (744)\nActuarial (gain) loss - assumptions (3,327) 2,458\nBenefit payments (756) (509)\nEffects of foreign currency exchange rate changes (3,498) 4,106\nProjected benefit obligation at end of period 44,164 50,927\nChange in plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of period 32,263 28,016\nActual gain on plan assets 2,943 1,744\nContributions — 24\nEffects of foreign currency exchange rate changes (2,444) 2,479\nFair value of plan assets at end of period 32,762 32,263\nUnfunded status at end of period $ (11,402) $ (18,664)\nThe accumulated benefit obligation was $44.2 million and $50.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in the accumulated benefit\nobligation, projected benefit obligation and the actuarial loss was primarily attributable to an increase in the discount rate during 2021.\n94\nThe net amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the unfunded pension liability as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2021 2020\nCurrent liability $ — $ —\nPension liability 11,402 18,664\nTotal $ 11,402 $ 18,664\nThe components of net periodic pension cost, other than the service cost component, are included in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of\n(Loss) Income. The components of net periodic pension cost and amounts recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income for the years ended December 31,\n2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2021 2020 2019\nNet periodic benefit cost:\nService cost $ 1,229 $ 1,270 $ 1,471\nInterest cost 339 444 634\nExpected return on plan assets (1,842) (1,679) (1,392)\nAmortization of actuarial losses 1,088 970 795\nNet periodic benefit cost 814 1,005 1,508\nOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations\nrecognized in other comprehensive (loss) income:\nNet actuarial (gain) loss (4,984) 1,784 2,488\nAmortization of actuarial losses (825) (1,212) (771)\nAmount recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income (5,809) 572 1,717\nTotal recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other\ncomprehensive (loss) income $ (4,995) $ 1,577 $ 3,225\nThe amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2021 2020\nNet actuarial loss $ (7,736) $ (13,545)\nThe defined benefit pension plan is accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the use of various assumptions, including an expected rate of return on plan\nassets and a discount rate. The expected return on our German plan assets that is utilized in determining the benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost is\nderived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using\nstandard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent\nplan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return. The discount rate has been derived from the returns of\nhigh-quality, corporate bonds denominated in Euro currency with durations close to the duration of our pension obligations.\nThe weighted-average assumptions that were used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as\nfollows:\n2021 2020 2019\nDiscount rate 1.16% 1.00% 1.75%\nRate of compensation increase 2.00% 2.00% 2.00%\nExpected long-term rates of return 5.90% 5.90% 5.90%\nThe weighted-average assumptions that were used to determine the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n2021 2020\nDiscount rate 1.16% 0.69%\nRate of compensation increase 2.00% 2.00%\nActuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. To the extent unamortized gains and losses exceed 10% of the higher of\nthe market-related value of assets or the projected benefit obligation, the excess is amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost over the remaining\nservice period of active participants.\n95\nWe do not anticipate making any contributions to the pension plan in 2022.\nThe following pension benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid to participants:\n(In thousands)\n2022 $ 1,088\n2023 1,002\n2024 1,204\n2025 1,244\n2026 1,370\n2027 - 2031 8,894\nTotal $ 14,802\nU.S. GAAP establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy based upon observable and unobservable inputs for fair value measurement of financial instruments:\n•Level 1 – Observable outputs; values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market;\n•Level 2 – Significant inputs that are observable; values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either\ndirectly or indirectly;\n•Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs; values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the\noverall fair value measurement. These inputs could include information supplied by investees.\nWe have categorized our cash equivalents and our investments held at fair value into this hierarchy as follows:\nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2021 Using\nQuoted Prices Significant\nin Active Other Significant\nMarkets for Observable Unobservable\nIdentical Assets Inputs Inputs\n(In thousands) Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 801 $ 801 $ — $ —\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nBond funds:\nCorporate bonds 7,528 7,528 — —\nGovernment bonds 5,721 5,721 — —\nEquity funds:\nGlobal equity 12,170 12,170 — —\nBalanced fund 2,919 2,919 — —\nEmerging markets 2,259 2,259 — —\nLarge cap value 235 235 — —\nGlobal real estate fund 1,129 1,129 — —\nAvailable-for-sale securities 31,961 31,961 — —\nTotal $ 32,762 $ 32,762 $ — $ —\n96\nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2020 Using\nQuoted Prices Significant\nin Active Other Significant\nMarkets for Observable Unobservable\nIdentical Assets Inputs Inputs\n(In thousands) Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,935 $ 1,935 $ — $ —\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nBond funds:\nCorporate bonds 6,746 6,746 — —\nGovernment bonds 5,971 5,971 — —\nEmerging markets bonds 307 307 — —\nEquity funds:\nGlobal equity 11,638 11,638 — —\nBalanced fund 2,515 2,515 — —\nEmerging markets 1,848 1,848 — —\nLarge cap value 198 198 — —\nGlobal real estate fund 799 799 — —\nManaged futures fund 306 306 — —\nAvailable-for-sale securities 30,328 30,328 — —\nTotal $ 32,263 $ 32,263 $ — $ —\nOur investment policy includes various guidelines and procedures designed to ensure assets are invested in a manner necessary to meet expected future benefits\nearned by participants and consider a broad range of economic conditions. The current target allocation ranges by asset class are 50% for bond funds, 40% for\nequity funds and 10% for cash, real estate and managed futures. The objectives of the target allocations are to maintain investment portfolios that diversify risk\nthrough prudent asset allocation parameters, achieve asset returns that meet or exceed the plans’ actuarial assumptions and achieve asset returns that are\ncompetitive with like institutions employing similar investment strategies.\nThe investment policy is periodically reviewed by the Company and a designated third-party fiduciary for investment matters. The policy is established and\nadministered in a manner that is compliant at all times with applicable government regulations.\n401(k) Savings Plan\nWe maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. 401(k) Retirement Plan (the “Savings Plan”) for the benefit of eligible employees. The Savings Plan is intended to qualify under\nSections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and is intended to be a “safe harbor” 401(k) plan under Code Section\n401(k)(12). The Savings Plan allows employees to save for retirement by contributing part of their compensation to the plan on a tax-deferred basis. The Savings\nPlan also requires us to contribute a “safe harbor” amount each year. We match up to 4% of employee contributions (100% of an employee’s first 3% of\ncontributions and 50% of their next 2% of contributions), beginning on the employee’s one-year anniversary date. In calculating our matching contribution,\ncompensation up to the statutory maximum under the Code is used ($290,000 for 2021). All matching contributions under the Savings Plan vest immediately.\nEmployer contribution expense and plan administration costs for the Savings Plan amounted to approximately $3.9 million, $4.0 million and $4.4 million in 2021,\n2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDeferred Compensation Plans\nWe maintain four deferred compensation programs for certain executive management employees and our Board of Directors.\nThe ADTRAN, Inc. Deferred Compensation Program for Employees is offered as a supplement to our tax-qualified 401(k) plan and is available to certain\nexecutive management employees who have been designated by our Board of Directors. This deferred compensation plan allows participants to defer all or a\nportion of certain specified bonuses and up to 25% of remaining cash compensation and permits us to make matching contributions on a discretionary basis without\nthe limitations that apply to the 401(k) plan. To date, we have not made any matching contributions under this plan. We also maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. Equity\nDeferral Program for Employees. Under this plan, participants may elect to defer all or a portion of their vested PSUs and RSUs to the plan. Such deferrals shall\ncontinue to be held and deemed to be invested in shares of ADTRAN stock unless and until the amounts are distributed or such deferrals are moved to another\ndeemed investment pursuant to an election made by the participant.\n97\nFor our Board of Directors, we maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. Deferred Compensation Program for Directors. This program allows our Board of Directors to defer\nall or a portion of monetary remuneration paid to the Director, including, but not limited to, meeting fees and annual retainers. We also maintain the ADTRAN,\nInc. Equity Deferral Program for Directors. Under this plan, participants may elect to defer all or a portion of their vested restricted stock awards. Such deferrals\nshall continue to be held and deemed to be invested in shares of ADTRAN stock unless and until the amounts are distributed or such deferrals are moved to another\ndeemed investment pursuant to an election made by the director.\nWe have set aside the plan assets for all plans in a rabbi trust (the “Trust”) and all contributions are credited to bookkeeping accounts for the participants. The Trust\nassets are subject to the claims of our creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency. The assets of the Trust are deemed to be invested in pre-approved mutual\nfunds as directed by each participant and the participant’s bookkeeping account is credited with the earnings and losses attributable to those investments. Benefits\nare scheduled to be distributed six months after termination of employment in a single lump sum payment or annual installments paid over a three or ten-year term\nbased on the participant’s election. Distributions will be made on a pro-rata basis from each of the hypothetical investments of the participant’s account in cash.\nAny whole shares of ADTRAN, Inc. common stock that are distributed will be distributed in-kind.\nAssets of the Trust are deemed invested in mutual funds that cover an investment spectrum ranging from equities to money market instruments. These mutual\nfunds are publicly quoted and reported at fair value. The fair value of the assets held by the Trust and the amounts payable to the plan participants as of December\n31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2021 2020\nFair Value of Plan Assets\nLong-term investments $ 26,935 $ 23,891\nTotal Fair Value of Plan Assets $ 26,935 $ 23,891\nAmounts Payable to Plan Participants\nDeferred compensation liability $ 31,383 $ 25,866\nTotal Amounts Payable to Plan Participants $ 31,383 $ 25,866\nThe Trust held $4.1 million and $2.8 million of common stock in the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Shares of the Company held by\nthe Trust are recorded at cost and classified as treasury stock on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nInterest and dividend income of the Trust are included in interest and dividend income in the accompanying 2021, 2020 and 2019 Consolidated Statements of\n(Loss) Income. Changes in the fair value of the plan assets held by the Trust have been included in other income (expense) in the accompanying 2021, 2020 and\n2019 Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income. Changes in the fair value of the deferred compensation liability are included as selling, general and administrative\nexpense in the accompanying 2021, 2020 and 2019 Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income. Based on the changes in the total fair value of the Trust’s assets, we\nrecorded deferred compensation income in 2021, 2020 and 2019 of $0.9 million, $4.3 million and $3.6 million, respectively.\nRetiree Medical Coverage\nMedical, dental and prescription drug coverage is provided to certain spouses and former spouses of current and former officers on the same terms as provided to\nour active officers for up to 30 years. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, this liability totaled $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively.\n98\nNote 16 – Segment Information and Major Customers\nThe Chief Operating Decision Maker regularly reviews the Company’s financial performance based on two reportable segments: (1) Network Solutions and (2)\nServices & Support. Network Solutions includes hardware products and software defined next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or business\nnetworks, as well as prior-generation products. Services & Support includes a portfolio of maintenance, network implementation and solutions integration and\nmanaged services, which include hosted cloud services and subscription services.\nThe performance of each segment is evaluated based on gross profit; therefore, selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses,\ninterest and dividend income, interest expense, net investment gain (loss), other income (expense) and income tax (expense) benefit are reported on a Company-\nwide basis only. There is no inter-segment revenue. Asset information by reportable segment is not produced and, therefore, is not reported.\nThe following table presents information about revenue and gross profit of our reportable segments for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n2021 2020 2019\n(In thousands) Revenue Gross Profit Revenue Gross Profit Revenue Gross Profit\nNetwork Solutions $ 498,834 $ 190,993 $ 438,015 $ 193,789 $ 455,226 $ 191,549\nServices & Support 64,170 27,384 68,495 23,762 74,835 27,618\nTotal $ 563,004 $ 218,377 $ 506,510 $ 217,551 $ 530,061 $ 219,167\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, $1.2 million, $1.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively, of depreciation expense was included in gross\nprofit for our Network Solutions segment. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, $14 thousand, $32 thousand and $29 thousand, respectively, of\ndepreciation expense was included in gross profit for our Services & Support segment.\nRevenue by Category\nIn addition to our reportable segments, revenue is also reported for the following three categories – (1) Access & Aggregation, (2) Subscriber Solutions &\nExperience and (3) Traditional & Other Products.\nThe following tables disaggregate our revenue by category for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n2021\n(In thousands) Network Solutions Services & Support Total\nAccess & Aggregation $ 300,343 $ 43,853 $ 344,196\nSubscriber Solutions & Experience 189,121 10,500 199,621\nTraditional & Other Products 9,370 9,817 19,187\nTotal $ 498,834 $ 64,170 $ 563,004\n2020\n(In thousands) Network Solutions Services & Support Total\nAccess & Aggregation $ 262,578 $ 50,560 $ 313,138\nSubscriber Solutions & Experience 161,824 9,263 171,087\nTraditional & Other Products 13,613 8,672 22,285\nTotal $ 438,015 $ 68,495 $ 506,510\n2019\n(In thousands) Network Solutions Services & Support Total\nAccess & Aggregation $ 289,980 $ 58,894 $ 348,874\nSubscriber Solutions & Experience 144,651 8,269 152,920\nTraditional & Other Products 20,595 7,672 28,267\nTotal $ 455,226 $ 74,835 $ 530,061\n99\nAdditional Information\nThe following table presents revenue information by geographic area for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n(In thousands) 2021 2020 2019\nUnited States $ 374,600 $ 352,079 $ 300,853\nGermany 65,229 74,882 78,062\nUnited Kingdom 56,355 13,799 2,569\nMexico 4,616 4,087 90,795\nOther international 62,204 61,663 57,782\nTotal $ 563,004 $ 506,510 $ 530,061\nCustomers comprising more than 10% of revenue can change from year to year. Single customers comprising more than 10% of revenue in 2021 included one\ncustomer, at 18%, which was a distributor and was included in both our Network Solutions and Services & Support segments. Single customers comprising more\nthan 10% of revenue in 2020 included three customers at 15%, 12% and 10% and was included in both our Network Solutions and Services & Support segments.\nSingle customers comprising more than 10% of revenue in 2019 included three customers at 19%, 17% and 13% and was included in both our Network Solutions\nand Services & Support segments. Other than those with more than 10% of revenue disclosed above our next five largest customers can change, and have\nhistorically changed, from year-to-year. The next five largest customers combined represented 38%, 34% and 28% of total revenue in 2021, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021, property, plant and equipment, net totaled $55.8 million, which included $53.0 million held in the U.S. and $2.8 million held outside the\nU.S. As of December 31, 2020, property, plant and equipment, net totaled $62.4 million, which included $58.4 million held in the U.S. and $4.0 million held\noutside the U.S. Property, plant and equipment, net is reported on a Company-wide, functional basis only.\nNote 17 – Commitments and Contingencies\nShareholder Derivative Lawsuit\nOn March 31, 2020, a shareholder derivative suit, captioned Johnson (Derivatively on behalf of ADTRAN) v. T. Stanton, M. Foliano, R. Shannon, and Board of\nDirectors, case no. 5:20-cv-00447, was filed in the U.S. District Court of Northern Alabama against two of the Company’s current executive officers, one of its\nformer executive officers and certain current and former members of its Board of Directors. The derivative suit alleges, among other things, that the defendants\nmade or caused the Company to make materially false and misleading statements regarding, and/or failed to disclose material adverse facts about, the Company’s\nbusiness, operations and prospects, specifically relating to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, excess and obsolete inventory reserves,\nfinancial results and demand from certain customers. The case was temporarily stayed pending an order on the defendants’ motion to dismiss in a separate\nsecurities class action case that included similar factual allegations, Burbridge v. ADTRAN, Inc., et al., Case No. 5:20-cv-00050-LCB (N.D. Ala.). The Burbridge\ncase was dismissed on March 31, 2021, and the time to appeal the dismissal has expired, such that the dismissal is now final. Following the dismissal, the plaintiff\nin the shareholder derivative suit sent a demand letter dated June 29, 2021 to ADTRAN’s Board of Directors. The letter contains similar allegations to those made\nin the plaintiff’s filed complaint and in the now dismissed securities class action, and it demands, among other things, that the Board of Directors commence an\ninvestigation into the alleged wrongdoing. On December 10, 2021, after investigating the allegations in the demand with the assistance of independent counsel, the\ndirectors (Mr. Stanton abstaining) concluded that pursuing the claims asserted in the demand would not be in the Company's best interests and exercised their\nbusiness judgment to refuse the demand. Since that time, the parties to the derivative litigation have stipulated that plaintiff will either dismiss his complaint or\nseek to amend it pursuant to a schedule to be ordered by the Court. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of\nloss, if any, associated with the derivative lawsuit or the demand letter.\nOther Legal Matters\nIn addition to the litigation described above, from time to time we are subject to or otherwise involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and legal\nproceedings that arise out of or are incidental to the conduct of our business (collectively, “Legal Matters”), including those relating to employment matters, patent\nrights, regulatory compliance matters, stockholder claims, and contractual and other commercial disputes. Such Legal Matters, even if not meritorious, could result\nin the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Additionally, an unfavorable outcome in a legal matter, including in a patent dispute, could\nrequire the Company to pay damages, entitle claimants to other relief, such as royalties, or could prevent the Company from selling some of its products in\n100\ncertain jurisdictions. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with such legal matters.\nPerformance Bonds\nCertain contracts, customers and/or jurisdictions in which we do business require us to provide various guarantees of performance such as bid bonds, performance\nbonds and customs bonds. As of December 31, 2021, we had commitments related to these bonds totaling $22.9 million which expire at various dates through April\n2025. As of December 31, 2020, we had commitments related to these bonds totaling $15.2 million. Although the triggering events vary from contract to contract,\nin general we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote.\nIn June 2020, the Company entered into a letter of credit with a bank to guarantee performance obligations under a contract with a certain customer. The\nobligations under this customer contract will be performed over multiple years. We reached the maximum value of our minimum collateral requirement of $15.0\nmillion during the three months ended March 31, 2021 as the Company reached certain milestones through the first quarter of 2021 as outlined in the customer\ncontract. The letter of credit was secured by a pledge of a portion of the Company’s fixed-income securities, which totaled $18.3 million as of December 31, 2021,\nof which $0.2 million is included in restricted cash and $18.1 million is included in long-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This pledged\ncollateral value will fluctuate as the Company changes the mix of the pledged collateral between restricted cash and investments. Any shortfalls in the minimum\ncollateral value are required to be restored by the Company from available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and/or long-term investments. The\ncollateral under the letter of credit will be released when all obligations under the customer contract have been met. As of December 31, 2021 and through the date\nof this report, the Company was in compliance with all contractual requirements under the letter of credit.\nInvestment Commitment\nWe have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $5.0 million in a private equity fund, of which $4.9 million has been invested as of December 31, 2021.\nNote 18 – Current Expected Credit Losses\nUnder ASC 326 – Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, the Company estimates credit losses for the contractual life of assets that are measured at amortized cost\nand are within the scope of this guidance, which includes accounts receivable, net investment in sales-type leases, contract assets under the revenue recognition\nmodel and outstanding notes receivable. Where appropriate, the Company pools assets if similar risk characteristics exist. Additionally, the Company analyzes its\navailable-for-sale debt securities for impairment and records a credit loss allowance as needed.\nAssets Measured at Amortized Cost\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company records accounts receivable in the normal course of business as products are shipped or services are performed and invoiced, but payment has not\nyet been remitted by the customer. Accounts receivable balances are considered past due when payment has not been received by the date indicated on the relevant\ninvoice or based on agreed upon terms between the customer and the Company.\n101\nAs of December 31, 2021, 2020 and January 1, 2020 (the “implementation date”), the Company’s net outstanding accounts receivable balance was $158.7 million,\n$98.8 million and $90.5 million, respectively. The Company assessed the need for an allowance for credit losses related to its outstanding accounts receivable using\nthe historical loss-rate method as well as assessing asset-specific risks. The Company’s historical losses related to accounts receivable have been immaterial as\nevidenced by its historical allowance and write-offs due to collectability. The assessment of asset-specific risks included the evaluation of relevant available\ninformation, from internal and external sources, relating to current conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay, such as the customer’s current financial\ncondition, credit rating by geographic location, as provided by a third party and/or by customer, if needed, and the overall macro-economic conditions in which the\ncustomer operates. The Company pooled assets by geographic location to determine if an allowance should be applied to its accounts receivable balance, assessing\nthe specific country risk rating and overall economics of that particular country. If elevated risk existed, or customer specific risk indicated the accounts receivable\nbalance was at risk, the Company further analyzed the need for an allowance related to specific accounts receivable balances. Additionally, the Company\ndetermined that significant changes to customer country risk rating from period-to-period and from the end of the prior year to the end of the current quarter would\nrequire further review and analysis by the Company.\nNo allowance for credit losses was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or on January 1, 2020 related to accounts receivable. The Company's\nallowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable was $0 as of December 31, 2021 and was less than $0.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and January 1,\n2020, all of which was expensed prior to January 1, 2020.\nContract Assets\nThe Company records contract assets when it has recognized revenue but has not yet billed the customer. As of December 31, 2021, 2020 and January 1, 2020 (the\n\"implementation date\"), the Company’s outstanding contract asset balance was $0.5 million, $0.1 million and $2.8 million, respectively, which is included in other\nreceivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company assessed the need for an allowance for credit losses related to its outstanding contract assets using\nthe historical loss-rate method as well as asset-specific risks. The Company’s historical losses related to contract assets receivable have been immaterial as\nevidenced by historical write-offs due to collectability. Asset-specific risk included the evaluation of relevant available information, from internal and external\nsources, relating to current conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay once invoiced, such as the customer’s financial condition, credit rating by\ngeographic location as provided by a third party and/or by customer, if needed, and the overall macro-economic conditions in which the customer operates. The\nCompany pooled assets by geographic location to determine if an allowance should be applied to its contract asset balance, assessing the specific country risk\nrating and the overall economics of that particular country. If elevated risk existed, or customer specific risk indicated the contract balance was at risk, the\nCompany further analyzed the need for an allowance related to specific customer balances. Additionally, the Company determined that significant changes to\ncustomer country risk rating from period-to-period and from the end of the prior year to the end of the current quarter would be subject to further review and\nanalysis by the Company.\nNo allowance for credit losses was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or January 1, 2020 related to contract assets.\nNet Investment in Sales-Type Leases\nThe Company is the lessor in sales-type lease arrangements for network equipment. As of December 31, 2021, 2020 and January 1, 2020 (the \"implementation\ndate\"), the Company’s outstanding net investment in sales-type leases was less than $0.1 million, $0.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively, which is included in\nother receivables and other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company assessed the need for an allowance for credit losses related to\nfuture receivables under its outstanding sales-type leases using the historical loss-rate method as well as asset-specific risks. The Company’s historical losses\nrelated to contract assets receivable have been immaterial as evidenced by historical write-offs due to collectability. Asset-specific risk included the evaluation of\nrelevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to current conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay once invoiced, such as\nthe customer’s financial condition, credit rating by geographic location as provided by a third party and/or by customer, if needed, and the overall macro-economic\nconditions in which the customer operates.\nThe following table presents amortized cost basis in sales-type leases based on payment activity:\nSales-Type Leases Amortized Cost Basis by Origination Year\n(In thousands) 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 Prior Total\nPayment performance\nPerforming $ 14 $ 11 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 25\nNon-performing — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 14 $ 11 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 25\n102\nSales-type lease receivables are considered past due when payment has not been received based on agreed upon terms between the customer and the Company. No\nallowance for credit losses was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or January 1, 2020 related to sales-type leases.\nSecured Loan Receivable\nThe Company has a secured loan receivable totaling $0.4 million and $0.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, which originated in February 2019, and is\nincluded in long-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company assessed the need for an allowance for\ncredit losses related to its secured loan receivable using the historical loss-rate method as well as asset-specific risks. There have been no historical losses related to\nthis receivable. Asset-specific risks included the evaluation of relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to current conditions that\nmay affect the customer’s ability to repay the loan upon maturity, such as the customer’s current financial condition, credit rating specific to the customer as\ndetermined by a third party and current overall economic conditions, as well as a Company valuation prepared by a third party which was based on reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts as provided by management. Accrued interest receivable on the secured loan receivable, which is included in other receivables on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets totaled less than $0.1 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and was excluded from the estimate of credit losses for both periods\nbased on the Company’s accounting policy election.\nNo allowance for credit losses was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 or on the implementation date related to the secured loan receivable.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2021, 2020, or January 1, 2020.\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities\nAs of December 31, 2021, 2020, and January 1, 2020, the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities totaled $30.1 million, $45.1 million, and $37.7 million,\nrespectively. These securities were analyzed at the individual investment level, by Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures (“CUSIP”), to limit\ncredit losses, if applicable, to reflect only the amount by which the fair value of the security was less than its amortized cost. The Company noted that, as of\nDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and January 1, 2020, there was no intent to sell any of its available-for-sale debt securities before maturity, and, therefore, the Company\nassessed the need for an allowance for each of its available-for-sale debt securities in which the fair value was less than its amortized cost as of December 31, 2021,\n2020 and January 1, 2020. Accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale debt securities, which is included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, totaled less than $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and January 1, 2020,\nrespectively and was excluded from the estimate of credit losses for both periods based on the Company’s accounting policy election. Income generated from\navailable-for-sale debt securities was recorded as interest and dividend income in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income.\nThe Company had 174 positions in available-for-sale debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2021. See Note 6 for additional\ninformation.\nFor those available-for-sale debt securities whose fair value was less than its amortized cost basis, the Company analyzed additional criteria such as adverse\nconditions specifically related to the security, an industry or geographic area, failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments,\nif applicable, and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency to determine if a credit loss existed. The Company used information provided by its\ninvestment manager to determine if any scheduled interest or principal payments had not been received and used a third party to determine if any changes to credit\nratings had occurred. Principal and interest payments are considered past due when payment has not been received based on scheduled terms of each debt security.\nThe Company ceases to accrue interest on debt securities on a case by case basis. As of December 31, 2021, the Company noted that all principal and interest\npayments had been received as scheduled and that there had been no changes in credit ratings year-over-year or period-over-period that warranted further review.\nNo allowance for credit losses was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020 or on the implementation date related to the Company’s\navailable-for-sale debt securities.\n103\nNote 19 – (Loss) Earnings per Share\nThe calculations of basic and diluted (loss) earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\n(In thousands, except for per share amounts) 2021 2020 2019\nNumerator\nNet (Loss) Income $ (8,635) $ 2,378 $ (52,982)\nDenominator\nWeighted average number of shares – basic 48,582 47,996 47,836\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nStock options — — —\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock — 292 —\nWeighted average number of shares – diluted 48,582 48,288 47,836\n(Loss) earnings per share – basic $ (0.18) $ 0.05 $ (1.11)\n(Loss) earnings per share – diluted $ (0.18) $ 0.05 $ (1.11)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, less than 0.1 million, 0.1 million and 0.5 million shares, respectively, of unvested or unearned, as\napplicable, PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted (loss) earnings per share due to their anti-dilutive effect.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, 0.3 million, 3.6 million and 5.2 million stock options, respectively, were outstanding but were not included\nin the computation of diluted (loss) earnings per share due to their exercise prices being greater than the average market price of the common shares during the\nquarter, making them anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.\nNote 20 – Restructuring\nDuring the second half of 2019, the Company initiated a restructuring plan to realign its expense structure with the reduction in revenue experienced in recent years\nand overall Company objectives. As part of this restructuring plan, the Company announced plans to reduce its overall operating expenses, both in the U.S. and\ninternationally. Management continued to assess the efficiency of operations during 2020 and 2021 and, in turn, consolidated locations and personnel, among other\nthings, where possible.\nIn February 2019, the Company announced the restructuring of a certain portion of its workforce predominantly in Germany, which included the closure of the\nCompany’s office location in Munich, Germany accompanied by relocation or severance benefits for the affected employees. Voluntary early retirement was\noffered to certain other employees and was announced in March 2019 and again in August 2020.\nThe cumulative amount of restructuring expenses incurred as of December 31, 2021 for the restructuring plans was $12.7 million.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending restructuring liability, which is included in accrued wages and benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, is as follows:\n(In thousands) 2021 2020\nBalance at beginning of period $ 4,186 $ 1,568\nPlus: Amounts charged to cost and expense 411 6,229\nLess: Amounts paid (3,083) (3,611)\nBalance at end of period $ 1,514 $ 4,186\nRestructuring expenses included in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income are for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n(In thousands) 2021 2020 2019\nNetwork solutions - cost of revenue $ 13 $ 220 $ 629\nServices & support - cost of revenue 3 235 156\nCost of revenue $ 16 $ 455 $ 785\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 221 1,832 2,360\nResearch and development expenses 174 3,942 2,869\nTotal restructuring expenses $ 411 $ 6,229 $ 6,014\n104\nThe following table represents the components of restructuring expense by geographic area for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n(In thousands) 2021 2020 2019\nUnited States $ 289 $ 2,234 $ 3,336\nInternational 122 3,995 2,678\nTotal restructuring expenses $ 411 $ 6,229 $ 6,014\nNote 21 – Summarized Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)\nThe following table presents unaudited quarterly operating results for each of the last eight fiscal quarters.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that\nwe file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our\nChief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because of the inherent limitations\nto the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that all\ncontrol issues, if any, with a company have been prevented or detected on a timely basis. Even disclosure controls and procedures determined to be effective can\nonly provide reasonable assurance that their objectives are achieved.\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out by management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial\nOfficer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of ADTRAN’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, management\nused the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework\n(2013).\nBased on our assessment and those criteria, management has concluded that ADTRAN maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2021.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Item 8.\nAuditor Attestation Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n106\nThe attestation report of our registered public accounting firm on our internal control over financial reporting is included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements\nand Supplementary Data,” of this report.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter covered by this report that\nhave materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B.

Purpose.\n1.1 Background. The Company originally adopted the ADTRAN, Inc. Management Incentive Bonus Plan under a plan document adopted by\nthe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company on January 23, 2006 and effective January 1, 2006 (as amended, the “Plan”), and which\nwas approved by the Company’s shareholders in May 2006. The Company renamed the Plan the ADTRAN, Inc. Variable Incentive\nCompensation Plan and amended and restated the Plan, effective January 1, 2011, which was approved by the shareholders of the Company at\ntheir annual meeting in May 2011. Pursuant to its authority to amend the Plan under the terms of the Plan, the Board further amended and\nrestated the Plan, effective February 2, 2022.\n1.2. General Purpose. The purpose of the Plan is as follows: (i) to provide annual cash incentives and rewards for certain officers and\nmanagement employees of the Company; and (ii) to attract and retain qualified executives by providing performance-based compensation as\nan incentive for their efforts to achieve the Company’s financial and strategic objectives.\nSection 2.

BUSINESS\nCompany Overview\nADTRAN, Inc. (“ADTRAN” or the “Company”) is a leading global provider of networking and communications platforms and services focused on the broadband\naccess market. Our vision is to enable a fully connected world where the power to communicate is available to everyone, everywhere. Our unique approach,\nunmatched industry expertise and innovative solutions enable us to address almost any customer need. Our products and services are utilized by a diverse global\ncustomer base of network operators that range from those having regional or national reach and operating as telephone or cable television network operators to\nalternative network providers such as municipalities or utilities, as well as, managed service providers who serve small- and medium-sized businesses and\ndistributed enterprises.\nWe operate under two reportable segments: (1) Network Solutions, which includes hardware and software products, and (2) Services & Support, which includes a\nportfolio of services that complement our product portfolio and can be utilized to support other platforms as well. These two segments span across our three\nrevenue categories: (1) Access & Aggregation, (2) Subscriber Solutions & Experience and (3) Traditional & Other Products. These revenue categories are\ndistinguished by the types of products and services offered. Access & Aggregation is focused on solutions that are used by service providers to connect their\nnetwork infrastructure to subscribers; Subscriber Solutions & Experience is concentrated on subscriber solutions that terminate broadband access in the home\nand/or business; and Traditional & Other Products encompasses prior-generation technologies, products and services and certain other offerings. See below for a\ndetailed discussion of these reportable segments and revenue categories.\nOur innovative platforms and services enable voice, data and video communications across a variety of network infrastructures. They are currently in use by\nmillions of end-users worldwide, making us a top supplier of broadband access solutions in the North American, EMEA and APAC regions.\nWe are focused on being a top supplier of communications infrastructure spanning from the cloud edge (data center) to the subscriber edge (customer premise)\nserving both the residential internet and enterprise cloud services markets. We offer a broad portfolio of flexible network infrastructure solutions, customer\npremises equipment, management and orchestration solutions and global services and support that enable service providers to meet their service demands now and\nin the future. These products and services enable service providers to transition to a common network supporting the simplified delivery of high-capacity services,\nregardless of subscriber density, network topology and infrastructure diversity.\nADTRAN began operations in January 1986. Headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama, ADTRAN is located in Cummings Research Park-the second largest high-tech\ncenter in the U.S. and fourth largest in the world. Our mailing address is 901 Explorer Boulevard, Huntsville, Alabama, 35806. Our telephone number at that\nlocation is (256) 963-8000. Our website is www.adtran.com. No information contained on our website is intended to be included as part of, or incorporated by\nreference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n7\nReportable Segments\nOur business operates under two reportable segments: (1) Network Solutions and (2) Services & Support. We review our financial performance, specifically\nrevenue and gross profit, based on these two segments.\nNetwork Solutions Segment\nOur Network Solutions segment includes hardware and software products that support fiber, copper, coax and fixed wireless access infrastructures as well as\nresidential and business connectivity solutions. In the fixed broadband access segment, we offer traditional chassis-based network solutions, such as the Total\nAccess 5000 and hiX 5600, while also accelerating the industry’s transition to open, programmable and scalable fiber access solutions with our SDX Series. In our\nsubscriber solutions portion of the Network Solution segments, ADTRAN offers cloud-managed Wi-Fi gateways and switches that provide a mix of wired and\nwireless connectivity at the customer premise. Our complete portfolio of broadband access and subscriber connectivity solutions are managed and orchestrated by\nour Mosaic software suite. The Mosaic software suite includes a mix of modern orchestration tools that simplify the deployment of open, disaggregated access\nnetworks along with cloud-based network and subscriber service optimization tools that make it easy for service providers to deploy high-speed fixed access and\nmanaged Wi-Fi networks.\nServices & Support Segment\nIn addition to our network connectivity solutions, ADTRAN offers a comprehensive portfolio of network design, implementation and cloud management services\nto assist operators in the deployment of multi-vendor networks while reducing their cost to maintain these networks. These services are backed by a global support\norganization that offers on-site and off-site support services with varying SLAs. By pairing ADTRAN’s network solutions with our global services and support\norganization, customers can turn to ADTRAN as their single turnkey partner to assist in the deployment and maintenance of modern fiber access networks to\nconnect homes and businesses.\nRevenue Categories\nIn addition to classifying our operations into two reportable segments, we report revenue across three categories of products and services: (1) Access &\nAggregation, (2) Subscriber Solutions & Experience and (3) Traditional & Other Products.\nOur Access & Aggregation platforms are used by communications service providers to connect their network infrastructure to subscribers. This revenue category\nincludes hardware- and software-based products and services that aggregate and/or originate access technologies.

Drivers for this network investment include the evolution of government funding programs, regulatory broadband policies, competition,\nincreasing subscriber demand for broadband and merger obligations.\nSubscriber demand for higher bandwidth continues to increase due to increasing numbers of connected devices, shifting working arrangements, OTT video, the\nprevalence of IoT and cloud services and the increasing use of internet applications. Performance is directly related to bandwidth availability. As the demand for\nhigh-definition video streaming services, symmetric bandwidth for video conferencing and collaboration tools, low-latency cloud gaming services and smart home\nvideo surveillance applications continues to increase, so too does the need for higher bandwidth to the home and business. ADTRAN serves as a trusted partner to\nour customers. Working side-by-side with our customers, we enable them to glean the maximum performance from their network, providing a flexible path for\ntheir networks to evolve cost effectively, and to further monetize their investments.\n9\nOur Strategy\nOur strategy is to provide innovative and cost-effective solutions for SPs that enable them to address their increasing broadband demands. Our solutions focus on\ntechnology transformations that are happening in broadband network infrastructure, home and business CPE and software platforms, and services needed to help\nour customers address increasing complexity while scaling to meet increasing consumer demands. We aspire to be one of the top communication technology\nplayers in the world and plan to achieve this goal through innovation in network, home and business technology paired with a customer-focused organizational\nstructure that tailors solutions to meet the needs of our target customers. ADTRAN has a unique approach to our portfolio in which we are focused in specific\nmarkets where we can offer competitive differentiation and scale while also having enough diversity and breadth in the portfolio to provide end-to-end connectivity\nsolutions that offer value to our customers.\nCustomers\nWe have a diverse global customer base that includes Tier-1, -2 and -3 service providers, alternative service providers, such as utilities, municipalities and fiber\noverbuilders, cable/MSOs, SMBs and distributed enterprises. Many network operators require product approval before the purchase or installation of a product.\nThe nature of our business involves a dynamic process of submitting new and succeeding generations of products for approval prior to orders being placed.\nThree customers, CenturyLink, Inc., Deutsche Telekom AG and KGP Logistics, individually comprised more than 10% of our revenue in 2020. Additionally, our\nrevenue in Germany comprised more than 10% of our revenue in 2020. The revenue from these customers and country is reported in both our Network Solutions\nand Services & Support segments.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with customers, service providers and approval processes, see “Risk Factors – The lengthy sales and approval process\nrequired by major and other service providers for new products could result in fluctuations in our revenue,” “Risk Factors – We depend heavily on sales to certain\ncustomers; the loss of any of these customers would significantly reduce our revenues and net income,” and “Risk Factors – Consolidation and deterioration in the\nCLEC market could result in a significant decrease in our revenue,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nDistribution, Sales and Marketing\nWe sell our products through our direct sales organization and our distribution network. Our direct sales organization supports major accounts and has offices in\ndomestic and international locations. Sales to most smaller and independent telephone companies are fulfilled through a combination of direct sales and\ndistributors. Our services offerings can be purchased directly from us, or through one of our service providers, channel partners or distribution partners.\nBefore placing an order, service providers typically require lengthy product qualification and standardization processes that can extend for several months or even\nyears. Once approved, product orders are typically placed under single or multi-year supply agreements that are generally not subject to minimum volume\ncommitments. Service providers generally prefer having two or more suppliers for most products. Therefore, individual orders are usually subject to competition\nbased on some combination of total value, service, price, delivery and other terms.\nOrders for end-user products are fulfilled through a combination of direct sales and distributors. This is supported by a direct sales organization for major accounts\nand a channel-based sales organization to facilitate sales to our partners. MSPs, VARs and SIs may be affiliated with the company as channel partners, or they may\npurchase from a distributor in an unaffiliated fashion. Affiliated partners participate with us at various program levels, based on sales volume and other factors, to\nreceive benefits such as product discounts, market development funds, technical support and training.\nOutside of the U.S., most service provider products are sold through our direct sales organization and end-user products are sold direct or through distribution\narrangements customized for each region. Some regions are supported from a field office that offers sales and support functions, and in some cases, warehousing\nand manufacturing support. Our field sales organizations, distributors and service provider customers receive support from regional-based marketing, sales and\ncustomer support groups.\nOur marketing organization promotes all brands associated with ADTRAN to key stakeholders, including customers, partners and prospects throughout the world.\nMarketing is complemented by product marketing and management teams that work with our engineering teams to develop and promote new products and services\nas well as product enhancements.\n10\nResearch and Development\nRapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements and continuing developments in communications service offerings\ncharacterize the markets for our products. Our on-going ability to adapt to these changes and to develop new and enhanced products that meet or anticipate market\ndemand is a significant factor influencing our competitive position and our ability to grow.\nOur product development activities are an important part of our strategy. We plan to maintain our emphasis on product development to enable us to respond to\nrapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. Our research and development and engineering functions are global. We maintain research and\ndevelopment functions at our Huntsville, Alabama headquarters and in Germany and other locations worldwide. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019\nand 2018, research and development expenditures totaled $113.3 million, $126.2 million and $124.5 million, respectively.\nWe develop our products either internally or by leveraging partners. Additionally, in some cases, we license intellectual property or acquire technologies. Internal\ndevelopment on advanced technology products gives us more control over design and manufacturing issues, while for traditional designs, ODM and/or licensed\nintellectual property provides us with the ability to leverage the economies of scale of our technology partners. This balanced approach ensures we provide best-in-\nclass products for our customers.\nAs we continue to create more software-based intellectual property, such as our SDN/NFV portfolio, our use of lean agile practices in research and development\nensures we remain responsive and customer-focused. This enables us to deliver products faster, at higher quality and more economically to our customers and the\nmarket on a continuous basis.\nOur ability to continually reduce product costs, while focusing on delivery and quality, are important parts of our overall business strategy. Our product\ndevelopment efforts are often centered on entering a market with improved technology, allowing us to offer products at competitive prices. We then compete for\nmarket share. We continually re-engineer successive generations of existing products to improve our product performance, costs and value.\nDevelopment activities focus on solutions that support both existing and emerging communications industry technologies in segments that we consider viable\nrevenue opportunities. We are actively engaged in developing and refining technologies to support data, voice and video transport primarily over IP/Ethernet\nnetwork architectures. This includes Ethernet aggregation, fiber-optic transport and access, DSL, access routing, Ethernet switching, wireless LANs, integrated\naccess, converged services, VoIP, network management and professional services.\nOur research function supports product development efforts throughout the Company. This function guides our various product design and engineering teams in\ndigital signal processing technologies, computer simulation and modeling, CAD/CAM toolsets, custom semiconductor design, optical transceiver design, industry\nstandards, technological forecasting, product development methods and emerging networks standards.\nMany communication requirements, processes and technologies are governed by SDOs. These SDOs consist of representatives from various manufacturers, service\nproviders and testing laboratories who work to establish specifications and compliance guidelines for emerging communications technologies. We are an active\nparticipant in several SDOs and have assisted with the development of worldwide standards in many technologies.\nOur SDO activities are primarily in the area of broadband access. This includes involvement with the ITU-T, ATIS, ETSI and the BBF. We are involved in the\nevolution of optical access technologies, participating in activities in the ITU-T, FSAN and BBF on next-generation PON. We are also involved in standards\ndevelopment efforts related to maximizing the bandwidth potential of the copper pair to enable new applications in the ITU-T. We continue to be involved with the\nindustry-wide interoperability, performance-testing and system-level projects related to those standards in the BBF. We are also members of MEF, OCP, WFA,\nTIA, CableLabs and TIP.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with our research and development activities, see “Risk Factors – We must continue to update and improve our products and\ndevelop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology” and “Risk Factors – We engage in research and\ndevelopment activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application of developed technologies, and as a consequence may miss certain\nmarket opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially greater research and development effort and which may focus on more leading edge\ndevelopment,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\n11\nManufacturing and Operations\nThe principal steps in our manufacturing process include the purchase and management of materials, assembly, testing, final inspection, packing and shipping. We\npurchase parts and components for the assembly of some products from a large number of suppliers through a worldwide sourcing program. Additionally, we\nmanage a process that identifies the components that are best purchased directly by contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of our products to achieve\nmanufacturing efficiency, quality and cost objectives. Certain key components used in our products are currently available from a single source, and other key\ncomponents are available from only a limited number of sources. In the past, we have experienced delays in the receipt of certain key components, which has\nresulted in delays in related product deliveries. We attempt to manage these risks through developing alternative sources, by staging inventories at strategic\nlocations, through engineering efforts designed to prevent the necessity of certain components and by maintaining close contact and building long-term\nrelationships with our suppliers.\nWe rely on subcontractors for assembly and testing of certain printed circuit board assemblies, sub-assemblies, chassis, enclosures and equipment shelves, and to\npurchase some of the raw materials used in such assemblies. We typically manufacture our lower-volume, higher-mix products and build and test product\nprototypes and many of our initial production units at our manufacturing site in Huntsville, Alabama. We later transfer the production of higher-volume, lower-mix\nassemblies to our subcontractors. Subcontract assembly operations can lengthen fulfillment cycle times, but we believe we can respond more rapidly to\nuncertainties in incoming order rates by selecting assembly subcontractors that have significant reserve capacity and flexibility. Our subcontractors have proven to\nbe flexible and able to meet our quality requirements.\nWe ship the majority of products to our U.S. customers from our facilities in Huntsville, Alabama, although we also fulfill customer orders from other locations\nnear our customers' sites, when possible. The majority of our products shipped to EMEA customers come from locations in that region. We also ship directly from\nsubcontractors to a number of customers in the U.S. and international locations. Most of our facilities are certified pursuant to the most current releases of ISO\n9001, TL 9000, ISO 14001 and ISO 27001. Our Huntsville, Alabama facilities and many of our key suppliers are C-TPAT certified. Our products are also certified\nto certain other customer, industry and privacy standards, including those relating to emission of electromagnetic energy and safety specifications.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with manufacturing activities, see “Risk Factors – Our strategy of outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing requirements to\nsubcontractors located in various international regions may result in us not meeting our cost, quality or performance standards” and “Risk Factors – Our\ndependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products may prevent us from delivering our products on a\ntimely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on customer relations and operating results,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nCompetition\nWe compete in markets for networking and communications services and solutions for service providers, businesses, government agencies and other organizations\nworldwide. Our products and services provide solutions supporting voice, data and video communications across fiber-, copper-, coaxial- and wireless-based\ninfrastructure, as well as across wide area networks, local area networks and the internet.\nWe compete with a number of companies in the markets we serve. In our Access & Aggregation category, key competitors include Calix, Casa Systems, Ciena,\nCommScope, DZS, Huawei, Nokia, Vecima Networks and ZTE. In the Subscriber Solutions & Experience category, our primary competitors include Calix, Cisco,\nCommScope, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Juniper Networks, Ribbon Communications, Ubiquiti Networks and Zyxel. In addition to these OEM vendors, we face\nincreasing competition from various ODM vendors who are being engaged directly by some of our service provider customers. Some of these companies compete\nin a single product segment, while others compete across multiple product lines. Competitors of our Services & Support business include Calix, Fujitsu Network\nCommunications and Nokia.\nFor further discussion of risks associated with our competition, see “Risk Factors – We must continue to update and improve our products and develop new\nproducts to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology” and “Risk Factors – We compete in markets that have become\nincreasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and market share,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nSeasonality\nWe have experienced quarterly fluctuations in customer activity due to seasonal considerations. These seasonal effects may continue to vary and do not always\ncorrelate to our operating results. Accordingly, they should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or operating results.\n12\nForeign Currency\nTransactions with customers that are denominated in foreign currencies are recorded using the appropriate exchange rates from throughout the year. Assets and\nliabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the balance sheet dates using the closing rates of exchange between those foreign currencies and the\nfunctional currency with any transaction gains or losses reported in other income (expense). Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements\nare with our German subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Euro, our Australian subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Australian dollar, and our\nBritish subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Great British pound. Adjustments resulting from translating financial statements of international subsidiaries\nare recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nBacklog and Inventory\nA substantial portion of our shipments in any fiscal period relates to orders received and shipped within that fiscal period for customers under agreements\ncontaining nonbinding purchase commitments. Further, a significant percentage of orders require delivery within a few days. These factors normally result in very\nlittle order backlog or order flow visibility. Additionally, backlog levels may vary because of seasonal trends, the timing of customer projects and other factors that\naffect customer order lead times. We believe that because we fill a substantial portion of customer orders within the fiscal quarter of receipt, backlog is not a\nmeaningful indicator of actual revenue for any succeeding period.\nTo meet this type of demand, we have implemented supply chain management systems to manage the production process. We maintain substantial inventories of\nraw materials for long lead time components to support this demand and avoid expedite fees. We also maintain substantial finished goods inventories. Our practice\nof maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products and services increases the amount of inventory that may be considered excess\nand/or obsolete. This excess and obsolete inventory may require us to write down the value of the inventory, which may have an adverse effect on our operating\nresults.\nFor further discussion of risks associated with managing our inventory, see “Risk Factors – Managing our inventory is complex and may include write-downs of\nexcess or obsolete inventory,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur products must comply with various regulations and standards established by communications authorities in various countries, as well as those of certain\ninternational bodies. Environmental legislation within the EU may increase our cost of doing business as we amend our products to comply with these\nrequirements. For example, the EU issued the RoHS directive, the WEEE directive and the REACH regulation. We continue to implement measures to comply\nwith these directives and other similar directives and regulations from additional countries.\nWe strive to deliver innovative network access solutions that lower the total cost and reduce the time of deploying services, increase the level of performance\nachievable with established infrastructures, reduce operating and capital expenses for our customers, increase network bandwidth and functionality, and extend\nnetwork reach. Our development process is conducted in accordance with ISO 9001, TL 9000, ISO 14001, and ISO 27001, all of which are international standards\nfor quality and environmental management systems. Our corporate practices also conform to GDPR requirements, which protect digital data for all EU citizens, and\nto other applicable data protection laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to these laws, rules and\nregulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.\nFor further discussion of risks associated with government regulation, see “Risk Factors – We are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws,\nregulations and standards governing the conduct of our business. Violations of these laws and regulations may harm our business, subject us to penalties and to\nother adverse consequences.”\n13\nHuman Capital\nWe believe that our most valuable asset is our people. To ensure our Company continues to succeed, our objective is to be able to recruit, hire and retain top talent.\nOur ability to attract and retain a high-quality workforce is dependent on our ability to maintain a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace that provides\nopportunities for our employees to learn and grow in their careers. This is supported by strong compensation, benefits, community service and other programs that\nenable employees to build connections within the community.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 1,405 full-time employees, with 1,080 in the U.S. and 325 in our international subsidiaries located in North America, Latin\nAmerica, EMEA and APAC regions. We also utilized 250 contractors and temporary employees domestically and internationally in various manufacturing,\nengineering, sales and general and administrative capacities, as needed. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. ADTRAN has a diverse\nemployee base located in 17 countries. We pride ourselves on a highly educated workforce, and the majority of our employees serve in engineering, information\ntechnology and technical roles within the organization.\nUntil December 31, 2020, approximately 260 employees of ADTRAN GmbH were subject to collective bargaining agreements of either the Association of Metal\nand Electrical Industry in Berlin and Brandenburg e.V. or NORDMETALL Association of Metal and Electrical Industry e.V. Although these collective bargaining\nagreements expired on December 31, 2020, negotiations with the employees of ADTRAN GmbH for a new collective bargaining agreement are ongoing and we\nhave not experienced any work stoppage. None of our other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.\nAdditionally, we continually work to recruit technical talent in diverse communities through our cooperative education program. This program seeks to identify\ncollege students that major in relevant technology areas and expose them to the work environment at ADTRAN on an alternating semester basis. Our goal is to\nretain as many of these students as possible for full-time employment after graduation, as they are our Company's future.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe believe that maintaining a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to the success of our business. The Company encourages an environment where\nindividuality is embraced regardless of age, gender, identity, race, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, ethnicity and perspective and where each employee\nis accepted and respected and can, therefore, bring their most authentic self to work. To this end, we have established an employee-driven Diversity, Equity &\nInclusion (“DE&I”) Task Force to spearhead our efforts. The DE&I Task Force is comprised of our Chief Financial Officer and employee volunteers who are\npassionate about DE&I and how it affects our workforce.\nIn addition to diversity in our workforce, we seek to ensure diversity in our Board of Directors with respect to skills, experience, gender, race and ethnicity. Our\nBoard of Directors is comprised of six members, two of which are females and three of which are ethnically diverse. Additionally, the Board of Directors has a\ndiversity of skills and experience with respect to accounting and finance, management and leadership, vision and strategy, business operations, business judgment,\ncrisis management, risk assessment, industry knowledge, corporate governance and global markets.\nHealth, Safety and Wellness\nThe well-being of our employees is paramount to the continued success of our business. To this end, we are committed to each of our employees' health, safety and\nwellness. We provide our employees with access to various health and wellness benefits designed to enable them and their family members to have affordable\naccess to health, dental and vision insurance. Additionally, we offer access to many programs that provide additional monetary support in the event of a qualifying\nincident, including accident insurance, life insurance and hospital indemnity insurance, among others. We understand that mental health is an essential aspect of our\nemployees’ wellbeing. As a result, we offer an employee assistance program at no charge to employees and their family members. This program provides access to\nqualified personnel to address various issues such as grief, financial stress, family and emotional issues.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that were determined to be in the best interest of our employees and the communities\nin which we operate. We introduced enhanced health and safety standards that are in compliance with, or exceed, local, state and federal recommendations and\nregulations in the U.S. and at our international locations. This includes having the vast majority of our global employees work from home when possible. In areas\nwhere it is necessary to have critical, on-site personnel, such as at our manufacturing facilities, additional health and safety measures have been implemented to\nprovide the safest environment possible for these workers.\n14\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe continually work to provide a competitive compensation and benefits program as this plays a key role in our ability to attract and retain a highly skilled\nworkforce. In addition to salaries, these programs, which vary by country/region, include long-term equity incentive awards with certain vesting requirements,\ndeferred compensation plans, which are offered to certain of executive management, a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible\nspending accounts, paid time off, paid volunteer time off, employee assistance program and tuition assistance. Additionally, at our headquarters in Alabama, we\noffer our employees certain on-site services, including nurse practitioner care and a fitness center, among others.\nTalent Development\nWe invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain a market-leading global supplier of broadband infrastructure. We offer numerous training\nopportunities on both technical and professional development topics. We recently enhanced tools and processes for providing performance feedback and\ndeveloping high potential employees to become our future leaders.\nThe ADTRAN Career Development Program provides an opportunity for employees to shape their career journey. The program provides opportunities for\nemployees to develop competencies in areas including technology, business acumen, emotional intelligence, design and systems thinking. As employees increase\ntheir competencies in these areas and master skills within their individual roles, this program offers a variety of career advancement paths. Employees also have\naccess to the ADTRAN Learning Network. This platform houses all required training as well as optional training in a variety of areas.\nIntellectual Property\nADTRAN develops and owns a significant amount of intellectual property. We hold over 600 patents worldwide related to our products and over 60 additional\npending patent applications. Our patents expire at various dates between 2021 and 2038. We continue occasionally to seek additional patents related to our research\nand development activities. We do not derive any material amount of revenue from the licensing of our patents.\nThe ADTRAN corporate logo is a registered trademark of ADTRAN, as is the name “ADTRAN”, “SmartRG” and a number of our product identifiers and names.\nWe also claim rights to a number of unregistered trademarks.\nWe protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights in accordance with good legal and business practices. We believe, however, that our competitive success\nwill not fully depend on the ownership of intellectual property, but instead will depend primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing\nabilities of our personnel.\nThe communications industry is characterized by the existence of an ever-increasing volume of patent litigation and licensing activities. We have received, and\nmay continue to receive, notices of claims alleging that we are infringing upon patents or other intellectual property. We cannot predict whether we will prevail in\nany claims or litigation over alleged infringements, or whether we will be able to license any valid and infringed patents, or other intellectual property, on\ncommercially reasonable terms. It is possible that such litigation may result in significant legal costs and judgments and that intellectual property infringement\nclaims, or related litigation against or by us could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property and proprietary rights, see “Risk Factors – Our failure to maintain rights to intellectual property\nused in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality, and commercial value of our products” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\n15\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nSet forth below is certain information regarding the executive officers of ADTRAN.

RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves substantial risks. Any of the risk factors described below or elsewhere in this report could significantly and adversely affect our business\nprospects, financial condition and results of operations. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently\nknown to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect us.\nRisks related to our financial results and Company success\nOur revenue for a particular period can be difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.\nAs a result of the many factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict and will fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nTypically, our customers request product delivery within a short period following receipt of an order. Consequently, we do not typically carry a significant order\nbacklog and are dependent upon obtaining orders and completing delivery in accordance with shipping terms that are predominantly within each quarter to achieve\nour targeted revenues. Our net revenue may grow at a slower rate than in previous quarters or may decline. Our deployment/installation cycle can vary depending\non the customer’s schedule, site readiness, network size and complexity and other factors, which can cause our revenue to fluctuate from period to period. Our\nability to meet financial expectations could also be affected if the variable revenue patterns seen in prior quarters recur in future quarters. We have experienced\nperiods of time during which manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading to variable shipping patterns. In addition, to the extent that manufacturing\nissues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in quarters in which we and our subcontractors are operating\nat higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected, and we may not be able to remediate the conditions within the same\nquarter.\nIn the past, under certain market conditions, long manufacturing lead times have caused our customers to place the same order multiple times. When multiple\nordering occurs, along with other factors, it may cause difficulty in predicting our sales and, as a result, could impair our ability to manage inventory effectively.\nWe plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed\nin the short term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses\nin response to short-term business changes.\nThe lengthy sales and approval process required by major and other service providers for new products could result in fluctuations in our revenue.\nIn the industry in which we compete, sales and approval cycles are often lengthy. Selling efforts often involve a significant commitment of time and resources by\nus and our customers that may include extensive product testing, laboratory or network certification, or region-specific product certification and homologation\nrequirements for deployment in networks. Additionally, a supplier must first obtain product approval from a major or other service provider to sell its products to\nthese service providers. This process can last from six to eighteen months, or longer, depending on the technology, the service provider and the demand for the\nproduct from the service provider’s subscribers. Consequently, we are involved in a constant process of submitting for approval succeeding generations of\nproducts, as well as products that deploy new technology or respond to new technology demands from a major or other service provider. We have been successful\nin the past in obtaining these approvals; however, we cannot be certain that we will obtain these approvals in the future or that sales of these products will continue\nto occur. Any attempt by a major or other service provider to seek out additional or alternative suppliers, or to undertake, as permitted under applicable regulations,\nthe production of these products internally, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Furthermore, the delay in sales until the completion of the\napproval process, the length of which is difficult to predict, could result in fluctuations of revenue and uneven operating results from quarter to quarter or year to\nyear. Further, once customer approval or certifications are met, our supply chain customers typically do not guarantee us a minimum, or any, volume of sales. We\nare dependent on individual purchase orders as discussed elsewhere in this report.\nWe depend heavily on sales to certain customers; the loss of any of these customers would significantly reduce our revenues and net income.\nHistorically, a large percentage of our sales have been made to major service providers and larger independent communications companies. In 2020, these\ncustomers continued to comprise over half of our revenue. As long as the major and larger independent communications companies represent such a substantial\npercentage of our total revenue, our future success will significantly depend upon certain factors which are not within our control, including:\n• the timing and size of future purchase orders, if any, from these customers;\n• changes in strategic plans and capital budgets of these customers;\n• the product requirements of these customers;\n17\n• the subscriber take rate, including subscriber loss or churn, of our customers;\n• the financial and operational success of these customers;\n• the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on these customers;\n• consolidation, acquisition of, or corporate reorganization among these customers;\n• the success of these customers' services deployed using our products; and\n• the impact of work stoppages at these customers.\nIn the past, sales to our large customers have fluctuated, and may fluctuate in the future, significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. The loss of, or a\nsignificant reduction or delay in, sales to any such customer or the occurrence of sales fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results\nof operations. Further, any attempt by a major or other service provider to seek out additional or alternative suppliers or to undertake, as permitted under applicable\nregulations, the production of these products internally, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold\ntheir market positions or are unable to continue operations. This could lead to variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operating results, financial condition and cash flow. In addition, particularly in the service provider market, rapid consolidation will lead to fewer\ncustomers, with the effect that a loss of a major customer could have a material impact on our results that we would not have anticipated in a marketplace\ncomposed of more numerous participants.\nOur exposure to the credit risks of our customers and distributors may make it difficult to collect accounts receivable and could adversely affect our operating\nresults, financial condition and cash flows.\nMost of our revenue is made on an open credit basis, generally with payment terms of 30 days in the U.S. and typically longer in many geographic markets outside\nthe U.S. As our international revenue grows, our total accounts receivable balance will likely increase. Our DSO could also increase as a result of a greater mix of\ninternational revenue. Additionally, international laws may not provide the same degree of protection against defaults on accounts receivable as provided under\nU.S. laws governing domestic transactions; therefore, as our international business grows, we may be subject to higher bad debt expense compared to historical\ntrends. Overall, we monitor individual customer and distributor payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to\namounts that we believe customers and distributors can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts and other\nmacroeconomic indicators. In the course of our sales to customers and distributors, we may encounter difficulty collecting accounts receivable and could be\nexposed to risks associated with uncollectible accounts receivable due to various reasons, including potential declining operating cash flows or bankruptcy filings.\nWhile we attempt to monitor these situations carefully and attempt to take appropriate measures to collect accounts receivable balances, there are no assurances we\ncan avoid write-downs and/or write-offs of accounts receivable as a result of declining financial conditions for our customers, including bankruptcy. Such write-\ndowns or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur and could potentially have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe expect gross margins to vary over time, and our levels of product and services gross margins may not be sustainable.\nOur level of gross margins may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected by numerous factors, including:\n• changes in customer, geographic or product or services mix, including software and the mix of configurations and professional services revenue\nwithin each product segment;\n• mix of domestic versus international revenue;\n• introduction of new products by competitors, including products with price-performance advantages;\n• our ability to reduce product cost;\n• increases in labor or material cost, including increases in material costs resulting from tariffs;\n• foreign currency exchange rate movements;\n• expediting costs incurred to meet customer delivery requirements;\n• excess inventory and inventory holding charges;\n• excess and obsolescence charges;\n• changes in shipment volume;\n• our ability to absorb fixed manufacturing costs during short-term fluctuations in customer demand;\n18\n• loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly\nanticipate product demand;\n• lower than expected benefits from value engineering;\n• increased price competition, including competitors from Asia, specifically China;\n• changes in distribution channels;\n• increased warranty cost;\n• liquidated damages costs relating to customer contractual terms; and\n• our ability to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations relating to our revenue or cost of goods sold.\nOur dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products may prevent us from delivering our products\non a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on customer relations and operating results.\nCertain raw materials and key components used in our products are currently available from only one source, and others are available from only a limited number\nof sources. The availability of these raw materials and supplies may be subject to market forces beyond our control, such as merger and acquisition activity of our\nsuppliers and consolidation in some segments of our supplier base. From time to time, there may not be sufficient quantities of raw materials and supplies in the\nmarketplace to meet customer demand. Many companies utilize the same raw materials and supplies that we do in the production of their products. Companies with\nmore resources than our own may have a competitive advantage in obtaining raw materials and supplies due to greater buying power. These factors can result in\nreduced supply, higher prices of raw materials and delays in the receipt of certain of our key components, which in turn may generate increased costs, lower\nmargins and delays in product delivery, with a corresponding adverse effect on revenues and customer relationships. We attempt to manage these risks through\ndeveloping alternative sources, by staging inventories at strategic locations, through engineering efforts designed to obviate the necessity of certain components and\nby building long-term relationships and close contact with each of our key suppliers; however, we cannot assure that delays in or failures of deliveries of key\ncomponents, either to us or to our contract manufacturers, and consequent delays in product deliveries, will not occur in the future. For a discussion of the impact of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic on our supply chain see “- The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.”\nWe compete in markets that have become increasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and market share.\nThe markets for our products are intensely competitive. Additional manufacturers have entered the markets in recent years to offer products in competition with us.\nAdditionally, certain companies have, in recent years, developed the ability to deliver competing products using coaxial cable and cellular transmission, especially\nin high-density metropolitan areas. Competition will further increase if new companies enter the market or existing competitors expand their product lines. Some of\nthese potential competitors may have greater financial, technological, manufacturing, sales and marketing, and personnel resources than we have. As a result, these\ncompetitors may be able to respond more rapidly or effectively to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, withstand significant price\ndecreases, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can.\nIn addition, our present and future competitors may be able to enter our existing or future markets with products or technologies comparable or superior to those\nthat we offer. An increase in competition could cause us to reduce prices, decrease our market share, require increased spending by us on product development and\nsales and marketing, or cause delays or cancellations in customer orders, any one of which could reduce our gross profit margins and adversely affect our business\nand results of operations.\n19\nOur estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, installation and shipment volumes, field service repair\nobligations and other rework costs incurred in correcting product failures. If our estimates change, our liability for warranty obligations may increase or\ndecrease, impacting future cost of goods sold.\nOur products are highly complex, and we cannot ensure that our extensive product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect all\ndefects, errors, failures and quality issues. Quality or performance problems for products covered under warranty could adversely impact our reputation and\nnegatively affect our operating results, financial position and cash flows. The development and production of new products with high complexity often involves\nproblems with software, components and manufacturing methods. If significant warranty obligations arise due to reliability or quality issues arising from defects in\nsoftware, faulty components or manufacturing methods, our operating results, financial position and cash flows could be negatively impacted by:\n• costs associated with fixing software or hardware defects;\n• costs associated with internal or third-party installation errors;\n• high service and warranty expenses;\n• costs associated with recalling and replacing products with software or hardware defects, including costs from writing-off defective products\nrecalled;\n• high inventory obsolescence expense;\n• delays in collecting accounts receivable;\n• payment of liquidated damages for performance failures;\n• extended performance bond expenses; and\n• a decline in sales to existing customers.\nManaging our inventory is complex and may include write-downs of excess or obsolete inventory.\nManaging our inventory of components and finished products is complicated by a number of factors, including the need to maintain a significant inventory of\ncertain components that are in short supply, that have been discontinued by the component manufacturer, that must be purchased in bulk to obtain favorable pricing\nor that require long lead times. These issues may result in our purchasing and maintaining significant amounts of inventory, which if not used or expected to be\nused based on anticipated production requirements, may become excess or obsolete. Any excess or obsolete inventory could also result in sales price reductions\nand/or inventory write- downs, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n20\nThe continuing growth of our international operations could expose us to additional risks, increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results,\nfinancial condition and cash flows.\nWe are expanding our presence in international markets, which represented 30.5% of our net revenue for 2020, and as a result, we anticipate increased sales and\noperating costs in these markets. This international expansion may increase our operational risks and impact our results of operations, including: exposure to\nunfavorable commercial terms in certain countries; the time and cost to staff and manage foreign operations, including the time and cost to maintain good\nrelationships with employee associations and works councils;\n• exposure to unfavorable commercial terms in certain countries;\n• the time and cost to staff and manage foreign operations, including the time and cost to maintain good relationships with employee associations and\nworks councils;\n• the time and cost to ensure adequate business interruption controls, processes and facilities;\n• the time and cost to manage and evolve financial reporting systems, maintain effective financial disclosure controls and procedures, and comply with\ncorporate governance requirements in multiple jurisdictions;\n• the cost to collect accounts receivable and extension of collection periods;\n• the cost and potential disruption of facilities transitions required in some business acquisitions;\n• risks as a result of less regulation of patents or other safeguards of intellectual property in certain countries;\n• the potential impact of adverse tax, customs regulations and transfer-pricing issues;\n• exposure to increased price competition from additional competitors in some countries;\n• exposure to global social, political and economic instability, changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rate movements;\n• potential exposure to liability or damage of reputation resulting from a higher incidence of corruption or unethical business practices in some\ncountries;\n• potential regulations on data protection, regarding the collection, use, disclosure and security of data;\n• potential trade protection measures, export compliance issues, domestic preference procurement requirements, qualification to transact business and\nadditional regulatory requirements; and\n• potential exposure to natural disasters, epidemics and pandemics (and government regulations in response thereto) and acts of war or terrorism.\nIf we are unable to successfully address the potential risks associated with our overall international expansion, our operating results, financial condition and cash\nflows may be negatively impacted.\nIf we are unable to integrate future acquisitions successfully, it could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may make acquisitions to improve or expand our product offerings, customer base, talent or intellectual property. Our current and future acquisition strategy\nwill depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate acquisitions. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:\n• difficulties integrating and managing the operations, technologies and products of the companies we acquire;\n• our inability to maintain the key business relationships and the brand equity of businesses we acquire;\n• our inability to retain key personnel of the acquired business; and\n• our responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire, some of which we may not anticipate, including costs of third-party advisors to\nresolve disputes.\n21\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining key personnel.\nOur business has grown significantly since its inception. Our success is dependent in large part on the continued employment of our executive officers, including\nThomas R. Stanton, our Chief Executive Officer, and other key management personnel. The unplanned departure of one or more of these individuals could\nadversely affect our business. In addition, for ADTRAN to continue as a successful entity we must also be able to attract and retain key engineers and software\ndevelopers and architects whose expertise helps us maintain competitive advantages. We believe that our future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability\nto continue to attract, retain, train and motivate highly-skilled employees who are in great demand. Stock awards are designed to reward employees for their long-\nterm contributions and to provide incentives for them to remain with us. Changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, may\nadversely affect our ability to retain key employees. Properly managing our continued growth, avoiding the problems often resulting from such growth and\nexpansion and continuing to operate in the manner which has proven successful to us to date will be critical to the future success of our business.\nIf we fail to manage our exposure to worldwide financial and securities markets successfully, our operating results and financial statements could be materially\nimpacted.\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and prices of marketable equity and fixed-income securities. The global\nmacroeconomic environment has been challenging and inconsistent due to uncertainty in the global central bank monetary policy and uncertainty in global credit\nmarkets and the geopolitical environment in many areas of the world. The primary objective of the majority of our investment activities is to preserve principal\nwhile at the same time achieving appropriate yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, a majority of our marketable securities are\ninvestment grade corporate and municipal fixed-rate bonds, U.S. government bonds and municipal money market instruments denominated in U.S. dollars. While\nwe do invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equities, which are subject to market risks, including the loss of principal, our equity investments are generally\ninvested in professionally-managed portfolios with the objective of exceeding the performance of their underlying benchmarks.\nWe have significant investments in corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, U.S. government bonds and\nforeign government bonds. Through December 31, 2020, we have not been required to impair any of these investments; however, we may experience a reduction in\nvalue or loss of liquidity in these investments, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Fixed-rate interest\nsecurities may have their fair value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while variable-rate securities may produce less income than expected if\ninterest rates fall. Our investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may increase because of conditions in the financial\nmarkets and related credit liquidity issues. Consequently, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates, or we may\nsuffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in fair value due to changes in interest rates.\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Part II, Item 7 of this report,\n“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of this report and Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part\nII, Item 8 of this report for more information about our investments\nRisks related to COVID-19\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19, a pandemic. COVID-19 continues to spread and has resulted in authorities\nimplementing numerous measures to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and\nshutdowns. While we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash\nflows due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures, our compliance with these measures has\nimpacted, and may continue to impact, our day-to-day operations and could continue to disrupt our business and operations, as well as that of our customers,\nsuppliers (including contract manufacturers) and other counterparties, for an indefinite period of time. We have experienced, and may continue to experience,\ndisruptions in our supply chain, including a slow-down in supply chain deliveries and some raw material and freight-related cost increases as a result of the\npandemic.\nTo support the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and communities, a majority of our employees are working remotely as of February 26,\n2021. However, there is risk that a number of our employees could be infected with COVID-19, including our key personnel. In addition, many of our customers,\nsuppliers and other counterparties are working remotely, which may delay the timing of some orders and expected deliveries. The disruptions to our operations\ncaused by COVID-19 may result in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our product development, sales, marketing and customer service efforts that we\ncannot fully mitigate through remote or other alternative work arrangements. These additional costs may be partially offset by reduced travel expenses as a result of\ntravel restrictions that we have in place, as well as lower marketing-related costs.\n22\nMore generally, the global pandemic has caused a significant economic downturn and volatility in financial markets, which could affect demand for our products\nand services and impact our results and financial condition even after the pandemic is contained and the shelter-in-place orders are lifted. For example, we may be\nunable to collect receivables from those customers significantly impacted by COVID-19. Also, a decrease in orders could negatively affect our revenues in future\nperiods, particularly if experienced on a sustained basis.\nAlthough we expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances and cash flows that are generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our domestic and\ninternational working capital needs and other capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months, if our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing\ncosts increase as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nMoreover, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate other pre-existing risks, such as political, regulatory, social, financial, operational and\ncybersecurity risks, and those associated with global economic conditions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business.\nRisks related to our control environment\nWe are currently in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) software solution. If we do not effectively implement this project,\nor any future associated updates, our operations could be significantly disrupted.\nWe are currently in the process of implementing of a new ERP software solution. This project requires us to migrate and reconfigure all of our current system\nprocesses, transactions, data and controls to a new cloud-based platform and is expected to have a significant impact on our business processes, financial reporting,\ninformation systems and internal controls. This has required, and will continue to require, significant change management, meaningful investment in capital and\npersonnel resources and coordination of numerous software and system providers and internal business teams. We may experience difficulties, including delays and\nhigher than anticipated costs related to personnel and capital resources, as we manage these changes and transition to this new ERP solution, including loss or\ncorruption of data, delayed shipments, delayed financial reporting, decreases in productivity as our personnel implement and become familiar with the new systems\nand processes, unanticipated expenses (including increased costs of implementation, costs of conducting business or the potential impairment of previously\ncapitalized ERP implementation costs) and lost revenue. Once implemented, we will have cloud driven quarterly updates. Although we will conduct design\nvalidations and user testing, these may cause delays in transacting our business due to system challenges, limitations in functionality, inadequate change\nmanagement or process deficiencies in the production and use of the system. Difficulties in implementing this new ERP solution or the related quarterly updates\ncould disrupt our operations, divert management’s attention from key strategic initiatives and have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial\ncondition and cash flows.\nBreaches of our information systems and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property and cause significant damage to our business and\nreputation.\nWe maintain sensitive data on our information systems and the networks of third-party providers, including intellectual property, financial data and proprietary or\nconfidential business information relating to our business, customers, suppliers and business partners. We also produce networking equipment solutions and\nsoftware used by network operators to ensure security and reliability in their management and transmission of data. Our customers, particularly those in regulated\nindustries, are increasingly focused on the security features of our technology solutions. Maintaining the security of information sensitive to us and our business\npartners is critical to our business and reputation. We rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key operations and\nfinancial functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical. Companies are increasingly subjected to cyber-attacks and other attempts\nto gain unauthorized access. We have a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity, which includes prevention, detection, containment and response. Our layered\ndefense approach encompasses proactive security monitoring of our global infrastructure by both internal solutions and multiple third-party Security Operation\nCenters. Additionally, we routinely perform patch management, vulnerability scans and continuous monitoring across our entire enterprise. Our security policy\nframework includes meaningful and enforceable Information Security policies and procedures. The cybersecurity program is aligned with our mission and business\nobjectives, reviewed periodically for improvements and is supported by experienced and certified security professionals. This is supplemented by an information\nsecurity awareness program spanning our global workforce. Despite this, our network and storage applications and those systems and storage applications\nmaintained by our third-party providers may be subject to unauthorized access by cyber-attack or breached due to operator error, fraudulent activity or other system\ndisruptions. For example, although no indicators of compromise were identified by the Company in response to the SolarWinds Orion cybersecurity breach, we\ncannot absolutely assure that a future malware attack will not be successful in breaching our system and in turn, have a material impact to the Company.\nAdditionally, in some cases, it is difficult to anticipate or immediately detect damage caused by such incidents. Unauthorized access or disclosure of our\ninformation could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. Our information systems are designed to appropriate industry\nstandards to reduce downtime in the event of\n23\npower outages, weather or climate events and cybersecurity issues. The Company carries two cybersecurity insurance policies meant to limit its risk and exposure\nshould one of these cybersecurity issues occur. However, a significant failure of our systems due to these issues could result in significant remediation costs, disrupt\nbusiness operations and divert management attention, which could result in harm to our business reputation, operating results, financial condition and cash flow.\nWhile we have remediated the previously identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, any future material weakness, if not\nremediated, materially adversely affect us.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”) requires us to include in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K an assessment by the Company’s\nmanagement of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a report from our independent registered public accounting firm on the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial\nreporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting,\nas required by Section 404. Our compliance with Section 404 may require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts.\nIn addition, if management or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective,\nwe could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price or lead to\nlitigation claims.\nOur initiatives to remediate a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting identified in the future may not prove successful, and management\nmay not be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Furthermore, even if management were to reach a conclusion that our\ninternal control over financial reporting is effective, if our independent registered public accounting firm or the PCAOB is not satisfied with the adequacy of our\ncontrols, or if the independent registered public accounting firm interprets the requirements, rules or regulations differently than we do, then they in the future may\ndecline to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting or may issue a report that is qualified. Any of these events could result in a loss of investor\nconfidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could negatively affect the price of our common stock.\nRisks related to the telecommunications industry\nWe must continue to update and improve our products and develop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications\ntechnology.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and continuing improvements in the communications\nservice offerings of service providers. If technologies or standards applicable to our products, or service provider offerings based on our products, become obsolete\nor fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our existing products or products under development may become obsolete or unmarketable. Moreover, the\nintroduction of products embodying new technologies, the emergence of new industry standards, or changes in service provider offerings could adversely affect our\nability to sell our products. For instance, we offer a large number of products that apply primarily to the delivery of high-speed digital communications over the\nlocal loop utilizing copper wire. We compete favorably with our competitors by developing a high-performance line of these products. We market products that\napply to fiber optic transport in the local loop. We expect, however, that use of coaxial cable and fixed and mobile wireless access in place of local loop access will\nincrease. Also, MSOs are increasing their presence in the local loop. To meet the requirements of these new delivery systems and to maintain our market position,\nwe expect to continue to develop new products and/or modify existing products. We expect that the addition of fiber-based products focused on the cable MSO\noperators, using EPON and RFoG technologies, and fixed wireless access solutions will better position us to benefit from spending in these adjacent markets.\nOur revenue and profitability in the past have, to a significant extent, resulted from our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards and service\nprovider offerings, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products. Our continued ability to adapt will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving\nour competitive position and our prospects for growth. We cannot assure that we will be able to respond effectively to changes in technology, industry standards,\nservice provider offerings or new product announcements by our competitors. We also cannot assure that we will be able to successfully develop and market new\nproducts or product enhancements, or that these products or enhancements will achieve market acceptance. Any failure by us to continue to anticipate or respond in\na cost-effective and timely manner to changes in technology, industry standards, service provider offerings or new product announcements by our competitors, or\nany significant delays in product development or introduction, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to competitively market our products and on our\nrevenues, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n24\nOur failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable environmental regulations could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe manufacture, assembly and testing of our products may require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to environmental, health and safety regulations.\nOur failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with any of these applicable requirements could result in regulatory penalties, legal claims or\ndisruption of production. In addition, our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to properly manage the use, transportation, emission, discharge,\nstorage, recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could subject us to increased costs or liabilities. Existing and future environmental regulations may restrict our\nuse of certain materials to manufacture, assemble and test products. Any of these consequences could adversely impact our results of operations by increasing our\nexpenses and/or requiring us to alter our manufacturing processes.\nIf our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks, installations may be delayed or canceled, which could harm our business.\nOur products must interface with existing networks, each of which may have different specifications, utilize multiple protocol standards and incorporate products\nfrom other vendors. Many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and\nevolved. Our products may be required to interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks, as well as future products to meet our customers’\nrequirements. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks, we may have to modify our software or\nhardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate with the existing software and hardware. Implementation of product corrections\ninvolving interoperability issues could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations. Such issues may affect our ability to obtain product\nacceptance from other customers.\nWe engage in research and development activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application of developed technologies, and as a\nconsequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially greater research and development efforts and which may\nfocus on more leading edge development.\nWe engage in research and development activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application of developed technologies, and as a\nconsequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially greater research and development efforts. A portion of our\nresearch and development activities are focused on the continued innovation of currently accepted access technologies in order to deliver faster internet speeds,\nmore capacity, better quality of service and operational efficiency. These research and development efforts result in improved applications of technologies for\nwhich demand already exists or is latent. We also focus our research and development efforts on developing software, solutions and platforms that enable service\nproviders to increase revenue-generating service velocity, reducing operational costs, increasing scale and providing service agility. We rarely engage in research\nprojects that represent a vast departure from the current business practices of our key customers. While we believe our strategy provides a higher likelihood of\nproducing nearer term or more sustainable revenue streams, this strategy could result in lost revenue opportunities and higher operating expenses should a new\ntechnology achieve rapid and widespread market acceptance. When we do engage in research and development activities for new, leading-edge technologies and\nmarket approaches, there is no guarantee that those technologies or market approaches will be successful or that they will be adopted and purchased by our\ncustomers.\nOur strategy of outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing requirements to subcontractors located in various international regions may result in us not\nmeeting our cost, quality or performance standards.\nWe are heavily dependent on subcontractors for the assembly and testing of certain printed circuit board assemblies, subassemblies, chassis, enclosures and\nequipment shelves, and the purchase of some raw materials used in such assemblies. This reliance involves several risks, including the unavailability of, or\ninterruptions in, access to certain process technologies and reduced control over product quality, delivery schedules, transportation, manufacturing yields and costs.\nWe may not be able to provide product order volumes to our subcontractors that are high enough to achieve sufficient cost savings. If shipments fall below\nforecasted levels, we may incur increased costs or be required to take ownership of excess inventory. Changes in international tariff structures could adversely\nimpact our product costs. In addition, a significant component of maintaining cost competitiveness is the ability of our subcontractors to adjust their costs to\ncompensate for possible adverse exchange rate movements. To the extent that the subcontractors are unable to do so, and we are unable to procure alternative\nproduct supplies, then our competitiveness and results of operations could be adversely impaired. These risks may be exacerbated by economic, regulatory or\npolitical changes or uncertainties, terrorist actions, the effects of climate change, natural disasters or pandemics in the foreign countries in which our subcontractors\nare located. We do not utilize contract manufacturing for our products in China, though we do source some ODM products from China which are, or may become,\nsubject to import tariffs. Additionally, concerns and additional costs associated with import tariffs imposed on certain products from China has resulted in\nmanufacturers seeking to secure production capabilities outside of China, including in countries where we currently utilize contract manufacturing.\n25\nTo date, we believe that we have successfully managed the risks of our dependence on these subcontractors through a variety of efforts, which include seeking and\ndeveloping alternative subcontractors while maintaining existing relationships; however, we cannot be assured that delays in product deliveries will not occur in the\nfuture because of shortages resulting from this limited number of subcontractors or from the financial or other difficulties of these parties. Our inability to develop\nalternative subcontractors if and as required in the future, or the need to undertake required retraining and other activities related to establishing and developing a\nnew subcontractor relationship, could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which, in turn, could have a negative effect on our customer relationships\nand operating results.\nOur failure to maintain rights to intellectual property used in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality and commercial value of our\nproducts.\nOur future success depends in part upon our proprietary technology. Although we attempt to protect our proprietary technology by contract, trademark, copyright\nand patent registration and internal security, including trade secret protection, these protections may not be adequate. Furthermore, our competitors can develop\nsimilar technology independently without violating our proprietary rights. From time to time, we receive and may continue to receive notices of claims alleging that\nwe are infringing upon patents or other intellectual property. Any of these claims, whether with or without merit, could result in significant legal fees, divert our\nmanagement’s time, attention and resources, delay our product shipments or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. We cannot predict whether we\nwill prevail in any claims or litigation over alleged infringements, or whether we will be able to license any valid and infringed patents, or other intellectual\nproperty, on commercially reasonable terms. If a claim of intellectual property infringement against us is successful and we fail to obtain a license or develop or\nlicense non-infringing technology, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be affected adversely.\nSoftware under license from third parties for use in certain of our products may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe integrate third-party software into certain of our products. Licenses for this technology may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially\nreasonable terms. Difficulties with third-party technology licensors could result in the termination of such licenses, which may result in increased costs or require\nus to purchase or develop a substitute technology. Difficulty obtaining and maintaining third-party technology licenses may disrupt the development of our\nproducts and increase our costs, which could harm our business.\nOur use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products.\nSeveral of our solutions utilize elements of open source or publicly available software. Although we closely monitor our use of open source software, the terms of\nmany open source software licenses have not been interpreted by the courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose\nunanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to sell our products. In such event, we could be required to make our proprietary software generally available\nto third parties, including competitors, at no cost, to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to\ndiscontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or at all, any of which could adversely affect our revenues\nand operating expenses.\nWe may incur liabilities or become subject to litigation that would have a material effect on our business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we accept purchase orders, and enter into sales and other related contracts, for the marketing, sale, manufacture, distribution or\nuse of our products and services. We may incur liabilities relating to our performance under such agreements, or which result from damage claims arising from\ncertain events as outlined within the particular contract. While we attempt to include reasonable limitations of liability and other protective measures to all\nagreements, such agreements may not always contain, or be subject to, maximum loss clauses and liabilities arising from them may result in significant adverse\nchanges to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including employment disputes, patent claims, disputes over contract\nagreements and other commercial disputes. In some cases, claimants seek monetary recovery, or other relief, including damages such as royalty payments related to\npatents, lost profits or injunctive relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. Any such disputes may be resolved before trial, or if tried, may be\nresolved in our favor; however, the cost of claims sustained in litigation, and costs associated with the litigation process, may not be covered by our insurance. Such\ncosts, and the demands on management time during such an event, could harm our business, reputation and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results\nof operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n26\nConsolidation and deterioration in the CLEC market could result in a significant decrease in our revenue.\nWe sell a moderate volume of products directly or indirectly to CLECs who compete with the established ILEC. The CLEC market is experiencing a process of\nconsolidation. Many of our CLEC customers do not have a strong financial position and have limited ability to access the public financial markets for additional\nfunding for growth and operations. If one or more of these CLECs fail, we could face a loss in revenue and an increased bad debt expense, due to their inability to\npay outstanding invoices, as well as the corresponding decrease in customer base and future revenue. Furthermore, significant portions of our sales to CLECs are\nmade through independent distributors. The failure of one or more CLECs could also negatively affect the financial position of a distributor to the point that the\ndistributor could also experience business failure and/or default on payments to us.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and maintain relationships with SIs, service providers and enterprise VARs, our sales may be negatively affected.\nAs part of our sales strategy, we are targeting SIs, service providers and enterprise VARs. In addition to specialized technical expertise, SIs, service providers and\nVARs typically offer sophisticated service capabilities that are frequently desired by enterprise customers. To expand our distribution channel to include resellers\nwith such capabilities, we must be able to provide effective support to these resellers. If our sales, marketing or service capabilities are not sufficient to provide\neffective support to such SIs, service providers and VARs, our sales may be negatively affected, and current SI, service provider and VAR partners may terminate\ntheir relationships with us, which would adversely impact our sales and overall results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nRisks related to the Company’s stock price\nOur operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price.\nOur operating results have been, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors. These factors include, but are\nnot limited to:\n• fluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially with respect to significant network expansion projects undertaken by service\nproviders;\n• continued growth of communications network traffic and the adoption of communication services and applications by enterprise and consumer end\nusers;\n• changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers’ spending plans and associated revenue,\nespecially should a slowdown in communications industry spending occur due to economic downturns, tight capital markets, or declining liquidity\ntrends;\n• reductions in demand for our traditional products as new technologies gain acceptance;\n• our ability, and that of our distributors, to maintain appropriate inventory levels and related purchase commitments;\n• price and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change rapidly due to technological innovation;\n• the overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers;\n• our dependence on sales of our products by channel partners, the timing of their replenishment orders, the potential for conflicts and competition\ninvolving our channel partners and large end-user customers and the potential for consolidation among our channel partners;\n• variations in sales channels, product cost or mix of products and services sold;\n• delays in receiving acceptance, as defined under contract, from certain customers for shipments or services performed near the end of a reporting\nperiod;\n• our ability to maintain high levels of product support and professional services;\n• manufacturing and customer order lead times, and potential restrictions in the supply of key components;\n• fluctuations in our gross margin and the factors that contribute to this (as described above);\n• our ability to achieve cost reductions;\n• the ability of our customers, channel partners and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures;\n• our ability to execute on our strategy and operating plans;\n27\n• benefits anticipated from our investments in engineering, sales and marketing activities;\n• the effects of climate change and other natural events;\n• the effect of political or economic conditions, including the effect of tariffs or so-called “trade wars” on us and our supply chain, acts of war, terrorist\nattacks or other unrest in certain international markets; and\n• changes in tax laws and regulations or accounting pronouncements.\nAs a result, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future\nperiods. Any of the above-mentioned factors, or other factors discussed elsewhere in this report, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, financial condition and cash flows that could adversely affect our stock price.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ADTN. Since our initial public offering in August 1994, there has been, and\nmay continue to be, significant volatility in the market for our common stock, based on a variety of factors, including factors listed in this section, some of which\nare beyond our control.\nRisks related to the regulatory environments in which we do business\nWe are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and standards governing the conduct of our business. Violations of these laws and\nregulations may harm our business, subject us to penalties and to other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that govern conduct by our Company, our employees and agents and the manufacture, sale and use of our products. Our\ninability to comply with current and evolving laws and regulations governing our business domestically and internationally may adversely affect our revenues,\nresults of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. New and changing laws, regulations and industry practices could require us to modify our business,\nproducts or services offered, potentially in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new products, services and features. If we violate these laws and\nregulations, governmental authorities in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions could seek to impose civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have an\nadverse effect on our reputation, as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThese laws and regulations include, but are not limited to:\n• Various regulations and regional standards established by communications authorities and import/export control authorities that govern the manufacture,\nsale and use of our products. Changes in domestic or international communications regulations, tariffs, potential changes in trade policies by the U.S.\nand other nations, application requirements, import/export controls or expansion of regulation to new areas, including access, communications or\ncommerce over the Internet, may affect customer demand for our products or slow the adoption of new technologies which may affect our sales. Further,\nthe cost of complying with the evolving standards and regulations, including the cost of product re-design if necessary, or the failure to obtain timely\ndomestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certification such that we may not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply,\nmay adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n• Compliance with a wide variety of provincial, state, national and international laws and regulations applicable to the collection, use, retention,\nprotection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of data, including personal data. Foreign data protection, privacy and other laws and regulations,\nincluding GDPR, are often more restrictive than those in the U.S. These data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are varied, evolving,\ncan be subject to significant change, may be augmented or replaced by new or additional laws and regulations and may result in ever-increasing\nregulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. For example, California’s Consumer Privacy Act became effective in\nJanuary 2020, providing new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for companies, and, on July 16, 2020, the Court of\nJustice of the European Union issued a decision that invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework as a basis for transfers of personal data from the\nEU to the U.S., resulting in uncertainty and potential additional compliance obligations to ensure that a valid basis under the GDPR exists for these data\ntransfers. There is also a risk that we, directly or as the result of a third-party service provider we use, could be found to have failed to comply with the\nlaws and regulations applicable in a jurisdiction regarding the collection, consent, handling, transfer or disposal of personal data.\n28\n• The FCPA, which prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of directing,\nobtaining or keeping business, and requires companies to maintain reasonable books and records and a system of internal accounting controls. The FCPA\napplies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions\ntaken by employees, strategic or local partners or other representatives. Because a significant portion of our total revenues is generated from sales\noutside of the U.S., we have proactively implemented internally and externally focused measures and controls to address this risk. We help ensure that\nour employees understand the key requirements of FCPA compliance and the consequences of non-compliance through training courses and detective\ncontrols. ADTRAN senior management and employees whose responsibilities include international activities are required to complete an online training\nprogram and pass an exam every two years. We have put processes in place to help detect non-compliance through providing our employees access to a\nworldwide reporting “hotline,” available by phone and online, that is maintained by a third-party provider. Finally, we perform annual reviews of our\nemployees’ expense reports and corporate credit card activity to identify possible corruption concerns. We have also implemented controls to help\nensure our third-party partners and customers observe FCPA requirements. Prior to selling to new international distributors, resellers or agents, we\nreview third-party data and check them against over 200 denied party lists from government institutions worldwide for potential FCPA concerns. We\nalso require international distributors, resellers and agents to complete an Anti-Corruption Due Diligence Questionnaire, which is reviewed and assessed\nby a cross-functional compliance committee and our export-compliance function.\n• Environmental, health and safety regulation governing the manufacture, assembly and testing of our products, including without limitation regulations\ngoverning the use of hazardous materials. Our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to properly manage the use, transportation, emission,\ndischarge, storage, recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could subject us to increased costs or liabilities. Existing and future environmental\nregulations may restrict our use of certain materials to manufacture, assemble and test products.\n• Requirements by the SEC governing the disclosure of the use of “conflict minerals” mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining\ncountries and procedures to identify the source of such minerals included in manufactured products. The disclosures will require us to incur additional\ncosts to verify the origins of the identified minerals used and comply with disclosure requirements. These requirements could affect the availability of\nminerals used in the manufacture of a limited number of parts contained in our products. This may reduce the number of suppliers who provide conflict-\nfree minerals and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Our material sourcing is broad-based and\nmulti-tiered. While we are taking steps to identify sourcing based on recommended standards for our industry, we may not be able to conclusively verify\nthe origins for all minerals used in our products. An inability to make a sourcing determination of minerals in our products could impact our revenues\nand harm our financial condition should our customers require that we certify that all components used in our products are free of minerals from this\nregion.\n29\nChanges in trade policy in the U.S. and other countries, specifically the U.K. and China, including the imposition of additional tariffs and the resulting\nconsequences, may adversely impact our gross profits, gross margins, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe U.S. government has imposed tariffs on a wide range of products and goods manufactured in China and imported into the U.S. These tariffs are intended to\naddress trade imbalances, which include decreasing imports from China and encouraging increased production of these products in the U.S. These proposals have,\nand could continue to, result in increased customs duties and tariffs. We import an increasing percentage of our products into the U.S. from China and an increase\nin customs duties and tariffs with respect to these imports could negatively impact our gross profit, gross margins and results of operations. These customs duties\nand tariffs may also cause other U.S. trading partners to take certain actions with respect to U.S. imports in their respective countries. Any potential changes in\ntrade policies in the U.S. and the potential actions by other countries in which we do business could adversely impact our financial performance.\nIn June 2016, the UK held a referendum, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” in which the majority of voters elected to withdraw from the EU. The UK formally\ndeparted from the EU on Friday, January 31, 2020. Negotiations between the UK and the EU are ongoing regarding the customs and trading relationship between\nthe UK and the EU. Although the terms of withdrawal remain in negotiation, the referendum has created global economic uncertainty, including anticipation of a\npossible slowdown in the global economy. Brexit has resulted in, and likely will continue to result in, significant volatility in the value of the British Pound Sterling\nand Euro currencies. The past year has been challenging for the credit markets due to a shift from a time of quantitative easing to a time of quantitative tightening\nby central banks around the world. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or further deteriorate, we\nmay experience material impacts on our business and operating results. We may also be adversely affected in ways that we do not currently anticipate.\nNew or revised tax regulations, changes in our effective tax rate, recognition of a valuation allowance or assessments arising from tax audits may have an\nadverse impact on our results.\nWe are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions, both domestically and internationally, in which we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in the\ndetermination of our provision for income taxes, and this determination requires the interpretation and application of complex and sometimes uncertain tax laws\nand regulations. Our effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by changes in the mix of earnings between jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, in the\nvaluation of our deferred tax assets, and by changes in tax rules and regulations. We continually monitor our deferred tax assets and when it becomes more likely\nthan not that a tax benefit will not be recognized, a valuation allowance is recorded against those assets. In addition, we are subject to examination of our income\ntax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and various other jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes\nresulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous\nexaminations will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Additionally, we continually review the adequacy of\nthe valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets\nwill be recognized. As such, we may release a portion of the valuation allowance or establish a new valuation allowance based on operations in the jurisdictions in\nwhich these assets arose. Management continues to evaluate all evidence including historical operating results, the existence of losses in the most recent year,\nforecasted earnings, future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Should management determine that a valuation allowance is needed in the future due to not\nbeing able to absorb deferred tax assets, it would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n30\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur headquarters and principal administrative, engineering and manufacturing facilities are located on an 82-acre campus in Cummings Research Park in\nHuntsville, Alabama. Two office buildings serve both our Network Solutions and our Services & Support segments. We lease engineering facilities in the U.S. and\nEurope that are used to develop products sold by our Network Solutions segment. In addition, we lease office space in North America, LATAM, EMEA and\nAPAC, providing sales and service support for both of our segments. These cancelable and non-cancelable leases expire at various times through 2025. For more\ninformation, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nWe also have numerous sales and support staff operating from home-based offices serving both our Network Solutions and our Services & Support segments,\nwhich are located within the U.S. and abroad.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nSecurities Class Action Lawsuit\nOn October 17, 2019, a purported stockholder class action lawsuit, captioned Burbridge v. ADTRAN, Inc. et al., Docket No. 19-cv-09619, was filed in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, two of its current executive officers and one of its former executive officers. The\ncomplaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages on behalf of purported purchasers of ADTRAN securities\nbetween February 28, 2019 and October 9, 2019. The lawsuit claims that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding, and/or failed to\ndisclose material adverse facts about, the Company’s business, operations and prospects, specifically relating to the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting, excess and obsolete inventory reserves, financial results and demand from certain customers. The lawsuit was transferred to the U.S. District Court for\nthe Northern District of Alabama on January 7, 2020, and co-lead plaintiffs have been appointed to represent the putative class. The plaintiffs filed an amended\ncomplaint on April 30, 2020. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on June 17, 2020. The plaintiffs filed an opposition brief to the\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss on July 17, 2020. The defendants filed a reply to the plaintiffs’ brief on August 17, 2020. The motion to dismiss remains under\nreview by the Court. We deny the allegations in the complaint, as amended, and intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit. At this time, we are unable to\npredict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.\nShareholder Derivative Lawsuit\nOn March 31, 2020, a shareholder derivative suit, captioned Johnson (Derivatively on behalf of ADTRAN) v. T. Stanton, M. Foliano, R. Shannon, and Board of\nDirectors, case no. 5:20-cv-00447, was filed in the U.S. District Court of Northern Alabama against two of the Company’s current executive officers, one of its\nformer executive officers and its Board of Directors. The derivative suit, which is purportedly brought on behalf of ADTRAN, makes similar allegations as the\nstockholder class action lawsuit and accuses the directors and officers of breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with those allegations. On June 7, 2020, the Court\nentered an order staying the derivative litigation pending resolution of the motion to dismiss in the securities class action. The Company and its defendants disagree\nwith the claims made in the complaint, and the defendants intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of or\nestimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.\nOther Legal Matters\nIn addition to the litigation described above, from time to time we are subject to or otherwise involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and legal\nproceedings that arise out of or are incidental to the conduct of our business (collectively, “Legal Matters”), including those relating to employment matters, patent\nrights, regulatory compliance matters, stockholder claims, and contractual and other commercial disputes. Such Legal Matters, even if not meritorious, could result\nin the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Additionally, an unfavorable outcome in a legal matter, including in a patent dispute, could\nrequire the Company to pay damages, entitle claimants to other relief, such as royalties, or could prevent the Company from selling some of its products in certain\njurisdictions. While the Company cannot predict with certainty the results of the Legal Matters in which it is currently involved, the Company does not expect that\nthe ultimate outcome of such Legal Matters will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial\ncondition or cash flows.\n31\nITEM 4.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\nThe Company has applied the amendment to Regulation S-K Item 301 which became effective on February 10, 2021.\n34\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. We have omitted discussion of the earliest of the three years of financial condition and results of operations and this information can\nbe found in Part I, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at sec.gov and on our\nwebsite at www.adtran.com.\nThis discussion is designed to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements, the changes in certain\nkey items in those financial statements from period to period, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting\nprinciples affect our consolidated financial statements. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” on page 2 of this report for a description\nof important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected results. See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nADTRAN is a leading global provider of networking and communications platforms and services focused on the broadband access market, serving a diverse\ndomestic and international customer base in multiple countries that includes Tier-1, -2 and -3 service providers, alternative service providers, such as utilities,\nmunicipalities and fiber overbuilders, cable/MSOs, SMBs and distributed enterprises. Our innovative solutions and services enable voice, data, video and internet\ncommunications across a variety of network infrastructures and are currently in use by millions worldwide. We support our customers through our direct global\nsales organization and our distribution networks. Our success depends upon our ability to increase unit volume and market share through the introduction of new\nproducts and succeeding generations of products having lower selling prices and increased functionality as compared to both the prior generation of a product and\nto the products of competitors. In order to service our customers and grow revenue, we are continually conducting research and development of new products\naddressing customer needs and testing those products for the specific requirements of the particular customers. We are focused on being a top global supplier of\naccess infrastructure and related value-added solutions from the cloud edge to the subscriber edge. We offer a broad portfolio of flexible software and hardware\nnetwork solutions and services that enable service providers to meet today’s service demands, while enabling them to transition to the fully-converged, scalable,\nhighly-automated, cloud-controlled voice, data, internet and video network of the future. In addition to our corporate headquarters in Huntsville, Alabama, we have\nresearch and development facilities in strategic global locations.\nAn important part of our strategy is to reduce the cost of each succeeding product generation and then lower the product’s selling price based on the cost savings\nachieved in order to gain market share and/or improve gross margins. As a part of this strategy, we seek to be a high-quality and low-cost provider of products in\nour markets. Our success to date is attributable in large measure to our ability to design our products initially with a view to their subsequent redesign, allowing\nboth increased functionality and reduced manufacturing costs in each succeeding product generation. This strategy enables us to sell succeeding generations of\nproducts to existing customers, while increasing our market share by selling these enhanced products to new customers.\nWe ended 2020 with a year-over-year revenue decline of 4.4%, driven by the decrease in shipments to an international Tier-1 operator partially offset by an\nincrease in shipments to regional service providers in the U.S., alternative network operators in Europe and initial sales to a European Tier-1 operator. During 2020,\nwe had three 10% revenue customers. Our year-over-year domestic revenue growth of 17.0% was driven by growth in both Tier-2 and Tier-3 carrier categories due\nto additional fiber access deployments in both access equipment and CPE. Internationally, our revenue decreased by 32.6% compared to the prior year, primarily\ndriven by a slowdown in shipments to an international Tier-1 operator. In the Asia Pacific region, we experienced growth driven by the acceleration of access\nnetwork builds. Additionally, fiber access continued to experience revenue growth, and, during 2020, we announced multiple long-term Tier-1 next-generation\nfiber access deals in Europe and the U.S., positioning us well for the next access network upgrade investment cycle.\n35\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, there was a\ndownturn in the global financial markets followed by a gradual rebound and a slowdown in the global economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19\ncontinues to spread throughout the U.S. and the world and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus, including travel bans\nand restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. While we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that\nCOVID-19 will have on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of\nthe pandemic and containment measures, our compliance with these measures has impacted our day-to-day operations and could disrupt our business and\noperations, as well as that of our key customers, suppliers and other counterparties, for an indefinite period of time. We have experienced some impact to our\nsupply chain, including a slowdown in supply chain deliveries, extended lead times on some key components and some raw material cost increases. We have also\nhad to increase our volume of inventory to ensure supply continuity during the pandemic. In addition, we have experienced significant increases in freight-related\ncosts. While throughout the pandemic, we have seen increased demand in networking requirements and utilization due to social distancing guidelines issued by\ngovernments, as well as COVID-19 related reductions in travel and infrastructure expenses, it is possible that we could experience some slowdown in demand and\nfurther supply chain issues as the pandemic continues. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our\nbusiness as a result of any economic recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nAmong our customers, we made progress with our fiber and fiber-extension solutions, including PON and Gfast, while also continuing to engage various Services\n& Support opportunities that we expect will contribute to sales in 2021 and beyond. In addition, we believe that we are at the beginning of a significant investment\ncycle for fiber deployment driven by technology advancements and regulatory influences. The transition to next-generation network architectures is beginning, and\nwe are seeing demand for our next-generation SD-Access solutions. In 2021, we anticipate that payments to service providers under government funding programs\nsuch as the FCC RDOF will begin.\nIn addition to classifying our operations into two reportable segments, we report revenue across three categories of products and services – (1) Access &\nAggregation, (2) Subscriber Solutions & Experience and (3) Traditional & Other Products.\nOur Access & Aggregation platforms are used by CSPs to connect their network infrastructure to subscribers. This revenue category includes hardware- and\nsoftware-based products and services that aggregate and/or originate access technologies. ADTRAN solutions within this category include a wide array of modular\nor fixed platforms designed to deliver the best technology and economy based on subscriber density and environmental conditions.\nOur Subscriber Solutions & Experience portfolio is used by service providers to terminate their infrastructure at the customer’s premises while providing an\nimmersive and interactive experience for the subscriber. These solutions include copper and fiber WAN termination, LAN switching, Wi-Fi access, and cloud\nsoftware services, for both residential and business markets.\nOur Traditional & Other Products category generally includes a mix of prior-generation technologies’ products and services, as well as other products and services\nthat do not fit within the other revenue categories.\nOur operating results have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, on a quarterly basis due to a number of factors, including customer order activity and backlog.\nA substantial portion of our shipments in any fiscal period relates to orders received and shipped within that fiscal period for customers under agreements\ncontaining non-binding purchase commitments. Further, a significant percentage of orders require delivery within a few days. These factors normally result in a\nvarying order backlog and limited order flow visibility. Additionally, backlog levels may vary because of seasonal trends, the timing of customer projects and other\nfactors that affect customer order lead times. Because many of our customers require prompt delivery of products, we are required to maintain sufficient inventory\nlevels to satisfy anticipated customer demand. If near-term demand for our products declines, or if potential sales in any quarter do not occur as anticipated, our\nfinancial results could be adversely affected. Operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term; therefore, a shortfall in quarterly revenues could significantly\nimpact our financial results in a given quarter.\n36\nOur operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors, including a decline in general economic and market conditions, specifically the\ndecline that has resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign currency exchange rate movements, increased competition, customer order patterns, changes in\nproduct and services mix, timing differences between price decreases and product cost reductions, product warranty returns, expediting costs, tariffs and\nannouncements of new products by us or our competitors. Additionally, maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases\nthe amount of inventory that may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of this inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and\noperating results. Also, not maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products may cause us to incur expediting costs to meet\ncustomer delivery requirements, which may negatively impact our operating results in a given quarter. During 2019 and continuing into 2020, the Company\ninitiated restructuring plans to realign its expense structure with the reduction in revenue experienced in recent years and with overall Company objectives.\nManagement assessed the efficiency of our operations and consolidated locations and personnel, among other things, and implemented certain cost savings\ninitiatives, where possible. We expect to continue to see a reduction in our operating expenses and cost of sales, both in the U.S. and internationally, as a result of\nour implementation of these restructuring plans.\nOur historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results, and, in general, management expects that our financial results may\nvary from period to period. See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report, for additional information on\nquarterly results for 2020 and 2019. For a discussion of risks associated with our operating results, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents selected financial information derived from our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) expressed as a percentage of revenue for\nthe years indicated.

The emphasis of the discussion is a comparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. For a discussion of a comparison of the\nyears ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nincluded in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020.\n37\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019\nRevenue\nOur revenue decreased 4.4% from $530.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $506.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our Services &\nSupport revenue decreased $6.3 million compared to 2019 and our Network Solutions revenue decreased $17.2 million versus the prior year. The decrease in our\n2020 revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in Access & Aggregation revenue of $35.7 million and Traditional & Other Products revenue of $6.0 million,\npartially offset by increases in Subscriber Solutions & Experience revenue of $18.2 million.\nNetwork Solutions revenue decreased by 3.8% from $455.2 million in 2019 to $438.0 million in 2020, due primarily to a decrease in sales of our Access &\nAggregation products and Traditional & Other Products, partially offset by increases in Subscriber Solutions & Experience revenue. The decrease in revenue of\n9.4% of our Access & Aggregation products for 2020 was primarily attributable to decreased volume in sales of FTTN products. The increase of 11.9% in 2020 for\nsales of our Subscriber Solutions & Experience products was primarily attributable to an increased volume of network termination and Fiber CPE. While we expect\nthat revenue from Traditional & Other Products will continue to decline over time, this revenue may fluctuate, and continue to fluctuate, for years because of the\ntime required for our customers to transition to newer technologies.\nServices & Support revenue decreased by 8.5% from $74.8 million in 2019 to $68.5 million in 2020. The decrease in revenue for 2020 was primarily attributable to\ndecreased sales volume of FTTN products for Access & Aggregation.\nDomestic revenue increased 17.0% from $300.9 million in 2019 to $352.1 million in 2020. Our domestic growth was driven by an increase in revenue to the RSP\nmarket segment and additional fiber deployments across all customers. In addition, such growth was driven by an increase in sales to Tier-2 and Tier-3 customers\nwith diversified business among our fiber access and CPE, service provider CPE and services.\nInternational revenue, which is included in the amounts for the Network Solutions and Services & Support segments amounts discussed above, decreased 32.6%\nfrom $229.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $154.4 for the year ended December 31, 2020. International revenue, as a percentage of total\nrevenue, decreased from 43.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 30.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in international revenue for\n2020 was primarily attributable to the slowdown in shipments to an international Tier-1 customer.\nOur international revenue is largely focused on broadband infrastructure and is affected by the decisions of our customers as to timing for installation of new\ntechnologies, expansion of their networks and/or network upgrades. Our international customers must make these decisions in the regulatory and political\nenvironment in which they operate – both nationally and in some instances, regionally – whether of a multi-country region or a more local region within a country.\nThe competitive landscape in certain international markets is also affected by the increased presence of Asian manufacturers that seek to compete aggressively on\nprice. Our revenue and operating income in some international markets can be negatively impacted by a strengthening U.S. dollar. Consequently, while we expect\nthe global trend towards deployment of more robust broadband speeds and access to continue creating additional market opportunities for us, the factors described\nabove may result in negative pressure on revenue and operating income.\nCost of Sales\nAs a percentage of revenue, cost of sales decreased from 58.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 57.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The\ndecrease was primarily attributable to regional revenue shifts, changes in customer and product mix and a decrease in fixed personnel costs as a result of our\nrestructuring program initiated in 2019.\nNetwork Solutions cost of sales, as a percentage of that segment’s revenue, decreased from 57.9% of revenue in 2019 to 55.8% of revenue in 2020. The decrease in\nNetwork Solutions cost of sales as a percentage of that segment’s revenue was primarily attributable to changes in customer and product mix, a regional revenue\nshift and a decrease in fixed personnel costs as a result of our restructuring program initiated in 2019.\nAn important part of our strategy is to reduce the cost of each succeeding generation of product and then lower the product’s selling price based on the cost savings\nachieved in order to gain market share and/or improve gross margins. This may cause variations in our gross profit percentage due to timing differences between\nthe recognition of cost reductions and the lowering of product selling prices.\nServices & Support cost of sales, as a percentage of that segment’s revenue, increased from 63.1% of revenue in 2019 to 65.3% of revenue in 2020. The increase in\nServices & Support cost of sales as a percentage of that segment’s revenue in 2020 was primarily attributable to changes in services and support mix and volume.\n38\nServices & Support revenue is comprised of network planning and implementation, maintenance, support and cloud-based management services, with network\nplanning and implementation being the largest and fastest growing component in the long-term. Compared to our other services, such as maintenance, support and\ncloud-based management services, our network planning and implementation services typically utilize a higher percentage of internal and subcontracted engineers,\nprofessionals and contractors to perform the work for customers. The additional costs incurred to perform these infrastructure and labor-intensive services\ninherently result in lower average gross margins as compared to maintenance and support services.\nAs our network planning and implementation revenue grew to become the largest component of our Services & Support segment business, our Services & Support\nsegment gross margins decreased versus those reported when maintenance and support comprised the majority of the business. Further, because the growth in our\nnetwork planning and implementation services has resulted in our Services & Support segment revenue comprising a larger percentage of our overall revenue, and\nbecause our Services & Support segment gross margins are generally below those of the Network Solutions segment, our overall corporate gross margins may\ndecline as that business continues to grow. Within the Services & Support segment, we do expect variability in gross margins from quarter-to-quarter based on the\nmix of the services recognized.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 24.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 22.5% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will generally fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in\nrevenues for the periods being compared as these costs are relatively fixed in the short term.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 12.5% from $130.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $114.0 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020. Selling, general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for management, accounting, information technology, human resources,\nsales and marketing, as well as accounting, tax and other professional fees, contract services and legal and litigation related costs. The decrease in selling, general\nand administrative expenses was primarily attributable to lower travel related expenses, personnel costs due to our restructuring program initiated in 2019 and the\ncapitalization of certain costs related to our ongoing enterprise resource planning implementation project as well as marketing related costs, such as trade show\nexpenses, offset by increased contract and professional services mainly related to our enterprise resource planning implementation project.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 23.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 22.4% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate whenever there are incremental product development activities\nor significant fluctuations in revenue for the periods being compared as these costs are relatively fixed in the short term.\nResearch and development expenses decreased by 10.2% from $126.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $113.3 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to lower personnel costs and other expenses, such as operating\nexpenses, which were mainly the result of our restructuring program initiated in 2019 as well as lower travel related costs, partially offset by increased contract\nservices and restructuring related costs.\nWe expect to continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with our new and existing products and our expansion into international markets.\nWe continually evaluate new product and market opportunities and engage in significant research and development efforts which provide for new product\ndevelopment, enhancement of existing products and product cost reductions. We may incur significant research and development expenses prior to the receipt of\nrevenue from a major new product group.\nAsset Impairments\nAsset impairments, which were $3.9 million and less than $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, relate to the abandonment of\ncertain information technology implementation projects in which we had previously capitalized costs. See Note 1 and Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\n39\nGain on Contingency\nGain on contingency, which was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, relates to the reversal of unearned contingent liabilities which were initially\nrecognized upon the acquisition of SmartRG in the fourth quarter of 2018. There was no gain on contingency recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSee Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nInterest and Dividend Income\nInterest and dividend income decreased by 30.0% from $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe decrease in interest and dividend income was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest income as a result of a decline in our investment balances. Our\ninvestment balances decreased due to the maturity of our certificate of deposit which served as collateral for our taxable revenue bonds and the sale of certain\nequity investments for working capital and other purposes. Our investments decreased from $127.7 million as of December 31, 2019 to $83.3 million as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense, which is related to our taxable revenue bonds, decreased by $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019. The decrease was due to the outstanding principal balance of the taxable revenue bonds being paid off upon maturity in January 2020. See\n“Financing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional information on our taxable revenue bond.\nNet Investment Gain\nWe recognized a net investment gain of $11.4 million and $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in our net\ninvestment gain was primarily attributable to changes in fair value of equity securities recognized during the period and impairment charges related to an equity\ninvestment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our investments were impacted by varying market conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which\nresulted in a sharp downturn in the markets during the first quarter of 2020 followed by market improvements and more positive results from a favorable portfolio\nmix during the remainder of 2020. We expect that any future equity market volatility, whether from COVID-19 or other factors, will result in continued volatility in\nour investment portfolios. See “Investing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and Note 1 and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net, decreased from income of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to expense of $3.3 million for the year ended December\n31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, other income (expense), net, is comprised primarily of gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. For the\nyear ended December 31, 2019, other income (expense), net, consisted mainly of the receipt of a one-time insurance proceeds from a life insurance policy.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit\nOur effective tax rate decreased from an expense of 113.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 to a benefit of 138.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe change in the effective tax rate between the two periods was primarily driven by the establishment of a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax\nassets in the amount of $42.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, and tax benefits generated from loss carrybacks as a result of the passage of the\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) partially offset by tax expense in foreign jurisdictions during the year ended December\n31, 2020. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nNet Income (Loss)\nAs a result of the above factors, our net income increased from a net loss of $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to net income of $2.4 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2020. As a percentage of revenue, net loss was 10.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a percentage of revenue, net income\nwas 0.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n40\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nWe have historically financed, and currently expect to continue to finance, our ongoing business with existing cash, investments and cash flow from operations. We\nhave used, and expect to continue to use, existing cash, investments and cash generated from operations for working capital, business acquisitions, purchases of\ntreasury stock, shareholder dividends and other general corporate purposes, including product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop\nnew products, expand our sales and marketing activities and fund capital expenditures. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash\ngenerated from operations will be adequate to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.\nAs of December 31, 2020, cash on hand was $60.2 million and short-term investments were $3.1 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of\n$63.3 million, of which $49.7 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2019, cash on hand was $73.8 million and short-term investments\nwere $33.2 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $107.0 million, of which $52.3 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. The decrease in\nshort-term liquidity from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to the maturity of a certificate of deposit of $25.6 million that served\nas collateral for our revenue bond, which matured in January 2020, and the sale of certain equity investments for working capital and other purposes.\nOn November 4, 2020, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement and related Promissory Note (together, the “Revolving Credit\nAgreement”) with Cadence Bank, N.A., as lender (the “Lender”). The Revolving Credit Agreement provides the Company with a new $10.0 million secured\nrevolving credit facility. Loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to 1.50% over the screen rate as obtained by Reuter’s,\nBloomberg or another commercially available source as may be designated by the Lender from time to time; provided, however, that in no event shall the\napplicable rate of interest under the Revolving Credit Agreement be less than 1.50% per annum. Such loans are secured by all of the cash, securities, securities\nentitlements and investment property in a certain bank account, as outlined in the Revolving Credit Agreement, at a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75%\ndetermined by dividing the full commitment amount under the Revolving Credit Agreement on the date of testing, determined by the Lender each fiscal quarter, by\nthe market value of the collateral. The Revolving Credit Agreement matures on November 4, 2021, subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain\nevents of default. The Company entered into the Revolving Credit Agreement in order to increase the flexibility and management of its short-term liquidity. To\ndate, the Company has not made any draws under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Company agreed to certain negative covenants that are customary for\ncredit arrangements of this type, including, among other things, restrictions on the Company’s ability to enter into mergers, acquisitions or other business\ncombination transactions, grant liens or suffer a material adverse change in the condition or affairs (financial or otherwise) of the Company, which negative\ncovenants are subject to certain exceptions. The Company must be in compliance with all covenants to be able to draw on the line of credit. As of December 31,\n2020, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.\nOperating Activities\nOur working capital, which consists of current assets less current liabilities, increased 7.5% from $207.6 million as of December 31, 2019 to $223.2 million as of\nDecember 31, 2020. The current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, increased from 2.84 as of December 31, 2019 to 3.37 as of December\n31, 2020. The increase in our working capital and current ratio was primarily attributable to an increase in inventory, accounts receivable and other receivables,\npartially offset by a decrease in cash and short-term investments, which consisted of a certificate of deposit related to our taxable revenue bond as of December 31,\n2019 and the related bonds payable. The quick ratio, defined as cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and net accounts receivable, divided by current\nliabilities, decreased from 1.75 as of December 31, 2019 to 1.72 as of December 31, 2020. The decrease in the quick ratio was primarily attributable to the decrease\nin cash and cash equivalents as well as a decrease in short-term investments, offset by a decrease in current liabilities due to the repayment of our revenue bond\npayable.\nNet accounts receivable increased 9.2% from $90.5 million as of December 31, 2019 to $98.8 million as of December 31, 2020. Our allowance for doubtful\naccounts was less than $0.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Quarterly accounts receivable DSO decreased from 72 days as of December 31, 2019 to 70\ndays as of December 31, 2020. The decrease in DSO was due to the timing of product shipments and customer mix.\nOther receivables increased 30.0% from $16.6 million as of December 31, 2019 to $21.5 million as of December 31, 2020. The increase in other receivables was\nprimarily attributable to increases in income tax receivables related to the CARES Act partially offset by a decrease in contract assets and purchasing shipments.\n41\nAnnual inventory turnover decreased from 3.14 turns as of December 31, 2019 to 2.58 turns as of December 31, 2020. Inventory increased 27.6% from $98.3\nmillion as of December 31, 2019 to $125.5 million as of December 31, 2020. The increase in inventory was due to increased purchases in preparation for new\nproduct ramp ups as well as strategic inventory buffer purchases to ensure supply continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect inventory levels to\nfluctuate as we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory in response to COVID-19 uncertainties related to supply chain and supply, seasonal cycles of our business\nand ensuring competitive lead times while managing the risk of inventory.\nAccounts payable increased 11.3% from $44.9 million as of December 31, 2019 to $49.9 million as of December 31, 2020. Accounts payable will fluctuate due to\nvariations in the timing of the receipt of supplies, inventory and services and our subsequent payments for these purchases.\nInvesting Activities\nCapital expenditures totaled approximately $6.4 million, $9.5 million and $8.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These\nexpenditures were primarily used to purchase manufacturing and test equipment, software, computer hardware and building improvements.\nOur combined short-term and long-term investments decreased $44.5 million from $127.7 million as of December 31, 2019 to $83.3 million as of December 31,\n2020. This decrease reflects the maturity of a certificate of deposit which served as collateral for our revenue bond and the sale of certain equity investments for\nworking capital and other purposes.\nWe typically invest all available cash not required for immediate use in operations, primarily in securities that we believe bear minimal risk of loss. See Note 6 of\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information. As of December 31, 2020, our corporate bonds,\nmunicipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, U.S. government bonds, and foreign government bonds were classified as\navailable-for-sale and had a combined duration of 1.74 years with an average Standard & Poor’s credit rating of AA-. Because our investment portfolio has a high-\nquality rating and contractual maturities of short duration, we are able to obtain prices for these bonds derived from observable market inputs, or for similar\nsecurities traded in an active market, on a daily basis.\nOur long-term investments decreased 15.2% from $94.5 million as of December 31, 2019 to $80.1 million as of December 31, 2020. Our investments include\nvarious marketable equity securities classified as long-term investments with a fair market value of $11.0 million and $35.8 million, as of December 31, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019, respectively. Long-term investments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 also included $23.9 million and $21.7 million, respectively, related to\nour deferred compensation plan, and $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of other investments, consisting of interests in a private equity fund.\nFinancing Activities\nIn conjunction with the 1995 expansion of our Huntsville, Alabama, facility, we were approved for participation in an incentive program offered by the State of\nAlabama Industrial Development Authority (“the Authority”). Pursuant to the program, in January 1995, the Authority issued $20.0 million of its taxable revenue\nbonds (the “Taxable Revenue Bonds”) and loaned the proceeds from the sale of the Taxable Revenue Bonds to ADTRAN. Further advances on the Taxable\nRevenue Bonds were made by the Authority, bringing the total amount outstanding to $50.0 million. The bonds matured on January 1, 2020, and the current\noutstanding balance of $24.6 million was repaid in full on January 2, 2020. We were required to make payments to the Authority in amounts necessary to pay the\ninterest on the Taxable Revenue Bonds which totaled $1.0 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company\nhad no outstanding debt as of December 31, 2020. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for\nadditional information.\nDividends\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018, we paid shareholder dividends totaling $17.3 million, $17.2 million and $17.3 million, respectively. The Board of Directors presently\nanticipates that it will declare a regular quarterly dividend so long as the present tax treatment of dividends exists and adequate levels of liquidity are maintained.\nThe following table shows dividends per common share paid to our shareholders in each quarter of 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nDividends per Common Share\n2020 2019 2018\nFirst Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nSecond Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nThird Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nFourth Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09 $ 0.09\n42\nStock Repurchase Program\nSince 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of our common\nstock, which are implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant. There were no stock repurchases during the year\nended December 31, 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we repurchased less than 0.1 million shares and 1.0 million shares, respectively, for\n$0.2 million and $15.5 million, respectively, at an average price of $14.06 and $15.52 per share, respectively. We currently have authorization to repurchase an\nadditional 2.5 million shares of our common stock under the current authorization of up to 5.0 million shares.\nStock Option Exercises\nTo accommodate employee stock option exercises, we issued less than 0.1 million shares of treasury stock for $0.5 million during the year ended December 31,\n2019 and 0.1 million shares of treasury stock for $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. There were no stock option exercises during the year\nended December 31, 2020.\nEmployee Pension Plan\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries. Pension benefit plan obligations are based on various assumptions\nused by our actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, compensation rate increases, expected return on plan assets,\nretirement rates and mortality rates. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in assumptions could affect future expenses and obligations.\nOur defined benefit plan assets consist of a balanced portfolio of equity funds, bond funds, real estate funds and managed futures. Our investment policy includes\nvarious guidelines and procedures designed to ensure assets are invested in a manner necessary to meet expected future benefits earned by participants and consider\na broad range of economic conditions. Central to the policy are target allocation ranges by asset class, which is currently 50% for bond funds, 40% for equity funds\nand 10% cash, real estate and managed futures. The objectives of the target allocations are to maintain investment portfolios that diversify risk through prudent\nasset allocation parameters, achieve asset returns that meet or exceed the plans’ actuarial assumptions and achieve asset returns that are competitive with like\ninstitutions employing similar investment strategies. The investment policy is periodically reviewed by us and a designated third-party fiduciary for investment\nmatters. The policy is established and administered in a manner that is compliant at all times with applicable government regulations. At December 31, 2020, the\nestimated fair market value of our defined benefit pension plans assets increased to $32.3 million from $28.0 million at December 31, 2019.\nThe defined benefit pension plan is accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the use of various assumptions, including an expected rate of return on plan\nassets and a discount rate. The expected return on our German plan assets that is utilized in determining the benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost is\nderived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using\nstandard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent\nplan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return. The discount rate has been derived from the returns of\nhigh-quality, corporate bonds denominated in Euro currency with durations close to the duration of our pension obligations. The projected benefit obligation for our\ndefined benefit pension plans was $50.9 million and $43.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe components of net periodic pension cost, other than the service cost component, are included in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome (Loss). The components of net periodic pension cost and amounts recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31,\n2020, 2019 and 2018 were $1.6 million, $3.2 million and $6.1 million, respectively.\nActuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). To the extent unamortized gains and losses exceed 10% of the higher of\nthe market-related value of assets or the projected benefit obligation, the excess is amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost over the remaining service\nperiod of active participants. We estimate that $0.9 million will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic pension cost in\n2021 for the net actuarial loss. The net actuarial loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $13.5\nmillion and $13.0 million, respectively.\nSee Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nWe do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or\nother persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or the\navailability of, or requirements for, capital resources.\n43\nContractual Obligations\nWe have various contractual obligations and commercial commitments. The following table sets forth the annual payments we are required to make under\ncontractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2020:\n(In thousands) Total 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 After 2025\nPledged collateral(1) $ 6,000 $ 6,000 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nPurchase obligations(2) 143,944 136,924 2,839 2,123 2,056 2 —\nOperating lease obligations(3) 5,554 1,895 1,600 1,251 521 287 —\nTotals $ 155,498 $ 144,819 $ 4,439 $ 3,374 $ 2,577 $ 289 $ —\n(1) We are required to maintain a pledged collateral amount related to a letter of credit agreement entered into with a bank to guarantee performance obligations\nunder a contract with a certain customer. The obligations under this customer contract will be performed over multiple years. As of December 31, 2020, the\nCompany was required to maintain a minimum collateral value of $9.0 million. The letter of credit was secured by a pledge of a portion of the Company’s fixed-\nincome securities, which totaled $11.2 million as of December 31, 2020. The Company increased its pledged collateral to the maximum value of our minimum\ncollateral requirement of $15.0 million in February 2021 as the Company reached certain milestones as outlined in the customer contract. Any shortfalls in the\nminimum collateral value are required to be restored by the Company from available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and/or long-term\ninvestments. The collateral under the letter of credit will be released when all obligations under the customer contract have been met.\n(2) Primarily relates to open purchase orders to our contract manufacturers, component suppliers, service partners and other vendors, including those assisting with\nthe implementation of our new ERP system.\n(3) Primarily relates to future minimum rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases, including renewals determined to be reasonably assured, with\noriginal maturities of greater than 12 months.\nWe have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $5.0 million in a private equity fund, of which $4.9 million has been applied to these commitments. The\nadditional $0.1 million commitment has been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of when it will be applied.\nCertain contracts, customers and/or jurisdictions in which we do business require us to provide various guarantees of performance such as bid bonds, performance\nbonds and customs bonds. As of December 31, 2020, we had commitments related to these bonds totaling $15.2 million, which expire at various dates through\nAugust 2024. Although the triggering events vary from contract to contract, in general we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of\ndefault in our performance under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote.\nWe also have obligations related to uncertain income tax positions that have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of when the related expense\nwill be recognized. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nOn November 4, 2020, the Company, as borrower, entered into a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement and related Promissory Note (together, the “Revolving\nCredit Agreement”) with Cadence Bank, N.A., as lender (the “Lender”). See Liquidity and Capital Resources – Liquidity for further information.\n44\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the\ntime the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could\nmaterially impact the results of financial operations. Several accounting policies, as described in Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included\nin Part II, Item 8 of this report, require material subjective or complex judgment and have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations,\nas applicable. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated\nFinancial Statements:\nRevenue\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a customer and as performance\nobligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied. Generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of a product to the customer. Review of contracts with\ncustomers, for both direct customers and distributors, are performed and assessed for principal versus agent considerations to determine primary responsibility for\ndelivery of performance obligation, presumed inventory risk, and discretion in establishing pricing, when applicable. For transactions where there are multiple\nperformance obligations, individual products and services are accounted for separately if they are distinct (if a product or service is separately identifiable from\nother items and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer). The consideration, including any\ndiscounts, is allocated between separate products and services based on their stand-alone selling prices. Stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the\nprices at which the separate products and services are sold and are allocated based on each item’s relative value to the total value of the products and services in the\narrangement. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate stand-alone selling prices primarily using the “expected cost plus a margin” approach. Payment\nterms are generally 30 days in the U.S. and typically longer in many geographic markets outside the U.S. Shipping fees are recorded as revenue and the related cost\nis included in cost of sales. Sales, value-added and other taxes collected concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Costs of\nobtaining a contract, if material, are capitalized and amortized over the period that the related revenue is recognized if greater than one year. We have elected to\naccount for shipping fees as a cost of fulfilling the related contract. We have also elected to apply the practical expedient related to the incremental costs of\nobtaining contracts and recognize those costs as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets is one year or less. These costs are included in\nselling, general and administrative expenses. Capitalized costs with an amortization period greater than one year were immaterial.\nRevenue is generated by two reportable segments: Network Solutions and Services & Support.\nNetwork Solutions Segment - Includes hardware products and software defined next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or business networks,\nas well as prior generation products. The majority of the revenue from this segment is from hardware sales.\nHardware and Software Revenue\nRevenue from hardware sales is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally when the products are shipped. Shipping terms are\ngenerally FOB shipping point. Revenues from software license sales are recognized at delivery and transfer of control to the customer. Revenue is recorded net of\nestimated discounts and rebates using historical trends. Customers are typically invoiced when control is transferred and revenue is recognized. Our products\ngenerally include assurance-based warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects.\nIn certain transactions, we are also the lessor in sales-type lease arrangements for network equipment that have terms of 18 months to five years. These\narrangements typically include network equipment, network implementation services and maintenance services.\nServices & Support Segment – A complete portfolio of maintenance, network implementation and solutions integration and managed services, which include\nhosted cloud services and subscription services to complement our Network Solutions segment.\nMaintenance Revenue\nOur maintenance service periods range from one month to five years. Customers are typically invoiced and pay for maintenance services at the beginning of the\nmaintenance period. We recognize revenue for maintenance services on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period as our customers benefit evenly\nthroughout the contract term and deferred revenues, when applicable, are recorded in unearned revenue and non-current unearned revenue.\nNetwork Implementation Revenue\n45\nWe recognize revenue for network implementation, which primarily consists of engineering, execution and enablement services at a point in time when each\nperformance obligation is complete. If we have recognized revenue but have not billed the customer, the right to consideration is recognized as a contract asset that\nis included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when the completed performance\nobligation is invoiced to the customer.\nInventory\nWe carry our inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost being determined using the first-in, first-out method. Standard costs for material,\nlabor, and manufacturing overhead are used to value inventory and are updated at least quarterly. Most variances are expensed in the current period; therefore, our\ninventory costs approximate actual costs at the end of each reporting period. We establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the\ndifference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on estimated reserve percentages, which consider\nhistorical usage, known trends, inventory age and marketing conditions. If actual trends and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by\nmanagement, we may be required to make additional inventory write-downs. Our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $39.6 million and $34.1 million at\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Inventory disposals charged against the reserve were $6.0 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31,\n2020 and 2019, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nFor purposes of determining the estimated fair value of market-based performance stock unit (PSU) awards on the date of grant, the Monte Carlo Simulation\nvaluation method is used. These PSUs are subject to a market condition based on the relative total shareholder return of ADTRAN against all of the companies in\nthe NASDAQ Telecommunications Index and vest at the end of a three-year performance period. The fair value of performance-based PSUs, restricted stock units\n(RSUs) and restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the business day immediately preceding the grant date. Compensation expense related to\nunvested performance-based PSUs is recognized over the requisite service period of three years as the achievement of the performance obligation becomes\nprobable. For purposes of determining the estimated fair value of our stock option awards on the date of grant, we use the Black-Scholes Model. This model\nrequires the input of certain assumptions that require subjective judgment. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, expected stock price volatility over the\nterm of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. Because our stock option awards have characteristics significantly different\nfrom those of traded options, and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the existing model may not provide a\nreliable, single measure of the fair value of our stock option awards. Management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the\nestimated fair value of stock-based compensation. Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes\nto these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact our fair value determination. If factors change in future periods, the compensation expense\nthat we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of\neach year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below\nits carrying amount. We have elected to by-pass a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit to\nwhich the goodwill is assigned is less than its carrying amount and, in turn, performed a step-1 analysis of goodwill. No impairment charges on goodwill were\nrecognized during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n46\nIncome Taxes\nWe estimate our income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing\nauthorities. We also make judgments regarding the realization of deferred tax assets and establish valuation allowances where we believe it is more likely than not\nthat future taxable income in certain jurisdictions will be insufficient to realize these deferred tax assets. Our estimates regarding future taxable income and income\ntax provision or benefit may vary due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws, or other factors. If our assumptions, and consequently our estimates,\nchange in the future, the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased, impacting future income tax expense. We continually review the\nadequacy of our valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the\ndeferred tax assets will be realized in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Due to a decrease in revenue and profitability for 2019, and all other positive and\nnegative objective evidence considered as part of our analysis, our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as projections for future growth is limited\nwhen evaluating whether our deferred tax assets will be realized. As such, the Company is no longer able to conclude that it is more likely than not that our\ndomestic deferred tax assets will be realized and a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets was established in the third quarter of 2019. The\namount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted in future periods in the event sufficient evidence is present to support a\nconclusion that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our domestic deferred tax assets will be realized.\nWe establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain. We adjust\nthese reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, as facts and circumstances change.\nLiability for Warranty\nOur products generally include warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the time of product shipment based on our\nhistorical return rate and an estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products. We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes,\nincluding actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. Our products continue to become more complex in both size and functionality\nas many of our product offerings migrate from line card applications to total systems. The increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences,\nwhen they arise, to be more costly. Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage, and other rework\ncosts incurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise. Should our\nactual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to record additional warranty expense. The liability for warranty\nobligations totaled $7.1 million and $8.4 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other\nliabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPension Benefit Plan Obligations\nPension benefit plan obligations are based on various assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates,\ncompensation rate increases, expected return on plan assets, retirement rates and mortality rates. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in\nassumptions could affect future expenses and obligations. Our net pension liability totaled $18.7 million and $15.9 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively. This liability is included in pension liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report\nfor additional information.\n47\nSubsequent Events\nOn February 3, 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common share to be paid to the\nCompany’s stockholders of record at the close of business on February 18, 2021. The dividends will be paid on March 4, 2021 in the aggregate amount of\napproximately $4.4 million.\nAs part of our required pledged collateral related to a letter for credit agreement entered into with a bank to guarantee performance obligations under a contract\nwith a certain customer, the Company increased its pledged collateral to $15.0 million as of February 2021. We do not anticipate any additional increases in the\ncollateral value at this time as we have reached the maximum amount of the letter of credit required under our contract with the customer. The collateral under the\nletter of credit will be released when all obligations under the customer contract have been met.\n48\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency rates and prices of marketable equity and fixed-income securities. In addition, the\nongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused an economic downturn and volatility in financial markets. The primary objective of the large majority of our investment\nactivities is to preserve principal while at the same time achieving appropriate yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, a majority of\nour marketable securities are investment grade, fixed-rate bonds and municipal money market instruments denominated in U.S. dollars. Our investment policy\nprovides limitations for issuer concentration, which limits, at the time of purchase, the concentration in any one issuer to 5% of the market value of our total\ninvestment portfolio.\nWe maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions. As of December 31, 2020, $56.3 million of our cash and cash equivalents, primarily certain\ndomestic money market funds and foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government provided insured depository limits. Although these depository\ninvestments exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit-worthiness of these financial institutions and determined the risk of material\nfinancial loss due to exposure of such credit risk to be minimal.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately $46.0 million of our cash and investments may be directly affected by changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2020,\nwe held $4.4 million of cash and variable-rate investments where a change in interest rates would impact our interest income. A hypothetical 50 basis point decline\nin interest rates as of December 31, 2020, assuming all other variables remain constant, would reduce annualized interest income on our cash and investments by\nless than $0.1 million. In addition, we held $41.6 million of fixed-rate bonds whose fair values may be directly affected by a change in interest rates. A hypothetical\n50 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2020, assuming all other variables remain constant, would reduce the fair value of our fixed-rate bonds\nby approximately $0.4 million.\nWe are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent that such changes affect our revenue and gross margin on revenue derived from some\ninternational customers, expenses, and assets and liabilities held in non-functional currencies related to our foreign subsidiaries. Our primary exposures to foreign\ncurrency exchange rate movements are with our German subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Euro, and our Australian subsidiary, whose functional\ncurrency is the Australian dollar. Our revenue is primarily denominated in the respective functional currency of the subsidiary and paid in that subsidiary’s\nfunctional currency or certain other local currency. Our global supply chain predominately invoices us in the respective functional currency of the subsidiary and is\npaid in U.S. dollars, and some of our operating expenses are invoiced and paid in certain local currencies (approximately 13% of total operating expense for the\nyear ended December 31, 2020, respectively). Therefore, our revenues, gross margins, operating expenses and operating income are all subject to foreign currency\nfluctuations. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates could cause variations in our operating income.\nWe have certain customers and suppliers who are invoiced or pay in a non-functional currency. Changes in the monetary exchange rates used to invoice such\ncustomers versus the functional currency of the entity billing such customers may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. To manage the\nvolatility relating to these typical business exposures, we may enter into various derivative transactions, when appropriate. We do not hold or issue derivative\ninstruments for trading or other speculative purposes. All non-functional currencies billed would result in a combined hypothetical gain or loss of $2.3 million if the\nU.S. dollar weakened or strengthened 10% against the billing currencies. This change represents an increase in the amount of hypothetical gain or loss compared to\nprior periods and is mainly due to an increase in U.S. dollar denominated billings in a non-U.S. dollar denominated subsidiary. Although we do not currently hold\nany derivative instruments, any gain or loss would be partially mitigated by any derivative instruments held.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had certain material contracts subject to currency revaluation, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and lease liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any forward contracts outstanding.\nFor further information about the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2020, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part\nII, Item 8 of this report.\n49\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe following consolidated financial statements are contained in this report.\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 51\nFinancial Statements 53\nConsolidated Balance Sheets,\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019 53\nConsolidated Statements of Income (Loss),\nYears Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 54\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss),\nYears Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 55\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity,\nYears Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 56\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows,\nYears Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 57\nSchedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts,\nYears Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 108\n50\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of ADTRAN, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ADTRAN, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and\nthe related consolidated statements of income (loss), of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to\nas the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December\n31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nappearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions\nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n51\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii)\ninvolved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical\naudit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nExcess and Obsolete Inventory Reserve\nAs described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated net inventory and inventory reserve as of December 31, 2020 were\n$125.5 million and $39.6 million, respectively. Management establishes reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the\ncost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on estimated reserve percentages, which consider historical usage, known trends,\ninventory age, and market conditions.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the excess and obsolete inventory reserve is a critical audit matter are (i)\nthe significant judgment by management in estimating the excess and obsolete inventory reserve, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment,\nsubjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to the estimated reserve percentages.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the excess and obsolete inventory reserve. These procedures also included,\namong others, testing management’s process for developing the excess and obsolete inventory reserve; evaluating the appropriateness of the approach; testing the\ncompleteness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach, including historical usage and inventory age; and evaluating the reasonableness of the\nestimated reserve percentages used by management to determine the excess and obsolete inventory reserve. Evaluating the reasonableness of the estimated reserve\npercentages involved assessing whether they were consistent with the historical data and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n/s/

(“ADTRAN” or the “Company”) is a leading global provider of networking and communications platforms and services focused on the broadband\naccess market. Our vision is to enable a fully connected world where the power to communicate is available to everyone, everywhere. Our unique approach,\nunmatched industry expertise and innovative solutions enable us to address almost any customer need. Our products and services are utilized by a diverse global\ncustomer base of network operators that range from those having regional or national reach and operating as telephone or cable television network operators to\nalternative network providers such as municipalities or utilities, as well as, managed service providers who serve small- and medium-sized businesses and\ndistributed enterprises.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”)\nand include the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity and cash flows of ADTRAN and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Our more significant estimates include excess and obsolete inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates, determination and\naccrual of the deferred revenue components of multiple element sales agreements, estimated costs to complete obligations associated with deferred revenues and\nnetwork installations, estimated income tax provision and income tax contingencies, fair value of stock-based compensation, assessment of goodwill and other\nintangibles for impairment, estimated lives of intangible assets, estimated pension liability, fair value of investments, evaluation of other-than-temporary declines in\nthe value of investments and our allowance for current expected credit losses. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates.\nWe assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available\nto us and the unknown future impacts of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) as of December 31, 2020 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters\nassessed included, but were not limited to, the allowance for doubtful accounts, current estimated credit losses, stock-based compensation, excess and obsolete\ninventory reserves, carrying value of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets, financial assets, valuation allowances for tax assets and revenue recognition.\nWhile there was not a material impact to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 resulting from these assessments,\nfuture conditions related to the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to our consolidated\nfinancial statements in future reporting periods.\nCorrection of Immaterial Misstatement\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company determined that there was an immaterial misstatement of its excess and obsolete inventory reserves in\nits previously issued annual and interim financial statements. The Company corrected this misstatement by recognizing a $0.8 million out-of-period adjustment\nduring the three months ended June 30, 2019, which increased its excess and obsolete inventory reserve and cost of goods sold for the period. For the six and\ntwelve months ended June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2019, respectively, the out-of-period adjustment was a cumulative $0.2 million reduction in its excess and\nobsolete inventory reserve and cost of goods sold. Management determined that the correction of this misstatement was not material to any of its previously issued\nfinancial statements on both a quantitative and qualitative basis.\n58\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, it was determined that certain investments held in the Company’s stock for a deferred compensation plan accounted for as a Rabbi\ntrust were incorrectly classified as long-term investments with the fair value of such investments incorrectly marked to market at each period end rather than\nclassified as treasury stock held at historical cost. This plan has been in existence since 2011. The Company corrected this misstatement as an out-of-period\nadjustment in the three months ended March 31, 2020 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, by remeasuring the investment assets to their historical\ncost basis through the recording of a net investment gain of $1.5 million in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) and then correcting the classification by\ndecreasing the long-term investment balance at its remeasured cost basis of $2.8 million to treasury stock in the Consolidated 2020 Balance Sheet. Management has\ndetermined that this misstatement was not material to any of its previously issued financial statements and that correction of the misstatement was not material to\nthe 2020 annual financial results on either a quantitative or qualitative basis.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents represent demand deposits, money market funds and short-term investments classified as available-for-sale with original maturities of\nthree months or less. We maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions. As of December 31, 2020, $56.3 million of our cash and cash\nequivalents, primarily certain domestic money market funds and foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government provided insured depository limits.\nAlthough these depository investments may exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit worthiness of these applicable financial\ninstitutions and determined the risk of material financial loss due to the exposure of such credit risk to be minimal.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash consists of certain collateral which secures the Company’s performance obligation under a contract with a certain customer.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value\ndue to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying amount reported for bonds payable was $24.6 million, which was its fair\nvalue as of December 31, 2019.\nInvestments with contractual maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities\nrepresent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Despite the long-term nature of their stated contractual maturities, we routinely buy and sell\nthese securities and we believe we have the ability to quickly sell them to the remarketing agent, tender agent or issuer at par value plus accrued interest in the\nevent we decide to liquidate our investment in a particular variable rate demand note. All income generated from these investments is recorded as interest income.\nWe have not recorded any losses relating to variable rate demand notes.\nLong-term investments is comprised of deferred compensation plan assets, corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-\nbacked bonds, U.S. and foreign government bonds, marketable equity securities and other equity investments. Marketable equity securities are reported at fair value\nas determined by the most recently traded price of the securities at the balance sheet date, although the securities may not be readily marketable due to the size of\nthe available market. Any changes in fair value are recognized in net investment gain (loss). Realized gains and losses on sales of debt securities are computed\nunder the specific identification method and are included in other income (expense). See Note 6 for additional information.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe record accounts receivable at net realizable value. Prior to establishing payment terms for a new customer, we evaluate the credit risk of the customer. Credit\nlimits and payment terms established for new customers are re-evaluated periodically based on customer collection experience and other financial factors. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, single customers comprising more than 10% of our total accounts receivable balance included three customers, which accounted for 41.5% of\nour total accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2019, single customers comprising more than 10% of our total accounts receivable balance included four\ncustomers, which accounted for 53.2% of our total accounts receivable.\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\n59\nAccounting Policy Under Topic 326\nWe regularly review the need for an allowance for credit losses related to our outstanding accounts receivable balances using the historical loss-rate method as well\nas assessing asset-specific risks. The assessment of asset-specific risks included the evaluation of relevant available information, from internal and external sources,\nrelating to current conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay, such as the customer’s current financial condition or credit rating by geographic location,\nas provided by a third party and/or by customer, if needed, and overall macro-economic conditions in which the customer operates. Based on this assessment, an\nallowance for credit loss would be recorded if the Company determined that, based on our historical write-offs, which have been immaterial, and such asset specific\nrisks, there was risk in collectability of the full amount of any accounts receivable.\nAccounting Policy Prior to Adoption of Topic 326\nPrior to adoption of Topic 326 on January 1, 2020, we regularly reviewed the need to maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and considered factors such as\nthe age of accounts receivable balances, the current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay, significant one-time events impacting these\ncustomers and our historical experience. If the financial condition of a customer deteriorated, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, we may\nhave been required to record an allowance for doubtful accounts.\nInventory\nInventory is carried at the lower of cost and estimated net realizable value, with cost being determined using the first-in, first-out method. Standard costs for\nmaterial, labor and manufacturing overhead are used to value inventory and are updated at least quarterly. We establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete\ninventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on estimated reserve percentages,\nwhich consider historical usage, known trends, inventory age and market conditions. When we dispose of excess and obsolete inventories, the related disposals are\ncharged against the inventory reserve. See Note 7 for additional information.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment, which is stated at cost, is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We depreciate\nbuilding and land improvements from five to 39 years, office machinery and equipment from three to seven years, engineering machinery and equipment from\nthree to seven years, and computer software from three to five years. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Major\nimprovements that materially prolong the lives of the assets are capitalized. Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are recorded in\noperating income (loss). See Note 8 for additional information.\nIntangible Assets\nPurchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives of the\nrespective assets, which is two to 14 years. See Note 11 for additional information.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles\nLong-lived assets used in operations and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount of an asset may not be recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value. An\nimpairment loss would be recognized in the amount by which the recorded value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, measured by the quoted market\nprice of an asset or an estimate based on the best information available in the circumstances. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019,\nwe recognized an impairment loss of less than $0.1 million and $3.9 million, respectively, related to the abandonment of certain information technology\nimplementation projects for which we had previously capitalized expenses. There were no impairment losses for long-lived assets during the year ended December\n31, 2018, or for intangible assets recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.\n60\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of\neach year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below\nits carrying amount. We have elected to by-pass a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit to\nwhich the goodwill is assigned is less than its carrying amount and, in turn, performed a step-1 analysis of goodwill. No impairment charges related to goodwill\nwere recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nLiability for Warranty\nOur products generally include warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the time of product shipment based on our\nhistorical return rate and estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products. We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including\nactively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. The increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences, when they\narise, to be more costly. Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage and other rework costs\nincurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise. Should our actual\nexperience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to record additional warranty expense. The liability for warranty obligations\ntotaled $7.1 million and $8.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the\naccompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nA summary of warranty expense and write-off activity for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nBalance at beginning of period $ 8,394 $ 8,623 $ 9,724\nPlus: Amounts charged to cost and expenses 1,538 4,569 7,392\nLess: Deductions (2,786) (4,798) (8,493)\nBalance at end of period $ 7,146 $ 8,394 $ 8,623\nPension Benefit Plan Obligations\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries. Pension benefit plan obligations are based on various assumptions\nused by our actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, compensation rate increases, expected return on plan assets,\nretirement rates and mortality rates. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in assumptions could affect future expenses and obligations. Our\nnet pension liability totaled $18.7 million and $15.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have two stock incentive plans from which stock options, performance stock units (“PSUs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock are available\nfor grant to employees and directors. Costs related to these awards are recognized over their vesting periods. All employee and director stock options granted under\nour stock option plans have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the award, as defined in the plan, of the underlying common stock on the grant date.\nAll of our outstanding stock option awards are classified as equity awards and therefore are measured at fair value on their grant date.\nStock-based compensation expense recognized for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $6.8 million, $7.0 million and $7.2\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options, PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock was\napproximately $16.7 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 2.9 years. See Note 5 for additional information.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs include compensation for engineers and support personnel, contracted services, depreciation and material costs associated with\nnew product development, enhancement of current products and product cost reductions. We continually evaluate new product opportunities and engage in\nintensive research and product development efforts. Research and development costs totaled $113.3 million, $126.2 million and $124.5 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n61\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe following table presents changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, by components of accumulated other comprehensive income\n(loss) for the years ended December 31, 2020 2019 and 2018:\nUnrealized\nGains (Losses)\non Available- Defined Foreign\nfor-Sale Benefit Plan Currency ASU 2018-02\n(In thousands) Securities Adjustments Adjustments Adoption (2) Total\nBalance as of December 31, 2017 $ 2,567 $ (4,286) $ (1,576) $ — $ (3,295)\nOther comprehensive loss before\nreclassifications 685 (3,890) (4,236) — (7,441)\nAmounts reclassified to retained earnings (1) (3,220) — — — (3,220)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss (595) 135 — — (460)\nBalance as of December 31, 2018 (563) (8,041) (5,812) — (14,416)\nOther comprehensive loss before\nreclassifications 573 (1,717) (1,480) — (2,624)\nAmounts reclassified to retained earnings (1) — — — 385 385\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss (294) 532 — — 238\nBalance as of December 31, 2019 (284) (9,226) (7,292) 385 (16,417)\nOther comprehensive loss before\nreclassifications 749 (1,231) 4,857 — 4,375\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss (433) 836 — — 403\nBalance as of December 31, 2020 $ 32 $ (9,621) $ (2,435) $ 385 $ (11,639)\n(1) With the adoption of ASU 2016-01, the unrealized gains on our equity investments were reclassified to retained earnings.\n(2) With the adoption of ASU 2018-02 on January 1, 2019, stranded tax effects related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 were reclassified to retained\nearnings.

Under this approach, deferred taxes\nrepresent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes\nrepresents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from the difference between\nfinancial and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when such changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are\nrecorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.\nWe establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain. We adjust\nthese reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, as facts and circumstances change.\n63\nForeign Currency\nTransactions with customers that are denominated in foreign currencies are recorded using the appropriate exchange rates from throughout the year. Assets and\nliabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the balance sheet dates using the closing rates of exchange between those foreign currencies and the\nfunctional currency with any transaction gains or losses reported in other income (expense). Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements\nare with our German subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Euro, our Australian subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Australian dollar and our\nBritish subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Great British pound. Adjustments resulting from translating financial statements of international subsidiaries\nare recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nRevenue\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in\nTopic 605, Revenue Recognition.\nAccounting Policy under Topic 606\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a customer and as performance\nobligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied. Generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of a product to the customer. Review of contracts with\ncustomers, for both direct customers and distributors, are performed and assessment made regarding principal versus agent considerations to determine primary\nresponsibility for delivery of performance obligation, presumed inventory risk, and discretion in establishing pricing, when applicable. For transactions where there\nare multiple performance obligations, individual products and services are accounted for separately if they are distinct (if a product or service is separately\nidentifiable from other items and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer). The consideration,\nincluding any discounts, is allocated between separate products and services based on their stand-alone selling prices. Stand-alone selling prices are determined\nbased on the prices at which the separate products and services are sold and are allocated based on each item’s relative value to the total value of the products and\nservices in the arrangement. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate stand-alone selling prices primarily using the “expected cost plus a margin”\napproach. Payment terms are generally 30 days in the U.S. and typically longer in many geographic markets outside the U.S. Shipping fees are recorded as revenue\nand the related cost is included in cost of sales. Sales, value-added and other taxes collected concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from\nrevenue. Costs of obtaining a contract, if material, are capitalized and amortized over the period that the related revenue is recognized if greater than one year. We\nhave elected to account for shipping fees as a cost of fulfilling the related contract. We have also elected to apply the practical expedient related to the incremental\ncosts of obtaining contracts and recognize those costs as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets is one year or less. These costs are\nincluded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Capitalized costs with an amortization period greater than one year were immaterial.\nRevenue is generated by two reportable segments: Network Solutions and Services & Support.\nNetwork Solutions Segment - Includes hardware products and software defined next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or business networks,\nas well as prior generation products. The majority of the revenue from this segment is from hardware revenue.\nHardware and Software Revenue\nRevenue from hardware sales is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally when the products are shipped. Shipping terms are\ngenerally FOB shipping point. Revenue from software license sales are recognized at delivery and transfer of control to the customer. Revenue is recorded net of\nestimated discounts and rebates using historical trends. Customers are typically invoiced when control is transferred and revenue is recognized. Our products\ngenerally include assurance-based warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects, which are accrued at the time products are delivered.\n64\nServices & Support Segment - A complete portfolio of maintenance, network implementation and solutions integration and managed services, which include\nhosted cloud services and subscription services to complement our Network Solutions segment.\nMaintenance Revenue\nOur maintenance service periods range from one month to five years. Customers are typically invoiced and pay for maintenance services at the beginning of the\nmaintenance period. We recognize revenue for maintenance services on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period as our customers benefit evenly\nthroughout the contract term and deferred revenues, when applicable, are recorded in current and non-current unearned revenue.\nNetwork Implementation Revenue\nWe recognize revenue for network implementation, which primarily consists of engineering, execution and enablement services at a point in time when each\nperformance obligation is complete. If we have recognized revenue but have not billed the customer, the right to consideration is recognized as a contract asset that\nis included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when the completed performance\nobligation is invoiced to the customer.\nSee Notes 4 and 16 for additional information on reportable segments.\nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue primarily represents customer billings on maintenance service programs and unearned revenues related to multiple element contracts where we\nstill have contractual obligations to our customers. We currently offer maintenance contracts ranging from one month to five years. Revenue attributable to\nmaintenance contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over the related contract term. In addition, we provide software maintenance and a variety of hardware\nmaintenance services to customers under contracts with terms up to ten years. When we defer revenue related to multiple performance obligations where we still\nhave contractual obligations, we also defer the related costs. Current deferred costs are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the accompanying\nConsolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $1.1 million and $1.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Non-current deferred costs are included in\nother non-current assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled less than $0.1 million and $0.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\nEarnings (Loss) per Share\nEarnings (loss) per common share and earnings (loss) per common share assuming dilution, are based on the weighted average number of common shares and,\nwhen dilutive, common equivalent shares outstanding during the year. See Note 19 for additional information.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company records assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, when applicable, and intangible assets recognized as part of business\ncombinations based on their fair values on the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible\nassets and liabilities assumed or acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the estimated fair values of net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nexceed the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recorded. The Company’s estimates of fair value are based on historical experience, industry knowledge,\ncertain information obtained from the management of the acquired company and, in some cases, valuations performed by independent third-party firms. The results\nof operations of acquired companies are included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) since their dates of acquisition. Costs incurred to\ncomplete the business combination, such as legal, accounting or other professional fees are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred.\n65\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-14, Compensation – Retirement Benefits\n– Defined Benefit Plans – General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans, which makes\nchanges to and clarifies the disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. ASU 2018-14 requires additional disclosures\nrelated to the reasons for significant gains and losses affecting the benefit obligation and an explanation of any other significant changes in the benefit obligation or\nplan assets that are not otherwise apparent in other disclosures required by ASC 715. ASU 2018-14 also clarifies the guidance in ASC 715 to require disclosure of\nthe projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with PBOs in excess of plan assets and the accumulated benefit obligation\n(“ABO”) and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with ABOs in excess of plan assets. ASU 2018-14 was effective for public business entities for fiscal years\nending after December 15, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the disclosures in the consolidation financial statements. See Note\n15 for additional information.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair\nValue Measurement, which changes the fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. The amendments in this ASU are\nthe result of a broader disclosure project, Concepts Statement No. 8 — Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting — Chapter 8 — Notes to Financial\nStatements, which the FASB finalized on August 28, 2018. The FASB used the guidance in the Concepts Statement to improve the effectiveness of ASC 820’s\ndisclosure requirements. ASU 2018-13 provides users of financial statements with information about assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of\nfinancial position or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. More specifically, ASU 2018-13 requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and\ninputs that are used to arrive at measures of fair value, including judgments and assumptions that are made in determining fair value. In addition, ASU 2018-13\nrequires disclosures regarding the uncertainty in the fair value measurements as of the reporting date and how changes in fair value measurements affect\nperformance and cash flows. The Company adopted ASU 2018-13 on January 1, 2020, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for\nImplementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. ASU 2018-15 clarifies certain aspects of ASU 2015-05,\nCustomer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. Specifically, ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation\ncosts incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementations costs incurred to develop or obtain internal\nuse software. The Company adopted ASU 2018-15 on January 1, 2020, retrospectively. The adoption of this standard resulted in a reclassification of $5.6 million\nfrom property, plant and equipment to other non-current assets for certain previously capitalized costs related to information technology implementation projects\nthat had not yet been placed in service on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. There was no impact to previously\nreported net cash provided by (used in) operations on the statement of cash flows and no impact to the statements of income (loss) as no portion of the capitalized\nasset was depreciated in prior periods.\nThe following table illustrates the impact of adoption of ASU 2018-15 on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019:\nAs of December 31, 2019\n(In thousands) Pre-Adoption Effect of Adoption As Presented Now\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nProperty, plant and equipment, net $ 73,708 $ (5,622) $ 68,086\nOther non-current assets $ 14,261 $ 5,622 $ 19,883\nThere was no impact upon adoption of ASU 2018-15 on the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the Consolidated\nStatement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 as outlined in the following tables:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019\n(In thousands) Pre-Adoption Effect of Adoption As Presented Now\nConsolidated Statement of Income (Loss)\nNet income (loss) $ (52,982) $ — $ (52,982)\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (2,472) $ — $ (2,472)\n66\nThe following table presents the capitalized implementation costs incurred with hosting arrangements, included in other non-current assets on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet, as of December 31, 2020:\n(In thousands) December 31, 2020\nImplementation costs - hosting arrangements $ 13,515\nLess: accumulated amortization —\nImplementation costs - hosting arrangements, net $ 13,515\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which simplifies the accounting for\nincome taxes by removing various exceptions, such as the exception to the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing\noperations and income or a gain from other items. The amendments in this update also simplify the accounting for income taxes related to income-based franchise\ntaxes and require that an entity reflect enacted tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company early adopted ASU 2019-12 on April 1, 2020, which was applied on a prospective basis as if the Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2020.\nThe Company early adopted the standard to take advantage of the simplification of rules for income taxes on intra-period tax allocations. Specifically, the adoption\nof this standard resulted in the recognition of approximately $0.1 million of tax benefit in other comprehensive income (loss), that otherwise would have been\nrecognized in continuing operations had the intra-period tax allocation been completed. There were no other impacts from this standard on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU\n2016-13 requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial instruments held at amortized cost. In November 2018, the FASB issued\nASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326 Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, which clarifies that receivables arising from operating leases are not\nwithin the scope of the credit losses standard, but rather should be accounted for in accordance with the standard for leases. In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU\n2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments–Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial\nInstruments, which clarifies the accounting for transfers between classifications of debt securities and clarifies that entities should include expected recoveries on\nfinancial assets in the calculation of the current expected credit loss allowance. In addition, renewal options that are not unconditionally cancelable should be\nconsidered in the determination of expected credit losses. In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326):\nTargeted Transition Relief, which amends ASU 2016-13 to allow companies, upon adoption, to elect the fair value option on financial instruments that were\npreviously recorded at amortized cost if they meet certain criteria. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326,\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses, which makes various narrow-scope amendments to the new credit losses standard, such as providing disclosure relief for\naccrued interest receivables. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-03, Codification Improvements to financial instruments, which clarifies various issues\nrelated to the new credit losses standard, such as the contractual term used to measure expected credit losses for leases and when to record an allowance for credit\nlosses for financial assets that fall under the scope of ASC 860-20, Transfers and Servicing – Sales of Financial Assets. All of these ASUs were codified as part of\nAccounting Standards Codifications (“ASC”) Topic 326 and were effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December\n15, 2019. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020, using a modified-retrospective approach and, therefore, elected to carry forward legacy\ndisclosures for comparative periods and did not adjust the comparative period financial information. Additionally, the Company made an accounting policy\nelection, at the class of financing receivable, not to measure the allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables, as the Company writes off the\nuncollectable accrued interest receivable by reversing any previously recorded interest income in a timely manner (as soon as these amounts are determined to be\nuncollectable). The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 18 for additional information.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. ASU 2017-04\nsimplifies the measurement of goodwill by eliminating step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2017-04, entities are required to compare the fair value\nof a reporting unit to its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.\nASU 2017-04 was effective for annual or interim impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.\n67\nThe Company adopted ASU 2017-04 on January 1, 2020, and the amendments were applied prospectively. The adoption of this standard did not have a material\neffect on our consolidated financial statements.\nNote 2 – Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the Consolidated Balance Sheet that sum to the total of\nthe same such amounts shown in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:\n(In thousands) December 31, 2020\nCash and cash equivalents $ 60,161\nRestricted cash 18\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 60,179\nThe Company did not have any restricted cash as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. See Note 17 for additional information regarding restricted cash.\nNote 3 – Business Combinations\nIn November 2018, we acquired SmartRG, Inc., for cash consideration. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination. We recorded goodwill of\n$3.5 million as a result of this acquisition, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The\nfinancial results of this acquisition are included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. The revenues are included in the Subscriber\nSolutions & Experience category within the Network Solutions and Services & Support reportable segments.\nContingent liabilities with a fair value totaling $1.2 million were recognized at the acquisition date. The required milestones were not achieved and therefore, a gain\nof $1.2 million was recognized upon the reversal of these liabilities during the second quarter of 2019.\nAn escrow in the amount of $2.8 million was set up at the acquisition date to fund post-closing working capital settlements and to satisfy indemnity obligations to\nthe Company arising from any inaccuracy or breach of representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the sellers. The escrow was subject to\narbitration. In December 2019, $1.3 million of the $2.8 million was released from the escrow account pursuant to the agreement and the remaining balance was\nreleased in December 2020.\nIn March 2018, we acquired Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s (SEL) North American EPON business and entered into a technology license and OEM supply\nagreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. (SEI). We recorded a bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, net of income\ntaxes, which was subject to customary working capital adjustments between the parties. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The\nfinancial results of this acquisition are included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. The revenues are included in the Access &\nAggregation and Subscriber Solutions & Experience categories within the Network Solutions and Services & Support reportable segments.\nThe Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes the following revenue and net loss attributable to SmartRG and Sumitomo\nsince the date of acquisition:\nMarch 19, 2018 to\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands) 2018\nRevenue $ 9,186\nNet loss $ (1,297)\nThe following unaudited supplemental pro forma information presents the financial results as if the acquisition of SmartRG and Sumitomo had occurred on January\n1, 2017. This unaudited supplemental pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition been completed on\nJanuary 1, 2018, nor is it indicative of any future results. There were no material, non-recurring adjustments to this unaudited pro forma information.\n(In thousands) 2018\nPro forma revenue $ 559,050\nPro forma net loss $ (33,862)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we incurred acquisition and integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles of $3.8\nmillion, $5.0 million and $2.9 million, respectively, related to the SmartRG and Sumitomo acquisitions.\n68\nNote 4 - Revenue\nThe following is a description of the principal activities from which revenue is generated by reportable segment:\nNetwork Solutions - Includes hardware products and software-defined next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or business networks, as well\nas prior generation products.\nServices & Support - Includes maintenance, network implementation, solutions integration and managed services, which include hosted cloud services and\nsubscription services.\nRevenue by Category\nIn addition to reportable segments, revenue is also reported for the following three categories – Access & Aggregation, Subscriber Solutions & Experience and\nTraditional & Other Products.\nThe following table disaggregates revenue by reportable segment and revenue category for the year ended December 31, 2020:\n(In thousands) Network Solutions Services & Support Total\nAccess & Aggregation $ 262,578 $ 50,560 $ 313,138\nSubscriber Solutions & Experience 161,824 9,263 171,087\nTraditional & Other Products 13,613 8,672 22,285\nTotal $ 438,015 $ 68,495 $ 506,510\nThe following table disaggregates revenue by reportable segment and revenue category for the year ended December 31, 2019:\n(In thousands) Network Solutions Services & Support Total\nAccess & Aggregation $ 289,980 $ 58,894 $ 348,874\nSubscriber Solutions & Experience 144,651 8,269 152,920\nTraditional & Other Products 20,595 7,672 28,267\nTotal $ 455,226 $ 74,835 $ 530,061\nThe following table disaggregates revenue by reportable segment and revenue category for the year ended December 31, 2018:\n(In thousands) Network Solutions Services & Support Total\nAccess & Aggregation $ 301,801 $ 57,069 $ 358,870\nSubscriber Solutions & Experience 129,067 5,393 134,460\nTraditional & Other Products 27,364 8,583 35,947\nTotal $ 458,232 $ 71,045 $ 529,277\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contract revenues that have not yet been recognized for contracts with a duration greater than\none year. As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any significant performance obligations related to customer contracts that had an original expected duration of\none year or more, other than maintenance services, which are satisfied over time. As a practical expedient, for certain contracts we recognize revenue equal to the\namounts we are entitled to invoice, which correspond to the value of completed performance obligations to date. The amount related to these performance\nobligations was $17.7 million and $13.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The Company expects to recognize 61% of the\n$17.7 million as of December 31, 2020 over the next 12 months, with the remainder to be recognized thereafter.\n69\nThe following table provides information about accounts receivable, contract assets and unearned revenue from contracts with customers:\n(In thousands) December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019\nAccounts receivable $ 98,827 $ 90,531\nContract assets(1) $ 63 $ 2,812\nUnearned revenue $ 14,092 $ 11,963\nNon-current unearned revenue $ 6,888 $ 6,012\n(1) Included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOf the outstanding unearned revenue balance as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, $11.0 million and $12.7 million were recognized as revenue during\nthe years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNote 5 – Stock-Based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock for the years ended December 31,\n2020, 2019 and 2018:\n(In thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nStock-based compensation expense included in cost of sales $ 426 $ 369 $ 418\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 4,036 3,889 3,989\nResearch and development expenses 2,372 2,704 2,748\nStock-based compensation expense included in operating expenses 6,408 6,593 6,737\nTotal stock-based compensation expense 6,834 6,962 7,155\nTax benefit for expense associated with non-qualified stock options, PSUs, RSUs and restricted\nstock (1,629) (1,659) (1,432)\nTotal stock-based compensation expense, net of tax $ 5,205 $ 5,303 $ 5,723\nStock Incentive Program Descriptions\n2020 Stock Incentive Plans\nAt the annual meeting of stockholders held on May 13, 2020, the Company’s stockholders approved, upon recommendation of the Board of Directors, the adoption\nof the ADTRAN, Inc. 2020 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2020 Employee Plan”) as well as the ADTRAN, Inc. 2020 Directors Stock Plan (the “2020\nDirectors Plan”). No additional awards will be granted under the Company’s previous stock incentive plans, the ADTRAN, Inc. 2015 Employee Stock Incentive\nPlan (the “2015 Employee Plan”) or the 2010 Directors Stock Plan (the “2010 Directors Plan”) subsequent to the stockholders’ approval of these new stock plans.\nOutstanding awards granted under the 2015 Employee Plan and the 2010 Directors Plan will remain subject to the terms of such plans, and shares underlying\nawards granted under such plans that are cancelled or forfeited will be available for issuance under the 2020 Employee Plan or the 2020 Directors Plan, as\napplicable.\nUnder the 2020 Employee Plan, the Company is authorized to issue 2.8 million shares of common stock to certain employees, key service providers and advisors\nthrough incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs and restricted stock, any of which may be subject to performance-\nbased conditions. RSUs and restricted stock granted under the 2020 Employee Plan will typically vest pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning on the\nfirst anniversary of the grant date. Stock options granted under the 2020 Employee Plan will typically become exercisable beginning after one year of continued\nemployment, normally pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and have a ten-year contractual term. Stock\noptions, RSUs and restricted stock granted under the 2020 Employee Plan reduce the shares authorized for issuance under the 2020 Employee Plan by one share of\ncommon stock for each share underlying the award. Forfeitures, cancellations or expirations of awards granted under the 2015 Employee Plan increase the shares\nauthorized for issuance under the 2020 Employee Plan, with forfeitures, cancellations or expirations of RSUs and restricted stock increasing the shares authorized\nfor issuance by 2.5 shares of common stock for each share underlying the award. Forfeitures, cancellations or expirations of stock options from the 2015 Employee\nPlan increase the shares authorized for issuance under the 2020 Employee Plan by one share of common stock for each share underlying the award.\n70\nUnder the 2020 Directors Plan, the Company is authorized to issue 0.4 million shares of common stock through stock options, restricted stock and RSUs to non-\nemployee directors. Stock awards issued under the 2020 Directors Plan typically will become vested in full on the first anniversary of the grant date. Stock options\nissued under the 2020 Directors Plan will have a ten-year contractual term. Stock options, restricted stock and RSUs granted under the 2020 Directors Plan reduce\nthe shares authorized for issuance under the 2020 Directors Plan by one share of common stock for each share underlying the award. Forfeitures, cancellations and\nexpirations of awards granted under the 2010 Directors Stock Plan increase the shares authorized for issuance under the 2020 Directors Plan by one share of\ncommon stock for each share underlying the award.\nPrevious Stock Incentive Plans\nIn January 2015, the Board of Directors adopted the 2015 Employee Plan, which authorized 7.7 million shares of common stock for issuance to certain employees\nand officers through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock. The 2015 Employee Plan\nwas adopted by stockholder approval at our annual meeting of stockholders held in May 2015. PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock granted under the 2015 Plan reduce\nthe shares authorized for issuance under the 2015 Employee Plan by 2.5 shares of common stock for each share underlying the award. Options granted under the\n2015 Employee Plan typically become exercisable beginning after one year of continued employment, normally pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning\non the first anniversary of the grant date and have a ten-year contractual term. Expiration dates of options outstanding as of December 31, 2020 under the 2015\nEmployee Plan range from 2025 to 2026.\nIn January 2006, the Board of Directors adopted the ADTRAN, Inc. 2006 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”), which authorized 13.0 million shares\nof common stock for issuance to certain employees and officers through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs\nand restricted stock. Options granted under the 2006 Plan typically become exercisable beginning after one year of continued employment, normally pursuant to a\nfour-year vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and had a ten-year contractual term. The 2006 Plan was replaced in May 2015 by the\n2015 Employee Plan. Expiration dates of options outstanding as of December 31, 2020 under the 2006 Plan range from 2021 to 2024.\nIn May 2010, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2010 Directors Plan, under which 0.5 million shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance.\nThis plan replaced the 2005 Directors Stock Option Plan. Under the 2010 Directors Plan, the Company may issue stock options, restricted stock and RSUs to our\nnon-employee directors. Stock awards issued under the 2010 Directors Plan become vested in full on the first anniversary of the grant date. Options issued under\nthe 2010 Directors Plan had a ten-year contractual term. All remaining options under the 2010 Directors Plan expired in 2019.\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock\nThe following table is a summary of our PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 and the changes that occurred during\n2020:\nNumber of Weighted\nshares (In Average Grant\nthousands) Date Fair Value\nUnvested PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding, December 31, 2019 1,891 $ 14.58\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock granted 1,029 $ 11.02\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock vested (453) $ 14.26\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock forfeited (621) $ 18.14\nUnvested PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding, December 31, 2020 1,846 $ 11.49\nThe following table details the significant assumptions that impact the fair value estimate of the market-based PSUs:\n2020 2019 2018\nEstimated fair value per share $14.43 $9.53 to $18.05 $16.59\nExpected volatility 51.88% 32.7% to 38.9% 27.98% to 31.58%\nRisk-free interest rate 0.24% 1.6% to 2.46% 2.11% to 2.99%\nExpected dividend yield 2.85% 2.3% to 4.09% 1.83% to 2.49%\n71\nFor market-based PSUs, the number of shares of common stock earned by a recipient is subject to a market condition based on ADTRAN’s relative total\nshareholder return against all companies in the NASDAQ Telecommunications Index at the end of a three-year performance period. Depending on the relative total\nshareholder return over the performance period, the recipient may earn from 0% to 150% of the shares underlying the PSUs, with the shares earned distributed\nupon the vesting. The fair value of the award is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the expected outcome of the\nimpact of market conditions using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method. A portion of the granted PSUs vests and the underlying shares become deliverable\nupon the death or disability of the recipient or upon a change of control of ADTRAN, as defined by the 2020 Employee Plan. The recipients of the PSUs receive\ndividend credits based on the shares of common stock underlying the PSUs. The dividend credits vest and are earned in the same manner as the PSUs and are paid\nin cash upon the issuance of common stock for the PSUs.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, the Company issued 0.3 million performance-based PSUs under the 2015 Employee Plan to its executive officers. The grant-date\nfair value of these performance-based awards is based on the closing price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. Subject to the grantee’s continued\nemployment, the grantee has the ability to earn shares in a range of 0% to 142.8% of the awarded number of PSUs based on the achievement of a defined\nperformance target at the end of a three-year period. If the Company achieves the performance target at the end of the first or second year during the vesting period,\nthe grantee will be entitled to the target number of performance shares, which will be issued at the end of the three-year period. Equity-based compensation expense\nwith respect to these awards will be adjusted over the vesting period to reflect the probability of achievement of the performance target defined in the award\nagreements.\nThe fair value of RSUs and restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the grant date. RSUs and restricted stock vest ratably over four-year and\none-year periods, respectively.\nWe will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation. If circumstances change, and\nadditional data becomes available over time, we may change our assumptions and methodologies, which may materially impact our fair value determination.\nAs of December 31, 2020, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the non-vested portion of market-based PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock was\napproximately $16.7 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 2.9 years and will be adjusted for actual\nforfeitures as they occur.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 3.6 million shares were available for issuance under shareholder-approved equity plans in connection with the grant and exercise of\nstock options, PSU’s, RSU’s or restricted stock.\nStock Options\nThe following table is a summary of stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the changes that occurred during 2020:\nWeighted Weighted Avg.\nNumber of Average Remaining Aggregate\nOptions (cid:0)(cid:3) Exercise Price(cid:0)(cid:3) Contractual Life Intrinsic(cid:0)(cid:3)Value (cid:0)(cid:3)\n(In thousands) (Per share) in Years (In thousands)\nStock options outstanding, December 31, 2019 3,572 $ 22.88 3.40 $ —\nStock options granted — $ —\nStock options exercised — $ —\nStock options forfeited — $ —\nStock options expired (854) $ 28.00\nStock options outstanding, December 31, 2020 2,718 $ 21.17 2.86 $ —\nStock options exercisable, December 31, 2020 2,718 $ 21.17 2.86 $ —\nAll of these stock options were issued at exercise prices that approximated fair market value at the date of grant. As of December 31, 2020, there was no\nunrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options.\nThe aggregate intrinsic values represent the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between ADTRAN’s closing stock price on the last trading day of 2020 and\nthe exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their\noptions on December 31, 2020. The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of ADTRAN’s stock and was $0 as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\n72\nThe total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $0, $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. The fair value of options fully\nvesting during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was less than $0.1 million, $0.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively.\nThe following table further describes our stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2020:\nOptions Outstanding Options Exercisable\nOptions Weighted Avg.

The\nBlack-Scholes Model requires the input of certain assumptions that involve judgment. Because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from\nthose of traded options, and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, existing models may not provide reliable\nmeasures of fair value of our stock options. The stock option pricing model requires the use of several assumptions that impact the fair value estimate. These\nvariables include, but are not limited to, the volatility of our stock price and employee exercise behaviors.\nThere were no stock options granted in during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nNote 6 – Investments\nDebt Securities and Other Investments\nAs of December 31, 2020, the following debt securities and other investments were included in short-term investments and long-term investments on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet and recorded at fair value:\nAmortized Gross Unrealized Fair\n(In thousands) Cost Gains Losses Value\nCorporate bonds $ 11,762 $ 123 $ — $ 11,885\nMunicipal fixed-rate bonds 2,854 30 — 2,884\nAsset-backed bonds 6,634 74 — 6,708\nMortgage/Agency-backed bonds 11,536 114 (6) 11,644\nU.S. government bonds 9,763 112 — 9,875\nForeign government bonds 1,334 4 (1) 1,337\nCommercial Paper 250 — — 250\nOther 533 — — 533\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities held at fair value $ 44,666 $ 457 $ (7) $ 45,116\nAs of December 31, 2019, the following debt securities and other investments were included in short-term investments and long-term investments on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet and recorded at fair value:\nAmortized Gross Unrealized Fair\n(In thousands) Cost Gains Losses Value\nCorporate bonds $ 9,304 $ 80 $ — $ 9,384\nMunicipal fixed-rate bonds 930 — — 930\nAsset-backed bonds 6,867 26 (3) 6,890\nMortgage/Agency-backed bonds 6,944 26 (8) 6,962\nU.S. government bonds 12,311 21 (9) 12,323\nForeign government bonds 372 — (1) 371\nVariable rate demand notes 800 — — 800\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities held at fair value $ 37,528 $ 153 $ (21) $ 37,660\n73\nAs of December 31, 2020, our debt securities had the following contractual maturities:\nMortgage /\nMunicipal Agency- U.S. Foreign\nCorporate fixed-rate Asset-backed backed government government Commercial\n(In thousands) bonds bonds bonds bonds bonds bonds paper Other\nLess than one year $ 1,477 $ 96 $ 144 $ 63 $ — $ 75 $ 250 $ 533\nOne to two years 2,007 1,245 300 2,129 5,122 462 — —\nTwo to three years 7,013 1,246 622 2,940 4,526 498 — —\nThree to five years 1,388 297 3,658 183 227 302 — —\nFive to ten years — — 1,241 2,095 — — — —\nMore than ten years — — 743 4,234 — — — —\nTotal $ 11,885 $ 2,884 $ 6,708 $ 11,644 $ 9,875 $ 1,337 $ 250 $ 533\nActual maturities may differ from contractual maturities as some borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.\nRealized gains and losses on sales of securities are computed under the specific identification method.

Of the\noutstanding $4.3 million, $3.4 million was issued as an equity investment, which represented a non-cash investing activity. This equity investment, which does not\nhave a readily determinable fair value, was recorded using the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, equity investments that do not have a\nreadily determinable fair value can be recorded at cost less impairment, if any, adjusted for observable price changes for an identical or similar investment. The\ncarrying value of this investment under the measurement alternative was $3.4 million as of December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020,\nimpairment charges totaling $2.6 million were recorded related to this equity investment and are included in net investment gain (loss) on the Consolidated\nStatement of Income (Loss). As a result, the carrying value of this investment was $0.8 million as of December 31, 2020. The remaining amount, $0.9 million of\nthe original $4.3 million note receivable, was reissued as a new note receivable, which is included in long-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as\nof December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, and represented a non-cash investing activity during the year ended December 31, 2019.

Market prices are obtained from a variety of industry\nstandard data providers, large financial institutions and other third-party sources. These multiple market prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based\nalgorithm to determine the daily market value of each security.\nThe fair value of Level 3 securities is calculated based on unobservable inputs. Quantitative information with respect to unobservable inputs consisted of third-party\nvaluations performed in accordance with ASC 820 – Fair Value Measurement. Inputs used in preparing the third-party valuation included the following\nassumptions, among others: estimated discount rates and fair market yields.\nOur variable rate demand notes have a structure that implies a standard expected market price. The frequent interest rate resets make it reasonable to expect the\nprice to stay at par.

During the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company recognized impairment charges of $0.1 million and $3.9 million, respectively, related to the\nabandonment of certain information technology projects in which we had previously capitalized expenses related to these projects. The impairment charges were\ndetermined based on actual costs incurred as part of the projects. No impairment charges were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDepreciation expense was $12.2 million, $12.5 million and $12.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which is recorded in\ncost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).\n77\nNote 9 – Leases\nWe have operating leases for office space, automobiles and various other equipment in the U.S. and in certain international locations. Other contracts, such as\nmanufacturing agreements and service agreements, are reviewed to determine if they contain potential embedded leases. These other contracts are specifically\nreviewed to determine whether we have the right to substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of any specified assets or the right to direct the use of any\nspecified assets, either of which would indicate the existence of a lease.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our operating leases had remaining lease terms of two months to 55 months, some of which included options to extend the leases for up\nto two years, and some of which included options to terminate the leases within three months. For those leases that are reasonably assured to be renewed, we have\nincluded the option to extend as part of our right of use asset and lease liability. Supplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases is as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n(In thousands) Classification 2020 2019\nAssets\nOperating lease assets Other non-current assets $ 5,309 $ 8,452\nTotal lease asset $ 5,309 $ 8,452\nLiabilities\nCurrent operating lease liability Accrued expenses and other liabilities $ 1,806 $ 2,676\nNon-current operating lease liability Other non-current liabilities 3,574 5,818\nTotal lease liability $ 5,380 $ 8,494\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over\nthe lease term. Lease expense related to these short-term leases was less than $0.1 million and $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively, and is included in cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome (Loss). Lease expense related to variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate, such as real estate taxes and insurance reimbursements,\nwas $0.7 million and $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For lease agreements entered into or reassessed after the adoption\nof Topic 842, we elected to not separate lease and non-lease components. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material\nrestrictive covenants.\nThe components of lease expense included in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) were as follows:\nFor the year ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2020 2019\nCost of sales $ 113 $ 64\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 1,311 1,400\nResearch and development expenses 1,121 2,417\nTotal operating lease expense $ 2,545 $ 3,881\nAs of December 31, 2020, operating lease liabilities included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet by future maturity were as follows:\n(In thousands) Amount\n2021 $ 1,895\n2022 1,600\n2023 1,251\n2024 521\n2025 287\nThereafter —\nTotal lease payments 5,554\nLess: Interest (174)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 5,380\n78\nFuture operating lease payments include $0.3 million related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised. There are no legally\nbinding leases that have not yet commenced.\nAn incremental borrowing rate is used based on information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The\nincremental borrowing rate is determined on a portfolio basis by grouping leases with similar terms as well as grouping leases based on a U.S. dollar or Euro\nfunctional currency. The actual rate is then determined based on a credit spread over LIBOR as well as the Bloomberg Curve Matrix for the U.S. Communications\nsection. The following table provides information about our weighted average lease terms and weighted average discount rates:\nAs of December 31,\nWeighted average remaining lease term (years) 2020 2019\nOperating leases with USD functional currency 2.4 2.6\nOperating leases with Euro functional currency 3.6 4.4\nWeighted average discount rate\nOperating leases with USD functional currency 4.47% 4.02%\nOperating leases with Euro functional currency 1.37% 1.84%\nSupplemental cash flow information related to operating leases is as follows:\nAs of December 31,\n(In thousands) 2020 2019\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease assets/liabilities\nCash used in operating activities related to operating leases $ 2,632 $ 3,439\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations $ 324 $ 11,615\nSales-Type Leases\nWe are the lessor in sales-type lease arrangements for network equipment, which have initial terms of up to five years. Our sales-type lease arrangements contain\neither a provision whereby the network equipment reverts back to us upon the expiration of the lease or a provision that allows the lessee to purchase the network\nequipment at a bargain purchase amount at the end of the lease. In addition, our sales-type lease arrangements do not contain any residual value guarantees or\nmaterial restrictive covenants. The allocation of the consideration between lease and non-lease components is determined by stand-alone selling price by\ncomponent. The net investment in sales-type leases consists of lease receivables less unearned income. Collectability of sales-type leases is evaluated periodically\nat an individual customer level. The Company has elected to exclude taxes related to sales-type leases from revenue and the associated expense of such taxes. As of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not have an allowance for credit losses for our net investment in sales-type leases. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the\ncomponents of the net investment in sales-type leases were as follows:\n(cid:0)(cid:3)\nAs of December 31,\n(In thousands) 2020 2019\nCurrent minimum lease payments receivable(1) $ 702 $ 1,201\nNon-current minimum lease payments receivable(2) 347 889\nTotal minimum lease payments receivable 1,049 2,090\nLess: Current unearned revenue(1) 218 365\nLess: Non-current unearned revenue(2) 50 163\nNet investment in sales-type leases $ 781 $ 1,562\n(1) Included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(2) Included in other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n79\nComponents of gross profit related to sales-type lease recognized at the lease commencement date and interest and dividend income, included in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nFor the year ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2020 2019\nRevenue - Network Solutions $ 78 $ 1,723\nCost of sales - Network Solutions 32 675\nGross profit $ 46 $ 1,048\nInterest and dividend income $ 42 $ 357\nAs of December 31, 2020 future minimum lease payments to be received from sales-type leases were as follows:\n(In thousands) Amount\n2021 $ 703\n2022 250\n2023 88\n2024 7\n2025 1\nTotal $ 1,049\nNote 10 – Goodwill\nGoodwill, all of which relates to our acquisitions of Bluesocket, Inc. in 2011 and SmartRG in 2018, was $7.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31,\n2019 of which $6.6 million and $0.4 million was allocated to our Network Solutions and Services & Support reportable segments, respectively.\nThe Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances\nchange that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have elected to by-pass a qualitative assessment to\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned is less than its carrying amount. No\nimpairment charges related to goodwill were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nNote 11 – Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, consisted of the following:\n2020 2019\nAccumulated Accumulated\n(In thousands) Gross Value Amortization Net Value Gross Value Amortization Net Value\nCustomer relationships $ 21,123 $ (8,055) $ 13,068 $ 22,356 $ (7,233) $ 15,123\nDeveloped technology 8,200 (2,546) 5,654 10,170 (3,379) 6,791\nLicensed technology 5,900 (1,830) 4,070 5,900 (1,174) 4,726\nSupplier relationships 2,800 (2,800) — 2,800 (2,508) 292\nLicensing agreements 560 (152) 408 560 (79) 481\nPatents 500 (294) 206 500 (226) 274\nTrade names 210 (146) 64 310 (176) 134\nTotal $ 39,293 $ (15,823) $ 23,470 $ 42,596 $ (14,775) $ 27,821\nThe Company evaluates the carrying value of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not\nbe recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value.

The Revolving Credit Agreement provides the Company with a new $10.0 million secured\nrevolving credit facility. Loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to 1.50% over the screen rate as obtained by Reuter’s,\nBloomberg or another commercially available source as may be designated by the Lender from time to time; provided, however, that in no event shall the\napplicable rate of interest under the Revolving Credit Agreement be less than 1.50% per annum. Such loans are secured by all of the cash, securities, securities\nentitlements and investment property in a certain bank account, as outlined in the Revolving Credit Agreement, at a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75%\ndetermined by dividing the full commitment amount under the Revolving Credit Agreement on the date of testing, determined by the Lender each fiscal quarter, by\nthe market value of the collateral. The Revolving Credit Agreement matures on November 4, 2021, subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain\nevents of default. The Company had not made any draws under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2020.\nNote 13 – Alabama State Industrial Development Authority Financing and Economic Incentives\nIn conjunction with the 1995 expansion of our Huntsville, Alabama facility, we were approved for participation in an incentive program offered by the State of\nAlabama Industrial Development Authority (the “Authority”). Pursuant to the program, in January 1995, the Authority issued $20.0 million of its taxable revenue\nbonds (the “Taxable Revenue Bonds”) and loaned the proceeds from the sale of the Taxable Revenue Bonds to the Company. Further advances on the Taxable\nRevenue Bonds were made by the Authority, bringing the total amount outstanding to $50.0 million. The Taxable Revenue Bonds bore interest, payable monthly\nwith an interest rate of 2% per annum. The Taxable Revenue Bonds’ aggregate principal amount outstanding of $24.6 million matured on January 1, 2020 and was\nrepaid in full on January 2, 2020, using the funds held in a certificate of deposit by the Company. This certificate of deposit, which totaled $25.6 million, was\nincluded in short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019. We made a principal payment of $1.0 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019.\nIn conjunction with this program, we were eligible to receive certain economic incentives from the state of Alabama that reduce the amount of payroll withholdings\nthat we were required to remit to the state for those employment positions that qualify under the program. Economic incentives realized related to payroll\nwithholdings totaled $0, $1.2 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This program concluded on January 2,\n2020 following the maturity of the Taxable Revenue Bonds.\n81\nNote 14 – Income Taxes\nThe components of income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:\n(In thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nCurrent\nFederal $ (10,574) $ (518) $ (8,001)\nState (329) (1,065) (476)\nInternational 3,635 (282) 11,705\nTotal Current (7,268) (1,865) 3,228\nDeferred\nFederal — 24,801 (14,448)\nState — 5,815 (3,390)\nInternational (1,356) (546) 581\nTotal Deferred (1,356) 30,070 (17,257)\nTotal Income Tax Expense (Benefit) $ (8,624) $ 28,205 $ (14,029)\nThe effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate due to the following:\n2020 2019 2018\nTax provision computed at the federal statutory rate 21.00% 21.00% 21.00%\nState income tax provision, net of federal benefit 11.10 6.97 14.53\nFederal research credits 57.63 15.53 14.23\nForeign taxes (17.83) 2.83 (11.45)\nTax-exempt income 1.93 0.49 0.45\nState tax incentives — 3.85 3.15\nChange in valuation allowance 44.79 (172.82) —\nForeign tax credits 17.90 16.69 —\nStock-based compensation (23.36) (6.01) (2.87)\nWithholding taxes (20.83) — —\nBargain purchase — — 8.82\nImpact of CARES Act 45.65 — —\nImpact of U.S. tax reform — — 12.00\nGlobal intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") (0.49) (1.87) (17.48)\nOther, net 0.56 (0.49) (0.34)\nEffective Tax Rate 138.05% (113.83)% 42.04%\nIncome (loss) before expense (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows:\n(In thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nU.S. entities $ (12,833) $ (29,829) $ (74,131)\nInternational entities 6,587 5,052 40,760\nTotal $ (6,246) $ (24,777) $ (33,371)\nIncome (loss) before expense (benefit) for income taxes for international entities reflects income (loss) based on statutory transfer pricing agreements. This amount\ndoes not correlate to consolidated international revenue, which occurs from our U.S. entity.\n82\nDeferred income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial\nreporting and tax purposes. The significant components of current and non-current deferred taxes as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 consist of the following:\n(In thousands) 2020 2019\nDeferred tax assets:\nInventory $ 8,882 $ 7,144\nAccrued expenses 2,331 2,330\nDeferred compensation 6,714 5,660\nStock-based compensation 1,971 2,451\nUncertain tax positions related to state taxes and related interest 149 241\nPensions 8,554 7,074\nForeign losses 2,590 2,925\nState losses and credit carry-forwards 5,509 3,995\nFederal loss and research carry-forwards 17,323 12,171\nLease liabilities 1,588 2,496\nCapitalized research and development expenditures 11,832 22,230\nValuation allowance (45,818) (48,616)\nTotal Deferred Tax Assets 21,625 20,101\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nProperty, plant and equipment (4,546) (2,815)\nIntellectual property (4,375) (5,337)\nRight of use lease assets (1,585) (2,496)\nInvestments (1,250) (1,892)\nTotal Deferred Tax Liabilities (11,756) (12,540)\nNet Deferred Tax Assets $ 9,869 $ 7,561\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was signed into law. Subsequently, the Internal Revenue Service\n(“IRS”) released its final Global Intangible Low Tax Income (“GILTI”) regulations on July 9, 2020. The passage of the CARES Act and subsequent issuance of the\nGILTI final regulations together resulted in the Company’s recognition of a tax benefit in the amount of $10.8 million during 2020, $7.9 million of which related to\nthe utilization of deferred tax assets which had previously been offset with a valuation allowance and $2.9 million primarily related to the tax rate differential on\ncarrying back losses from 2018 and 2019 tax years to prior years in which the U.S. Corporate tax rate was 35% versus the current 21% federal tax rate.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, non-current deferred taxes reflect deferred taxes on net unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments and\ndeferred taxes on unrealized losses in our pension plan. The net change in non-current deferred taxes associated with these items, which resulted in a deferred tax\nbenefit of $0.1 million and $0.4 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, was recorded as an adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), presented in the\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n83\nThe Company continually reviews the adequacy of its valuation allowance and recognizes the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that\nit is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recognized in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Our assessment of the realizability of our\ndeferred tax assets includes the evaluation of evidence, some of which requires significant judgement, including historical operating results, the evaluation of a\nthree-year cumulative income position, future taxable income projections and tax planning strategies. Should management’s conclusion change in the future and\nadditional valuation allowance or a partial or full release of the valuation allowance is necessary, it could have a material effect on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had gross deferred tax assets totaling $55.7 million offset by a valuation allowance totaling $45.8 million and\ngross deferred tax assets totaling $56.2 million offset by a valuation allowance of $48.6 million, respectively. Of the current valuation allowance, $43.8 million has\nbeen established against our domestic deferred tax assets and the remaining $2.0 million is related to foreign net operating loss and research and development credit\ncarryforwards where we lack sufficient activity to realize those deferred tax assets. The change in our valuation allowance for the year ending December 31, 2020\nwas a decrease of $2.8 million. The change in the valuation allowance was primarily related to increases in our deferred tax assets during the year, offset with the\nimpact of monetizing deferred tax assets through net operating loss carryback claims related to the CARES Act of $7.9 million. As of December 31, 2020, the\nremaining $9.9 million in deferred tax assets that were not offset by a valuation allowance are located in various foreign jurisdictions where the Company believes\nit is more likely than not we will realize these deferred tax assets.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\n(cid:0)(cid:3)\nDecember 31, 2020\n(In thousands) Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance Deferred Tax Assets, net\nDomestic $ 43,791 $ (43,791) $ —\nInternational 11,896 (2,027) 9,869\nTotal $ 55,687 $ (45,818) $ 9,869\n(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3)\nDecember 31, 2019\n(In thousands) Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance Deferred Tax Assets, net\nDomestic $ 46,266 $ (46,266) $ —\nInternational 9,911 (2,350) 7,561\nTotal $ 56,177 $ (48,616) $ 7,561\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the deferred tax assets for foreign and domestic loss carry-forwards, research and development tax credits, unamortized\nresearch and development costs and state credit carry-forwards totaled $37.3 million and $41.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, $25.1 million of\nthese deferred tax assets will expire at various times between 2021 and 2040. The remaining deferred tax assets will either amortize through 2029 or carryforward\nindefinitely.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, our cash and cash equivalents were $60.2 million and $73.8 million and short-term investments were $3.1 million\nand $33.2 million, which provided available short-term liquidity of $63.3 million and $107.0 million. Of these amounts, our foreign subsidiaries held cash of $49.7\nmillion and $52.3 million, respectively, representing approximately 78.5% and 48.9% of available short-term liquidity, which is used to fund ongoing liquidity\nneeds of these subsidiaries. As part of our restructuring plan, the Company’s assertion on being indefinitely reinvested changed in a particular jurisdiction during\nthe current year resulting in the accrual of $0.7 million in withholding tax liabilities. The Company maintains its assertion in all other jurisdictions that it is\nindefinitely reinvesting its funds held in foreign jurisdictions outside of the U.S., except to the extent any of these funds can be repatriated without withholding tax.\nHowever, if all of these funds were repatriated to the U.S., or used for U.S. operations, certain amounts could be subject to tax. Due to the timing and circumstances\nof repatriation of such earnings, if any, it is not practicable to determine the amount of funds subject to unrecognized deferred tax liability.\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018, no income tax benefit or expense was recorded for stock options exercised as an adjustment to equity.\n84\nThe change in the unrecognized income tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is reconciled below:\n(In thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nBalance at beginning of period $ 1,487 $ 1,868 $ 2,366\nIncreases for tax position related to:\nPrior years 4 — 3\nCurrent year 165 161 254\nDecreases for tax positions related to:\nPrior years — (71) —\nExpiration of applicable statute of limitations (578) (471) (755)\nBalance at end of period $ 1,078 $ 1,487 $ 1,868\nAs of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our total liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $1.1 million, $1.5 million and $1.9 million, respectively, of which\n$1.0 million, $1.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively, would reduce our effective tax rate if we were successful in upholding all of the uncertain positions and\nrecognized the amounts recorded. We classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the balances of accrued interest and penalties were $0.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\nWe do not anticipate a single tax position generating a significant increase or decrease in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of this\nreporting date. We file income tax returns in the U.S. for federal and various state jurisdictions and several foreign jurisdictions. We are not currently under audit\nby the Internal Revenue Service. Generally, we are not subject to changes in income taxes by any taxing jurisdiction for the years prior to 2017.\nNote 15 – Employee Benefit Plans\nPension Benefit Plan\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries.\nThe pension benefit plan obligations and funded status as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2020 2019\nChange in projected benefit obligation:\nProjected benefit obligation at beginning of period $ 43,902 $ 37,245\nService cost 1,270 1,471\nInterest cost 444 634\nActuarial (gain) loss - experience (744) 453\nActuarial loss - assumptions 2,458 5,091\nBenefit payments (509) (166)\nEffects of foreign currency exchange rate changes 4,106 (826)\nProjected benefit obligation at end of period 50,927 43,902\nChange in plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of period 28,016 24,159\nActual gain on plan assets 1,744 4,392\nContributions 24 —\nEffects of foreign currency exchange rate changes 2,479 (535)\nFair value of plan assets at end of period 32,263 28,016\nUnfunded status at end of period $ (18,664) $ (15,886)\nThe accumulated benefit obligation was $50.9 million and $43.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in the accumulated benefit\nobligation, projected benefit obligation and the actuarial loss was primarily attributable to a decrease in the discount rate during 2020.\n85\nThe net amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the unfunded pension liability as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2020 2019\nCurrent liability $ — $ —\nPension liability 18,664 15,886\nTotal $ 18,664 $ 15,886\nThe components of net periodic pension cost, other than the service cost component, are included in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome (Loss). The components of net periodic pension cost and amounts recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31,\n2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nNet periodic benefit cost:\nService cost $ 1,270 $ 1,471 $ 1,193\nInterest cost 444 634 727\nExpected return on plan assets (1,679) (1,392) (1,548)\nAmortization of actuarial losses 970 795 247\nNet periodic benefit cost 1,005 1,508 619\nOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations\nrecognized in other comprehensive income (loss):\nNet actuarial (gain) loss 1,784 2,488 5,638\nAmortization of actuarial losses (1,212) (771) (196)\nAmount recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) 572 1,717 5,442\nTotal recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other\ncomprehensive income (loss) $ 1,577 $ 3,225 $ 6,061\nThe amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2020 2019\nNet actuarial loss $ (13,545) $ (12,973)\nThe defined benefit pension plan is accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the use of various assumptions, including an expected rate of return on plan\nassets and a discount rate. The expected return on our German plan assets that is utilized in determining the benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost is\nderived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using\nstandard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent\nplan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return. The discount rate has been derived from the returns of\nhigh-quality, corporate bonds denominated in Euro currency with durations close to the duration of our pension obligations.\nThe weighted-average assumptions that were used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as\nfollows:\n2020 2019 2018\nDiscount rate 1.00% 1.75% 2.13%\nRate of compensation increase 2.00% 2.00% 2.00%\nExpected long-term rates of return 5.90% 5.90% 5.90%\nThe weighted-average assumptions that were used to determine the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n2020 2019\nDiscount rate 0.69% 1.00%\nRate of compensation increase 2.00% 2.00%\n86\nActuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). To the extent unamortized gains and losses exceed 10% of the higher of\nthe market-related value of assets or the projected benefit obligation, the excess is amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost over the remaining service\nperiod of active participants.\nWe do not anticipate making any contributions to the pension plan in 2021.\nThe following pension benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid to participants:\n(In thousands)\n2021 $ 714\n2022 1,048\n2023 1,348\n2024 1,657\n2025 1,621\n2026 - 2030 7,615\nTotal $ 14,003\nU.S. GAAP establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy based upon observable and unobservable inputs for fair value measurement of financial instruments:\n• Level 1 – Observable outputs; values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market;\n• Level 2 – Significant inputs that are observable; values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either\ndirectly or indirectly;\n• Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs; values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to\nthe overall fair value measurement. These inputs could include information supplied by investees.\nWe have categorized our cash equivalents and our investments held at fair value into this hierarchy as follows:\nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2020 Using\nQuoted Prices Significant\nin Active Other Significant\nMarkets for Observable Unobservable\nIdentical Assets Inputs Inputs\n(In thousands) Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,935 $ 1,935 $ — $ —\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nBond funds:\nCorporate bonds 6,746 6,746 — —\nGovernment bonds 5,971 5,971 — —\nEmerging markets bonds 307 307 — —\nEquity funds:\nGlobal equity 11,638 11,638 — —\nBalanced fund 2,515 2,515 — —\nEmerging markets 1,848 1,848 — —\nLarge cap value 198 198 — —\nGlobal real estate fund 799 799 — —\nManaged futures fund 306 306 — —\nAvailable-for-sale securities 30,328 30,328 — —\nTotal $ 32,263 $ 32,263 $ — $ —\n87\nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2019 Using\nQuoted Prices Significant\nin Active Other Significant\nMarkets for Observable Unobservable\nIdentical Assets Inputs Inputs\n(In thousands) Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 691 $ 691 $ — $ —\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nBond funds:\nGovernment bonds 6,645 6,645 — —\nCorporate bonds 5,514 5,514 — —\nEmerging markets bonds 531 531 — —\nEquity funds:\nGlobal equity 11,071 11,071 — —\nEmerging markets 956 956 — —\nBalanced fund 863 863 — —\nLarge cap value 312 312 — —\nGlobal real estate fund 902 902 — —\nManaged futures fund 531 531 — —\nAvailable-for-sale securities 27,325 27,325 — —\nTotal $ 28,016 $ 28,016 $ — $ —\nOur investment policy includes various guidelines and procedures designed to ensure assets are invested in a manner necessary to meet expected future benefits\nearned by participants and consider a broad range of economic conditions. Central to the policy are target allocation ranges by asset class, which is currently 50%\nfor bond funds, 40% for equity funds and 10% for cash, real estate and managed futures. The objectives of the target allocations are to maintain investment\nportfolios that diversify risk through prudent asset allocation parameters, achieve asset returns that meet or exceed the plans’ actuarial assumptions and achieve\nasset returns that are competitive with like institutions employing similar investment strategies.\nThe investment policy is periodically reviewed by us and a designated third-party fiduciary for investment matters. The policy is established and administered in a\nmanner that is compliant at all times with applicable government regulations.\n401(k) Savings Plan\nWe maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. 401(k) Retirement Plan (the “Savings Plan”) for the benefit of eligible employees. The Savings Plan is intended to qualify under\nSections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and is intended to be a “safe harbor” 401(k) plan under Code Section\n401(k)(12). The Savings Plan allows employees to save for retirement by contributing part of their compensation to the plan on a tax-deferred basis. The Savings\nPlan also requires us to contribute a “safe harbor” amount each year. We match up to 4% of employee contributions (100% of an employee’s first 3% of\ncontributions and 50% of their next 2% of contributions), beginning on the employee’s one-year anniversary date. In calculating our matching contribution,\ncompensation up to the statutory maximum under the Code is used ($285,000 for 2020). All matching contributions under the Savings Plan vest immediately.\nEmployer contribution expense and plan administration costs for the Savings Plan amounted to approximately $4.0 million, $4.4 million and $4.4 million in 2020,\n2019 and 2018, respectively.\nDeferred Compensation Plans\nWe maintain four deferred compensation programs for certain executive management employees and our Board of Directors.\nThe ADTRAN, Inc. Deferred Compensation Program for Employees is offered as a supplement to our tax-qualified 401(k) plan and is available to certain\nexecutive management employees who have been designated by our Board of Directors. This deferred compensation plan allows participants to defer all or a\nportion of certain specified bonuses and up to 25% of remaining cash compensation and permits us to make matching contributions on a discretionary basis without\nthe limitations that apply to the 401(k) plan. To date, we have not made any matching contributions under this plan. We also maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. Equity\nDeferral Program for Employees. Under this plan, participants may elect to defer all or a portion of their vested PSUs and RSUs to the plan. Such deferrals shall\ncontinue to be held and deemed to be invested in shares of ADTRAN stock unless and until the amounts are distributed or such deferrals are moved to another\ndeemed investment pursuant to an election made by the participant.\n88\nFor our Board of Directors, we maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. Deferred Compensation Program for Directors. This program allows our Board of Directors to defer all\nor a portion of monetary remuneration paid to the Director, including, but not limited to, meeting fees and annual retainers. We also maintain the ADTRAN, Inc.\nEquity Deferral Program for Directors. Under this plan, participants may elect to defer all or a portion of their vested restricted stock awards. Such deferrals shall\ncontinue to be held and deemed to be invested in shares of ADTRAN stock unless and until the amounts are distributed or such deferrals are moved to another\ndeemed investment pursuant to an election made by the director.\nWe have set aside the plan assets for all plans in a rabbi trust (the “Trust”) and all contributions are credited to bookkeeping accounts for the participants. The Trust\nassets are subject to the claims of our creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency. The assets of the Trust are deemed to be invested in pre-approved mutual\nfunds as directed by each participant and the participant’s bookkeeping account is credited with the earnings and losses attributable to those investments. Benefits\nare scheduled to be distributed six months after termination of employment in a single lump sum payment or annual installments paid over a three or ten-year term\nbased on the participant’s election. Distributions will be made on a pro-rata basis from each of the hypothetical investments of the participant’s account in cash.\nAny whole shares of ADTRAN, Inc. common stock that are distributed will be distributed in-kind.\nAssets of the Trust are deemed invested in mutual funds that cover an investment spectrum ranging from equities to money market instruments. These mutual funds\nare publicly quoted and reported at fair value. The fair value of the assets held by the Trust and the amounts payable to the plan participants as of December 31,\n2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2020 2019\nFair Value of Plan Assets\nLong-term investments $ 23,891 $ 21,698\nTotal Fair Value of Plan Assets $ 23,891 $ 21,698\nAmounts Payable to Plan Participants\nDeferred compensation liability $ 25,866 $ 21,698\nTotal Amounts Payable to Plan Participants $ 25,866 $ 21,698\nThe Trust held $2.8 million of common stock in the Company as of December 31, 2020. Shares of the Company held by the Trust are recorded at cost and\nclassified as treasury stock on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nInterest and dividend income of the Trust are included in interest and dividend income in the accompanying 2020, 2019 and 2018 Consolidated Statements of\nIncome (Loss). Changes in the fair value of the plan assets held by the Trust have been included in other income (expense) in the accompanying 2020, 2019 and\n2018 Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). Changes in the fair value of the deferred compensation liability are included as selling, general and administrative\nexpense in the accompanying 2020, 2019 and 2018 Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). Based on the changes in the total fair value of the Trust’s assets, we\nrecorded deferred compensation income (expense) in 2020, 2019 and 2018 of $4.3 million, $3.6 million and $(2.1) million, respectively.\nRetiree Medical Coverage\nMedical, dental and prescription drug coverage is provided to certain spouses and former spouses of current and former officers on the same terms as provided to\nour active officers for up to 30 years. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, this liability totaled $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively.\n89\nNote 16 – Segment Information and Major Customers\nThe chief operating decision maker regularly reviews the Company’s financial performance based on two reportable segments: (1) Network Solutions and\n(2) Services & Support. Network Solutions includes hardware products and software defined next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or\nbusiness networks, as well as prior-generation products. Services & Support includes a portfolio of maintenance, network implementation and solutions integration\nand managed services, which include hosted cloud services and subscription services.\nThe performance of each segment is evaluated based on gross profit; therefore, selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses,\ninterest and dividend income, interest expense, net investment gain (loss), other income (expense) and income tax (expense) benefit are reported on a Company-\nwide basis only. There is no inter-segment revenue. Asset information by reportable segment is not produced and, therefore, is not reported.\nThe following table presents information about revenue and gross profit of our reportable segments for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n2020 2019 2018\n(In thousands) Revenue Gross Profit Revenue Gross Profit Revenue Gross Profit\nNetwork Solutions $ 438,015 $ 193,789 $ 455,226 $ 191,549 $ 458,232 $ 179,303\nServices & Support 68,495 23,762 74,835 27,618 71,045 24,262\nTotal $ 506,510 $ 217,551 $ 530,061 $ 219,167 $ 529,277 $ 203,565\nRevenue by Category\nIn addition to our reportable segments, revenue is also reported for the following three categories – (1) Access & Aggregation, (2) Subscriber Solutions &\nExperience and (3) Traditional & Other Products.\nThe following tables disaggregate our revenue by category for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n2020\nServices &\n(In thousands) Network Solutions Support Total\nAccess & Aggregation $ 262,578 $ 50,560 $ 313,138\nSubscriber Solutions & Experience 161,824 9,263 171,087\nTraditional & Other Products 13,613 8,672 22,285\nTotal $ 438,015 $ 68,495 $ 506,510\n2019\nServices &\n(In thousands) Network Solutions Support Total\nAccess & Aggregation $ 289,980 $ 58,894 $ 348,874\nSubscriber Solutions & Experience 144,651 8,269 152,920\nTraditional & Other Products 20,595 7,672 28,267\nTotal $ 455,226 $ 74,835 $ 530,061\n2018\n(In thousands) Network Solutions Services & Support Total\nAccess & Aggregation $ 301,801 $ 57,069 $ 358,870\nSubscriber Solutions & Experience 129,067 5,393 134,460\nTraditional & Other Products 27,364 8,583 35,947\nTotal $ 458,232 $ 71,045 $ 529,277\n90\nAdditional Information\nThe following table presents revenue information by geographic area for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n(In thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nUnited States $ 352,079 $ 300,853 $ 288,843\nGermany 74,882 78,062 167,251\nMexico 4,087 90,795 12,186\nOther international 75,462 60,351 60,997\nTotal $ 506,510 $ 530,061 $ 529,277\nCustomers comprising more than 10% of revenue can change from year to year. Single customers comprising more than 10% of revenue in 2020 included three\ncustomers, at 15%, 12% and 10%, of which one was a distributor. Single customers comprising more than 10% of revenue in 2019 included three customers at\n19%, 17% and 13%. Single customers comprising more than 10% of revenue in 2018 included two customers at 27% and 17%. Other than those with more than\n10% of revenues disclosed above, and excluding distributors, our next five largest customers can change, and have historically changed, from year-to-year. The\nnext five largest customers combined represented 19%, 15% and 18% of total revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, property, plant and equipment, net totaled $62.4 million, which included $58.4 million held in the U.S. and $4.0 million held outside the\nU.S. As of December 31, 2019, property, plant and equipment, net totaled $68.1 million, which included $64.2 million held in the U.S. and $3.9 million held\noutside the U.S. Property, plant and equipment, net is reported on a Company-wide, functional basis only.\nNote 17 – Commitments and Contingencies\nSecurities Class Action Lawsuit\nOn October 17, 2019, a purported stockholder class action lawsuit, captioned Burbridge v. ADTRAN, Inc. et al., Docket No. 19-cv-09619, was filed in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, two of its current executive officers and one of its former executive officers. The\ncomplaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages on behalf of purported purchasers of ADTRAN securities\nbetween February 28, 2019 and October 9, 2019. The lawsuit claims that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding, and/or failed to\ndisclose material adverse facts about, the Company’s business, operations and prospects, specifically relating to the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting, excess and obsolete inventory reserves, financial results and demand from certain customers. The lawsuit was transferred to the U.S. District Court for\nthe Northern District of Alabama on January 7, 2020, and co-lead plaintiffs have been appointed to represent the putative class. The plaintiffs filed an amended\ncomplaint on April 30, 2020. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on June 17, 2020. The plaintiffs filed an opposition brief to the\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss on July 17, 2020. The defendants filed a reply to the plaintiffs’ brief on August 17, 2020. The motion to dismiss remains under\nreview by the Court. We deny the allegations in the complaint, as amended, and intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit. At this time, we are unable to\npredict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.\nShareholder Derivative Lawsuit\nOn March 31, 2020, a shareholder derivative suit, captioned Johnson (Derivatively on behalf of ADTRAN) v. T. Stanton, M. Foliano, R. Shannon, and Board of\nDirectors, case no. 5:20-cv-00447, was filed in the U.S. District Court of Northern Alabama against two of the Company’s current executive officers, one of its\nformer executive officers and its Board of Directors. The derivative suit, which is purportedly brought on behalf of ADTRAN, makes similar allegations as the\nstockholder class action lawsuit and accuses the directors and officers of breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with those allegations. On June 7, 2020, the Court\nentered an order staying the derivative litigation pending resolution of the motion to dismiss in the securities class action. The Company and its defendants disagree\nwith the claims made in the complaint, and the defendants intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of or\nestimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.\n91\nOther Legal Matters\nIn addition to the litigation described above, from time to time we are subject to or otherwise involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and legal\nproceedings that arise out of or are incidental to the conduct of our business (collectively, “Legal Matters”), including those relating to employment matters, patent\nrights, regulatory compliance matters, stockholder claims, and contractual and other commercial disputes. Such Legal Matters, even if not meritorious, could result\nin the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Additionally, an unfavorable outcome in any legal matter, including in a patent dispute, could\nrequire the Company to pay damages, entitle claimants to other relief, such as royalties, or could prevent the Company from selling some of its products in certain\njurisdictions. While the Company cannot predict with certainty the results of the Legal Matters in which it is currently involved, the Company does not expect that\nthe ultimate outcome of such Legal Matters will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial\ncondition or cash flows.\nPerformance Bonds\nCertain contracts, customers and/or jurisdictions in which we do business require us to provide various guarantees of performance such as bid bonds, performance\nbonds and customs bonds. As of December 31, 2020, we had commitments related to these bonds totaling $15.2 million which expire at various dates through\nAugust 2024. As of December 31, 2019, we had commitments related to these bonds totaling $9.3 million. Although the triggering events vary from contract to\ncontract, in general we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default under each contract, the probability of which we believe is\nremote.\nIn June 2020, the Company entered into a letter of credit with a bank to guarantee performance obligations under a contract with a certain customer. The\nobligations under this customer contract will be performed over multiple years. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was required to maintain a minimum\ncollateral value of $9.0 million. The letter of credit was secured by a pledge of a portion of the Company’s fixed-income securities, which totaled $11.2 million as\nof December 31, 2020, of which less than $0.1 million is included in restricted cash and $11.2 million is included in long-term investments on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. This pledged collateral value will fluctuate as the Company changes the mix of the pledged collateral between restricted cash and investments. We\nexpect to reach the maximum value of our minimum collateral requirement of $15.0 million in the first quarter of 2021 as the Company reaches certain milestones\nthrough the first quarter of 2021 as outlined in the customer contract. Any shortfalls in the minimum collateral value are required to be restored by the Company\nfrom available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and/or long-term investments. The collateral under the letter of credit will be released when all\nobligations under the customer contract have been met. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all contractual requirements under the\nletter of credit.\nInvestment Commitment\nWe have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $5.0 million in a private equity fund, of which $4.9 million has been applied to these commitments as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\nNote 18 – Current Expected Credit Losses\nUnder ASC 326 – Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, the Company estimates credit losses for the contractual life of assets that are measured at amortized cost\nand are within the scope of this guidance, which includes accounts receivable, net investment in sales-type leases, contract assets under the revenue recognition\nmodel and outstanding notes receivable. Where appropriate, the Company pools assets if similar risk characteristics exist. Additionally, the Company analyzes its\navailable-for-sale debt securities for impairment and records a credit loss allowance as needed.\nAssets Measured at Amortized Cost\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company records accounts receivable in the normal course of business as products are shipped or services are performed and invoiced, but payment has not yet\nbeen remitted by the customer. Accounts receivable balances are considered past due when payment has not been received by the date indicated on the relevant\ninvoice or based on agreed upon terms between the customer and the Company.\n92\nAs of December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020 (the “implementation date”), the Company’s net outstanding accounts receivable balance was $98.8 million and\n$90.5 million, respectively. The Company assessed the need for an allowance for credit losses related to its outstanding accounts receivable as of December 31,\n2020 and January 1, 2020 using the historical loss-rate method as well as assessing asset-specific risks. The Company’s historical losses related to accounts\nreceivable have been immaterial as evidenced by its historical allowance and write-offs due to uncollectability. The assessment of asset-specific risks included the\nevaluation of relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to current conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay, such as\nthe customer’s current financial condition, credit rating by geographic location, as provided by a third party and/or by customer, if needed, and overall macro-\neconomic conditions in which the customer operates. The Company pooled assets by geographic location to determine if an allowance should be applied to its\naccounts receivable balance, assessing the specific country risk rating and overall economics of that particular country. If elevated risk existed, or customer specific\nrisk indicated the accounts receivable balance was at risk, the Company further analyzed the need for an allowance related to specific accounts receivable balances.\nAdditionally, the Company determined that significant changes to customer country risk rating from period-to-period and from the end of the prior year to the end\nof the current quarter would require further review and analysis by the Company.\nNo allowance for credit loss was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 or on January 1, 2020 related to accounts receivable. The Company’s allowance\nfor credit losses related to accounts receivable was less than $0.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, all of which was expensed prior to\nJanuary 1, 2020.\nContract Assets\nThe Company records contract assets when it has recognized revenue but has not yet billed the customer. As of December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020, the\nCompany’s outstanding contract asset balance was $0.1 million and $2.8 million, respectively, which is included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The Company assessed the need for an allowance for credit losses related to its outstanding contract\nassets as of December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020 using the historical loss-rate method as well as asset-specific risks. The Company’s historical losses related to\ncontract assets receivable have been immaterial as evidenced by historical write-offs due to uncollectability. Asset-specific risk included the evaluation of relevant\navailable information, from internal and external sources, relating to current conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay once invoiced, such as the\ncustomer’s financial condition, credit rating by geographic location as provided by a third party and/or by customer, if needed, and overall macro-economic\nconditions in which the customer operates. The Company pooled assets by geographic location to determine if an allowance should be applied to its contract asset\nbalance, assessing the specific country risk rating and overall economics of that particular country. If elevated risk existed, or customer specific risk indicated the\ncontract balance was at risk, the Company further analyzed the need for an allowance related to specific customer balances. Additionally, the Company determined\nthat significant changes to customer country risk rating from period-to-period and from the end of the prior year to the end of the current quarter would be subject\nto further review and analysis by the Company.\nNo allowance for credit loss was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 or on the implementation date related to contract assets.\nNet Investment in Sales-Type Leases\nThe Company is the lessor in sales-type lease arrangements for network equipment. As of December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020, the Company’s outstanding net\ninvestment in sales-type leases was $0.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively, which is included in other receivables and other non-current assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company assessed the need for an allowance for credit losses related to future receivables\nunder its outstanding sales-type leases as of December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020 using the historical loss-rate method as well as asset-specific risks. The\nCompany’s historical losses related to contract assets receivable have been immaterial as evidenced by historical write-offs due to uncollectability. Asset-specific\nrisk included the evaluation of relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to current conditions that may affect a customer’s ability\nto pay once invoiced, such as the customer’s financial condition, credit rating by geographic location as provided by a third party and/or by customer, if needed,\nand overall macro-economic conditions in which the customer operates.\n93\nThe following table presents amortized cost basis in sales-type leases based on payment activity:\nSales-Type Leases Amortized Cost Basis by Origination Year\n(In thousands) 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 Prior Total\nPayment performance\nPerforming $ 55 $ 192 $ 354 $ 128 $ 52 $ — $ 781\nNon-performing — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 55 $ 192 $ 354 $ 128 $ 52 $ — $ 781\nSales-type lease receivables are considered past due when payment has not been received based on agreed upon terms between the customer and the Company. No\nallowance for credit loss was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 or on the implementation date related to sales-type leases.\nSecured Loan Receivable\nThe Company has a secured loan receivable totaling $0.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020, which originated in February 2019, and is included\nin long-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company assessed the need for an allowance for credit loss\nrelated to its secured loan receivable as of December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020 using the historical loss-rate method as well as asset-specific risks. There have\nbeen no historical losses related to this receivable. Asset-specific risks included the evaluation of relevant available information, from internal and external sources,\nrelating to current conditions that may affect the customer’s ability to repay the loan upon maturity, such as the customer’s current financial condition, credit rating\nspecific to the customer as determined by a third party and current overall economic conditions, as well as a Company valuation prepared by a third party which\nwas based on reasonable and supportable forecasts as provided by management. Accrued interest receivable on the secured loan receivable, which is included in\nother receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled less than $0.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020, and was excluded from the\nestimate of credit losses for both periods based on the Company’s accounting policy election.\nNo allowance for credit loss was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 or on the implementation date related to the secured loan receivable.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020 or January 1, 2020.\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities\nAs of December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020, the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities totaled $45.1 million and $37.7 million, respectively. These\nsecurities were analyzed at the individual investment level, by Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures (“CUSIP”), to limit credit losses, if\napplicable, to reflect only the amount by which the fair value of the security was less than its amortized cost. The Company noted that, as of December 31, 2020\nand January 1, 2020, there was no intent to sell any of its available-for-sale debt securities before maturity, and, therefore, the Company assessed the need for an\nallowance for each of its available-for-sale debt securities in which the fair value was less than its amortized cost as of December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020.\nAccrued interest receivable on available-for-sale debt securities, which is included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31,\n2020 and 2019, totaled $0.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020, and was excluded from the estimate of credit losses for both periods based on\nthe Company’s accounting policy election. Income generated from available-for-sale debt securities was recorded as interest and dividend income in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income (Loss).\nThe Company had 42 positions in available-for-sale debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2020. See Note 6 of Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\n94\nFor those available-for-sale debt securities whose fair value was less than its amortized cost basis, the Company analyzed additional criteria such as adverse\nconditions specifically related to the security, an industry or geographic area, failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments,\nif applicable, and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency to determine if a credit loss existed. The Company used information provided by its\ninvestment manager to determine if any scheduled interest or principal payments had not been received and used a third party to determine if any changes to credit\nratings had occurred. The Company noted that all principal and interest payments had been received as scheduled and that there had been no changes in credit\nratings year-over-year or period-over-period that warranted further review.\nNo allowance for credit loss was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 or on the implementation date related to the Company’s available-for-sale debt\nsecurities.\nNote 19 – Earnings (Loss) per Share\nThe calculations of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:\n(In thousands, except for per share amounts) 2020 2019 2018\nNumerator\nNet Income (Loss) $ 2,378 $ (52,982) $ (19,342)\nDenominator\nWeighted average number of shares – basic 47,996 47,836 47,880\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nStock options — — —\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock 292 — —\nWeighted average number of shares – diluted 48,288 47,836 47,880\nEarnings (loss) per share – basic $ 0.05 $ (1.11) $ (0.40)\nEarnings (loss) per share – diluted $ 0.05 $ (1.11) $ (0.40)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 0.1 million and 0.5 million shares, respectively, of unvested or unearned, as applicable, PSUs, RSUs and\nrestricted stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share due to their anti-dilutive effect.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 3.6 million and 5.2 million stock options were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted\nearnings per share due to the fact that their exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares during the quarter, making them anti-\ndilutive under the treasury stock method.\nNote 20 – Restructuring\nDuring the second half of 2019, the Company initiated a restructuring plan to realign its expense structure with the reduction in revenue experienced in recent years\nand overall Company objectives. As part of this restructuring plan, the Company announced plans to reduce its overall operating expenses, both in the U.S. and\ninternationally. Management continued to assess the efficiency of operations during 2020 and, in turn, consolidated locations and personnel, among other things,\nwhere possible.\nIn February 2019, the Company announced the restructuring of a certain portion of its workforce predominantly in Germany, which included the closure of the\nCompany’s office location in Munich, Germany accompanied by relocation or severance benefits for the affected employees. Voluntary early retirement was\noffered to certain other employees and was announced in March 2019 and again in August 2020.\nThe cumulative amount of restructuring expenses incurred as of December 31, 2020 for the restructuring plans announced in the second half of 2019 and\ncontinuing in 2020 was $12.2 million.\nIn January 2018, the Company announced an early retirement incentive program for employees that met certain defined requirements. The cumulative amount\nincurred during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to this restructuring program was $7.3 million. We did not incur any additional expenses related to this\nrestructuring program during the year ended December 31, 2019 or 2020.\n95\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending restructuring liability, which is included in accrued wages and benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, is as follows:\n(In thousands) 2020 2019\nBalance at beginning of period $ 1,568 $ 185\nPlus: Amounts charged to cost and expense 6,229 6,014\nLess: Amounts paid (3,611) (4,631)\nBalance at end of period $ 4,186 $ 1,568\nRestructuring expenses included in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) are for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n(In thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nCost of sales $ 455 $ 785 $ 2,775\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 1,832 2,360 2,655\nResearch and development expenses 3,942 2,869 1,831\nTotal restructuring expenses $ 6,229 $ 6,014 $ 7,261\nThe following table represents the components of restructuring expense by geographic area for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n(In thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nUnited States $ 2,234 $ 3,336 $ 7,120\nInternational 3,995 2,678 141\nTotal restructuring expenses $ 6,229 $ 6,014 $ 7,261\nNote 21 – Summarized Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)\nThe following table presents unaudited quarterly operating results for each of the last eight fiscal quarters.

The payment date will be March 4, 2021 in the aggregate amount of\napproximately $4.4 million.\nAs part of our required pledged collateral related to a letter for credit agreement entered into with a bank to guarantee performance obligations under a contract\nwith a certain customer, the Company increased its pledged collateral to $15.0 million as of February 2021. We do not anticipate any additional increases in the\ncollateral value at this time as we have reached the maximum amount of the letter of credit required under our contract with the customer. The collateral under the\nletter of credit will be released when all obligations under the customer contract have been met.\n97\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that\nwe file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our\nChief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because of the inherent limitations\nto the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that all\ncontrol issues, if any, with a company have been prevented or detected on a timely basis. Even disclosure controls and procedures determined to be effective can\nonly provide reasonable assurance that their objectives are achieved.\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out by management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial\nOfficer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based\non that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the\nreasonable assurance level.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to include in our Annual Report on Form 10-K a report on management’s assessment of the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a report from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting. Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting is included below, and the related report from our\nindependent registered public accounting firm is located in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, ADTRAN, Inc. began implementing a new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) software solution. As of December 31, 2020,\nthe Company was still reliant on its existing procedures and controls. The Company continues to work toward implementation of the new ERP system and expects\nto complete that process during 2021. There were no other changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent\nfiscal quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement of ADTRAN, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and\n15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. ADTRAN’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. ADTRAN’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n• pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of ADTRAN;\n• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of ADTRAN are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management\nand directors of ADTRAN; and\n• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of ADTRAN’s assets that could\nhave a material effect on the financial statements.\n98\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of ADTRAN’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management\nused the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).\nBased on our assessment and those criteria, management has concluded that ADTRAN maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Item 8.\nITEM 9B.

(“ADTRAN”, the “Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”). ADTRAN and its representatives may from time to time make\nwritten or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in this report, our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and other communications with our stockholders. Any statement that does not directly relate to a\nhistorical or current fact is a forward-looking statement. Generally, the words, “believe”, “expect”, “intend”, “estimate”, “anticipate”, “will”, “may”, “could” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. We caution you that any forward-looking\nstatements made by us or on our behalf are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could affect the accuracy of such statements. For a detailed description of the risk factors associated with our business, see Part I, Item 1A of this report. We caution investors\nthat other factors may prove to be important in the future in affecting our operating results. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of these factors, nor can we assess the impact each factor, or a combination of factors, may\nhave on our business. You are further cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements because they speak only of our views as of the date that the statements were made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-\nlooking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\n2\nGLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMS\nBelow are certain acronyms, concepts and defined terms commonly used in our industry and in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, along with their meanings:\nAcronym/Concept/\nDefined Term Meaning\n10G EPON 10-Gigabit EPON (as defined below)\n10G PON 10-Gigabit PON (as defined below)\nADSL Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line\nAPAC Asia Pacific\nATIS Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions;

Our products and services are utilized by a diverse global customer base of network operators that range from those having national or regional\nreach, operating as telephone or cable television network operators, to alternative network providers such as municipalities or utilities, as well as managed service providers who serve small- and medium-sized businesses and distributed enterprises.\nWe operate in two business segments: (1) Network Solutions, which includes hardware and software products, and (2) Services & Support, which includes a portfolio of services that complement our product portfolio. These two segments span across our three\nrevenue categories: (1) Access & Aggregation, (2) Subscriber Solutions & Experience and (3) Traditional & Other Products. A revenue category is distinguished by the types of products and services offered. Access & Aggregation is focused on solutions that are\nused by service providers to connect their network infrastructure to subscribers; Subscriber Solutions & Experience is concentrated on subscriber solutions that terminate broadband access in the home and/or business; and Traditional & Other Products encompasses\nprior-generation technologies, products and services and certain other offerings. See below for a detailed discussion of these reportable segments and revenue categories.\nOur innovative solutions and services enable voice, data and video communications across a variety of network infrastructures. They are currently in use by millions of end users worldwide, making us a top supplier of broadband access solutions in both the North\nAmerican and the EMEA regions.\nWe are focused on being a top supplier of communications infrastructure spanning from the cloud edge (data center) to the subscriber edge (subscriber device) serving both the residential internet and enterprise cloud services markets. We offer a broad portfolio of\nflexible network infrastructure solutions, customer premises equipment software, management and orchestration solutions and global services and support including network implementation, system integration and network maintenance and management services\nthat enable service providers to meet their service demands now and in the future. These products and services enable service providers to transition to a common network supporting the simplified delivery of high-capacity services, regardless of subscriber density,\nnetwork topology and infrastructure diversity.\nADTRAN was incorporated in Delaware in November 1985 and began operations in January 1986.

Our telephone number at that location is (256) 963-8000. Our website is www.adtran.com. No information contained on our website is intended to be included as part of, or incorporated\nby reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n6\nIndustry Overview\nCommunications solution providers are investing in their networks for growth in subscriber acquisition and retention, while streamlining their operations to reduce costs and complexity. Drivers for this network investment include the evolution of government\nfunding programs, regulatory broadband policies, competition, increasing subscriber demand for broadband and merger obligations.\nSubscriber demand for higher bandwidth continues to increase due to increasing numbers of connected devices, OTT video, the prevalence of IoT and cloud services and the increasing use of internet applications. Today, practically everything is or can be\n“connected.” Performance is directly related to bandwidth availability. As the demand for high-definition video streaming services, low-latency cloud gaming services and smart home video surveillance applications continues to increase, so too does the need for\nhigher bandwidth to the home and business. ADTRAN serves as a trusted partner to our customers. Working side-by-side with our customers, we enable them to glean the maximum performance from their network, providing a flexible path for their networks to\nevolve cost effectively, and to further monetize their investments.\nOur Strategy\nOur strategy is to provide innovative and cost-effective solutions for SPs that enable them to address their increasing broadband demands. Our solutions focus on technology transformations that are happening in broadband network infrastructure, home and business\nCPE and software solutions, and services needed to help our customers address increasing complexity while scaling to meet increasing consumer demands. We aspire to be one of the top communication technology players in the world and plan to achieve this goal\nthrough innovation in network, home and business technology, leadership in open source solutions, disruptive and unique products timed to market use, diversifying our customer base, delivering end to end product and service solutions, evolving our organization to\nbe more flexible and agile, effective cost management, expanding our global scale and growing our share of home and business devices during Wi-Fi and cloud service technology transformations.\nReportable Segments\nOur business operates under two reportable segments: (1) Network Solutions and (2) Services & Support. We review our financial performance, specifically revenue and gross profit, based on these two segments.\nNetwork Solutions Segment\nOur Network Solutions segment includes hardware and software products that support fiber optic-, copper- and coaxial-based infrastructures as well as a growing number of fixed wireless solutions. We offer traditional chassis-based network solutions, such as the\nADTRAN Total Access 5000 and ADTRAN hiX 5600. We are also accelerating the industry’s transition to open, programmable and scalable SD-Access networks by providing CSPs with open and disaggregated network elements leveraging open-source software\nand reference designs that we have helped drive over the last several years.\nOur SD-Access architecture consists of the ADTRAN MosaicTM Cloud Platform and the ADTRAN SDX Series of programmable network elements. Together, these solutions provide network operators with a highly agile and scalable networking architecture.\nAlso included in this segment are our subscriber solutions that terminate fiber optic, copper and coaxial cable access networks in the home and/or business and that extend access through our delivery of whole-home Wi-Fi solutions. These solutions also include\nconnected home and enterprise software platforms that improve in-home visibility while leveraging subscriber insight and network analytics. These solutions are designed to elevate subscriber experience and empower customer care personnel, all leading to\nimproving overall customer satisfaction and creating added revenue streams for the network operator.\nServices & Support Segment\nTo complement our Network Solutions product portfolio and to enable our service provider customers to accelerate time to market, reduce costs and improve customer satisfaction, we offer a complete portfolio of services. These services include consulting,\nsolutions integration, network implementation, maintenance and professional and managed services as described below.\nOur consulting services allow service providers to leverage ADTRAN’s network engineering expertise to build and deploy best-of-breed networks. Our NetAssure Program offers a variety of ways to leverage ADTRAN networking expertise applied to\nnetworks. One aspect of this program, resident engineering services, provides an on-site ADTRAN engineer, whose goal is to drive customer success by serving as the single point of contact for product knowledge, on-going network troubleshooting and technical\nexpertise, enabling network operators to gain a strategic competitive advantage from our products.\n7\nOur solution integration services enable network operators to design and build the open distributed access networks of the future. Our offerings in this area include the SD-Access Accelerator, which enables service providers to explore the benefits of SD-Access\nwithout impacting their network. The SD-Access Accelerator includes system integration services with a compact pod that includes all of the equipment needed to evaluate a SEBA solution. This fully functional SD-Access system enables network operators to cost-\neffectively perform functional testing, develop transition plans, access a variety of applications and environments and evaluate fully functional disaggregated solutions.\nOur network implementation services enable network operators to increase service delivery velocity and improve their return on investment while increasing customer satisfaction. ADTRAN offers a full turn-key suite of services to help network operators accelerate\nnetwork deployment. We partner with our customers to tailor a program to each specific service-delivery need.\nOur maintenance services are specifically designed to protect customers' networks from unnecessary downtime through SLA services, such as managed spares and remote or on-site technical support beyond our standard warranty coverage. Network Care Plans offer\nprioritized remote or on-site support, after-hours emergency support, advanced replacement, early access to software patches and upgrades, as well as bundled training and network management vouchers. Element management is an option and can be included as part\nof the support plan.\nADTRAN’s ProServices include a full spectrum of professional services for end-user customers or network operators reselling to end-user customers. This is a comprehensive and flexible service program designed to offer complete networking lifecycle support. The\nProServices portfolio consists of three distinct service offerings: ProStart (end-user network implementation), ProCare (maintenance and support), and ProCloud (cloud-based Wi-Fi services). Our ProCare program, which is available to all customers, is geared\ntowards equipment located at the customer premises. It offers advanced hardware replacement and priority access to our product support engineers.\nIn addition to these professional services, we offer managed services to help customers manage their network components on a day-to- day basis. Our EliteCloud Plus service provides managed Wi-Fi with configuration changes, outage alerts, and on-site support\nwith SLAs. For our Tier-3 service providers, we offer cloud-based device management services for day-to-day control of residential gateways and subscriber home analytics. In December 2019, we released a Network Performance Testing service to assist any\nnetwork operator with FCC-mandated testing and reporting in support of the Connect America programs.\nRevenue Categories\nIn addition to classifying our operations into two reportable segments, we report revenue across three categories of products and services: (1) Access & Aggregation, (2) Subscriber Solutions & Experience (formerly Customer Devices) and (3) Traditional & Other\nProducts.\nOur Access & Aggregation solutions are used by communications service providers to connect their network infrastructure to subscribers. This revenue category includes hardware- and software-based products and services that aggregate and/or originate access\ntechnologies. ADTRAN solutions within this category include a wide array of modular or fixed platforms designed to deliver the best technology and economy based on subscriber density and environmental conditions.\nThe Access & Aggregation category includes the following product and service families:\n•Total Access 5000 Series FTTP and FTTN MSANs •SDX Series of SDN-controlled programmable network elements that form the hardware components within SD-Access\narchitectures\n•hiX 5600 Series fiber aggregation and FTTN MSANs •ADTRAN ONE branded packet optical transport solutions used for broadband and Ethernet services aggregation and/or metro\ntransport.\n•FTTdp Gfast DPUs •IP-based DSLAMs\n•Mosaic-branded network management and subscriber services control and orchestration software within SD-Access •Cabinet and OSP enclosures and services\narchitectures\n•Planning, engineering, program management, maintenance, installation and commissioning services to implement customer •SFP, SFP+, XFP, QSFP transceivers, cables and other miscellaneous materials\nnetwork solutions\n•All technology varieties of PON OLTs used in conjunction with the ADTRAN family of ONTs or select third-party ONTs. •Other products and services that are generally applicable to Access & Aggregation\n8\nOur Subscriber Solutions & Experience portfolio is used by service providers to terminate their access services infrastructure at the customer premises while providing an immersive and interactive experience for the subscriber. These solutions include copper and\nfiber WAN termination, LAN switching, Wi-Fi access and cloud software services for both residential and business markets.\nIn alignment with our increased focus on enhancing the customer experience for both business and consumer broadband customers as well as the addition of SmartRG, Inc. (“SmartRG”) at the end of 2018, what was previously known as our Customer Devices\ncategory became our Subscriber Solutions & Experience category in 2019, as this more accurately represents this revenue category and our vision moving forward.\nThe Subscriber Solutions & Experience category includes the following products, software and services:\n•Broadband customer premises solutions, including GPON, XGS-PON, NG-PON2, EPON and 10G EPON and point-to-point •SmartRG Wi-Fi-enabled residential gateway products and accessories across xDSL, Ethernet, DOCSIS, LTE, and fiber\nEthernet ONTs technologies\n•NetVanta Ethernet switches for reliable multi-gigabit local area networking •Intellifi (access points working together to form one unified, whole-home Wi-Fi network)\n•SmartOS-branded embedded software licensing for residential gateway and Wi-Fi devices •Bluesocket access points and vWLANs for business-class Wi-Fi and management\n•Mosaic cloud-based SaaS management platform for service providers to manage residential and enterprise networks •ProServices pre-sale and post-sale technical support\n•RFoG micro-nodes •Planning, engineering, program management, maintenance, installation and commissioning services to implement customer\ndevices solutions into consumer, small business and enterprise locations\n•Mosaic cloud-based SaaS management platform for subscriber and network analytics collection used to enhance network •NetVanta Ethernet switches for reliable multi-gigabit local area networking\noperations and customer experience\n•Other products, software and services applicable to Subscriber Solutions & Experience\nOur Traditional & Other Products category generally includes a mix of prior-generation technologies’ products and services, as well as other products and services that do not fit within the other revenue categories.\nThe Traditional & Other Products category includes products and services such as:\n•TDM and ATM-based aggregation systems and customer devices\n•HDSL, ADSL and other mature technologies used to deliver business and residential services over service provider access and customer networks\n•Other products and services outside the Access & Aggregation and Subscriber Solutions & Experience categories\n9\nCustomers\nWe have a diverse global customer base that includes Tier-1, -2 and -3 service providers, alternative service providers, such as utilities, municipalities and fiber overbuilders, cable/MSOs, SMBs and distributed enterprises. Many network operators require product\napproval before the purchase or installation of a product. The nature of our business involves a dynamic process of submitting new and succeeding generations of products for approval prior to orders being placed.\nThree customers, CenturyLink, Inc., Deutsche Telekom, AG and Telmex, individually comprised more than 10% of our revenue in 2019. Additionally, our revenues in Germany and Mexico comprised more than 10% of our revenue in 2019. The revenues from these\ncustomers are reported in both our Network Solutions and Services & Support segments.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with customers, service providers and approval processes, see “Risk Factors – The lengthy sales and approval process required by major and other service providers for new products could result in fluctuations in our revenue,”\n“Risk Factors – We depend heavily on sales to certain customers; the loss of any of these customers would significantly reduce our revenues and net income,” and “Risk Factors – Consolidation and deterioration in the CLEC market could result in a significant\ndecrease in our revenue,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nDistribution, Sales and Marketing\nWe sell our products through our direct sales organization and our distribution network. Our direct sales organization supports major accounts and has offices in many domestic and international locations. Sales to most competitive service providers and independent\ntelephone companies are fulfilled through a combination of direct sales and distributors. Our services offerings can be purchased directly from us, or through one of our service providers, channel partners or distribution partners.\nBefore placing an order, service providers typically require lengthy product qualification and standardization processes that can extend for several months or even years. Once approved, product orders are typically placed under single or multi-year supply\nagreements that are generally not subject to minimum volume commitments. Service providers generally prefer having two or more suppliers for most products. Therefore, individual orders are usually subject to competition based on some combination of total\nvalue, service, price, delivery and other terms.\nOrders for end-user products are fulfilled through a combination of direct sales and distributors. This is supported by a direct sales organization for major accounts and a channel-based sales organization to facilitate sales to our partners. MSPs, VARs and SIs may be\naffiliated with the company as channel partners, or they may purchase from a distributor in an unaffiliated fashion. Affiliated partners participate with us at various program levels, based on sales volume and other factors, to receive benefits such as product\ndiscounts, market development funds, technical support and training. We maintain offices worldwide to support direct sales, distributors, MSPs, VARs and SIs.\nOutside of the U.S., most service provider products are sold through our direct sales organization and end-user products are sold direct or through distribution arrangements customized for each region. Each region is supported by a field office that offers sales and\nsupport functions, and in some cases, warehousing and manufacturing support. Our field sales organizations, distributors and service provider customers receive support from regional-based marketing, sales and customer support groups.\nOur marketing organization promotes all brands associated with ADTRAN to key stakeholders, including customers, partners and prospects throughout the world. Marketing is complemented by product marketing and management teams that work with our\nengineering teams to develop and promote new products and services as well as product enhancements.\nResearch and Development\nRapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements and continuing developments in communications service offerings characterize the markets for our products. Our on-going ability to adapt to these changes and to develop\nnew and enhanced products that meet or anticipate market demand is a significant factor influencing our competitive position and our ability to grow.\nOur product development activities are an important part of our strategy. We plan to maintain our emphasis on product development to enable us to respond to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. Our research and development and\nengineering functions are global. We maintain research and development functions at our Huntsville, Alabama headquarters and in Germany, India and other locations worldwide. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, research and\ndevelopment expenditures totaled $126.2 million, $124.5 million and $130.7 million, respectively.\n10\nWhile we develop most of our products internally, in some cases, we license intellectual property, use ODM partners or acquire technologies. Internal development on advanced technology products gives us more control over design and manufacturing issues, while\nfor traditional designs, ODM and/or licensed intellectual property provides us with the ability to leverage the economies of scale of our technology partners. This balanced approach ensures we provide best-in-class products for our customers.\nAs we continue to create more software-based intellectual property, such as our SDN/NFV portfolio, our use of lean agile practices in research and development ensures we remain responsive and customer-focused. This enables us to deliver products faster and more\neconomically to our customers and the market on a continuous basis.\nOur ability to continually reduce product costs, while focusing on delivery and quality, are important parts of our overall business strategy. Our product development efforts are often centered on entering a market with improved technology, allowing us to offer\nproducts at competitive prices. We then compete for market share. We continually re-engineer successive generations of existing products to improve our product performance, costs and value.\nDevelopment activities focus on solutions that support both existing and emerging communications industry technologies in segments that we consider viable revenue opportunities. We are actively engaged in developing and refining technologies to support data,\nvoice and video transport primarily over IP/Ethernet network architectures. This includes Ethernet aggregation, fiber-optic transport and access, DSL, access routing, Ethernet switching, wireless LANs, integrated access, converged services, VoIP, network\nmanagement and professional services.\nA centralized research function supports product development efforts throughout the company. This group guides our various product design and engineering teams in digital signal processing technologies, computer simulation and modeling, CAD/CAM toolsets,\ncustom semiconductor design, optical transceiver design, industry standards, technological forecasting, product development methods and emerging networks standards.\nMany communication requirements, processes and technologies are governed by SDOs. These SDOs consist of representatives from various manufacturers, service providers and testing laboratories who work to establish specifications and compliance guidelines for\nemerging communications technologies. We are an active participant in several SDOs and have assisted with the development of worldwide standards in many technologies.\nOur SDO activities are primarily in the area of broadband access. This includes involvement with the ITU-T, ATIS, ETSI and the BBF. We are involved in the evolution of optical access technologies, participating in activities in the ITU-T, FSAN and BBF on next-\ngeneration PON. We are also involved in standards development efforts related to maximizing the bandwidth potential of the copper pair to enable new applications in the ITU-T. We continue to be involved with the industry-wide interoperability, performance-\ntesting and system-level projects related to those standards in the BBF. We are also members of MEF, OCP, WFA, TIA, CableLabs, Quest Forum and TIP.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with our research and development activities, see “Risk Factors – We must continue to update and improve our products and develop new products in order to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications\ntechnology” and “Risk Factors – We engage in research and development activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application of developed technologies, and as a consequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger\ncompanies with substantially greater research and development effort and which may focus on more leading edge development,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nManufacturing and Operations\nThe principal steps in our manufacturing process include the purchase and management of materials, assembly, testing, final inspection, packing and shipping. We purchase parts and components for the assembly of some products from a large number of suppliers\nthrough a worldwide sourcing program. Additionally, we manage a process that identifies the components that are best purchased directly by contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of our products to achieve manufacturing efficiency, quality and cost\nobjectives. Certain key components used in our products are currently available from a single source, and other key components are available from only a limited number of sources. In the past, we have experienced delays in the receipt of certain key components,\nwhich has resulted in delays in related product deliveries. We attempt to manage these risks through developing alternative sources, by staging inventories at strategic locations, through engineering efforts designed to prevent the necessity of certain components and\nby maintaining close contact and building long-term relationships with our suppliers.\n11\nWe rely on subcontractors for assembly and testing of certain printed circuit board assemblies, sub-assemblies, chassis, enclosures and equipment shelves, and to purchase some of the raw materials used in such assemblies. We typically manufacture our lower-\nvolume, higher-mix products and build and test product prototypes and many of our initial production units at our manufacturing site in Huntsville, Alabama. We later transfer the production of higher-volume, lower-mix assemblies to our subcontractors.\nSubcontract assembly operations can lengthen fulfillment cycle times, but we believe we can respond more rapidly to uncertainties in incoming order rates by selecting assembly subcontractors that have significant reserve capacity and flexibility. Our subcontractors\nhave proven to be flexible and able to meet our quality requirements. We conduct the majority of transactions with our foreign suppliers in U.S. dollars.\nWe ship the majority of products to our U.S. customers from our facilities in Huntsville, Alabama, although we also fulfill customer orders from other locations near our customers' sites, when possible. The majority of our products shipped to EMEA customers\ncome from locations in that region. We also ship directly from subcontractors to a number of customers in the U.S. and international locations. Most of our facilities are certified pursuant to the most current releases of ISO 9001, TL 9000, ISO 14001 and ISO 27001.\nOur Huntsville, Alabama facilities and many of our key suppliers are C-TPAT certified. Our products are also certified to certain other customer, industry and privacy standards, including those relating to emission of electromagnetic energy and safety specifications\nas well as GDPR.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with manufacturing activities, see “Risk Factors – Our strategy of outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing requirements to subcontractors located in various international regions may result in us not meeting our cost, quality\nor performance standards” and “Risk Factors – Our dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and key components may prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on customer\nrelations and operating results,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nCompetition\nWe compete in markets for networking and communications services and solutions for service providers, businesses, government agencies and other organizations worldwide. Our products and services provide solutions supporting voice, data and video\ncommunications across fiber-, copper-, coaxial- and wireless-based infrastructure, as well as across wide area networks, local area networks and the internet.\nThe markets for our products are intensely competitive and numerous competitors exist in each of our product segments. These competitive conditions have resulted in competitor consolidations, bankruptcies and liquidations. Consumer acceptance of alternative\ncommunications technologies such as coaxial cable through cable/MSOs and cellular-based wireless services that compete with our products has grown in recent years. Our development of 10G EPON and RFoG products better positions us to compete in the MSO\nmarket. Competition might further increase if new technologies emerge, new companies enter the market or existing competitors expand their product lines.\nWe compete with a number of companies in the markets we serve. In our Access & Aggregation category, key competitors include Calix, Casa Systems, Ciena, CommScope, DASAN Zhone Solutions, Huawei, Nokia and ZTE. In the Subscriber Solutions &\nExperience category, our primary competitors include Calix, Cisco, CommScope, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Ribbon Communications, Technicolor and Ubiquiti Networks. In addition to these OEM vendors, we face increasing competition from various ODM\nvendors who are being engaged directly by some of our service provider customers. Some of these companies compete in a single product segment, while others compete across multiple product lines. Competitors of our Services & Support business include Calix,\nEricsson, Fujitsu Network Communications and Nokia.\nFor further discussion of risks associated with our competition, see “Risk Factors – We must continue to update and improve our products and develop new products in order to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology” and\n“Risk Factors – We compete in markets that have become increasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and market share,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nSeasonality\nWe have experienced quarterly fluctuations in customer activity due to seasonal considerations. These seasonal effects may continue to vary and do not always correlate to our operating results. Accordingly, they should not be considered a reliable indicator of our\nfuture revenue or operating results.\n12\nForeign Currency\nTransactions with customers that are denominated in foreign currencies are recorded using the appropriate exchange rates from throughout the year. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the balance sheet dates using the closing\nrates of exchange between those foreign currencies and the functional currency with any transaction gains or losses reported in other income (expense). Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements are with our German subsidiary, whose\nfunctional currency is the Euro and our Australian subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Australian dollar. Adjustments resulting from translating financial statements of international subsidiaries are recorded as a component of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss).\nBacklog and Inventory\nA substantial portion of our shipments in any fiscal period relates to orders received and shipped within that fiscal period for customers under agreements containing nonbinding purchase commitments. Further, a significant percentage of orders require delivery\nwithin a few days. These factors normally result in very little order backlog or order flow visibility. Additionally, backlog levels may vary because of seasonal trends, the timing of customer projects and other factors that affect customer order lead times. We believe\nthat because we fill a substantial portion of customer orders within the fiscal quarter of receipt, backlog is not a meaningful indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period.\nTo meet this type of demand, we have implemented supply chain management systems to manage the production process. We maintain substantial inventories of raw materials for long lead time components to support this demand and avoid expedite fees. We also\nmaintain substantial finished goods inventories. Our practice of maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products and services increases the amount of inventory that may be considered excess and/or obsolete. This excess and obsolete\ninventory may require us to write down the value of the inventory, which may have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nFor further discussion of risks associated with managing our inventory, see “Risk Factors – Managing our inventory is complex and may include write-downs of excess or obsolete inventory,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur products must comply with various regulations and standards established by communications authorities in various countries, as well as those of certain international bodies. For instance, environmental legislation within the EU may increase our cost of doing\nbusiness as we amend our products to comply with these requirements. The EU issued the RoHS directive, the WEEE directive and the REACH regulation. We continue to implement measures to comply with these directives and other similar directives and\nregulations from additional countries.\nWe strive to deliver innovative network access solutions that lower the total cost and reduce the time of deploying services, increase the level of performance achievable with established infrastructures, reduce operating and capital expenses for our customers,\nincrease network bandwidth and functionality, and extend network reach. Our development process is conducted in accordance with ISO 9001, TL 9000, ISO 14001, and ISO 27001, all of which are international standards for quality and environmental management\nsystems. Our corporate practices also conform to GDPR requirements, which protect digital data for all EU citizens, and to other applicable data protection laws. Additionally, ADTRAN holds a Privacy Shield certification providing adequate protection for the\ntransfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S.\nFor further discussion of risks associated with government regulation, see “Risk Factors – Our products may not continue to comply with evolving regulations governing their sale, which may harm our business,” and “Risk Factors – Regulatory and potential\nphysical impacts of climate change and other natural events may affect our customers and our production operations, resulting in adverse effects on our operating results.” and “Risk Factors – We are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and\nregulations regarding privacy, data protection and other matters. Violations of these laws and regulations may harm our business.” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\n13\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had 1,790 full-time employees in the U.S. and our international subsidiaries located in North America, Latin America, EMEA and the APAC regions. Approximately 76% of employees of ADTRAN GmbH are subject to collective\nbargaining agreements of either the Association of Metal and Electrical Industry in Berlin and Brandenburg e.V. or NORDMETALL Association of Metal and Electrical Industry e.V. Additionally, a small number of our ADTRAN GmbH employees are represented\nby other collective bargaining agreements. Although these collective bargaining agreements expire during the next twelve months, we have never experienced a work stoppage and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good.\nWe also utilize contractors and temporary employees domestically and internationally in various manufacturing, engineering, sales, and general and administrative capacities, as needed.\nIntellectual Property\nThe ADTRAN corporate logo is a registered trademark of ADTRAN, as is the name “ADTRAN” and the “SmartRG” trademark. We also claim rights to a number of unregistered trademarks.\nWe own over 600 patents worldwide related to our products and over 90 additional pending patent applications. Our patents expire at various dates between 2020 and 2038. We continue to seek additional patents from time-to-time related to our research and\ndevelopment activities. We do not derive any material amount of revenue from the licensing of our patents.\nWe protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights in accordance with good legal and business practices. We believe, however, that our competitive success will not depend on the ownership of intellectual property, but instead will depend primarily on the\ninnovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our personnel.\nThe communications industry is characterized by the existence of an ever-increasing volume of patent litigation and licensing activities. We have received, and may continue to receive, notices of claims alleging that we are infringing upon patents or other\nintellectual property. We cannot predict whether we will prevail in any claims or litigation over alleged infringements, or whether we will be able to license any valid and infringed patents, or other intellectual property, on commercially reasonable terms. It is\npossible that such litigation may result in significant legal costs and judgments and that intellectual property infringement claims, or related litigation against or by us could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nFor a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property and proprietary rights, see “Risk Factors – Our failure to maintain rights to intellectual property used in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality, and commercial value of\nour products.” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\n14\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nSet forth below, in accordance with General Instruction G(3) of Form 10-K and the Instruction to Item 401 of Regulation S-K, is certain information regarding the executive officers of ADTRAN.

RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves substantial risks. Any of the risk factors described below or elsewhere in this report could significantly and adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The risks described below are not the only ones\nfacing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect us.\nOur operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price.\nOur operating results have been, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n• fluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially with respect to significant network expansion projects undertaken by service providers;\n• continued growth of communications network traffic and the adoption of communication services and applications by enterprise and consumer end users;\n• changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers’ spending plans and associated revenue;\n• reductions in demand for our traditional products as new technologies gain acceptance;\n• our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and related purchase commitments;\n• price and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change rapidly due to technological innovation;\n• the overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers;\n• our dependence on sales of our products by channel partners, the timing of their replenishment orders, the potential for conflicts and competition involving our channel partners and large end-user customers and the potential for consolidation\namong our channel partners;\n• variations in sales channels, product cost or mix of products and services sold;\n• delays in receiving acceptance from certain customers as defined under contract, for shipments or services performed near the end of a reporting period;\n• our ability to maintain high levels of product support and professional services;\n• manufacturing and customer order lead times, and potential restrictions in the supply of key components;\n• fluctuations in our gross margin and the factors that contribute to this (as described below);\n• our ability to achieve cost reductions;\n• the ability of our customers, channel partners and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures;\n• our ability to execute on our strategy and operating plans;\n• benefits anticipated from our investments in engineering, sales and marketing activities;\n• the effects of climate change and other natural events;\n• the effect of political or economic conditions, including the effect of tariffs or so-called “trade wars” on us and our supply chain, acts of war, terrorist attacks or other unrest in certain international markets; and\n• changes in tax laws and regulations or accounting pronouncements.\nAs a result, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the above-mentioned factors, or other factors discussed elsewhere in this report, could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows that could adversely affect our stock price.\n17\nOur revenue for a particular period can be difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.\nAs a result of the many factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict and will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our typical pattern of customer orders requests product delivery within a short period following receipt of an\norder. Consequently, we do not typically carry a significant order backlog and are dependent upon obtaining orders and completing delivery in accordance with shipping terms that are predominantly within each quarter to achieve our targeted revenues. Our net sales\nmay grow at a slower rate than in previous quarters or may decline. Our deployment/installation cycle can vary depending on the customer’s schedule, site readiness, network size and complexity and other factors, which can cause our revenue to fluctuate from\nperiod to period. Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be affected if the variable sales patterns seen in prior quarters recur in future quarters. We have experienced periods of time during which manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading to\nvariable shipping patterns. In addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in quarters in which we and our subcontractors are operating at higher levels of capacity, it\nis possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected, and we may not be able to remediate the conditions within the same quarter.\nIn the past, under certain market conditions, long manufacturing lead times have caused our customers to place the same order multiple times. When this multiple ordering occurs, along with other factors, it may cause difficulty in predicting our sales and, as a result,\ncould impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively.\nWe plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations\nbecause we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes.\nGeneral economic conditions may reduce our revenues and harm our operating results.\nEconomic conditions may contribute to a slowdown in communications industry spending, including in the specific market segments in which we operate. The potential reoccurrence of these trends and their duration and depth are difficult to predict. Capital\nspending for network infrastructure projects of our largest customers could be delayed or canceled in response to reduced consumer spending, tight capital markets or declining liquidity trends. Sustained trends of this nature could have a material, adverse effect on\nour revenues, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur exposure to the credit risks of our customers and distributors may make it difficult to collect accounts receivable and could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nMost of our sales are made on an open credit basis, generally with payment terms of 30 days in the U.S. and typically longer in many geographic markets outside the U.S. As our international sales grow, our total accounts receivable balance will likely increase. Our\ndays sales outstanding (“DSO”) could also increase as a result of a greater mix of international sales. Additionally, international laws may not provide the same degree of protection against defaults on accounts receivable as provided under U.S. laws governing\ndomestic transactions; therefore, as our international business grows, we may be subject to higher bad debt expense compared to historical trends. Overall, we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit\nsuch open credit to amounts that we believe customers can pay, and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts. In the course of our sales to customers, we may encounter difficulty collecting accounts receivable and could be\nexposed to risks associated with uncollectible accounts receivable due to various reasons, including potential declining operating cash flows or bankruptcy filings of our customers. We may be exposed to similar credit risks relating to collections from distributors of\nour products, and we apply similar processes to monitor and reserve for any exposures. Turmoil in the financial markets could impact certain of our customers’ ability to maintain adequate credit facilities with financial institutions, thereby potentially impacting their\nability to pay their debts. While we attempt to monitor these situations carefully and attempt to take appropriate measures to collect accounts receivable balances, there are no assurances we can avoid accounts receivable write-downs or write-offs of doubtful\naccounts as a result of declining financial conditions for our customers, including bankruptcy. Such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur and could potentially have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n18\nWe expect gross margins to vary over time, and our levels of product and services gross margins may not be sustainable.\nOur level of gross margins may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected by numerous factors, including:\n• changes in customer, geographic or product or services mix, including software and the mix of configurations and professional services revenue within each product group;\n• mix of domestic versus foreign sales;\n• introduction of new products by competitors, including products with price-performance advantages;\n• our ability to reduce product cost;\n• increases in labor or material cost, including increases in material costs resulting from tariffs;\n• foreign currency exchange rate movements;\n• expediting costs incurred to meet customer delivery requirements;\n• excess inventory and inventory holding charges;\n• excess and obsolescence charges;\n• changes in shipment volume;\n• our ability to absorb fixed manufacturing costs during short-term fluctuations in customer demand;\n• loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand;\n• lower than expected benefits from value engineering;\n• increased price competition, including competitors from Asia, specifically China;\n• changes in distribution channels;\n• increased warranty cost;\n• liquidated damages costs relating to customer contractual terms; and\n• our ability to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations relating to our accounts receivable and accounts payable.\nWe must continue to update and improve our products and develop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and continuing improvements in the communications service offerings of service providers. If technologies or standards applicable to our products, or\nservice provider offerings based on our products, become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our existing products or products under development may become obsolete or unmarketable. Moreover, the introduction of products embodying\nnew technologies, the emergence of new industry standards, or changes in service provider offerings could adversely affect our ability to sell our products. For instance, we offer a large number of products that apply primarily to the delivery of high-speed digital\ncommunications over the local loop utilizing copper wire. We compete favorably with our competitors by developing a high-performance line of these products. We market products that apply to fiber optic transport in the local loop. We expect, however, that use of\ncoaxial cable and fixed and mobile wireless access in place of local loop access will increase. Also, MSOs are increasing their presence in the local loop. To meet the requirements of these new delivery systems and to maintain our market position, we expect to\ncontinue to develop new products and/or modify existing products. We expect that the addition of fiber-based products focused on the cable MSO operators, using EPON and RFoG technologies, and fixed wireless access solutions will better position us to benefit\nfrom spending in these adjacent markets.\n19\nOur sales and profitability in the past have, to a significant extent, resulted from our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards and service provider offerings, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products. Our continued ability to\nadapt will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and our prospects for growth. We cannot assure that we will be able to respond effectively to changes in technology, industry standards, service provider offerings or new product\nannouncements by our competitors. We also cannot assure that we will be able to successfully develop and market new products or product enhancements, or that these products or enhancements will achieve market acceptance. Any failure by us to continue to\nanticipate or respond in a cost-effective and timely manner to changes in technology, industry standards, service provider offerings or new product announcements by our competitors, or any significant delays in product development or introduction, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our ability to competitively market our products and on our revenues, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur products may not continue to comply with evolving regulations governing their sale, which may harm our business.\nOur products must comply with various regulations, regional standards established by communications authorities, import/export control authorities or other authorities who control the execution of trade agreements in various countries, as well as those of certain\ninternational bodies. Although we believe our products are currently in compliance with domestic and international standards and regulations in countries in which we currently sell, there can be no assurance that we will be able to design our products to comply with\nevolving standards and regulations in the future. Changes in domestic or international communications regulations, tariffs, potential changes in trade policies by the U.S. and other nations, application requirements, import/export controls or expansion of regulation to\nnew areas, including access, communications or commerce over the Internet, may affect customer demand for our products or slow the adoption of new technologies which may affect our sales. Further, the cost of complying with the evolving standards and\nregulations, or the failure to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certification such that we may not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply, may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, financial\ncondition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and other matters. Violations of these laws and regulations may harm our business.\nA wide variety of provincial, state, national and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of data, including personal data. Foreign data protection, privacy and other laws and\nregulations, including the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, are often more restrictive than those in the U.S. These data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are varied, evolving, can be subject to significant change, may be augmented or\nreplaced by new or additional laws and regulations and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. For example, California’s Consumer Privacy Act becomes effective in 2020, proving new data\nprivacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for companies. New and changing laws, regulations and industry practices regarding our employees’ and users’ data could require us to modify our business, products or services offered, potentially in a\nmaterial manner, and may limit our ability to develop new products, services and features. There is also a risk that we, directly or as the result of a third-party service provider we use, could be found to have failed to comply with the laws and regulations applicable\nin a jurisdiction regarding the collection, consent, handling, transfer or disposal of personal data. If we violate these laws and regulations, governmental authorities in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere could seek to impose civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which\ncould have an adverse effect on our reputation, as well as, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nA material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could, if not remediated, materially adversely affect us.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”) requires us to include in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K an assessment by the Company’s management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a report from\nour independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our\nindependent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404. Our compliance with Section 404 may require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend\nsignificant management efforts. In addition, if management or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness\nof our financial statements, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\n20\nAs further described in Part II, Item 9A of this report, and as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (as amended) and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2019 and September\n30, 2019, management previously concluded that certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting existed as of December 31, 2018 and continued through September 30, 2019. Specifically, management determined that controls were not\neffectively designed, documented and maintained to verify that the existence of all inventories subject to our cycle count program were included and counted at the frequency required under the Company’s internal policies, and that the key reports and related data\nused to monitor the results of this program were not validated to ensure completeness and accuracy. Furthermore, management determined that controls were not effectively designed and maintained over the determination of the estimated reserve for excess and\nobsolete inventory, including the review of significant inputs and assumptions used to determine our excess and obsolete inventory reserve, and to ensure the completeness and accuracy of key reports and related data used in the calculation of this reserve.\nManagement has been working to further strengthen the Company’s internal controls relating to inventory. Specifically, as discussed in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has redesigned, enhanced and added certain controls and procedures\nto ensure the completeness of our cycle count program and the completeness and accuracy of key reports and related data used to monitor the results of this cycle count program. As a result of these remediation efforts, management has determined that, as of\nDecember 31, 2019, our controls related to our cycle count program were effectively designed, documented and maintained, and the material weakness related to these controls no longer existed.\nAdditionally, as discussed in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has been working to redesign and implement enhanced controls and procedures related to the review of significant inputs and assumptions used to determine our excess and\nobsolete inventory reserve, and to ensure the completeness and accuracy of key reports and related data used in the calculation of the excess and obsolete inventory reserve. The implementation of these measures is ongoing, and, while we believe that they will\nultimately be effective in remediating the material weakness, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, our controls related to our excess and obsolete inventory reserve were not effectively designed and maintained, and the material weakness\nrelated to these controls continued to exist.\nOur initiatives to remediate this material weakness related to our excess and obsolete inventory reserve or any other material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting identified in the future may not prove successful, and management may not be able\nto conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Furthermore, even if management were to reach a conclusion that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, if our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied\nwith the adequacy of our controls, or if the independent registered public accounting firm interprets the requirements, rules or regulations differently than we do, then they in the future may decline to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting or\nmay issue a report that is qualified. Any of these events could result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could negatively affect the price of our common stock.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws associated with our global activities could subject us to penalties or other adverse consequences.\nA significant portion of our total revenues is generated from sales outside of the U.S. As a result, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign\nofficials for the purpose of directing, obtaining or keeping business, and requires companies to maintain reasonable books and records and a system of internal accounting controls. The FCPA applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents.\nUnder the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by employees, strategic or local partners or other representatives. If we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar legislation, governmental\nauthorities in the U.S. and elsewhere could seek to impose civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. To help ensure that we remain compliant with FCPA, we have\nproactively implemented internally and externally focused measures and controls to address this risk. We help ensure that our employees understand the key requirements of FCPA compliance and the consequences of non-compliance through training courses and\ndetective controls. ADTRAN senior management and employees whose responsibilities include international activities are required to complete an online training program and pass an exam every two years. We have put processes in place to help detect non-\ncompliance through providing our employees access to a worldwide reporting “hotline,” available by phone and online, that is maintained by a third-party provider. Finally, we perform annual reviews of our employees’ expense reports and corporate credit card\nactivity to identify possible corruption concerns. We have also implemented controls to help ensure our third-party partners and customers observe FCPA requirements. Prior to selling to new international distributors, resellers or agents, we review third-party data\nand check them against over 200 denied party lists from government institutions worldwide for potential FCPA concerns. We also require international distributors, resellers and agents to complete an Anti-Corruption Due Diligence Questionnaire, which is reviewed\nand assessed by a cross-functional compliance committee and our export-compliance function.\n21\nOur operating results may be adversely affected due to uncertain global economic and financial market conditions.\nThe global macroeconomic environment has been challenging and inconsistent due to uncertainty in the global central bank monetary policy and uncertainty in global credit markets and the geopolitical environment in many areas of the world. In June 2016, the UK\nheld a referendum, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” in which the majority of voters elected to withdraw from the EU. The UK formally departed from the EU on Friday, January 31, 2020, subject to a transition period expected to last until December 31, 2020 (the\n“Transition Period”). During the Transition Period, most EU rules and regulations will continue to apply to the UK as negotiations between the UK and the EU take place regarding the customs and trading relationship between the UK and the EU. Such negotiations\nare expected to continue after the expiration of the Transition Period. Although the terms of withdrawal remain in negotiation, the referendum has created global economic uncertainty, including anticipation of a possible slowdown in the global economy. Brexit has\nresulted in, and likely will continue to result in, significant volatility in the value of the British Pound Sterling and Euro currencies. In addition, economic and trade and tariff challenges in China, and the global economic ramifications of these challenges, may\ncontinue to put pressure on global economic conditions. The past year has been challenging for the credit markets due to going from a time of quantitative easing to a time of quantitative tightening by central banks around the world. If global economic and market\nconditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or further deteriorate, we may experience material impacts on our business and operating results. We may also be adversely affected by Brexit, and other global economic challenges, in ways that\nwe do not currently anticipate.\nOur failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable environmental regulations could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe manufacture, assembly and testing of our products may require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to environmental, health and safety regulations. Our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with any of these applicable\nrequirements could result in regulatory penalties, legal claims or disruption of production. In addition, our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to properly manage the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage, recycling or disposal of hazardous\nmaterials could subject us to increased costs or liabilities. Existing and future environmental regulations may restrict our use of certain materials to manufacture, assemble and test products. Any of these consequences could adversely impact our results of operations\nby increasing our expenses and/or requiring us to alter our manufacturing processes.\nIf our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks, installations may be delayed or canceled, which could harm our business.\nOur products must interface with existing networks, each of which may have different specifications, utilize multiple protocol standards and incorporate products from other vendors. Many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that\nhave been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved. Our products may be required to interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks, as well as future products to meet our customers’ requirements. If we find errors in the\nexisting software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks, we may have to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate with the existing software and hardware. Implementation of product\ncorrections involving interoperability issues could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations. Such issues may affect our ability to obtain product acceptance from other customers.\nThe lengthy sales and approval process required by major and other service providers for new products could result in fluctuations in our revenue.\nIn the industry in which we compete, sales and approval cycles are often lengthy. Selling efforts often involve a significant commitment of time and resources by us and our customers that may include extensive product testing, laboratory or network certification, or\nregion-specific product certification and homologation requirements for deployment in networks. Additionally, a supplier must first obtain product approval from a major or other service provider to sell its products to them. This process can last from six to eighteen\nmonths, or longer, depending on the technology, the service provider and the demand for the product from the service provider’s subscribers. Consequently, we are involved in a constant process of submitting for approval succeeding generations of products, as well\nas products that deploy new technology or respond to new technology demands from a major or other service provider. We have been successful in the past in obtaining these approvals; however, we cannot be certain that we will obtain these approvals in the future\nor that sales of these products will continue to occur. Any attempt by a major or other service provider to seek out additional or alternative suppliers, or to undertake, as permitted under applicable regulations, the production of these products internally, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our operating results. Furthermore, the delay in sales until the completion of the approval process, the length of which is difficult to predict, could result in fluctuations of revenue and uneven operating results from quarter to quarter or year\nto year. Further, once customer approval or certifications are met, our supply chain customers typically do not guarantee us a minimum, or any, volume of sales. We are dependent on individual purchase orders as discussed elsewhere in this report.\n22\nWe engage in research and development activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application of developed technologies, and as a consequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially\ngreater research and development effort and which may focus on more leading edge development.\nWe engage in research and development activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application of developed technologies, and as a consequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially greater\nresearch and development efforts. A portion of our research and development activities are focused on the continued innovation of currently accepted access technologies in order to deliver faster internet speeds, more capacity, better quality of service and\noperational efficiency. These research and development efforts result in improved applications of technologies for which demand already exists or is latent. We also focus our research and development efforts on developing software, solutions and platforms that\nenable service providers to increase revenue-generating service velocity, reducing operational costs, increasing scale and providing service agility. We rarely engage in research projects that represent a vast departure from the current business practices of our key\ncustomers. While we believe our strategy provides a higher likelihood of producing nearer term or more sustainable revenue streams, this strategy could result in lost revenue opportunities should a new technology achieve rapid and widespread market acceptance.\nWhen we do engage in research and development activities for new, leading-edge technologies and market approaches, there is no guarantee that those technologies or market approaches will be successful or that they will be adopted and purchased by our\ncustomers.\nWe depend heavily on sales to certain customers; the loss of any of these customers would significantly reduce our revenues and net income.\nHistorically, a large percentage of our sales have been made to major service providers and larger independent communications companies. In 2019, these customers continued to comprise over half of our revenue. As long as the major and larger independent\ncommunications companies represent such a substantial percentage of our total sales, our future success will significantly depend upon certain factors which are not within our control, including:\n• the timing and size of future purchase orders, if any, from these customers;\n• changes in strategic plans and capital budgets of these customers;\n• the product requirements of these customers;\n• the subscriber take rate, including subscriber loss or churn, of our customers;\n• the financial and operational success of these customers;\n• the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on these customers;\n• consolidation, acquisition of, or corporate reorganization among these customers;\n• the success of these customers' services deployed using our products; and\n• the impact of work stoppages at these customers.\nIn the past, sales to our large customers have fluctuated, and may fluctuate in the future, significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. The loss of, or a significant reduction or delay in, sales to any such customer or the occurrence of sales fluctuations could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, any attempt by a major or other service provider to seek out additional or alternative suppliers or to undertake, as permitted under applicable regulations, the production of these\nproducts internally, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions or are unable to continue operations. This could lead to variability in our\noperating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flow. In addition, particularly in the service provider market, rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers, with the effect that a loss of a\nmajor customer could have a material impact on our results that we would not have anticipated in a marketplace composed of more numerous participants.\n23\nIf we are unable to integrate recent and future acquisitions successfully, it could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may make acquisitions to improve or expand our product offerings, customer base, talent or intellectual property. Our current and future acquisition strategy will depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate acquisitions. Acquisitions\ninvolve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:\n• difficulties integrating and managing the operations, technologies and products of the companies we acquire;\n• our inability to maintain the key business relationships and the brand equity of businesses we acquire;\n• our inability to retain key personnel of the acquired business; and\n• our responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire, some of which we may not anticipate, including costs of third-party advisors to resolve disputes.\nOur strategy of outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing requirements to subcontractors located in various international regions may result in us not meeting our cost, quality or performance standards.\nWe are heavily dependent on subcontractors for the assembly and testing of certain printed circuit board assemblies, subassemblies, chassis, enclosures and equipment shelves, and the purchase of some raw materials used in such assemblies. This reliance involves\nseveral risks, including the unavailability of, or interruptions in, access to certain process technologies and reduced control over product quality, delivery schedules, transportation, manufacturing yields and costs. We may not be able to provide product order\nvolumes to our subcontractors that are high enough to achieve sufficient cost savings. If shipments fall below forecasted levels, we may incur increased costs or be required to take ownership of excess inventory. Changes in international tariff structures could\nadversely impact our product costs. In addition, a significant component of maintaining cost competitiveness is the ability of our subcontractors to adjust their costs to compensate for possible adverse exchange rate movements. To the extent that the subcontractors\nare unable to do so, and we are unable to procure alternative product supplies, then our competitiveness and results of operations could be adversely impaired. These risks may be exacerbated by economic, regulatory or political changes or uncertainties, terrorist\nactions, the effects of climate change, natural disasters or pandemics in the foreign countries in which our subcontractors are located. We do not utilize contract manufacturing for our products in China, though we do source some ODM products from China which\nare, or may become, subject to import tariffs. Additionally, concerns and additional costs associated with imports tariffs imposed on certain products from China has resulted in manufacturers seeking to secure production capabilities outside of China, including in\ncountries where we currently utilize contract manufacturing.\nTo date, we believe that we have successfully managed the risks of our dependence on these subcontractors through a variety of efforts, which include seeking and developing alternative subcontractors while maintaining existing relationships; however, we cannot\nbe assured that delays in product deliveries will not occur in the future because of shortages resulting from this limited number of subcontractors or from the financial or other difficulties of these parties. Our inability to develop alternative subcontractors if and as\nrequired in the future, or the need to undertake required retraining and other activities related to establishing and developing a new subcontractor relationship, could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which, in turn, could have a negative effect on\nour customer relationships and operating results.\n24\nChanges in trade policy in the United States and other countries, specifically China, including the imposition of additional tariffs and the resulting consequences, may adversely impact our gross profits, gross margins, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nThe U.S. government has imposed tariffs on a wide-range of products and goods manufactured in China and imported into the U.S. These tariffs are intended to address trade imbalances, which include decreasing imports from China and encouraging increased\nproduction of these products in the U.S. These proposals have, and could continue to, result in increased customs duties and tariffs. We import an increasing percentage of our products into the U.S from China and an increase in customs duties and tariffs with\nrespect to these imports could negatively impact our gross profit, gross margins and results of operations. These customs duties and tariffs may also cause other U.S. trading partners to take certain actions with respect to U.S. imports in their respective countries.\nAny potential changes in trade policies in the U.S. and the potential actions by other countries in which we do business could adversely impact our financial performance.\nOur dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products may prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on customer relations and operating\nresults.\nCertain raw materials and key components used in our products are currently available from only one source, and others are available from only a limited number of sources. The availability of these raw materials and supplies may be subject to market forces beyond\nour control, such as merger and acquisition activity of our suppliers and consolidation in some segments of our supplier base. From time to time, there may not be sufficient quantities of raw materials and supplies in the marketplace to meet customer demand. Many\ncompanies utilize the same raw materials and supplies that we do in the production of their products. Companies with more resources than our own may have a competitive advantage in obtaining raw materials and supplies due to greater buying power. These factors\ncan result in reduced supply, higher prices of raw materials and delays in the receipt of certain of our key components, which in turn may generate increased costs, lower margins and delays in product delivery, with a corresponding adverse effect on revenues and\ncustomer relationships. Furthermore, due to general economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, our suppliers may experience financial difficulties, which could result in increased delays, additional costs or loss of a supplier. We attempt to manage these risks\nthrough developing alternative sources, by staging inventories at strategic locations, through engineering efforts designed to obviate the necessity of certain components and by building long-term relationships and close contact with each of our key suppliers;\nhowever, we cannot assure that delays in or failures of deliveries of key components, either to us or to our contract manufacturers, and consequent delays in product deliveries, will not occur in the future.\nIn particular, if the current novel coronavirus outbreak continues and results in a prolonged period of travel, commercial and other similar restrictions, we could experience global supply disruptions. These restrictions could disrupt our ability to receive ODM\nproducts from China and may disrupt our suppliers located elsewhere who rely on products from China. Although we have not experienced material effects from the disruptions through the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, if we experience additional\nsupply disruptions, we may become dependent on alternative sources outside the region. We may not be able to develop such alternate sourcing quickly enough to avoid production delays. Any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage\nof ODM products could cause us to alter production schedules, which could cause a loss of revenues, which would adversely affect our operations.\nIn addition, the SEC has adopted disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict minerals” mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and procedures to identify the source of such minerals included in manufactured products. The\ndisclosures will require us to incur additional costs to verify the origins of the identified minerals used and comply with disclosure requirements. These requirements could affect the availability of minerals used in the manufacture of a limited number of parts\ncontained in our products. This may reduce the number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Our material sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered. While we are\ntaking steps to identify sourcing based on recommended standards for our industry, we may not be able to conclusively verify the origins for all minerals used in our products. An inability to make a sourcing determination of minerals in our products could impact\nour revenues and harm our financial condition should our customers require that we certify that all components used in our products are free of minerals from this region.\n25\nWe compete in markets that have become increasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and market share.\nThe markets for our products are intensely competitive. Additional manufacturers have entered the markets in recent years to offer products in competition with us. Additionally, certain companies have, in recent years, developed the ability to deliver competing\nproducts using coaxial cable and cellular transmission, especially in high-density metropolitan areas. Competition will further increase if new companies enter the market or existing competitors expand their product lines. Some of these potential competitors may\nhave greater financial, technological, manufacturing, sales and marketing, and personnel resources than we have. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly or effectively to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer\nrequirements, withstand significant price decreases, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can.\nIn addition, our present and future competitors may be able to enter our existing or future markets with products or technologies comparable or superior to those that we offer. An increase in competition could cause us to reduce prices, decrease our market share,\nrequire increased spending by us on product development and sales and marketing, or cause delays or cancellations in customer orders, any one of which could reduce our gross profit margins and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, installation and shipment volumes, field service repair obligations and other rework costs incurred in correcting product failures. If our estimates change, our\nliability for warranty obligations may increase or decrease, impacting future cost of goods sold.\nOur products are highly complex, and we cannot ensure that our extensive product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect all defects, errors, failures and quality issues. Quality or performance problems for products covered\nunder warranty could adversely impact our reputation and negatively affect our operating results, financial position and cash flows. The development and production of new products with high complexity often involves problems with software, components and\nmanufacturing methods. If significant warranty obligations arise due to reliability or quality issues arising from defects in software, faulty components or manufacturing methods, our operating results, financial position and cash flows could be negatively impacted\nby:\n• costs associated with fixing software or hardware defects;\n• costs associated with internal or third-party installation errors;\n• high service and warranty expenses;\n• costs associated with recalling and replacing products with software or hardware defects, including costs from writing-off defective products recalled;\n• high inventory obsolescence expense;\n• delays in collecting accounts receivable;\n• payment of liquidated damages for performance failures; and\n• a decline in sales to existing customers.\nManaging our inventory is complex and may include write-downs of excess or obsolete inventory.\nManaging our inventory of components and finished products is complicated by a number of factors, including the need to maintain a significant inventory of certain components that are in short supply, that have been discontinued by the component manufacturer,\nthat must be purchased in bulk to obtain favorable pricing or that require long lead times. These issues may result in our purchasing and maintaining significant amounts of inventory, which if not used or expected to be used based on anticipated production\nrequirements, may become excess or obsolete. Any excess or obsolete inventory could also result in sales price reductions and/or inventory write- downs, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n26\nThe continuing growth of our international operations could expose us to additional risks, increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are expanding our presence in international markets, which represented 43.2% of our net sales for 2019, and as a result, we anticipate increased sales and operating costs in these markets. This international expansion may increase our operational risks and\nimpact our results of operations, including:\n• exposure to unfavorable commercial terms in certain countries;\n• the time and cost to staff and manage foreign operations;\n• the time and cost to maintain good relationships with employee associations and works councils;\n• the time and cost to ensure adequate business interruption controls, processes and facilities;\n• the time and cost to manage and evolve financial reporting systems, maintain effective financial disclosure controls and procedures, and comply with corporate governance requirements in multiple jurisdictions;\n• the cost to collect accounts receivable and extension of collection periods;\n• the cost and potential disruption of facilities transitions required in some business acquisitions;\n• less regulation of patents or other safeguards of intellectual property in certain countries;\n• the potential impact of adverse tax, customs regulations and transfer-pricing issues;\n• exposure to increased price competition from additional competitors in some countries;\n• exposure to global social, political and economic instability, changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rate movements;\n• potential exposure to liability or damage of reputation resulting from a higher incidence of corruption or unethical business practices in some countries;\n• potential regulations on data protection, regarding the collection, use, disclosure and security of data;\n• potential trade protection measures, export compliance issues, domestic preference procurement requirements, qualification to transact business and additional regulatory requirements; and\n• potential exposure to natural disasters, epidemics and acts of war or terrorism.\nIf we are unable to successfully address the potential risks associated with our overall international expansion, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows may be negatively impacted.\nWe may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nAs our international sales increase or as utilization of international suppliers expands, we may transact additional business in currencies other than U.S. currency. As a result, we will be subject to the possibility of greater effects of foreign currency exchange\ntranslation on our financial statements. Sales contract commitments and accounts receivable balances based on foreign currency expose us to the potential risk of loss as the value of the U.S. dollar fluctuates over time. In addition, for those countries outside the U.S.\nwhere we have significant sales or significant purchases of supplies, devaluation in the local currency could make our products more expensive for customers to purchase or increase our costs, thereby adversely affecting our competitiveness or results of operation.\nWhen appropriate, we may enter into various derivative transactions to enhance our ability to manage the volatility relating to these typical business exposures. If used, the derivative transactions will be intended to reduce, but not eliminate, the impact of foreign\ncurrency exchange rate movements; therefore, we generally would not anticipate hedging all outstanding foreign currency risk. There can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our revenue from\ninternational sales, manufacturing costs, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n27\nOur success depends on our ability to reduce the selling prices of succeeding generations of our products.\nOur strategy is to increase unit sales volumes and market share each year by introducing succeeding generations of products having lower selling prices and increased functionality as compared to prior generations of products. To maintain or increase our revenues\nand margins while continuing this strategy, we must continue, in some combination, to increase sales volumes of existing products, introduce and sell new products, or reduce our per unit costs at rates sufficient to compensate for the reduced revenue effect of\ncontinuing reductions in the average sales prices of our products. We cannot ensure that we will be able to maintain or increase revenues or margins by increasing unit sales volumes of our products, introducing and selling new products or reducing unit costs of our\nproducts.\nWe are currently evaluating the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) software solution. If we do not effectively implement this project, our operations could be significantly disrupted.\nWe are currently evaluating the implementation of a new ERP software solution. This project could have a significant impact on our business processes, financial reporting, information systems and internal controls, and will require significant change management,\nmeaningful investment in capital and personnel resources and coordination of numerous software and system providers and internal business teams. We may experience difficulties as we manage these changes and transition to a new ERP solution, including loss or\ncorruption of data, delayed shipments, delayed financial reporting, decreases in productivity as our personnel implement and become familiar with the new systems and processes, unanticipated expenses (including increased costs of implementation, costs of\nconducting business or the potential impairment of previously capitalized ERP implementation costs) and lost revenues. Difficulties in implementing a new ERP solution could disrupt our operations, divert management’s attention from key strategic initiatives and\nhave an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nBreaches of our information systems and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property and cause significant damage to our business and reputation.\nWe maintain sensitive data on our information systems and the networks of third-party providers, including intellectual property, financial data and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business, customers, suppliers and business partners.\nWe also produce networking equipment solutions and software used by network operators to ensure security and reliability in their management and transmission of data. Our customers, particularly those in regulated industries, are increasingly focused on the\nsecurity features of our technology solutions and maintaining the security of information sensitive to us and our business partners is critical to our business and reputation. We rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key\noperations and financial functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical. Companies are increasingly subjected to cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. We have multiple layers of access control and devote\nsignificant resources to data encryption and other security measures to protect our information technology and communications systems. We test our vulnerability periodically and take action to further secure our networks, yet our network and storage applications\nand those systems and storage applications maintained by our third-party providers may be subject to unauthorized access by cyber-attack or breached due to operator error, fraudulent activity or other system disruptions. In some cases, it is difficult to anticipate or\nimmediately detect damage caused by such incidents. Unauthorized access or disclosure of our information could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. Our information systems are designed to appropriate industry\nstandards to reduce downtime in the event of power outages, weather or climate events and cyber-security issues. A significant failure of our systems due to these issues could result in significant remediation costs, disrupt business operations and divert management\nattention, which could result in harm to our business reputation, operating results, financial condition and cash flow.\nOur failure to maintain rights to intellectual property used in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality and commercial value of our products.\nOur future success depends in part upon our proprietary technology. Although we attempt to protect our proprietary technology by contract, trademark, copyright and patent registration, and internal security, including trade secret protection, these protections may\nnot be adequate. Furthermore, our competitors can develop similar technology independently without violating our proprietary rights. From time to time, we receive and may continue to receive notices of claims alleging that we are infringing upon patents or other\nintellectual property. Any of these claims, whether with or without merit, could result in significant legal fees, divert our management’s time, attention and resources, delay our product shipments or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. We cannot\npredict whether we will prevail in any claims or litigation over alleged infringements, or whether we will be able to license any valid and infringed patents, or other intellectual property, on commercially reasonable terms. If a claim of intellectual property\ninfringement against us is successful and we fail to obtain a license or develop or license non-infringing technology, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be affected adversely.\n28\nSoftware under license from third-parties for use in certain of our products may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe integrate third-party software into certain of our products. Licenses for this technology may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. Difficulties with third-party technology licensors could result in the termination of\nsuch licenses, which may result in increased costs or require us to purchase or develop a substitute technology. Difficulty obtaining and maintaining third-party technology licenses may disrupt the development of our products and increase our costs, which could\nharm our business.\nOur use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products.\nSeveral of our solutions utilize elements of open source or publicly available software. Although we closely monitor our use of open source software, the terms of many open source software licenses have not been interpreted by the courts, and there is a risk that\nsuch licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to sell our products. In such event, we could be required to make our proprietary software generally available to third parties, including competitors,\nat no cost, to seek licenses from third-parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or at all, any of which could adversely\naffect our revenues and operating expenses.\nWe may incur liabilities or become subject to litigation that would have a material effect on our business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we accept purchase orders, and enter into sales and other related contracts, for the marketing, sale, manufacture, distribution or use of our products and services. We may incur liabilities relating to our performance under such\nagreements, or which result from damage claims arising from certain events as outlined within the particular contract. While we attempt to include reasonable limitations of liability and other protective measures to all agreements, such agreements may not always\ncontain, or be subject to, maximum loss clauses and liabilities arising from them may result in significant adverse changes to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including employment disputes, patent claims, disputes over contract agreements and other commercial disputes. In some cases, claimants seek monetary recovery, or\nother relief, including damages such as royalty payments related to patents, lost profits or injunctive relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. Any such disputes may be resolved before trial, or if tried, may be resolved in our favor; however,\nthe cost of claims sustained in litigation, and costs associated with the litigation process, may not be covered by our insurance. Such costs, and the demands on management time during such an event, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on\nour liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nConsolidation and deterioration in the CLEC market could result in a significant decrease in our revenue.\nWe sell a moderate volume of products directly or indirectly to CLECs who compete with the established Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (“ILEC”). The CLEC market is experiencing a process of consolidation. Many of our CLEC customers do not have a\nstrong financial position and have limited ability to access the public financial markets for additional funding for growth and operations. If one or more of these CLECs fail, we could face a loss in revenue and an increased bad debt expense, due to their inability to\npay outstanding invoices, as well as the corresponding decrease in customer base and future revenue. Furthermore, significant portions of our sales to CLECs are made through independent distributors. The failure of one or more CLECs could also negatively affect\nthe financial position of a distributor to the point that the distributor could also experience business failure and/or default on payments to us.\nWe depend on distributors who maintain inventories of our products. If the distributors reduce their inventories of these products, our sales could be adversely affected.\nWe work closely with our distributors to monitor channel inventory levels and ensure that appropriate levels of our products are available to resellers and end users. If our distributors reduce their levels of inventory of our products, our sales would be negatively\nimpacted during the period of change.\n29\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and maintain relationships with SIs, service providers and enterprise VARs, our sales may be negatively affected.\nAs part of our sales strategy, we are targeting SIs, service providers and enterprise VARs. In addition to specialized technical expertise, SIs, service providers and VARs typically offer sophisticated service capabilities that are frequently desired by enterprise\ncustomers. To expand our distribution channel to include resellers with such capabilities, we must be able to provide effective support to these resellers. If our sales, marketing or service capabilities are not sufficient to provide effective support to such SIs, service\nproviders and VARs, our sales may be negatively affected, and current SI, service provider and VAR partners may terminate their relationships with us, which would adversely impact our sales and overall results of operations.\nIf we fail to manage our exposure to worldwide financial and securities markets successfully, our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted.\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and prices of marketable equity and fixed-income securities. The primary objective of the majority of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time achieving\nappropriate yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, a majority of our marketable securities are investment grade corporate and municipal fixed-rate bonds, U.S. government bonds and municipal money market instruments denominated\nin U.S. dollars. While we do invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equities, which are subject to market risks, including the loss of principal, our equity investments are generally invested in professionally-managed portfolios with the objective of exceeding\nthe performance of their underlying benchmarks. All of our fixed income and equity portfolios are reviewed regularly for performance and policy compliance. Our investment policy provides limitations for issuer concentration, which limits, at the time of purchase,\nthe concentration in any one issuer to 5% of the market value of our total investment portfolio.\nWe have significant investments in corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, U.S. government bonds and foreign government bonds. Through December 31, 2019, we have not been required to impair any of\nthese investments; however, we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity in these investments, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Fixed-rate interest securities may have their fair value\nadversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while variable-rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Our investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may increase because of\nconditions in the financial markets and related credit liquidity issues. Consequently, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates, or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in fair\nvalue due to changes in interest rates.\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Part II, Item 7 of this report, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of this report and\nNote 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for more information about our investments.\n30\nNew or revised tax regulations, changes in our effective tax rate, recognition of a valuation allowance or assessments arising from tax audits may have an adverse impact on our results.\nWe are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions, both domestically and internationally, in which we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in the determination of our provision for income taxes, and this determination requires the interpretation and\napplication of complex and sometimes uncertain tax laws and regulations. Our effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by changes in the mix of earnings between jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, and by\nchanges in tax rules and regulations. We continually monitor our deferred tax assets and when it becomes more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be recognized a valuation allowance is recorded against those assets. During 2019, we received corporate\nincome tax credits under a program administered by the Alabama State Industrial Development Authority in connection with revenue bonds issued to provide funding for the expansion of our corporate facilities. The credit program administered by the Alabama\nState Industrial Development Authority ended on January 2, 2020 with the repayment of the revenue bonds, which will result in an increased effective tax rate in the future. These employment-related tax benefits are currently accounted for in our effective tax rate.\nIn addition, we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and various other jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to\ndetermine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Additionally, we continually\nreview the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recognized. As such, we may release a portion of the valuation\nallowance or establish a new valuation allowance based on operations in the jurisdictions in which these assets arose. Management continues to evaluate all evidence including historical operating results, the existence of losses in the most recent year, forecasted\nearnings, future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Should management determine that a valuation allowance is needed in the future due to not being able to absorb loss carryforwards, it would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe are required to periodically evaluate the value of our long-lived assets, including the value of intangibles assets acquired and goodwill resulting from business acquisitions. Any future impairment charges required may adversely affect our operating\nresults.\nValuation of our long-lived assets requires us to make assumptions about future sales prices and sales volumes for our products. These assumptions are used to forecast future, undiscounted cash flows. Forecasting future business trends is difficult and subject to\nmodification. Should actual market conditions differ, or our forecasts change, we may be required to reassess long-lived assets and could record an impairment charge. Any impairment charge relating to long-lived assets would have the effect of decreasing our\nearnings or increasing our losses in such period.\nWe may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of our ongoing restructuring plans. Our restructuring efforts may adversely affect our business and our operating results.\nWe have undertaken restructuring efforts to realign our organization to better match our market opportunities, technology development initiatives and improve efficiencies. There can be no assurance that we will fully realize the anticipated benefits to future\nfinancial results from our efforts. This realignment could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy by diverting management’s attention from normal daily operations, decreasing cash flows and operating results due to severance payments and\nfacility termination costs, and could be disruptive to our business. If we fail to realize some or all of the expected benefits of this realignment, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining key personnel.\nOur business has grown significantly since its inception. Our success is dependent in large part on the continued employment of our executive officers, including Thomas R. Stanton, our Chief Executive Officer, and other key management personnel. The unplanned\ndeparture of one or more of these individuals could adversely affect our business. In addition, for ADTRAN to continue as a successful entity we must also be able to attract and retain key engineers and software developers and architects whose expertise helps us\nmaintain competitive advantages. We believe that our future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to continue to attract, retain, train and motivate highly-skilled employees who are in great demand. Stock awards are designed to reward employees for\ntheir long-term contributions and to provide incentives for them to remain with us. Changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees. Properly managing our continued\ngrowth, avoiding the problems often resulting from such growth and expansion and continuing to operate in the manner which has proven successful to us to date will be critical to the future success of our business.\n31\nRegulatory and potential physical impacts of climate change and other natural events may affect our customers and our production operations, resulting in adverse effects on our operating results.\nThere is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases continue to alter the composition of the atmosphere, affecting large-scale weather patterns and the global climate. It appears that some form of U.S. federal regulation related to\ngreenhouse gas emissions may occur, and any such regulation could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes or emission allowances. The impact of any future legislation, regulations or product specification requirements on our products and\nbusiness operations is dependent on the design of the final mandate or standard, so we are unable to predict its significance at this time.\nThe potential physical impacts of climate change and other natural events on our customers, suppliers and on our operations are highly uncertain, and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions. These events may include\nchanges in weather patterns (including drought and rainfall levels), water availability, storm patterns and intensities, ocean levels, temperature levels, earthquakes and tsunamis. These potential physical effects may adversely affect our revenues, costs, production and\ndelivery schedules, and cause harm to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ADTN. Since our initial public offering in August 1994, there has been, and may continue to be, significant volatility in the market for our common stock, based on a variety of\nfactors, including factors listed in this section, some of which are beyond our control.\n32\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur headquarters and principal administrative, engineering and manufacturing facilities are located on an 82-acre campus in Cummings Research Park in Huntsville, Alabama. Two office buildings serve both our Network Solutions and our Services & Support\nsegments. We lease engineering facilities in the U.S., Europe and India that are used to develop products sold by our Network Solutions segment. In addition, we lease office space in North America, Latin America, EMEA and APAC, providing sales and service\nsupport for both of our segments. These cancelable and non-cancelable leases expire at various times through 2025. For more information, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nWe also have numerous sales and support staff operating from home-based offices serving both our Network Solutions and our Services & Support segments, which are located within the U.S. and abroad.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nSecurities Class Action Lawsuit\nOn October 17, 2019, a purported stockholder class action lawsuit, captioned Burbridge v. ADTRAN, Inc. et al., Docket No. 19-cv-09619, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, two of its current\nexecutive officers and one of its former executive officers. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages on behalf of purported purchasers of ADTRAN securities between February 28, 2019 and October 9,\n2019. The lawsuit claims that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding, and/or failed to disclose material adverse facts about, the Company’s business, operations and prospects, specifically relating to the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting, excess and obsolete inventory reserves, financial results and shipments to a Latin American customer. Investors in ADTRAN securities had until December 16, 2019 to move the court to serve as lead plaintiff in this action.\nOn December 16, 2019, two purported investors in ADTRAN securities filed motions seeking to be appointed lead plaintiff in the case. On January 6, 2020, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Defendants’ unopposed\nrequest to transfer the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, where the case is now pending as Burbridge v. ADTRAN, Inc. et al., Docket No. 5:20-cv-00050-LCB. On January 27, 2020, the two prospective lead plaintiff\nmovants filed a stipulation among plaintiffs seeking to be appointed as co-lead plaintiffs in the case.\nWe disagree with the claims made in the complaint and intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.\nOther Legal Matters\nIn addition to the litigation described above, from time to time we are subject to or otherwise involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and legal proceedings that arise out of or are incidental to the conduct of our business (collectively, “Legal Matters”),\nincluding those relating to employment matters, patent rights, regulatory compliance matters, stockholder claims, and contractual and other commercial disputes. Such Legal Matters, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and\nmanagerial resources. Additionally, an unfavorable outcome in a legal matter, including in a patent dispute, could require the Company to pay damages, entitle claimants to other relief, such as royalties, or could prevent the Company from selling some of its\nproducts in certain jurisdictions. While the Company cannot predict with certainty the results of the Legal Matters in which it is currently involved, the Company does not expect that the ultimate outcome of such Legal Matters will individually or in the aggregate\nhave a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nITEM 4.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have omitted\ndiscussion of the earliest of the three years of financial condition and results of operations and this information can be found in Part I, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2019, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at sec.gov and on our website at www.adtran.com.\nOverview\nADTRAN is a leading global provider of networking and communications equipment, serving a diverse domestic and international customer base in multiple countries that includes Tier-1, -2 and -3 service providers, cable/MSOs and distributed enterprises. Our\ninnovative solutions and services enable voice, data, video and internet communications across a variety of network infrastructures and are currently in use by millions worldwide. We support our customers through our direct global sales organization and our\ndistribution networks. Our success depends upon our ability to increase unit volume and market share through the introduction of new products and succeeding generations of products having lower selling prices and increased functionality as compared to both the\nprior generation of a product and to the products of competitors. In order to service our customers and grow revenue, we are constantly conducting research and development of new products addressing customer needs and testing those products for the particular\nspecifications of the particular customers. We are focused on being a top global supplier of access infrastructure and related value-added solutions from the cloud edge to the subscriber edge. We offer a broad portfolio of flexible software and hardware network\nsolutions and services that enable service providers to meet today’s service demands, while enabling them to transition to the fully-converged, scalable, highly-automated, cloud-controlled voice, data, internet and video network of the future. In addition to our\ncorporate headquarters in Huntsville, Alabama, we have research and development facilities in strategic global locations.\nAn important part of our strategy is to reduce the cost of each succeeding product generation and then lower the product’s selling price based on the cost savings achieved in order to gain market share and/or improve gross margins. As a part of this strategy, we seek\nto be a high-quality, and in most instances the low-cost, provider of products in our markets. Our success to date is attributable in large measure to our ability to design our products initially with a view to their subsequent redesign, allowing both increased\nfunctionality and reduced manufacturing costs in each succeeding product generation. This strategy enables us to sell succeeding generations of products to existing customers, while increasing our market share by selling these enhanced products to new customers.\nWe ended the first half of 2019 with 20.6% year-over-year revenue growth and good geographical diversity with 50.8% of our revenue coming from international markets. During the third quarter of 2019, we experienced a slowdown in capital spending by a Tier-1\ncustomer in Europe and an unforeseen pause in spending from a LATAM Tier-1 customer. While shipments to the LATAM customer resumed in the fourth quarter, these delays, combined with seasonality, resulted in a softer than expected second half of the year.\nDuring 2019, we had three 10% revenue customers geographically diversified with one each in the U.S., Europe and LATAM. Our domestic revenue growth of 4.2% year-over-year was driven by an increase in sales to RSPs and additional fiber deployments across\nall customers. In addition, we saw an increase in sales to a Tier-1 customer with diversified business among our fiber access and CPE, service provider CPE and services as well as sales to a Tier-2 customer. Our LATAM Tier-1 customer expanded their FTTx\ndeployments in 2019 with ADTRAN solutions. In Europe, a Tier-1 customer continued expansion of their vectoring and super-vectoring VDSL2 solutions. We also experienced increases in our service provider CPE business in 2019. Among our customers, we made\nprogress with our fiber and fiber-extension solutions, including Gfast and PON, while also continuing to engage various Services & Support opportunities that we expect will contribute in 2020 and beyond. In addition, we believe we are at the beginning of a\nsignificant investment cycle for fiber deployment driven by technology advancements, regulatory influences and vendor disruption. The transition to next-generation network architectures is beginning, and we are seeing demand for our next-generation SD-Access\nsolutions. In the latter part of 2020, we anticipate that payments to service providers under government funding programs such as the FCC Rural Digital Opportunity Fund will begin and continue into 2021.\nWe made two acquisitions in 2018, strengthening our position in both the cable/MSOs and connected home markets. In the first quarter of 2018, we acquired Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s North American EPON business and certain assets for North\nAmerica and entered into a technology license and original equipment manufacturer supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. These solutions, combined with our organic fiber access product portfolio and our distributed access expertise, present\nnew opportunities in the cable/MSO market. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired U.S.-based SmartRG, an industry-leading provider of carrier-class, connected-home software platforms and cloud services for broadband service providers. With this\nacquisition, ADTRAN now offers a complete cloud-to-consumer portfolio of virtualized management, data analytics, Wi-Fi-enabled residential gateways and software platforms.\n36\nIn addition to classifying our operations into two reportable segments, we report revenue across three categories of products and services – (1) Access & Aggregation, (2) Subscriber Solutions & Experience (formerly Customer Devices) and (3) Traditional & Other\nProducts.\nOur Access & Aggregation solutions are used by CSPs to connect their network infrastructure to subscribers. This revenue category includes hardware- and software-based products and services that aggregate and/or originate access technologies. ADTRAN\nsolutions within this category include a wide array of modular or fixed platforms designed to deliver the best technology and economy based on subscriber density and environmental conditions.\nOur Subscriber Solutions & Experience portfolio is used by service providers to terminate their infrastructure at the customers premises while providing an immersive and interactive experience for the subscriber. These solutions include copper and fiber WAN\ntermination, LAN switching, Wi-Fi access, and cloud software services, for both residential and business markets.\nIn alignment with our increased focus on enhancing the customer experience for both business and consumer broadband customers as well as the addition of SmartRG during 2018, what was previously known as our Customer Devices category became our\nSubscriber Solutions & Experience category, as this more accurately represents this revenue category and our vision moving forward.\nOur Traditional & Other Products category generally includes a mix of prior-generation technologies’ products and services, as well as other products and services that do not fit within the other revenue categories.\nOur operating results have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, on a quarterly basis due to a number of factors, including customer order activity and backlog. A substantial portion of our shipments in any fiscal period relates to orders received and shipped\nwithin that fiscal period for customers under agreements containing non-binding purchase commitments. Further, a significant percentage of orders require delivery within a few days. These factors normally result in a varying order backlog and limited order flow\nvisibility. Additionally, backlog levels may vary because of seasonal trends, the timing of customer projects, and other factors that affect customer order lead times. Because many of our customers require prompt delivery of products, we are required to maintain\nsufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand. If near-term demand for our products declines, or if potential sales in any quarter do not occur as anticipated, our financial results could be adversely affected. Operating expenses are relatively fixed\nin the short term; therefore, a shortfall in quarterly revenues could significantly impact our financial results in a given quarter.\nOur operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors, including a decline in general economic and market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate movements, increased competition, customer order patterns, changes in product and\nservices mix, timing differences between price decreases and product cost reductions, product warranty returns, expediting costs, tariffs and announcements of new products by us or our competitors. Additionally, maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure\nprompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory that may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of this inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. Also, not maintaining sufficient inventory\nlevels to assure prompt delivery of our products may cause us to incur expediting costs to meet customer delivery requirements, which may negatively impact our operating results in a given quarter. During 2019, the Company implemented restructuring plans to\nrealign its expense structure with the reduction in revenue experienced in recent years and with overall Company objectives. Management assessed the efficiency of our operations and consolidated locations and personnel, among other things, and has implemented\ncertain cost savings initiatives, where possible. We expect to see a reduction in our operating expenses, both in the U.S. and internationally, as a result of our implementation of these restructuring plans.\nOur historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results, and, in general, management expects that our financial results may vary from period to period. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in\nPart II, Item 8 of this report, for additional information on quarterly results for 2018 and 2019. For a discussion of risks associated with our operating results, see Part I, Item 1A of this report.\n37\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents selected financial information derived from our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) expressed as a percentage of sales for the years indicated.

The emphasis of the discussion is a comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. For a discussion of a comparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and\nDecember 31, 2017, please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2019.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018\nSales\nOur sales increased 0.1% from $529.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $530.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our Services & Support sales increased $3.8 million compared to 2018 and our Network Solutions sales decreased $3.0\nmillion versus the prior year. The increase in our 2019 sales was primarily attributable to an increase in Subscriber Solutions & Experience sales of $18.5 million, partially offset by decreases in Access & Aggregation sales of $10.0 million and Traditional & Other\nProducts sales of $7.7 million.\nNetwork Solutions sales decreased by 0.7% from $458.2 million in 2018 to $455.2 million in 2019, due primarily to a decrease in sales of our Access & Aggregation products and Traditional & Other Products. The decrease in sales of 3.9% of our Access &\nAggregation products for 2019 was primarily attributable to decreased FTTN products, offset by an increase in sales of Gfast DPUs. The increase of 12.1% in 2019 for sales of our Subscriber Solutions & Experience products was primarily attributable to increased\nresidential CPE and fiber CPE sales, partially offset by a decrease in sales of SP Business CPE and WiFi access points and infrastructure. While we expect that revenues from Traditional & Other Products will continue to decline over time, these revenues may\nfluctuate and continue for years because of the time required for our customers to transition to newer technologies.\n38\nServices & Support sales increased by 5.3% from $71.0 million in 2018 to $74.8 million in 2019. The increase in sales for 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in network installation and maintenance services for Access & Aggregation products and\nSubscriber Solutions & Experience.\nDomestic sales increased 4.2% from $288.8 million in 2018 to $300.9 million in 2019. Our domestic growth was driven by an increase in sales to the RSP market segment and additional fiber deployments across all customers. In addition, such growth was driven by\nan increase in sales to a Tier-1 customer with diversified business among our fiber access and CPE, service provider CPE and services, as well as increased sales to a Tier-2 customer.\nInternational sales, which are included in the amounts for the Network Solutions and Services & Support segments amounts discussed above, decreased 4.7% from $240.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $229.2 for the year ended December 31,\n2019. International sales, as a percentage of total sales, decreased from 45.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 43.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in international sales for 2019 was primarily attributable to the slowdown in\nshipments to two international Tier-1 customers.\nOur international revenue is largely focused on broadband infrastructure and is affected by the decisions of our customers as to timing for installation of new technologies, expansion of their networks and/or network upgrades. Our international customers must make\nthese decisions in the regulatory and political environment in which they operate – both nationally and in some instances, regionally – whether of a multi-country region or a more local region within a country. The competitive landscape in certain international\nmarkets is also affected by the increased presence of Asian manufacturers that seek to compete aggressively on price. Our revenue and operating income in some international markets can be negatively impacted by a strengthening U.S. dollar. Consequently, while\nwe expect the global trend towards deployment of more robust broadband speeds and access to continue creating additional market opportunities for us, the factors described above may result in negative pressure on revenue and operating income.\nCost of Sales\nAs a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased from 61.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 58.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to regional revenue shifts, changes in customer and product mix, changes in\nservices and support mix and a decrease in labor expense as a result of restructuring programs which were initiated in 2018 and continued throughout 2019.\nNetwork Solutions cost of sales, as a percent of that segment’s sales, decreased from 60.9% of sales in 2018 to 57.9% of sales in 2019. The decrease in Network Solutions cost of sales as a percentage of that segment’s sales was primarily attributable to regional\nrevenue shifts, changes in customer and product mix and a decrease in labor expense due to restructuring programs which were initiated in 2018 and continued throughout 2019, offset by an increase in freight and shipping charges.\nAn important part of our strategy is to reduce the cost of each succeeding generation of product and then lower the product’s selling price based on the cost savings achieved in order to gain market share and/or improve gross margins. This may cause variations in\nour gross profit percentage due to timing differences between the recognition of cost reductions and the lowering of product selling prices.\nServices & Support cost of sales, as a percent of that segment’s sales, decreased from 65.8% of sales in 2018 to 63.1% of sales in 2019. The decrease in Services & Support cost of sales as a percentage of that segment’s sales in 2019 was primarily attributable to\nlower fixed personnel costs due to restructuring programs which were initiated in 2018 and continued throughout 2019, changes in customer mix, changes in services support mix and an increase in volume.\nOur Services & Support revenue is comprised of network planning and implementation, maintenance, support and cloud-based management services, with network planning and implementation being the largest and fastest growing component in the long-\nterm. Compared to our other services, such as maintenance, support and cloud-based management services, our network planning and implementation services typically utilize a higher percentage of internal and subcontracted engineers, professionals and contractors\nto perform the work for customers. The additional costs incurred to perform these infrastructure and labor-intensive services inherently result in lower average gross margins as compared to maintenance and support services.\nAs our network planning and implementation revenue grew to become the largest component of our Services & Support segment business, our Services & Support segment gross margins decreased versus those reported when maintenance and support comprised the\nmajority of the business. Further, because the growth in our network planning and implementation services has resulted in our Services & Support segment revenue comprising a larger percentage of our overall revenue, and because our Services & Support segment\ngross margins are generally below those of the Network Solutions segment, our overall corporate gross margins may decline as that business continues to grow. Within the Services & Support segment, we do expect variability in gross margins from quarter-to-\nquarter based on the mix of the services recognized.\n39\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased from 23.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 24.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales will generally\nfluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenues for the periods being compared as these costs are relatively fixed in the short term.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by 4.7% from $124.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $130.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for\nadministration, finance, information technology, human resources, sales and marketing and general management, as well as rent, utilities, legal and accounting expenses, advertising, promotional material, trade show expenses and related travel costs. The increase in\nselling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to deferred compensation related costs, incremental expenses as a result of the SmartRG acquisition, IP litigation and other legal related costs, partially offset by decreases in labor expense and\nuse tax expense.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of sales increased from 23.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 23.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales will fluctuate whenever there\nare incremental product development activities or significant fluctuations in revenues for the periods being compared.\nResearch and development expenses increased by 1.3% from $124.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $126.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to increases\nin incremental expenses as a result of the SmartRG acquisition and lease expense offset by a decrease in labor expense, certain material engineering costs and contract services.\nWe expect to continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with our new and existing products and our expansion into international markets. We continually evaluate new product and market opportunities and engage in significant research and\ndevelopment efforts which provide for new product development, enhancement of existing products and product cost reductions. We may incur significant research and development expenses prior to the receipt of revenues from a major new product group.\nAsset Impairments\nAsset impairments, which were $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, relate to the abandonment of certain information technology implementation projects which we had previously capitalized costs for these projects. There were no asset impairments\nrecognized during the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 1 and Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nGain on Contingency\nGain on contingency, which was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, relates to the reversal of contingent liabilities which were initially recognized upon the acquisition of SmartRG in the fourth quarter of 2018. See Note 2 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information. There was no gain on contingency recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInterest and Dividend Income\nInterest and dividend income decreased by 31.3% from $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in interest and dividend income was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest\nincome. Our investments increased from $112.1 million as of December 31, 2018 to $127.7 million as of December 31, 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense, which is primarily related to our taxable revenue bond, remained constant at $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, as we had no substantial change in our fixed-rate borrowing. See “Financing Activities” in “Liquidity and\nCapital Resources” below for additional information on our taxable revenue bond.\n40\nNet Investment Gain (Loss)\nWe recognized a net investment loss of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and a net investment gain of $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The fluctuation in our net investment gain was primarily attributable to changes in fair\nvalue of equity securities recognized during the period. We expect that any future equity market volatility will result in continued volatility in gains or losses from our equity investment portfolios. See “Investing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and\nNote 1 and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net, which is comprised primarily of miscellaneous income, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, net periodic pension costs, investment account management fees and gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts,\nincreased 16.5% from income of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to income of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was primarily attributable to a gain on a life insurance recovery recognized in 2019 partially offset by\nlosses on foreign exchange contracts and transactions in 2019 as compared to foreign exchange gains in 2018.\nGain on Bargain Purchase of a Business\nGain on bargain purchase of a business is related to our acquisition of Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s North American EPON business and entry into a technology license and supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. in March 2018. See Note\n2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit\nOur effective tax rate increased from a benefit of 42.0%, excluding the tax effect of the bargain purchase gain, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to an expense of (113.9%) for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in the effective tax rate between the\ntwo periods was primarily driven by the establishment of a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets in the amount of $42.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, offset by a 15.5% rate reduction related to the generation of federal\nresearch and development credits, and a 16.7% rate reduction for the generation of foreign tax credits. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the above factors, our net loss increased from $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to a net loss of $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a percentage of sales, net loss increased from 3.7% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2018 to 10.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nWe have historically and we currently expect to finance our ongoing business with existing cash and cash flow from operations. We have used, and expect to continue to use, existing cash and cash generated from operations for working capital, business\nacquisitions, purchases of treasury stock, shareholder dividends and other general corporate purposes, including product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop new products, expansion of our sales and marketing activities and capital\nexpenditures. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations to be adequate to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.\nAs of December 31, 2019, cash on hand was $73.8 million and short-term investments were $33.2 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $107.0 million, of which $52.3 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, cash\non hand was $105.5 million and short-term investments were $3.2 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $108.7 million, of which $87.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. The decrease in short-term liquidity from December 31, 2018\nto December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to the use of cash for operating, investing and financing activities and income tax payments, offset by the reclassification of our certificate of deposit from long-term to short-term investments.\n41\nOperating Activities\nOur working capital, which consists of current assets less current liabilities, decreased 12.6% from $237.4 million as of December 31, 2018 to $207.6 million as of December 31, 2019. The current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities,\ndecreased from 3.01 as of December 31, 2018 to 2.84 as of December 31, 2019. The decrease in our working capital and current ratio was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, net accounts receivable and other receivables as described\nbelow. The quick ratio, defined as cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and net accounts receivable, divided by current liabilities, decreased from 1.76 as of December 31, 2018 to 1.75 as of December 31, 2019. The decrease in the quick ratio was\nprimarily attributable to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and net accounts receivable. This decrease was offset by an increase in short-term investments.\nNet accounts receivable decreased 8.91% from $99.4 million as of December 31, 2018 to $90.5 million as of December 31, 2019. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.1 million as of December 31, 2018 and $38 thousand as of December 31, 2019. Quarterly\naccounts receivable DSO increased from 65 days as of December 31, 2018 to 72 days as of December 31, 2019. The decrease in net accounts receivable and increase in DSO was attributable to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter, customer specific payment\nterms and other collections during the quarter.\nOther receivables decreased 54.9% from $36.7 million as of December 31, 2018 to $16.6 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease in other receivables was primarily attributable to a decrease in current lease payments receivable related to our sales-type\nleases, income tax receivables and purchasing shipments.\nAnnual inventory turnover increased from 2.93 turns as of December 31, 2018 to 3.14 turns as of December 31, 2019. Inventory decreased 1.6% from $99.8 million as of December 31, 2018 to $98.3 million as of December 31, 2019. We expect inventory levels to\nfluctuate as we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory in response to seasonal cycles of our business ensuring competitive lead times while managing the risk of excess inventory.\nAccounts payable decreased 25.3% from $60.1 million as of December 31, 2018 to $44.9 million as of December 31, 2019. Accounts payable will fluctuate due to variations in the timing of the receipt of supplies, inventory and services and our subsequent payments\nfor these purchases.\nInvesting Activities\nCapital expenditures totaled approximately $9.5 million, $8.1 million and $14.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These expenditures were primarily used to purchase computer hardware, software, manufacturing and test\nequipment and for building improvements.\nOur combined short-term and long-term investments increased $15.7 million from $112.1 million as of December 31, 2018 to $127.7 million as of December 31, 2019. This increase reflects the increase in fair market value of our equity investments.\nWe invest all available cash not required for immediate use in operations primarily in securities that we believe bear minimal risk of loss. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, U.S. government bonds, and foreign government bonds were classified as available-for-sale and had a combined duration of 1.71 years\nwith an average credit rating of AA. Because our bond portfolio has a high-quality rating and contractual maturities of short duration, we are able to obtain prices for these bonds derived from observable market inputs, or for similar securities traded in an active\nmarket, on a daily basis.\nOur long-term investments decreased 16.5% from $108.8 million as of December 31, 2018 to $94.5 million as of December 31, 2019. Long-term investments as of December 31, 2018 included an investment in a certificate of deposit of $25.6 million, which served\nas collateral for our revenue bonds. This certificate of deposit was included in short-term investments as of December 31, 2019, as these bonds matured on January 1, 2020, and were repaid in full on January 2, 2020. We also have investments in various marketable\nequity securities classified as long-term investments with a fair market value of $35.8 million and $27.0 million, as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Long-term investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 also included $21.7 million\nand $18.3 million, respectively, related to our deferred compensation plan, and $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of other investments, consisting of interests in two private equity funds.\nNo businesses were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2019. Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, totaled $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item\n8 of this report for additional information.\n42\nFinancing Activities\nIn conjunction with the 1995 expansion of our Huntsville, Alabama, facility, we were approved for participation in an incentive program offered by the State of Alabama Industrial Development Authority (“the Authority”). Pursuant to the program, on January 13,\n1995, the Authority issued $20.0 million of its taxable revenue bonds (the “Taxable Revenue Bonds”) and loaned the proceeds from the sale of the Taxable Revenue Bonds to ADTRAN. Further advances on the Taxable Revenue Bonds were made by the Authority,\nbringing the total amount outstanding to $50.0 million. The bonds matured on January 1, 2020, and the current outstanding balance of $24.6 million was repaid in full on January 2, 2020. We were required to make payments to the Authority in amounts necessary to\npay the interest on the Taxable Revenue Bonds which totaled $1.0 million, $1.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of\nthis report for additional information.\nDividends\nDuring 2019, 2018 and 2017, we paid shareholder dividends totaling $17.2 million, $17.3 million and $17.4 million, respectively. The Board of Directors presently anticipates that it will declare a regular quarterly dividend so long as the present tax treatment of\ndividends exists and adequate levels of liquidity are maintained. The following table shows dividends per common share paid to our shareholders in each quarter of 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nDividends per Common Share\n2019 2018 2017\nFirst Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nSecond Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nThird Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nFourth Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nStock Repurchase Program\nSince 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of our common stock, which are implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions\nwarrant. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we repurchased 13 thousand shares, 1.0 million shares and 0.9 million shares, respectively, for $0.2 million, $15.5 million and $17.3 million, respectively, at an average price of $14.06, $15.52 and\n$20.27 per share, respectively. We currently have authorization to repurchase an additional 2.5 million shares of our common stock under the current authorization of up to 5.0 million shares.\nStock Option Exercises\nTo accommodate employee stock option exercises, we issued 34 thousand shares of treasury stock for $0.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, 0.1 million shares of treasury stock for $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 0.7\nmillion shares of treasury stock for $13.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nEmployee Pension Plan\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan, covering employees in certain foreign countries. Pension benefit plan obligations are based on various assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates,\ncompensation rate increases, expected return on plan assets, retirement rates and mortality rates. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in assumptions could affect future expenses and obligations.\nOur defined benefit plan assets consist of a balanced portfolio of equity funds, bond funds, real estate funds and managed futures. Our investment policy includes various guidelines and procedures designed to ensure assets are invested in a manner necessary to meet\nexpected future benefits earned by participants and consider a broad range of economic conditions. Central to the policy are target allocation ranges by asset class, which is currently 50% for bond funds, 40% for equity funds and 10% cash, real estate and managed\nfutures. The objectives of the target allocations are to maintain investment portfolios that diversify risk through prudent asset allocation parameters, achieve asset returns that meet or exceed the plans’ actuarial assumptions and achieve asset returns that are\ncompetitive with like institutions employing similar investment strategies. The investment policy is periodically reviewed by us and a designated third-party fiduciary for investment matters. The policy is established and administered in a manner that is compliant at\nall times with applicable government regulations. At December 31, 2019, the estimated fair market value of our defined benefit pension plans assets increased to $28.0 million from $24.2 million at December 31, 2018.\n43\nThe defined benefit pension plan is accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the use of various assumptions, including an expected rate of return on plan assets and a discount rate. The expected return on our German plan assets that is utilized in\ndetermining the benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations, and\ncorrelations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return. The discount\nrate has been derived from the returns of high-quality, corporate bonds denominated in Euro currency with durations close to the duration of our pension obligations. The projected benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was $43.9 million and $37.2\nmillion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe components of net periodic pension cost, other than the service cost component, are included in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). The components of net periodic pension cost and amounts recognized in other\ncomprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $3.2 million, $6.1 million and $(0.2) million, respectively.\nActuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). To the extent unamortized gains and losses exceed 10% of the higher of the market-related value of assets or the projected benefit obligation, the excess is amortized as a\ncomponent of net periodic pension cost over the remaining service period of active participants. We estimate that $0.8 million will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic pension cost in 2020 for the net actuarial loss.\nThe net actuarial loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 2019 and 2018 was $(13.0) million and $(11.3) million, respectively.\nSee Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nWe do not have off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of, or\nrequirements for, capital resources.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have various contractual obligations and commercial commitments. The following table sets forth the annual payments we are required to make under contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2019:\n(In thousands) Total 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 After 2024\nBonds payable(1) $ 24,600 $ 24,600 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nPurchase obligations(2) 99,210 98,324 759 83 28 16 —\nOperating lease obligations(3) 8,879 2,856 2,412 1,705 1,160 482 264\nTotals $ 132,689 $ 125,780 $ 3,171 $ 1,788 $ 1,188 $ 498 $ 264\n(1) As of December 31, 2019, we were required to make payments necessary to pay the interest on the Taxable Revenue Bonds, which were outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $24.6 million as of December 31, 2019. The bonds had an interest rate of\n2% per annum and matured on January 1, 2020. Included in short-term investments as of December 31, 2019 was a certificate of deposit of $25.6 million, which served a collateral deposit against the principal amount of the bonds. See Note 12 of Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\n(2) Primarily relates to open purchase orders to our contract manufacturers, component suppliers, service partners and other vendors.\n(3) Primarily relates to future minimum rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases, including renewals determined to be reasonably assured, with original maturities of greater than 12 months.\nWe have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments. The additional $0.2 million commitment has been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of\nwhen it will be applied.\n44\nCertain contracts, customers and/or jurisdictions in which we do business require us to provide various guarantees of performance such as bid bonds, performance bonds and customs bonds. As of December 31, 2019, we had commitments related to these bonds\ntotaling $9.3 million, which expire at various dates through August 2024. Although the triggering events vary from contract to contract, in general we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in our performance under each\ncontract, the probability of which we believe is remote.\nWe also have obligations related to uncertain income tax positions that have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of when the related expense will be recognized. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II,\nItem 8 of this report for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the\naccounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the results of financial operations. Several accounting policies, as described in Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report, require\nmaterial subjective or complex judgment and have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as applicable. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the\npreparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a customer and as performance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied. Generally, this occurs with the transfer of\ncontrol of a product or service to the customer. For transactions where there are multiple performance obligations, we account for individual products and services separately if they are distinct (if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items and if a\ncustomer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer). The consideration, including any discounts, is allocated between separate products and services based on their stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone\nselling prices are determined based on the prices at which we sell the separate products and services and are allocated based on each item’s relative value to the total value of the products and services in the arrangement. For items that are not sold separately, we\nestimate stand-alone selling prices primarily using the “expected cost plus a margin” approach. Payment terms are generally 30 days in the U.S. and typically longer in many geographic markets outside the U.S. Shipping fees are recorded as revenue and the related\ncost is included in cost of sales. Sales, value-added and other taxes collected concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Costs of obtaining a contract are capitalized and amortized over the period that the related revenue is recognized\nif greater than one year. We have elected to apply the practical expedient related to the incremental costs of obtaining contracts and recognize those costs as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets is one year or less. These costs are included\nin selling, general and administrative expenses. Capitalized costs with an amortization period greater than one year were immaterial.\nThe following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate our revenue by reportable segment.\nNetwork Solutions Segment\nNetwork Solutions includes software and hardware products and software defined next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or business networks, as well as prior generation products. The majority of the revenue from this segment is from\nhardware sales.\nHardware and Software Revenue\nRevenue from hardware sales is recognized when control is transferred to our customers, which is generally when we ship the products. Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point. This segment also includes revenues from software license sales which is\nrecognized at delivery and transfer of control to the customer. Revenue is recorded net of estimated discounts and rebates using historical trends. Customers are typically invoiced when control is transferred and revenue is recognized. Our products generally include\nassurance-based warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects, which are accrued at the time revenue is recognized.\n45\nIn certain transactions, we are also the lessor in sales-type lease arrangements for network equipment that have terms of 18 months to five years. These arrangements typically include network equipment, network implementation services and maintenance services.\nProduct revenue for these leases is generally recorded when we transfer control of the product to our customers. Revenue for network implementation and maintenance services is recognized as described below. Customers are typically invoiced and pay in equal\ninstallments over the lease term. In relation to these lease agreements, during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 we recognized revenue of $1.7 million, $13.7 million and $16.5 million, respectively.\nServices & Support Segment\nTo complement our Network Solutions segment, we offer a complete portfolio of maintenance, network implementation, and solutions integration and managed services, which include hosted cloud services and subscription services.\nMaintenance Revenue\nOur maintenance service periods range from one month to five years. Customers are typically invoiced and pay for maintenance services at the beginning of the maintenance period. We recognize revenue for maintenance services on a straight-line basis over the\nmaintenance period in services revenue as our customers benefit evenly throughout the contract term and deferred revenues are recorded in current and non-current unearned revenue.\nNetwork Implementation Revenue\nWe recognize revenue for network implementation, which primarily consists of engineering, execution and enablement services, at a point in time when each performance obligation is complete. If we have recognized revenue, but have not billed the customer, the\nright to consideration is recognized as a contract asset that is included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when the completed performance obligation is invoiced to the customer.\nInventory\nWe carry our inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost being determined using the first-in, first-out method. Standard costs for material, labor, and manufacturing overhead are used to value inventory and are updated at least a quarterly. Any\nvariances are expensed in the current period, therefore, our inventory costs approximate actual costs at the end of each reporting period. We establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and\nthe estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on estimated reserve percentages, which consider historical usage, known trends, inventory age and marketing conditions. If actual trends and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by\nmanagement, we may be required to make additional inventory write-downs. Our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $34.1 million and $30.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Inventory disposals charged against the reserve were $1.8\nmillion, $0.4 million and $8.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nFor purposes of determining the estimated fair value of our stock option awards on the date of grant, we use the Black-Scholes Model. This model requires the input of certain assumptions that require subjective judgment. These assumptions include, but are not\nlimited to, expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. Because our stock option awards have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes\nin the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the existing model may not provide a reliable, single measure of the fair value of our stock option awards. For purposes of determining the estimated fair value of our market-based performance\nstock unit (PSU) awards on the date of grant, we use a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method. These PSUs are subject to a market condition based on the relative total shareholder return of ADTRAN against all of the companies in the NASDAQ\nTelecommunications Index and vest at the end of a three-year performance period. The fair value of performance-based PSUs, restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the business day immediately preceding the\ngrant date. Compensation expense related to unvested performance-based PSUs will be recognized over the requisite service period of three years as the achievement of the performance obligation becomes probable. Management will continue to assess the\nassumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation. Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and\nthereby materially impact our fair value determination. If factors change in future periods, the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period.\n46\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company records assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, when applicable, and intangible assets recognized as part of business combinations based on their fair values on the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the\nestimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the estimated fair values of net tangible and intangible assets acquired exceed the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recorded. The Company’s estimates of fair\nvalue are based on historical experience, industry knowledge, certain information obtained from the management of the acquired company and, in some cases, valuations performed by independent third-party firms. The results of operations of acquired companies\nare included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations since their dates of acquisition. Costs incurred to complete the business combination, such as legal, accounting, or other professional fees, are charged to general and administrative expenses\nas they are incurred.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more\nlikely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have elected to by-pass a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned is less\nthan its carrying amount and, in turn, performed a step-1 analysis of goodwill. Based on the results of our step-1 analysis, no impairment charges on goodwill were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nWe estimate our income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. We also make judgments regarding the realization of deferred tax assets and establish\nvaluation allowances where we believe it is more likely than not that future taxable income in certain jurisdictions will be insufficient to realize these deferred tax assets. Our estimates regarding future taxable income and income tax provision or benefit may vary\ndue to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws, or other factors. If our assumptions, and consequently our estimates, change in the future, the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased, impacting future income tax expense.\nWe continually review the adequacy of our valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes\n(ASC 740). Due to our recent decrease in revenue and profitability for 2019, and all other positive and negative objective evidence considered as part of our analysis, our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as projections for future growth is limited\nwhen evaluating whether our deferred tax assets will be realized. As such, the Company is no longer able to conclude that it is more likely than not that our domestic deferred tax assets will be realized and a valuation allowance against our Domestic deferred tax\nassets was established in the third quarter of 2019. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted in future periods in the event sufficient evidence is present to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or a\nportion of our domestic deferred tax assets will be realized.\nWe establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, as facts and circumstances\nchange.\nLiability for Warranty\nOur products generally include warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the time revenue is recognized based on our historical return rate and an estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products. We\nengage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. Our products continue to become more complex in both size and functionality as many of our product offerings\nmigrate from line card applications to total systems. The increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences, when they arise, to be more costly. Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material\nusage, and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise. Should our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will\nbe required to record additional warranty expense. Alternatively, if we provide for more reserves than we require, we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods. The liability for warranty obligations totaled $8.4 million and $8.6 million at December\n31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n47\nPension Benefit Obligations\nPension benefit plan obligations are based on various assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, compensation rate increases, expected return on plan assets, retirement rates and mortality rates. Actual\nresults that differ from the assumptions and changes in assumptions could affect future expenses and obligations. Our net pension liability totaled $15.9 million and $13.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This liability is included in pension\nliability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nSubsequent Events\nOn January 2, 2020, we paid off the outstanding balance of $24.6 million of the Taxable Revenue Bonds upon their maturity. We used a certificate of deposit which was held as collateral to repay the outstanding balance.\nOn February 5, 2020, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common share to be paid to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2020. The quarterly dividend payment will be paid on March 5, 2020 in the aggregate amount\nof approximately $4.3 million. In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity.\n48\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates and prices of marketable equity and fixed-income securities. The primary objective of the large majority of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at\nthe same time achieving appropriate yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, a majority of our marketable securities are investment grade, fixed-rate bonds and municipal money market instruments denominated in U.S. dollars. Our\ninvestment policy provides limitations for issuer concentration, which limits, at the time of purchase, the concentration in any one issuer to 5% of the market value of our total investment portfolio.\nWe maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions. Although these depository investments may exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit-worthiness of these financial institutions and determined the risk of\nmaterial financial loss due to exposure of such credit risk to be minimal. As of December 31, 2019, $71.6 million of our cash and cash equivalents, primarily certain domestic money market funds and foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government\nprovided insured depository limits.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately $39.0 million of our cash and investments may be directly affected by changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, we held $3.7 million of cash and variable-rate investments where a change in interest rates would\nimpact our interest income. A hypothetical 50 basis points (“bps”) decline in interest rates, assuming all other variables remain constant, as of December 31, 2019 would reduce annualized interest income on our cash and investments by approximately $19 thousand.\nIn addition, we held $35.3 million of fixed-rate bonds whose fair values may be directly affected by a change in interest rates. A hypothetical 50 bps increase in interest rates, assuming all other variables remain constant, as of December 31, 2019 would reduce the\nfair value of our fixed-rate bonds by approximately $0.3 million.\nWe are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent that such changes affect our revenue and gross margin on revenue derived from some international customers, expenses and assets and liabilities held in non-functional currencies related to\nour foreign subsidiaries. Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements are with our German subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Euro, and our Australian subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Australian dollar. Our revenue is\nprimarily denominated in the respective functional currency of the subsidiary and paid in that subsidiary’s functional currency or certain other local currency, our global supply chain predominately invoices us in the respective functional currency of the subsidiary\nand is paid in U.S. dollars and some of our operating expenses are invoiced and paid in certain local currencies (approximately 13% of total operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2019). Therefore, our revenues, gross margins, operating expense and\noperating income are all subject to foreign currency fluctuations. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates could cause variations in our operating income.\nWe have certain international customers who are invoiced or pay in a non-functional currency. Changes in the monetary exchange rates used to invoice such customers versus the functional currency of the entity billing such customers may adversely affect our\nresults of operations and financial condition. To manage the volatility relating to these typical business exposures, we may enter into various derivative transactions, when appropriate. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative\npurposes. All non-functional currencies billed would result in a combined hypothetical gain or loss of $1.2 million if the U.S. dollar weakened or strengthened 10% against the billing currencies. This change represents a decrease in the amount of hypothetical gain or\nloss compared to prior periods and is mainly due to a decrease in U.S. dollar-denominated billings in a non-U.S. dollar denominated subsidiary. Although we do not currently hold any derivative instruments, any gain or loss would be partially mitigated by any\nderivative instruments held.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had certain material contracts subject to currency revaluation, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and lease liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any forward contracts\noutstanding.\nFor further information about the fair value of our available-for-sale investments and our derivative and hedging activities as of December 31, 2019, see Notes 5 and 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\n49\nITEM 8.

Also in our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO because a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed as of that date related to ineffective controls over the\nCompany’s determination of its estimated reserve for excess and obsolete inventory.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on\na timely basis. The material weakness referred to above is described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. We considered this material weakness in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests\napplied in our audit of the 2019 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in\nmanagement's report referred to above. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due\nto error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable\nbasis for our opinions.\n51\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of\nthe company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes\nin conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that\nare material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nExcess and Obsolete Inventory Reserve\nAs described in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated net inventory and inventory reserves as of December 31, 2019 were $98.3 million and $34.1 million, respectively. Management establishes reserves for estimated\nexcess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on estimated reserve percentages, which consider historical usage, known trends, inventory age, and market\nconditions.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the excess and obsolete inventory reserve is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management in estimating the excess and obsolete inventory reserve,\nwhich in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used in developing the reserve, including the estimated reserve percentages. As described in the\n\"Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\" section, a material weakness was identified as of December 31, 2019 related to ineffective controls over the Company’s determination of its estimated reserve for excess and\nobsolete inventory.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, testing management’s process for developing\nthe excess and obsolete inventory reserve; evaluating the appropriateness of the approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach, including historical usage and inventory age; and evaluating the reasonableness of the\nestimated reserve percentages used by management to determine the excess and obsolete inventory reserve. Evaluating the reasonableness of the estimated reserve percentages involved assessing whether they were consistent with the historical data and evidence\nobtained in other areas of the audit.\n/s/

(“ADTRAN” or the “Company”) is a leading global provider of networking and communications solutions. Our vision is to enable a fully connected world where the power to communicate is available to everyone, everywhere. Our unique approach,\nunmatched industry expertise and innovative solutions enable us to address almost any customer need. Our products and services are utilized by a diverse global customer base of network operators that range from those having national or regional reach, operating as\ntelephone or cable television network operators, to alternative network providers such as municipalities or utilities, as well as managed service providers who serve small- and medium-sized businesses and distributed enterprises.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in\nequity and cash flows of ADTRAN and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our more significant estimates include excess and obsolete inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates, determination and accrual of the deferred revenue\ncomponents of multiple element sales agreements, estimated costs to complete obligations associated with deferred revenues and network installations, estimated income tax provision and income tax contingencies, fair value of stock-based compensation,\nassessment of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment, estimated lives of intangible assets, estimated pension liability, fair value of investments and evaluation of other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments. Actual amounts could differ\nsignificantly from these estimates.\nCorrection of Immaterial Misstatement\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company determined that there was an immaterial misstatement of its excess and obsolete inventory reserves in its previously issued annual and interim financial statements. The Company corrected this\nmisstatement by recognizing a $0.8 million out-of-period adjustment during the three months ended June 30, 2019, which increased its excess and obsolete inventory reserves and cost of goods sold for the period. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, the out-of-\nperiod adjustment was a cumulative $0.2 million reduction in the Company’s excess and obsolete inventory reserves and cost of goods sold.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents represent demand deposits, money market funds and short-term investments classified as available-for-sale with original maturities of three months or less. We maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions. Although\nthese depository investments may exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit worthiness of these applicable financial institutions and determined the risk of material financial loss due to the exposure of such credit risk to be minimal.\nAs of December 31, 2019, $71.6 million of our cash and cash equivalents, primarily certain domestic money market funds and foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government provided insured depository limits.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying amount\nreported for bonds payable was $24.6 million, which was its fair value as of December 31, 2019.\nInvestments with contractual maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Despite the long-term nature\nof their stated contractual maturities, we routinely buy and sell these securities and we believe we have the ability to quickly sell them to the remarketing agent, tender agent or issuer at par value plus accrued interest in the event we decide to liquidate our investment\nin a particular variable rate demand note. All income generated from these investments was recorded as interest income. We have not recorded any losses relating to variable rate demand notes.\n58\nLong-term investments is comprised of deferred compensation plan assets, corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, U.S. and foreign government bonds, marketable equity securities and other equity\ninvestments. Marketable equity securities are reported at fair value as determined by the most recently traded price of the securities at the balance sheet date, although the securities may not be readily marketable due to the size of the available market. Any changes\nin fair value are recognized in net investment gain (loss). Realized gains and losses on sales of debt securities are computed under the specific identification method and are included in other income (expense). See Note 5 for additional information.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe record accounts receivable at net realizable value. Prior to establishing payment terms for a new customer, we evaluate the credit risk of the customer. Credit limits and payment terms established for new customers are re-evaluated periodically based on\ncustomer collection experience and other financial factors. As of December 31, 2019, single customers comprising more than 10% of our total accounts receivable balance included four customers, which accounted for 53.2% of our total accounts receivable. As of\nDecember 31, 2018, single customers comprising more than 10% of our total accounts receivable balance included two customers, which accounted for 36.9% of our total accounts receivable.\nWe regularly review the need to maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and consider factors such as the age of accounts receivable balances, the current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay, significant one-time events impacting\nthese customers and our historical experience. If the financial condition of a customer deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, we may be required to record an allowance for doubtful accounts. If circumstances change with regard to\nindividual receivable balances that have previously been determined to be uncollectible, and for which a specific reserve has been established, a reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts may be required. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $38\nthousand and $0.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nInventory\nInventory is carried at the lower of cost and estimated net realizable value, with cost being determined using the first-in, first-out method. Standard costs for material, labor and manufacturing overhead are used to value inventory and are updated at least quarterly.\nWe establish reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on estimated reserve percentages, which consider historical usage, known trends,\ninventory age and market conditions. When we dispose of excess and obsolete inventories, the related disposals are charged against the inventory reserve. See Note 7 for additional information.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment, which is stated at cost, is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We depreciate building and land improvements from five to 39 years, office machinery and equipment from three to\nseven years, engineering machinery and equipment from three to seven years, and computer software from three to five years. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Major improvements that materially prolong the lives of the\nassets are capitalized. Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are recorded in operating income (loss). See Note 8 for additional information.\nIntangible Assets\nPurchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which is two to 14 years. See Note 11 for additional information.\n59\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles\nLong-lived assets used in operations and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by\nthe asset are less than the asset’s carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized in the amount by which the recorded value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, measured by the quoted market price of an asset or an estimate based on the best\ninformation available in the circumstances. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized an impairment loss of approximately $3.9 million related to the abandonment of certain information technology implementation projects which we had previously\ncapitalized expenses related to these projects. There were no impairment losses for long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017, or for intangible assets recognized during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more\nlikely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have elected to by-pass a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned is less\nthan its carrying amount and, in turn, performed a step-1 analysis of goodwill. Based on the results of our step-1 analysis, no impairment charges on goodwill were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nLiability for Warranty\nOur products generally include warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the time revenue is recognized based on our historical return rate and estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products. We engage\nin extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. The increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences, when they arise, to be more costly. Our estimates\nregarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise.\nShould our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to record additional warranty expense. Alternatively, if we provide for more reserves than we require, we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future\nperiods. The liability for warranty obligations totaled $8.4 million and $8.6 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. During 2017, we recorded a\nreduction in warranty expense related to a settlement with a third-party supplier for a defective component, the impact of which is reflected in the following table.\nA summary of warranty expense and write-off activity for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018 2017\nYear Ended December 31,\nBalance at beginning of period $ 8,623 $ 9,724 $ 8,548\nPlus: Amounts charged to cost and expenses 4,569 7,392 6,951\nLess: Deductions (4,798) (8,493) (5,775)\nBalance at end of period $ 8,394 $ 8,623 $ 9,724\nPension Benefit Plan Obligations\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries. Pension benefit plan obligations are based on various assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates,\ncompensation rate increases, expected return on plan assets, retirement rates and mortality rates. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in assumptions could affect future expenses and obligations. Our net pension liability totaled $15.9 million\nand $13.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n60\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have two stock incentive plans from which stock options, performance stock units (“PSUs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock are available for grant to employees and directors. Costs related to these awards are recognized over their vesting\nperiods. All employee and director stock options granted under our stock option plans have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the award, as defined in the plan, of the underlying common stock on the grant date. All of our outstanding stock option\nawards are classified as equity awards and therefore are measured at fair value on their grant date.\nStock-based compensation expense recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $7.0 million, $7.2 million and $7.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-\nvested stock options, PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock was approximately $17.2 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 3.0 years. See Note 4 for additional information.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs include compensation for engineers and support personnel, outside contracted services, depreciation and material costs associated with new product development, enhancement of current products and product cost reductions. We\ncontinually evaluate new product opportunities and engage in intensive research and product development efforts. Research and development costs totaled $126.2 million, $124.5 million and $130.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017,\nrespectively.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe following table presents changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, by components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2019 2018 and 2017:\nUnrealized\nGains (Losses)\non Available- Unrealized Gains Defined Foreign\n(In thousands)\nSf eo cr u-S ria til ee\ns\n(Losses)\nH\no en\nd\ngC ea ssh Flow AB den jue sfi tt\nm\nP el na tn\ns\nAC dju ur sr te mn ec ny\nts\nASU 2018- (0 22\n)\nAdoption\nTotal\nBalance as of December 31, 2016 $ 404 $ — $ (5,017) $ (7,575) $ — $ (12,188)\nOther comprehensive income before\nreclassifications 5,020 (619) 451 5,999 — 10,851\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss (2,857) 619 280 — — (1,958)\nBalance as of December 31, 2017 2,567 — (4,286) (1,576) — (3,295)\nOther comprehensive loss before\nreclassifications 685 — (3,890) (4,236) — (7,441)\nAmounts reclassified to retained earnings (1) (3,220) — — — — (3,220)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss (595) — 135 — — (460)\nBalance as of December 31, 2018 (563) — (8,041) (5,812) — (14,416)\nOther comprehensive loss before\nreclassifications 573 — (1,717) (1,480) — (2,624)\nAmounts reclassified to retained earnings (1) — — — — 385 385\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss (294) — 532 — — 238\nBalance as of December 31, 2019 $ (284) $ — $ (9,226) $ (7,292) $ 385 $ (16,417)\n(1) With the adoption of ASU 2016-01, the unrealized gains on our equity investments were reclassified to retained earnings.

Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities\nare recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from the difference between financial and tax bases of our assets and liabilities\nand are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when such changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.\nWe establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, as facts and circumstances\nchange.\nForeign Currency\nWe record transactions denominated in foreign currencies using appropriate exchange rates from throughout the year. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the balance sheet dates using the closing rates of exchange between\nthose foreign currencies and the functional currency with any transaction gains or losses reported in other income (expense). Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements are with our German subsidiary, whose functional currency is the\nEuro, our Australian subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Australian dollar and our Mexican subsidiary, whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar as most invoices are paid in Mexican Pesos. Adjustments resulting from translating financial statements of\ninternational subsidiaries are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nRevenue\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.\nAccounting Policy under Topic 606\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a customer and as performance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied. Generally, this occurs with the transfer of\ncontrol of a product to the customer. Review of contracts with customers, for both direct customers and distributors, are performed and assessment made regarding principal versus agent considerations to determine primary responsibility for delivery of performance\nobligation, presumed inventory risk, and discretion in establishing pricing. For transactions where there are multiple performance obligations, we account for individual products and services separately if they are distinct (if a product or service is separately\nidentifiable from other items and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer). The consideration, including any discounts, is allocated between separate products and services based on their stand-\nalone selling prices. Stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which we sell the separate products and services and are allocated based on each item’s relative value to the total value of the products and services in the arrangement. For items\nthat are not sold separately, we estimate stand-alone selling prices primarily using the “expected cost plus a margin” approach. Payment terms are generally 30 days in the U.S. and typically longer in many geographic markets outside the U.S. Shipping fees are\nrecorded as revenue and the related cost is included in cost of sales. Sales, value-added and other taxes collected concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Costs of obtaining a contract, if material, are capitalized and amortized over\nthe period that the related revenue is recognized if greater than one year. We have elected to account for shipping fees as a cost of fulfilling the related contract. We have also elected to apply the practical expedient related to the incremental costs of obtaining\ncontracts and recognize those costs as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets is one year or less. These costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Capitalized costs with an amortization period greater than one year\nwere immaterial.\nThe following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate our revenue by reportable segment.\nNetwork Solutions Segment\nNetwork Solutions includes hardware products and software defined next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or business networks, as well as prior generation products. The majority of the revenue from this segment is from hardware sales.\n64\nHardware and Software Revenue\nRevenue from hardware sales is recognized when control is transferred to our customers, which is generally when we ship the products. Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point. This segment also includes revenues from software license sales which is\nrecognized at delivery and transfer of control to the customer. Revenue is recorded net of estimated discounts and rebates using historical trends. Customers are typically invoiced when control is transferred and revenue is recognized. Our products generally include\nassurance-based warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects, which are accrued at the time revenue is recognized.\nIn certain transactions, we are also the lessor in sales-type lease arrangements for network equipment that have terms of 18 months to five years. These arrangements typically include network equipment, network implementation services and maintenance services.\nServices & Support Segment\nTo complement our Network Solutions segment, we offer a complete portfolio of maintenance, network implementation and solutions integration and managed services, which include hosted cloud services and subscription services.\nMaintenance Revenue\nOur maintenance service periods range from one month to five years. Customers are typically invoiced and pay for maintenance services at the beginning of the maintenance period. We recognize revenue for maintenance services on a straight-line basis over the\nmaintenance period as our customers benefit evenly throughout the contract term and deferred revenues, when applicable, are recorded in current and non-current unearned revenue.\nNetwork Implementation Revenue\nWe recognize revenue for network implementation, which primarily consists of engineering, execution and enablement services at a point in time when each performance obligation is complete. If we have recognized revenue but have not billed the customer, the\nright to consideration is recognized as a contract asset that is included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when the completed performance obligation is invoiced to the customer.\nAccounting Policy under Topic 605\nRevenue was generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the product price was fixed or determinable, collection of the resulting receivable was reasonably assured, and product returns were reasonably estimable.\nFor product sales, revenue was generally recognized upon shipment of the product to our customer in accordance with the title transfer terms of the sales agreement, generally Ex Works, per International Commercial Terms. In the case of consigned inventory,\nrevenue was recognized when the end customer assumes ownership of the product. Contracts that contained multiple deliverables were evaluated to determine the units of accounting, and the consideration from the arrangement was allocated to each unit of\naccounting based on the relative selling price and corresponding terms of the contract. When this was not available, we were generally not able to determine third-party evidence of selling price because of the extent of customization among competing products or\nservices from other companies. In these instances, we used best estimates to allocate consideration to each respective unit of accounting. These estimates included analysis of respective bills of material and review and analysis of similar product and service\nofferings. We recorded revenue associated with installation services when respective contractual obligations are complete. In instances where customer acceptance was required, revenue was deferred until respective acceptance criteria were met. Contracts that\nincluded both installation services and product sales were evaluated for revenue recognition in accordance with contract terms. As a result, installation services may have been considered a separate deliverable or may have been considered a combined single unit of\naccounting with the delivered product. Generally, either the purchaser, ADTRAN, or a third party would perform the installation of our products. Shipping fees were recorded as revenue and the related costs were included in cost of sales. Sales taxes invoiced to\ncustomers were included in revenues and represented less than one percent of total revenues. The corresponding sales taxes paid were included in cost of goods sold. Value-added taxes collected from customers in international jurisdictions were recorded in accrued\nexpenses as a liability. Revenue was recorded net of discounts. Sales returns were recorded as a reduction of revenue and accrued based on historical sales return experience, which we believed provided a reasonable estimate of future returns.\n65\nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue primarily represents customer billings on our maintenance service programs and unearned revenues related to multiple element contracts where we still have contractual obligations to our customers. We currently offer maintenance contracts\nranging from one month to five years. Revenue attributable to maintenance contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over the related contract term. In addition, we provide software maintenance and a variety of hardware maintenance services to customers\nunder contracts with terms up to ten years. When we defer revenue related to multiple performance obligations where we still have contractual obligations, we also defer the related costs. Current deferred costs are included in prepaid expenses and other current\nassets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $1.6 million and $2.4 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Non-current deferred costs are included in other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and\ntotaled $0.1 million and $0.8 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nEarnings (Loss) per Share\nEarnings (loss) per common share and earnings (loss) per common share assuming dilution, are based on the weighted average number of common shares and, when dilutive, common equivalent shares outstanding during the year. See Note 17 for additional\ninformation.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company records assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, when applicable, and intangible assets recognized as part of business combinations based on their fair values on the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the\nestimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the estimated fair values of net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceed the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain\nis recorded. The Company’s estimates of fair value are based on historical experience, industry knowledge, certain information obtained from the management of the acquired company and, in some cases, valuations performed by independent third-party firms. The\nresults of operations of acquired companies are included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations since their dates of acquisition. Costs incurred to complete the business combination, such as legal, accounting or other professional fees are\ncharged to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nHistorically, we have participated in foreign exchange forward contracts in connection with the management of exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as outlined below.\nCash Flow Hedges\nOur cash flow hedging activities utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the planned purchase of products from foreign suppliers. Purchases of U.S.\ndenominated inventory by our European subsidiary represent our primary exposure. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts related to cash flow hedges are\nreclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings. This reclassification is recorded in the same line item of the consolidated statements of income as where the effects of the hedged item are\nrecorded, which is cost of sales.\nUndesignated Hedges\nWe have certain customers and suppliers who are invoiced or pay in a non-functional currency. Changes in the monetary exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, as outstanding non-functional balances are revalued to the\nfunctional currency through earnings. When appropriate, we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to help manage the volatility relating to these valuation exposures. All changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments that do not qualify for, or are not\ndesignated for, hedged accounting transactions are recognized in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Our derivative instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. Our derivative instruments are not subject to master netting arrangements and\nare not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n66\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 requires the\nmeasurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial instruments held at amortized cost. In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326 Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, that clarifies receivables\narising from operating leases are not within the scope of the credit losses standard, but rather should be accounted for in accordance with the leases standard. In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial\nInstruments–Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments, which clarifies the accounting for transfers between classifications of debt securities and clarifies that entities should include expected recoveries on financial\nassets in the calculation of the current expected credit loss allowance. In addition, renewal options that are not unconditionally cancelable should be considered in the determination of expected credit losses. In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial\nInstruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief, which amends ASU 2016-13 to allow companies, upon adoption, to elect the fair value option on financial instruments that were previously recorded at amortized cost if they meet certain criteria.\nIn November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-11, Codification improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, which makes various narrow-scope amendments to the new credit losses standard, such as, providing disclosure relief for accrued\ninterest receivables. All of these ASUs are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect these ASUs will have on our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. ASU 2017-04 simplifies the measurement of goodwill by eliminating step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. Under ASU\n2017-04, entities will be required to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or\ninterim impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for annual or interim impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively. We are\ncurrently evaluating ASU 2017-04, but do not expect it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which changes the fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASC 820,\nFair Value Measurement. The amendments in this ASU are the result of a broader disclosure project, Concepts Statement No. 8 — Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting — Chapter 8 — Notes to Financial Statements, which the FASB finalized on August\n28, 2018. The FASB used the guidance in the Concepts Statement to improve the effectiveness of ASC 820’s disclosure requirements. ASU 2018-13 provides users of financial statements with information about assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the\nstatement of financial position or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. More specifically, ASU 2018-13 requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs that are used to arrive at measures of fair value, including judgments and assumptions\nthat are made in determining fair value. In addition, ASU 2018-13 requires disclosures regarding the uncertainty in the fair value measurements as of the reporting date and how changes in fair value measurements affect performance and cash flows. ASU 2018-13 is\neffective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the effect of ASU 2018-13, but do not expect it will have a material effect on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans, which makes changes to and clarifies\nthe disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. ASU 2018-14 requires additional disclosures related to the reasons for significant gains and losses affecting the benefit obligation and an explanation of any other\nsignificant changes in the benefit obligation or plan assets that are not otherwise apparent in other disclosures required by ASC 715. ASU 2018-14 also clarifies the guidance in ASC 715 to require disclosure of the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) and fair value\nof plan assets for pension plans with PBOs in excess of plan assets and the accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with ABOs in excess of plan assets. ASU 2018-14 is effective for public business entities for fiscal\nyears ending after December 15, 2020. We are currently evaluating the effect of ASU 2018-14, but do not expect it will have a material effect on our financial statement disclosures.\n67\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. ASU 2018-15\nclarifies certain aspects of ASU 2015-05, Customer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. Specifically, ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract\nwith the requirements for capitalizing implementations costs incurred to develop or obtain internal use software. ASU 2018-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption\npermitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of ASU 2018-15, but do not expect it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The amendments in this update simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing various exceptions, such as, the exception to the\nincremental approach for intra-period tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income or a gain from other items. The amendments in this update, also simplify the accounting for income taxes related to income-based franchise taxes and\nrequiring that an entity reflect enacted tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after\nDecember 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of ASU 2019-12, but do not expect it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nDuring 2019, we adopted the following accounting standards, which had the following impacts on our consolidated financial statements:\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires an entity to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity’s leasing arrangements. In July 2018, the FASB\nissued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, which clarified certain aspects of ASU 2016-02, as well as ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements, which provided for an optional transition method allowing for the\napplication of the legacy lease guidance, Leases (Topic 840), including its disclosure requirements, for the comparative periods presented in the year of adoption, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new lease standard recognized as an adjustment to\nretained earnings as of the date of adoption. In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842) Codification Improvements, which removed the requirement for an entity to disclose in the interim periods after adoption, the effect of the change on\nincome from continuing operations, net income, any other affected financial statement line item and any affected per share amount. For lessors, the new leasing standard requires leases to be classified as sales-type, direct financing or operating leases. These criteria\nfocus on the transfer of control of the underlying lease asset. This standard, and its related updates, were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.\nThe Company adopted the new standard on January 1, 2019, the effective date of our initial application, using the optional transition method. At that time, the Company elected to carry forward the legacy ASC 840 disclosures for comparative periods and, therefore,\ndid not adjust the comparative period financial information prior to January 1, 2019. In addition, the Company elected the package of practical expedients which allows for companies to not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, not\nreassess historical lease classifications for expired or existing contracts and not reassess initial direct costs for existing leases. Additionally, the Company elected the practical expedients which allow the use of hindsight when determining the lease term, the short-\nterm lease recognition exemption and the option to not separate lease and nonlease components. The adoption of this standard resulted in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and corresponding right-of-use liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets of $10.3\nmillion as of January 1, 2019, primarily related to our operating leases for office space, automobiles and other equipment.\nAs a lessee, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Statement of Income or Statement of Cash Flows. See Note 9 for additional information.\nAs a lessor, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Income or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Prior to and after adoption, all of our leases in which we are the lessor were\nclassified as sales-type leases.\n68\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-08, Receivables – Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities, which shortened the amortization period for the premium on certain purchased\ncallable debt securities to the earliest call date. ASU 2017-08 was effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The amendments were required to be applied through a modified-retrospective transition\napproach that required a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company adopted ASU 2017-08 on January 1, 2019, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. ASU 2017-12 expanded and refined hedge accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components,\naligned the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedge items in the financial statements, and included certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of hedge effectiveness. In\nOctober 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) Overnight Index Swap (“OIS”) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting, which permits the OIS\nrate based on SOFR as a U.S. benchmark interest rate. Both ASU 2017-12 and ASU 2018-16 were effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted ASU 2017-12 on January 1, 2019,\nand the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements as we did not have any hedging instruments as of the date of adoption.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Comprehensive Income. ASU 2018-02 allowed for an optional reclassification from\naccumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. ASU 2018-02 was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2018-02 on January 1, 2019, and upon adoption reclassified $0.4 million of stranded tax effects created by rate changes related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to retained earnings.\nNote 2 – Business Combinations\nIn November 2018, we acquired SmartRG, Inc., a provider of carrier-class, open-source connected home platforms and cloud services for broadband service providers for cash consideration. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination. We have\nincluded the financial results of this acquisition in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. These revenues are included in the Subscriber Solutions & Experience category within the Network Solutions and Services & Support reportable\nsegments.\nContingent liabilities with a fair value totaling $1.2 million were recognized at the acquisition date, the payments of which were dependent upon SmartRG achieving future revenue, EBIT or customer purchase order milestones during the first half of 2019. The\nrequired milestones were not achieved and therefore, we recognized a gain of $1.2 million upon the reversal of these liabilities during the second quarter of 2019.\nAn escrow in the amount of $2.8 million was set up at the acquisition date to fund post-closing working capital settlements and to satisfy indemnity obligations to the Company arising from any inaccuracy or breach of representations, warranties, covenants,\nagreements or obligations of the sellers. The escrow is subject to arbitration. In December 2019, $1.3 million of the $2.8 million was released from the escrow account pursuant to the agreement, with the final settlement of the remaining balance expected during the\nfourth quarter of 2020. The remaining minimum and maximum potential release of funds to the seller ranges from no payment to $1.5 million.\nWe recorded goodwill of $3.5 million as a result of this acquisition, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We assessed the recognition and measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed based on historical and forecasted data for future periods and concluded that our valuation procedures and resulting measures were appropriate.\nOn March 19, 2018, we acquired Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s (SEL) North American EPON business and entered into a technology license and OEM supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. (SEI). This acquisition establishes ADTRAN\nas the North American market leader for EPON solutions for the cable MSO industry and it will accelerate the MSO market’s adoption of our open, programmable and scalable architectures. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination. We have\nincluded the financial results of this acquisition in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. These revenues are included in the Access & Aggregation and Subscriber Solutions & Experience categories within the Network Solutions\nreportable segment.\n69\nWe recorded a bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, net of income taxes, which is subject to customary working capital adjustments between the parties. The bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million represents the difference between\nthe fair-value of the net assets acquired over the cash paid. SEI, an OEM supplier based in Japan, is the global market leader in EPON. SEI’s Broadband Networks Division, through its SEL subsidiary, operated a North American EPON business that included sales,\nmarketing, support, and region-specific engineering development. The North American EPON market is primarily driven by the Tier 1 cable MSO operators and has developed more slowly than anticipated. Through the transaction, SEI divested its North American\nEPON assets and established a relationship with ADTRAN. The transfer of these assets to ADTRAN, which included key customer relationships and a required assumption by ADTRAN of relatively low incremental expenses, along with the value of the technology\nlicense and OEM supply agreement, resulted in the bargain purchase gain. We have assessed the recognition and measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on historical and forecasted data for future periods and we have concluded that our\nvaluation procedures and resulting measures were appropriate. The gain is included in the line item ”Gain on bargain purchase of a business” in the 2018 Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe final allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date for SmartRG and the final allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed at the acquisition date for Sumitomo are as follows:\n(In thousands) Sumitomo SmartRG\nAssets\nTangible assets acquired $ 1,006 $ 8,594\nIntangible assets 22,100 9,960\nGoodwill — 3,476\nTotal assets acquired 23,106 22,030\nLiabilities\nLiabilities assumed (3,978) (6,001)\nTotal liabilities assumed (3,978) (6,001)\nTotal net assets 19,128 16,029\nGain on bargain purchase of a business, net of tax (11,322) —\nTotal purchase price $ 7,806 $ 16,029\nOur Consolidated Statements of Income include the following revenue and net loss attributable to SmartRG and Sumitomo since the date of acquisition:\nMarch 19, 2018 to\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands) 2018\nRevenue $ 9,186\nNet loss $ (1,297)\nThe details of the acquired intangible assets from the SmartRG and Sumitomo acquisitions are as follows:\n(In thousands) Value Life (in years)\nCustomer relationships $ 15,190 3 - 12\nDeveloped technology 7,400 7\nLicensed technology 5,900 9\nSupplier relationship 2,800 2\nLicensing agreements 560 5 - 10\nTrade name 210 3\nTotal $ 32,060\n70\nThe following unaudited supplemental pro forma information presents the financial results as if the acquisition of SmartRG and Sumitomo had occurred on January 1, 2017. This unaudited supplemental pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of\nwhat would have occurred had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2017, nor is it indicative of any future results. Aside from revising the 2017 net income for the effect of the bargain purchase gains, there were no material, non-recurring adjustments to this\nunaudited pro-forma information.\n(In thousands) 2018 2017\nPro forma revenue $ 559,050 $ 702,573\nPro forma net loss $ (33,862) $ 33,206\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred acquisition and integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles of $5.0 million and $2.9 million, respectively, related to the SmartRG and Sumitomo acquisitions. No acquisition\nexpenses related to the SmartRG and Sumitomo acquisitions were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNote 3 - Revenue\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by major source for the year ended December 31, 2019:\n(In thousands) Network Solutions Services & Support Total\nAccess & Aggregation $ 289,980 $ 58,894 $ 348,874\nSubscriber Solutions & Experience(1) 144,651 8,269 152,920\nTraditional & Other Products 20,595 7,672 28,267\nTotal $ 455,226 $ 74,835 $ 530,061\n(1) Subscriber Solutions & Experience was formerly reported as Customer Devices.

With the increasing focus on enhancing the customer experience for both our business and consumer broadband customers and the addition of SmartRG during the\nfourth quarter of 2018, Subscriber Solutions & Experience more accurately represents this revenue category.\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contract revenues that have not yet been recognized for contracts with a duration greater than one year. As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any significant performance obligations related to\ncustomer contracts that had an original expected duration of one year or more, other than maintenance services, which are satisfied over time. As a practical expedient, for certain contracts recognize revenue equal to the amounts we are entitled to invoice which\ncorrespond to the value of completed performance obligations to date. The amount related to these performance obligations was $13.3 million as of December 31, 2018. The amount related to these performance obligations was $13.6 million as of December 31,\n2019, and the Company expects to recognize 64% of such revenue over the next 12 months with the remainder thereafter.\n71\nThe following table provides information about accounts receivables, contract assets and unearned revenue from contracts with customers:\n(In thousands) December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018\nAccounts receivable $ 90,531 $ 99,385\nContract assets(1) $ 2,812 $ 3,766\nUnearned revenue $ 11,963 $ 17,940\nNon-current unearned revenue $ 6,012 $ 5,296\n(1) Included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nOf the outstanding unearned revenue balance as of December 31, 2018, $12.7 million was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNote 4 – Stock-Based Compensation\nStock Incentive Program Descriptions\nIn January 2006, the Board of Directors adopted the ADTRAN, Inc. 2006 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”), which authorized 13.0 million shares of common stock for issuance to certain employees and officers through incentive stock options and\nnon-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs and restricted stock. The 2006 Plan was adopted by stockholder approval at our annual meeting of stockholders held in May 2006. Options granted under the 2006 Plan typically become exercisable\nbeginning after one year of continued employment, normally pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and had a ten-year contractual term. The 2006 Plan was replaced in May 2015 by the ADTRAN, Inc. 2015\nEmployee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”). Expiration dates of options outstanding as of December 31, 2019 under the 2006 Plan range from 2020 to 2024.\nIn January 2015, the Board of Directors adopted the 2015 Plan, which authorized 7.7 million shares of common stock for issuance to certain employees and officers through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, PSUs,\nRSUs and restricted stock. The 2015 Plan was adopted by stockholder approval at our annual meeting of stockholders held in May 2015. PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock granted under the 2015 Plan reduce the shares authorized for issuance under the 2015 Plan by\n2.5 shares of common stock for each share underlying the award. Options granted under the 2015 Plan typically become exercisable beginning after one year of continued employment, normally pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning on the first\nanniversary of the grant date and have a ten-year contractual term. Expiration dates of options outstanding as of December 31, 2019 under the 2015 Plan range from 2025 to 2026.\nOur stockholders approved the 2010 Directors Stock Plan (the “2010 Directors Plan”) in May 2010, under which 0.5 million shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance. This plan replaced the 2005 Directors Stock Option Plan. Under the 2010\nDirectors Plan, the Company may issue stock options, restricted stock and RSUs to our non-employee directors. Stock awards issued under the 2010 Directors Plan become vested in full on the first anniversary of the grant date. Options issued under the 2010\nDirectors Plan had a ten-year contractual term. All remaining options under the 2010 Directors Plan expired in 2019.\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, which was recognized as follows:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018 2017\nStock-based compensation expense included in cost of sales $ 369 $ 418 $ 379\nSelling, general and administrative expense 3,889 3,989 4,063\nResearch and development expense 2,704 2,748 2,991\nStock-based compensation expense included in operating expenses 6,593 6,737 7,054\nTotal stock-based compensation expense 6,962 7,155 7,433\nTax benefit for expense associated with non-qualified options, PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock (1,659) (1,432) (1,699)\nTotal stock-based compensation expense, net of tax $ 5,303 $ 5,723 $ 5,734\n72\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock\nUnder the 2015 Plan, awards other than stock options, including PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock, may be granted to certain employees and officers.\nUnder our market-based PSU program, the number of shares of common stock earned by a recipient is subject to a market condition based on ADTRAN’s relative total shareholder return against all companies in the NASDAQ Telecommunications Index at the end\nof a three-year performance period. Depending on the relative total shareholder return over the performance period, the recipient may earn from 0% to 150% of the shares underlying the PSUs, with the shares earned distributed upon the vesting. The fair value of the\naward is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the expected outcome of the impact of market conditions using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method. A portion of the granted PSUs vests and the underlying shares\nbecome deliverable upon the death or disability of the recipient or upon a change of control of ADTRAN, as defined by the 2015 Plan. The recipients of the PSUs receive dividend credits based on the shares of common stock underlying the PSUs. The dividend\ncredits vest and are earned in the same manner as the PSUs and are paid in cash upon the issuance of common stock for the PSUs.\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a one-time PSU grant of 0.5 million shares that contained performance conditions and would have vested at the end of a three-year period if such performance\nconditions were met. The fair value of these performance-based PSU awards was equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. These awards were forfeited during the first quarter of 2020 as the performance conditions were not achieved.\nThe fair value of RSUs and restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the business day immediately preceding the grant date. RSUs and restricted stock vest ratably over four-year and one-year periods, respectively.\nWe will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation. If circumstances change, and additional data becomes available over time, we may change our assumptions and methodologies,\nwhich may materially impact our fair value determination.\nThe following table is a summary of our PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 and the changes that occurred during 2019:\nWeighted\nNumber of Average Grant\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) shares Date Fair Value\nUnvested PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding, December 31, 2018 1,570 $ 18.52\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock granted 897 $ 9.63\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock vested (368) $ 17.23\nPSUs, RSUs and restricted stock forfeited (208) $ 18.24\nUnvested PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding, December 31, 2019 1,891 $ 14.58\nAs of December 31, 2019, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the non-vested portion of market-based PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock was approximately $17.2 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition\nperiod of 2.9 years and adjusted for actual forfeitures as they occur.\nThe following table details the significant assumptions that impact the fair value estimate of the market-based PSUs:\n2019 2018 2017\nEstimated fair value per share $9.53 to $18.05 $ 16.59 $ 24.17\nExpected volatility 32.7% to 38.9% 27.98% to 31.58% 27.03%\nRisk-free interest rate 1.6% to 2.46% 2.11% to 2.99% 1.78%\nExpected dividend yield 2.3% to 4.09% 1.83% to 2.49% 1.74%\nAs of December 31, 2019, 1.0 million shares were available for issuance under shareholder-approved equity plans in connection with the grant and exercise of stock options, PSU’s, RSU’s or restricted stock.\n73\nStock Options\nThe following table is a summary of our stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the changes that occurred during 2019:\nWeighted Weighted Avg.\nNumber of Average Remaining Aggregate\nOptions Exercise Price Contractual Life Intrinsic Value\n(in thousands) (per share) in Years (in thousands)\nStock options outstanding, December 31, 2018 4,382 $ 22.91 4.10 $ —\nStock options granted — $ —\nStock options exercised (34) $ 15.53\nStock options forfeited (32) $ 15.56\nStock options expired (744) $ 23.72\nStock options outstanding, December 31, 2019 3,572 $ 22.88 3.40 $ —\nStock options exercisable, December 31, 2019 3,570 $ 22.89 3.40 $ —\nAll of the options above were issued at exercise prices that approximated fair market value at the date of grant. As of December 31, 2019, total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options was approximately $11 thousand, which is\nexpected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of one year and will be adjusted for actual forfeitures as they occur.\nThe aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represent the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between ADTRAN’s closing stock price on the last trading day of 2019 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would\nhave been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on December 31, 2019. The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of ADTRAN’s stock and was $0 as of December 31, 2019.\nThe total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $3.4 million, respectively. The fair value of options fully vesting during 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $0.9 million, $2.5 million and $4.3 million,\nrespectively.\nThe following table further describes our stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2019:\nOptions Outstanding Options Exercisable\nOptions Weighted Avg.

The Black-Scholes Model requires the input of certain assumptions that involve judgment. Because our\nstock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, existing models may not provide reliable measures of fair value of our stock options.\nThe stock option pricing model requires the use of several assumptions that impact the fair value estimate. These variables include, but are not limited to, the volatility of our stock price and employee exercise behaviors.\nThere were no stock options granted in during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017.\n74\nNote 5 – Investments\nDebt Securities and Other Investments\nAs of December 31, 2019, we held the following debt securities and other investments, recorded at fair value:\nAmortized Gross Unrealized Fair\n(In thousands) Cost Gains Losses Value\nCorporate bonds $ 9,304 $ 80 $ — $ 9,384\nMunicipal fixed-rate bonds 930 — — 930\nAsset-backed bonds 6,867 26 (3) 6,890\nMortgage/Agency-backed bonds 6,944 26 (8) 6,962\nU.S. government bonds 12,311 21 (9) 12,323\nForeign government bonds 372 — (1) 371\nVariable rate demand notes 800 — — 800\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities held at fair value $ 37,528 $ 153 $ (21) $ 37,660\nAs of December 31, 2018, we held the following debt securities and other investments, recorded at fair value:\nAmortized Gross Unrealized Fair\n(In thousands) Cost Gains Losses Value\nCorporate bonds $ 20,777 $ 19 $ (112) $ 20,684\nMunicipal fixed-rate bonds 1,339 — (26) 1,313\nAsset-backed bonds 5,230 5 (14) 5,221\nMortgage/Agency-backed bonds 3,833 2 (44) 3,791\nU.S. government bonds 9,271 1 (66) 9,206\nForeign government bonds 592 — (8) 584\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities held at fair value $ 41,042 $ 27 $ (270) $ 40,799\nAs of December 31, 2019, our debt securities had the following contractual maturities:\nMunicipal Mortgage / U.S. Foreign\nCorporate fixed-rate Asset-backed Agency-backed government government\n(In thousands) bonds bonds bonds bonds bonds bonds\nLess than one year $ 4,005 $ — $ 396 $ — $ — $ —\nOne to two years 4,120 930 760 213 1,347 —\nTwo to three years 967 — 1,632 1,424 9,344 —\nThree to five years 292 — 2,092 494 1,632 371\nFive to ten years — — 1,719 792 — —\nMore than ten years — — 291 4,039 — —\nTotal $ 9,384 $ 930 $ 6,890 $ 6,962 $ 12,323 $ 371\nActual maturities may differ from contractual maturities as some borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.\nRealized gains and losses on sales of securities are computed under the specific identification method.

Realized gains and losses on marketable equity securities were included in net investment gain (loss). Unrealized gains and losses were recognized in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss), net of deferred taxes, on the balance sheet.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-01, which requires us to measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value, with any changes in fair value recognized in net investment gain\n(loss). Upon adoption, we reclassified $3.2 million of net unrealized gains related to marketable equity securities from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to opening retained earnings.\nASU 2016-01 also provides a measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value in which investments can be recorded at cost less impairment, if any, adjusted for observable price changes for an identical or similar\ninvestment. We elected to record our equity investment that does not have a readily determinable fair value using the measurement alternative method. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a note receivable of approximately $4.3 million, which was included\nin other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, this amount was repaid and reissued in the form of debt and equity. Approximately $3.4 million was issued as an equity investment, which represented a non-\ncash investing activity. The carrying value of this investment under the measurement alternative was $3.4 million as of December 31, 2019. The remaining amount, approximately $0.9 million, was converted into a new note receivable, which is included in other\nreceivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and represents a non-cash operating activity.\n76\nRealized and unrealized gains and losses for our marketable equity securities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018\nRealized gains (losses) on equity securities sold $ (96) $ 1,306\nUnrealized gains (losses) on equity securities held 11,472 (4,821)\nTotal gain (loss) recognized, net $ 11,376 $ (3,515)\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, gross unrealized losses related to individual investments in a continuous loss position for twelve months or longer were not material.\nU.S. GAAP establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy based upon observable and unobservable inputs for fair value measurement of financial instruments:\n• Level 1 – Observable outputs; values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market;\n• Level 2 – Significant inputs that are observable; values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly;\n• Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs; values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs could include information supplied by\ninvestees.\nWe have categorized our cash equivalents and our investments held at fair value into this hierarchy as follows:\nFair Value Measurements as of December 31, 2019 Using\nQuoted Prices\nin Active Significant\nMarket for Other\nIdentical Observable Significant Unobservable\nAssets Inputs Inputs\n(In thousands) Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nCash equivalents\nMoney market funds $ 1,309 $ 1,309 $ — $ —\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities\nCorporate bonds 9,384 — 9,384 —\nMunicipal fixed-rate bonds 930 — 930 —\nAsset-backed bonds 6,890 — 6,890 —\nMortgage/Agency-backed bonds 6,962 — 6,962 —\nU.S. government bonds 12,323 12,323 — —\nForeign government bonds 371 — 371 —\nVariable rate demand notes 800 — 800 —\nMarketable equity securities\nMarketable equity securities – various industries 35,501 35,501 — —\nEquity in escrow 298 298 — —\nDeferred compensation plan assets 21,698 21,698 — —\nOther investments 2,442 2,442 — —\nTotal $ 98,908 $ 73,571 $ 25,337 $ —\n77\nFair Value Measurements as of December 31, 2018 Using\nQuoted Prices\nin Active Significant\nMarket for Other\nIdentical Observable Significant Unobservable\nAssets Inputs Inputs\n(In thousands) Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nCash equivalents\nMoney market funds $ 1,554 $ 1,554 $ — $ —\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities\nCorporate bonds 20,684 — 20,684 —\nMunicipal fixed-rate bonds 1,313 — 1,313 —\nAsset-backed bonds 5,221 — 5,221 —\nMortgage/Agency-backed bonds 3,791 — 3,791 —\nU.S. government bonds 9,206 9,206 — —\nForeign government bonds 584 — 584 —\nMarketable equity securities\nMarketable equity securities – various industries 26,763 26,763 — —\nEquity in escrow 253 253 — —\nDeferred compensation plan assets 18,256 18,256 — —\nTotal $ 87,625 $ 56,032 $ 31,593 $ —\nThe fair value of our Level 2 securities is calculated using a weighted average market price for each security. Market prices are obtained from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions and other third-party\nsources. These multiple market prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily market value of each security.\nOur variable rate demand notes have a structure that implies a standard expected market price. The frequent interest rate resets make it reasonable to expect the price to stay at par. These securities are priced at the expected market price.\nNote 6 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had no foreign exchange forward contracts.\nThe change in the fair values of our derivative instruments recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:\nIncome Statement\n(In thousands) Location 2019 2018 2017\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts Other income (expense) $ — $ 13 $ (754)\nThe change in our derivatives designated as hedging instruments recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to income, net of tax, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:\nLocation of Amount of Losses Reclassified\nLosses Reclassified from AOCI into Income\n(In thousands) from AOCI into Income 2019 2018 2017\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts Cost of Sales $ — $ — $ (897)\n78\nNote 7 – Inventory\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, inventory was comprised of the following:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018\nRaw materials $ 36,987 $ 45,333\nWork in process 1,085 1,638\nFinished goods 60,233 52,877\nTotal Inventory, net $ 98,305 $ 99,848\nInventory reserves are established for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on estimated reserve percentages, which consider historical usage,\nknown trends, inventory age and market conditions. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our inventory reserve was $34.1 million and $30.0 million, respectively.\nNote 8 – Property, Plant and Equipment\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, property, plant and equipment was comprised of the following:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018\nLand $ 4,575 $ 4,575\nBuilding and land improvements 34,797 34,379\nBuilding 68,157 68,183\nFurniture and fixtures 19,959 19,831\nComputer hardware and software 74,399 92,071\nEngineering and other equipment 130,430 127,060\nTotal Property, Plant and Equipment 332,317 346,099\nLess accumulated depreciation (258,609) (265,464)\nTotal Property, Plant and Equipment, net $ 73,708 $ 80,635\nDepreciation expense was $12.5 million, $12.7 million and $12.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which is recorded in cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expense and research and development expense in\nthe consolidated statements of income.\nWe assess long-lived assets used in operations for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset are less\nthan the asset’s carrying value. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized impairment charges of $3.9 million related to the abandonment of certain information technology projects in which we had previously capitalized expenses related\nto these projects. The impairment charges were determined based on actual costs incurred as part of the projects. No impairment charges were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nNote 9 – Leases\nWe have operating leases for office space, automobiles and various other equipment in the U.S. and in certain international locations. We also reviewed other contracts, such as manufacturing agreements and service agreements, for potential embedded leases. We\nspecifically reviewed these other contracts to determine whether we have the right to substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of any specified assets or the right to direct the use of any specified assets, either of which would indicate the existence of a\nlease.\n79\nAs of December 31, 2019, our operating leases had remaining lease terms of one month to six years, some of which included options to extend the leases for up to nine years, and some of which included options to terminate the leases within three months. For those\nleases that are reasonably assured to be renewed, we have included the option to extend as part of our right of use asset and lease liability. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less were not recorded on the balance sheet and lease expense for these leases is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense related to these short-term leases was $0.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, and is included in cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and\ndevelopment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Lease expense related to variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate, such as real estate taxes and insurance reimbursements, was $0.9 million for the twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2019. For lease agreements entered into or reassessed after the adoption of Topic 842, we elected to not separate lease and nonlease components. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive\ncovenants.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases is as follows:\nDecember 31, January 1,\n(In thousands) Classification 2019 2019 (1)\nAssets\nRight of use lease assets Other assets $ 8,452 $ 10,322\nTotal lease asset $ 8,452 $ 10,322\nLiabilities\nCurrent lease liability Accrued expenses $ 2,676 $ 2,948\nNon-current lease liability Other non-current liabilities 5,818 7,374\nTotal lease liability $ 8,494 $ 10,322\n(1) Reflects the adoption of the new lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019.\nThe components of lease expense included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were as follows:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2019\nResearch and development expenses $ 2,417\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 1,400\nCost of sales 64\nTotal operating lease expense $ 3,881\nAs of December 31, 2019, operating lease liabilities included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet by future maturity were as follows:\n(In thousands) Amount\n2020 $ 2,856\n2021 2,412\n2022 1,705\n2023 1,160\n2024 482\nThereafter 264\nTotal lease payments 8,879\nLess: Interest (385)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 8,494\nFuture operating lease payments include $0.7 million related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised. There are no legally binding leases that have not yet commenced.\n80\nAs of December 31, 2018, future minimum rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases, including renewals determined to be reasonably assured as of December 31, 2018, with original maturities of greater than 12 months, were as follows:\n(In thousands) Amount (1)\n2019 $ 3,873\n2020 3,580\n2021 2,771\n2022 2,053\n2023 1,317\nThereafter 762\nTotal $ 14,356\n(1) Certain renewal options were subsequently determined to not be reasonably assured of renewal upon the Company’s adoption of the new lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019.\nOur leases do not provide an implicit rate and therefore we use an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We used the incremental borrowing rate on January 1, 2019,\nfor operating leases that commenced on or prior to that date. The incremental borrowing rate was determined on a portfolio basis by grouping leases with similar terms as well as grouping leases based on a U.S. dollar or Euro functional currency. The actual rate was\nthen determined based on a credit spread over LIBOR as well as the Bloomberg Curve Matrix for the U.S. Communications section. The following table provides information about our weighted average lease terms and weighted average discount rates as of\nDecember 31, 2019:\nAs of December 31,\n2019\nWeighted average remaining lease term (years)\nOperating leases with USD functional currency 2.6\nOperating leases with Euro functional currency 4.4\nWeighted average discount rate\nOperating leases with USD functional currency 4.02%\nOperating leases with Euro functional currency 1.84%\nSupplemental cash flow information related to operating leases is as follows:\nAs of December 31,\n(In thousands) 2019\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease assets / liabilities\nCash used in operating activities related to operating leases $ 3,439\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 11,615\n81\nSales-Type Leases\nWe are the lessor in sales-type lease arrangements for network equipment, which have initial terms of up to five years. Our sales-type lease arrangements contain either a provision whereby the network equipment reverts back to us upon the expiration of the lease or\na provision that allows the lessee to purchase the network equipment at a bargain purchase amount at the end of the lease. In addition, our sales-type lease arrangements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The allocation of\nthe consideration between lease and nonlease components is determined by stand-alone selling price by component. The net investment in sales-type leases consists of lease receivables less unearned income. Collectability of sales-type leases is evaluated\nperiodically at an individual customer level. The Company has elected to exclude taxes related to sales-type leases from revenue and the associated expense of such taxes. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we did not have an allowance for credit losses for our net\ninvestment in sales-type leases. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the components of the net investment in sales-type leases were as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n(In thousands) 2019 2018\nCurrent minimum lease payments receivable(1) $ 1,201 $ 11,339\nNon-current minimum lease payments receivable(2) 889 1,670\nTotal minimum lease payments receivable 2,090 13,009\nLess: Current unearned revenue(1) 365 631\nLess: Non-current unearned revenue(2) 163 473\nNet investment in sales-type leases $ 1,562 $ 11,905\n(1) Included in other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(2) Included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe components of sales-type lease gross profit recognized at the lease commencement date and interest and dividend income, included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were as follows:\n(In thousands) For the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nSales - Network Solutions $ 1,723\nCost of sales - Network Solutions 675\nGross profit $ 1,048\nInterest and dividend income $ 357\nAs of December 31, 2019 future minimum lease payments to be received from sales-type leases were as follows:\n(In thousands) Amount\n2020 $ 1,201\n2021 565\n2022 232\n2023 86\n2024 6\nTotal $ 2,090\nNote 10 – Goodwill\nGoodwill, all of which relates to our acquisitions of Bluesocket, Inc. in 2011 and SmartRG in 2018, was $7.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and $7.1 million as of December 31, 2018 of which $6.6 million and $0.4 million was allocated to our Network Solutions\nand Services & Support reportable segments, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, and of which $6.7 million and $0.4 million was allocated to our Network Solutions and Services & Support reportable segments, respectively, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2018. Goodwill related to our SmartRG acquisition was reduced by $0.1 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 as a result of a measurement period adjustment.\n82\nWe evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have\nelected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-\nstep impairment test. If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step impairment test will be performed. Based on the results of our qualitative assessment for the years ended December 31, 2019,\n2018 and 2017, there were no events or circumstances that occurred that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying value.\nNote 11 – Intangible Assets\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our intangible assets were comprised of the following:\n2019 2018\nAccumulated Accumulated\n(In thousands) Gross Value Amortization Net Value Gross Value Amortization Net Value\nCustomer relationships $ 22,356 $ (7,233) $ 15,123 $ 22,455 $ (5,380) $ 17,075\nDeveloped technology 10,170 (3,379) 6,791 12,801 (4,867) 7,934\nLicensed technology 5,900 (1,174) 4,726 5,900 (520) 5,380\nSupplier relationships 2,800 (2,508) 292 2,800 (1,108) 1,692\nIntellectual property — — — 930 (930) —\nLicensing agreements 560 (79) 481 560 (5) 555\nPatents 500 (226) 274 500 (157) 343\nTrade names 310 (176) 134 310 (106) 204\nNon-compete — — — 200 (200) —\nTotal $ 42,596 $ (14,775) $ 27,821 $ 46,456 $ (13,273) $ 33,183\nAmortization expense was $5.3 million, $2.3 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the estimated future amortization expense of intangible assets is as follows:\n(In thousands) Amount\n2020 $ 4,444\n2021 4,095\n2022 3,471\n2023 3,320\n2024 3,226\nThereafter 9,265\nTotal $ 27,821\nNote 12 – Alabama State Industrial Development Authority Financing and Economic Incentives\nIn conjunction with the 1995 expansion of our Huntsville, Alabama facility, we were approved for participation in an incentive program offered by the State of Alabama Industrial Development Authority (“the Authority”). Pursuant to the program, on January 13,\n1995, the Authority issued $20.0 million of its taxable revenue bonds (the “Taxable Revenue Bonds”) and loaned the proceeds from the sale of the Taxable Revenue Bonds to ADTRAN. Further advances on the Taxable Revenue Bonds were made by the Authority,\nbringing the total amount outstanding to $50.0 million. The Taxable Revenue Bonds bore interest, payable monthly with an interest rate of 2% per annum. The Taxable Revenue Bond’s outstanding aggregate principal amount of $24.6 million matured on January 1,\n2020 and was repaid in full on January 2, 2020. The fair value of the bond as of December 31, 2019 was $24.6 million. We are required to make payments to the Authority in amounts necessary to pay the interest on the Taxable Revenue Bonds. Included in short-\nterm investments as of December 31, 2019 is $25.6 million which is invested in a certificate of deposit. These funds serve as a collateral deposit against the principal of this bond, and we have the right to set-off the balance of the Taxable Revenue Bonds with the\ncollateral deposit in order to reduce the balance of the indebtedness.\n83\nIn conjunction with this program, we were eligible to receive certain economic incentives from the state of Alabama that reduce the amount of payroll withholdings that we were required to remit to the state for those employment positions that qualify under the\nprogram. We realized economic incentives related to payroll withholdings totaling $1.2 million, $1.4 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This program concluded on January 2, 2020 following the maturity\nof the Taxable Revenue Bonds. No additional benefits will be received in future periods.\nWe made principal payments of $1.0 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. No additional principal payments will be made in future periods.\nNote 13 – Income Taxes\nA summary of the components of the expense (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018 2017\nCurrent\nFederal $ (518) $ (8,001) $ 466\nState (1,065) (476) (150)\nInternational (282) 11,705 6,458\nTotal Current (1,865) 3,228 6,774\nDeferred\nFederal 24,801 (14,448) 8,024\nState 5,815 (3,390) 1,882\nInternational (546) 581 4,167\nTotal Deferred 30,070 (17,257) 14,073\nTotal Income Tax Expense (Benefit) $ 28,205 $ (14,029) $ 20,847\nOur effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate due to the following:\n2019 2018 2017\nTax provision computed at the federal statutory rate 21.00% 21.00% 35.00%\nState income tax provision, net of federal benefit 6.97 14.53 2.17\nFederal research credits 15.53 14.23 (11.88)\nForeign taxes 2.83 (11.45) (2.27)\nTax-exempt income 0.49 0.45 (0.75)\nState tax incentives 3.85 3.15 (2.71)\nChange in valuation allowance (172.82) — —\nForeign tax credits 16.69 — —\nStock-based compensation (6.01) (2.87) 1.43\nDomestic production activity deduction — — (1.13)\nBargain purchase — 8.82 —\nImpact of U.S. tax reform — 12.00 26.70\nGlobal intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") (1.87) (17.48) —\nOther, net (0.49) (0.34) 0.09\nEffective Tax Rate (113.83)% 42.04% 46.65%\nIncome (loss) before expense (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018 2017\nU.S. entities $ (29,829) $ (74,131) $ 26,552\nInternational entities 5,052 40,760 18,135\nTotal $ (24,777) $ (33,371) $ 44,687\n84\nIncome (loss) before expense (benefit) for income taxes for international entities reflects income (loss) based on statutory transfer pricing agreements. This amount does not correlate to consolidated international revenue, many of which occur from our U.S. entity.\nDeferred income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes. The principal components of our current and non-current deferred taxes\nwere as follows:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018\nDeferred tax assets\nInventory $ 7,144 $ 6,609\nAccrued expenses 2,330 2,850\nInvestments — 1,122\nDeferred compensation 5,660 4,779\nStock-based compensation 2,451 3,069\nUncertain tax positions related to state taxes and related interest 241 326\nPensions 7,074 5,538\nForeign losses 2,925 3,097\nState losses and credit carry-forwards 3,995 8,164\nFederal loss and research carry-forwards 12,171 17,495\nLease liabilities 2,496 —\nCapitalized research and development expenditures 22,230 —\nValuation allowance (48,616) (5,816)\nTotal Deferred Tax Assets 20,101 47,233\nDeferred tax liabilities\nProperty, plant and equipment (2,815) (3,515)\nIntellectual property (5,337) (6,531)\nRight of use lease assets (2,496) —\nInvestments (1,892) —\nTotal Deferred Tax Liabilities (12,540) (10,046)\nNet Deferred Tax Assets $ 7,561 $ 37,187\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Act”) was signed into law. As a result of the Act, we recognized an estimated expense of $11.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, of which $9.2 million related to the write-down of deferred tax assets and $2.7\nmillion related to tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings. We calculated our best estimate of the impact of the Act in our 2017 year-end income tax provision in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which was issued to address the application of U.S.\nGAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed to finalize the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. Additional work to complete a more detailed analysis of historical foreign earnings, as\nwell as the full impact relating to the write-down of deferred tax assets, was completed in the third quarter of 2018 and resulted in a tax benefit of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, non-current deferred taxes related to our investments and our defined benefit pension plan reflect deferred taxes on the net unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments and deferred taxes on unrealized losses in\nour pension plan. The net change in non-current deferred taxes associated with these items, which resulted in a deferred tax benefit of $0.4 million and $2.8 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, was recorded as an adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss),\npresented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nThe Company continually reviews the adequacy of our valuation allowance and recognizes the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in accordance with ASC 740,\nIncome Taxes. Due to our recent decrease in revenue and profitability for 2019, and all other positive and negative objective evidence considered as part of our analysis, our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as projections for future growth is limited\nwhen evaluating whether our deferred tax assets will be realized. As such, the Company was no longer able to conclude that it was more likely than not that our domestic deferred tax assets would be realized and a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred\ntax assets was established in the third quarter of 2019. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable may be adjusted in future periods in the event that sufficient evidence is present to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or a\nportion of our domestic deferred tax assets will be realized.\n85\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had gross deferred tax assets totaling $56.2 million offset by a valuation allowance totaling $48.6 million. Of the valuation allowance, $42.8 million was established in the current year primarily related to our domestic\ndeferred tax assets. The remaining $5.8 million established in prior periods related to state research and development credit carryforwards and foreign net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards where we lack sufficient activity to realize\nthose deferred tax assets. The remaining $7.6 million in deferred tax assets that were not offset by a valuation allowance are located in various foreign jurisdictions where the Company believes it is more likely than not we will realize these deferred tax assets.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to deferred tax assets is as follows:\nDecember 31, 2019\n(In thousands) Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance Deferred Tax Assets, net\nDomestic $ 46,266 $ (46,266) $ —\nInternational 9,911 (2,350) 7,561\nTotal $ 56,177 $ (48,616) $ 7,561\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the deferred tax assets for foreign and domestic loss carry-forwards, research and development tax credits, unamortized research and development costs and state credit carry-forwards totaled $41.3 million and $28.8 million,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2019, $19.1 million of these deferred tax assets will expire at various times between 2020 and 2039. The remaining deferred tax assets will either amortize through 2029 or carryforward indefinitely.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, our cash and cash equivalents were $73.8 million and $105.5 million and short-term investments were $33.2 million and $3.2 million, which provided available short-term liquidity of $107.0 million and $108.7\nmillion. Of these amounts, our foreign subsidiaries held cash of $52.3 million and $87.1 million, respectively, representing approximately 48.9% and 80.1% of available short-term liquidity, which is used to fund on-going liquidity needs of these subsidiaries. We\nintend to permanently reinvest these funds outside the U.S. except to the extent any of these funds can be repatriated without withholding tax and our current business plans do not indicate a need to repatriate to fund domestic operations. However, if all of these\nfunds were repatriated to the U.S. or used for U.S. operations, certain amounts could be subject to tax. Due to the timing and circumstances of repatriation of such earnings, if any, it is not practical to determine the amount of funds subject to unrecognized deferred\ntax liability.\nDuring 2019, 2018 and 2017, no income tax benefit or expense was recorded for stock options exercised as an adjustment to equity.\nThe change in the unrecognized income tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 is reconciled below:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018 2017\nBalance at beginning of period $ 1,868 $ 2,366 $ 2,226\nIncreases for tax position related to:\nPrior years — 3 465\nCurrent year 161 254 285\nDecreases for tax positions related to:\nPrior years (71) — (14)\nExpiration of applicable statute of limitations (471) (755) (596)\nBalance at end of period $ 1,487 $ 1,868 $ 2,366\nAs of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our total liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $1.5 million, $1.9 million and $2.4 million, respectively, of which $1.4 million, $1.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively, would reduce our effective tax rate if we were\nsuccessful in upholding all of the uncertain positions and recognized the amounts recorded. We classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the balances of\naccrued interest and penalties were $0.5 million, $0.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively.\nWe do not anticipate a single tax position generating a significant increase or decrease in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of this reporting date. We file income tax returns in the U.S. for federal and various state jurisdictions and several\nforeign jurisdictions. We are not currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. Generally, we are not subject to changes in income taxes by any taxing jurisdiction for the years prior to 2016.\n86\nNote 14 – Employee Benefit Plans\nPension Benefit Plan\nWe maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries.\nThe pension benefit plan obligations and funded status as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018\nChange in projected benefit obligation:\nProjected benefit obligation at beginning of period $ 37,245 $ 34,893\nService cost 1,471 1,193\nInterest cost 634 727\nActuarial loss - experience 453 38\nActuarial loss - assumptions 5,091 2,139\nBenefit payments (166) (138)\nEffects of foreign currency exchange rate changes (826) (1,607)\nProjected benefit obligation at end of period 43,902 37,245\nChange in plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of period 24,159 26,624\nActual gain (loss) on plan assets 4,392 (2,024)\nContributions — 688\nEffects of foreign currency exchange rate changes (535) (1,129)\nFair value of plan assets at end of period 28,016 24,159\nUnfunded status at end of period $ (15,886) $ (13,086)\nThe accumulated benefit obligation was $43.9 million and $37.2 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in the accumulated benefit obligation and the actuarial loss was primarily attributable to a decrease in the discount rate during\n2019.\nThe net amounts recognized in the balance sheet for the unfunded pension liability as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018\nCurrent liability $ — $ —\nPension liability 15,886 13,086\nTotal $ 15,886 $ 13,086\nThe components of net periodic pension cost, other than the service cost component, are included in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). The components of net periodic pension cost and amounts recognized in other\ncomprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018 2017\nNet periodic benefit cost:\nService cost $ 1,471 $ 1,193 $ 1,260\nInterest cost 634 727 607\nExpected return on plan assets (1,392) (1,548) (1,267)\nAmortization of actuarial losses 795 247 309\nNet periodic benefit cost 1,508 619 909\nOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations\nrecognized in other comprehensive income:\nNet actuarial (gain) loss 2,488 5,638 (654)\nAmortization of actuarial losses (771) (196) (406)\nAmount recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) 1,717 5,442 (1,060)\nTotal recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other\ncomprehensive income (loss) $ 3,225 $ 6,061 $ (151)\n87\nThe amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018\nNet actuarial loss $ (12,973) $ (11,256)\nThe defined benefit pension plan is accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the use of various assumptions, including an expected rate of return on plan assets and a discount rate. The expected return on our German plan assets that is utilized in\ndetermining the benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations, and\ncorrelations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return. The discount\nrate has been derived from the returns of high-quality, corporate bonds denominated in Euro currency with durations close to the duration of our pension obligations.\nThe weighted-average assumptions that were used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:\n2019 2018 2017\nDiscount rate 1.75% 2.13% 1.90%\nRate of compensation increase 2.00% 2.00% 2.00%\nExpected long-term rates of return 5.90% 5.90% 5.90%\nThe weighted-average assumptions that were used to determine the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n2019 2018\nDiscount rate 1.00% 1.75%\nRate of compensation increase 2.00% 2.00%\nActuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). To the extent unamortized gains and losses exceed 10% of the higher of the market-related value of assets or the projected benefit obligation, the excess is amortized as a\ncomponent of net periodic pension cost over the remaining service period of active participants. We estimate that $0.8 million will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic pension cost in 2020 for the net actuarial loss.\nWe do not anticipate making any contributions to the pension plan in 2020.\nThe following pension benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid to participants:\n(In thousands)\n2020 $ 515\n2021 582\n2022 619\n2023 706\n2024 789\nThereafter 4,872\nTotal $ 8,083\n88\nU.S. GAAP establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy based upon observable and unobservable inputs for fair value measurement of financial instruments:\n• Level 1 – Observable outputs; values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market;\n• Level 2 – Significant inputs that are observable; values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly;\n• Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs; values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs could include information supplied by\ninvestees.\nWe have categorized our cash equivalents and our investments held at fair value into this hierarchy as follows:\nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2019 Using\nQuoted Prices Significant\nin Active Other Significant\nMarkets for Observable Unobservable\nIdentical Assets Inputs Inputs\n(In thousands) Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 691 $ 691 $ — $ —\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nBond funds:\nGovernment bonds 6,645 6,645 — —\nCorporate bonds 5,514 5,514 — —\nEmerging markets bonds 531 531 — —\nEquity funds:\nGlobal equity 11,071 11,071 — —\nEmerging markets 956 956 — —\nBalanced fund 863 863 — —\nLarge cap value 312 312 — —\nGlobal real estate fund 902 902 — —\nManaged futures fund 531 531 — —\nAvailable-for-sale securities 27,325 27,325 — —\nTotal $ 28,016 $ 28,016 $ — $ —\nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2018 Using\nQuoted Prices Significant\nin Active Other Significant\nMarkets for Observable Unobservable\nIdentical Assets Inputs Inputs\n(In thousands) Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,010 $ 1,010 $ — $ —\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nBond funds:\nGovernment bonds 6,268 6,268 — —\nCorporate bonds 4,840 4,840 — —\nEmerging markets bonds 443 443 — —\nEquity funds:\nGlobal equity 7,743 7,743 — —\nEmerging markets 1,188 1,188 — —\nBalanced fund 815 815 — —\nLarge cap value 262 262 — —\nGlobal real estate fund 926 926 — —\nManaged futures fund 664 664 — —\nAvailable-for-sale securities 23,149 23,149 — —\nTotal $ 24,159 $ 24,159 $ — $ —\n89\nOur investment policy includes various guidelines and procedures designed to ensure assets are invested in a manner necessary to meet expected future benefits earned by participants and consider a broad range of economic conditions. Central to the policy are target\nallocation ranges by asset class, which is currently 50% for bond funds, 40% for equity funds and 10% cash, real estate and managed futures. The objectives of the target allocations are to maintain investment portfolios that diversify risk through prudent asset\nallocation parameters, achieve asset returns that meet or exceed the plans’ actuarial assumptions and achieve asset returns that are competitive with like institutions employing similar investment strategies.\nThe investment policy is periodically reviewed by us and a designated third-party fiduciary for investment matters. The policy is established and administered in a manner that is compliant at all times with applicable government regulations.\n401(k) Savings Plan\nWe maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. 401(k) Retirement Plan (the “Savings Plan”) for the benefit of our eligible employees. The Savings Plan is intended to qualify under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and is\nintended to be a “safe harbor” 401(k) plan under Code Section 401(k)(12). The Savings Plan allows employees to save for retirement by contributing part of their compensation to the plan on a tax-deferred basis. The Savings Plan also requires us to contribute a\n“safe harbor” amount each year. We match up to 4% of employee contributions (100% of an employee’s first 3% of contributions and 50% of their next 2% of contributions), beginning on the employee’s one-year anniversary date. In calculating our matching\ncontribution, we only use compensation up to the statutory maximum under the Code ($280,000 for 2019). All matching contributions under the Savings Plan vest immediately. Employer contribution expense and plan administration costs for the Savings Plan\namounted to approximately $4.4 million, $4.4 million and $4.6 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nDeferred Compensation Plans\nWe maintain four deferred compensation programs for certain executive management employees and our Board of Directors.\nFor our executive management employees, the ADTRAN, Inc. Deferred Compensation Program for Employees is offered as a supplement to our tax-qualified 401(k) plan and is available to certain executive management employees who have been designated by our\nBoard of Directors. This deferred compensation plan allows participants to defer all or a portion of certain specified bonuses and up to 25% of remaining cash compensation and permits us to make matching contributions on a discretionary basis without the\nlimitations that apply to the 401(k) plan. To date, we have not made any matching contributions under this plan. We also maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. Equity Deferral Program for Employees. Under this plan, participants may elect to defer all or a portion of their\nvested PSUs and RSUs to the plan. Such deferrals shall continue to be held and deemed to be invested in shares of ADTRAN stock unless and until the amounts are distributed or such deferrals are moved to another deemed investment pursuant to an election made\nby the participant.\nFor our Board of Directors, we maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. Deferred Compensation Program for Directors. This program allows our Board of Directors to defer all or a portion of monetary remuneration paid to the Director, including, but not limited to, meeting\nfees and annual retainers. We also maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. Equity Deferral Program for Directors. Under this plan, participants may elect to defer all or a portion of their vested restricted stock awards. Such deferrals shall continue to be held and deemed to be\ninvested in shares of ADTRAN stock unless and until the amounts are distributed or such deferrals are moved to another deemed investment pursuant to an election made by the director.\nWe have set aside the plan assets for all plans in a rabbi trust (the “Trust”) and all contributions are credited to bookkeeping accounts for the participants. The Trust assets are subject to the claims of our creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency. The assets\nof the Trust are deemed to be invested in pre-approved mutual funds as directed by each participant and the participant’s bookkeeping account is credited with the earnings and losses attributable to those investments. Benefits are scheduled to be distributed six\nmonths after termination of employment in a single lump sum payment or annual installments paid over a three or ten-year term based on the participant’s election. Distributions will be made on a pro-rata basis from each of the hypothetical investments of the\nparticipant’s account in cash. Any whole shares of ADTRAN, Inc. common stock that are distributed will be distributed in-kind.\n90\nAssets of the Trust are deemed invested in mutual funds that cover an investment spectrum ranging from equities to money market instruments. These mutual funds are publicly quoted and reported at fair value. The fair value of the assets held by the Trust and the\namounts payable to the plan participants as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018\nFair Value of Plan Assets\nLong-term investments $ 21,698 $ 18,256\nTotal Fair Value of Plan Assets $ 21,698 $ 18,256\nAmounts Payable to Plan Participants\nDeferred compensation liability $ 21,698 $ 18,256\nTotal Amounts Payable to Plan Participants $ 21,698 $ 18,256\nInterest and dividend income of the Trust are included in interest and dividend income in the accompanying 2019, 2018 and 2017 Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). Changes in the fair value of the plan assets held by the Trust have been included in other\nincome (expense) in the accompanying 2019, 2018 and 2017 Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). Changes in the fair value of the deferred compensation liability are included as selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying 2019, 2018 and\n2017 Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). Based on the changes in the total fair value of the Trust’s assets, we recorded deferred compensation income (expense) in 2019, 2018 and 2017 of $3.6 million, $(2.1) million and $(2.6) million, respectively.\nRetiree Medical Coverage\nWe provided medical, dental and prescription drug coverage to two spouses of retired former officers on the same terms as provided to our active officers for up to 30 years. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, this liability totaled $0.1 million.\nNote 15 – Segment Information and Major Customers\nOur chief operating decision maker regularly reviews our financial performance based on two reportable segments across our segments– (1) Network Solutions and (2) Services & Support. Network Solutions includes hardware and software products and next-\ngeneration virtualized solutions used in service provider or business networks, as well as prior-generation products. Services & Support includes a portfolio of maintenance, network implementation and solutions integration services, which include hosted cloud\nservices and subscription services.\nWe evaluate the performance of our segments based on gross profit. Selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, interest and dividend income, interest expense, net investment gain (loss), other income (expense) and income tax\n(expense) benefit are reported on a company-wide, functional basis only.

ADTRAN, Inc. et al., Docket No. 19-cv-09619, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, two of its current\nexecutive officers and one of its former executive officers. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages on behalf of purported purchasers of ADTRAN securities between February 28, 2019 and October 9,\n2019. The lawsuit claims that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding, and/or failed to disclose material adverse facts about, the Company’s business, operations and prospects, specifically relating to the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting, excess and obsolete inventory reserves, financial results and shipments to a Latin American customer. Investors in ADTRAN securities had until December 16, 2019 to move the court to serve as lead plaintiff in this action.\nOn December 16, 2019, two purported investors in ADTRAN securities filed motions seeking to be appointed lead plaintiff in the case. On January 6, 2020, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Defendants’ unopposed\nrequest to transfer the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, where the case is now pending as Burbridge v. ADTRAN, Inc. et al., Docket No. 5:20-cv-00050-LCB. On January 27, 2020, the two prospective lead plaintiff\nmovants filed a stipulation among plaintiffs seeking to be appointed as co-lead plaintiffs in the case.\nWe disagree with the claims made in the complaint and intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.\nOther Legal Matters\nIn addition to the litigation described above, from time to time we are subject to or otherwise involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and legal proceedings that arise out of or are incidental to the conduct of our business (collectively, “Legal Matters”),\nincluding those relating to employment matters, patent rights, regulatory compliance matters, stockholder claims, and contractual and other commercial disputes. Such Legal Matters, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and\nmanagerial resources. Additionally, an unfavorable outcome in a legal matter, including in a patent dispute, could require the Company to pay damages, entitle claimants to other relief, such as royalties, or could prevent the Company from selling some of its\nproducts in certain jurisdictions. While the Company cannot predict with certainty the results of the Legal Matters in which it is currently involved, the Company does not expect that the ultimate outcome of such Legal Matters will individually or in the aggregate\nhave a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nInvestment Commitment\nWe have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments as of December 31, 2019.\nPerformance Bonds\nCertain contracts, customers and/or jurisdictions in which we do business require us to provide various guarantees of performance such as bid bonds, performance bonds and customs bonds. As of December 31, 2019, we had commitments related to these bonds\ntotaling $9.3 million which expire at various dates through August 2024. As of December 31, 2018, we had commitments related to these bonds totaling $6.5 million. Although the triggering events vary from contract to contract, in general we would only be liable\nfor the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in our under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote.\n93\nNote 17 – Earnings (Loss) per Share\nA summary of the calculation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\n(In thousands, except for per share amounts) 2019 2018 2017\nNumerator\nNet Income (Loss) $ (52,982) $ (19,342) $ 23,840\nDenominator\nWeighted average number of shares – basic 47,836 47,880 48,153\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nStock options — — 406\nRestricted stock and restricted stock units — — 140\nWeighted average number of shares – diluted 47,836 47,880 48,699\nEarnings (loss) per share – basic $ (1.11) $ (0.40) $ 0.50\nEarnings (loss) per share – diluted $ (1.11) $ (0.40) $ 0.49\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, 5.7 million and 2.5 million, respectively, shares of unvested stock options, PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS due to their anti-dilutive effect.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, 3.2 million stock options were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because the options’ exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares,\ntherefore making them anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.\nNote 18 – Restructuring\nDuring the second half of 2019, the Company implemented a restructuring plan to realign its expense structure with the reduction in revenue experienced in recent years and overall Company objectives. Management assessed the efficiency of our operations and\nconsolidated locations and personnel, among other things, where possible. As part of this restructuring plan, the Company announced plans to reduce its overall operating expenses, both in the U.S and internationally.\nIn February 2019, the Company announced the restructuring of certain of our workforce predominantly in Germany, which included the closure of our office location in Munich, Germany accompanied by relocation or severance benefits for the affected employees.\nWe also offered voluntary early retirement to certain other employees, which was announced in March 2019.\nIn January 2018, the Company announced an early retirement incentive program for employees that met certain defined requirements. The cumulative amount incurred during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to this restructuring program was $7.3 million.\nWe did not incur any additional expenses related to this restructuring program during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending restructuring liability, which is included in accrued wages and benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, is as follows:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018\nBalance at beginning of period $ 185 $ 205\nPlus: Amounts charged to cost and expense 6,014 7,261\nLess: Amounts paid (4,631) (7,281)\nBalance at end of period $ 1,568 $ 185\nThe components of restructuring expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income are for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018 2017\nSelling, general and administrative expenses $ 2,360 $ 2,655 $ 152\nResearch and development expenses 2,869 1,831 122\nCost of sales 785 2,775 —\nTotal restructuring expenses $ 6,014 $ 7,261 $ 274\n94\nThe following table represents the components of restructuring expense by geographic area for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n(In thousands) 2019 2018 2017\nUnited States $ 3,336 $ 7,120 $ 274\nInternational 2,678 141 —\nTotal restructuring expenses $ 6,014 $ 7,261 $ 274\nNote 19 – Summarized Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)\nThe following table presents unaudited quarterly operating results for each of our last eight fiscal quarters.

We used a restricted certificate of deposit which was held as collateral to repay the outstanding balance.\nOn February 5, 2020, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common share to be paid to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2020. The quarterly dividend will be paid on March 5, 2019 payment in the aggregate amount\nof approximately $4.3 million. In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity.\n95\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief\nFinancial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because of the inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide\nabsolute assurance that all control issues, if any, with a company have been prevented or detected on a timely basis. Even disclosure controls and procedures determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance that their objectives are achieved.\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out by management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule\n13a-15(e)) pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below in\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2019.\nDespite the existence of the material weakness described below, we believe that the consolidated financial statements included in this report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented,\nin conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to include in our Annual Report on Form 10-K a report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a report from our independent\nregistered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting is included below, and the related report from our independent registered public accounting firm is\nlocated in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financials Reporting\nManagement of ADTRAN, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. ADTRAN’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. ADTRAN’s internal control\nover financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n• pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of ADTRAN;\n• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of ADTRAN are being made only\nin accordance with authorizations of management and directors of ADTRAN; and\n• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of ADTRAN’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes\nin conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n96\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of ADTRAN’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).\nA material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will\nnot be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, management determined that there was a deficiency in ADTRAN’s internal control over financial reporting that\nconstituted a material weakness. Specifically, management determined that the Company did not design and maintain effective internal control over the valuation of inventory:\n• Management determined that controls were not effectively designed and maintained over the determination of the estimated reserve for excess and obsolete inventory including the review of significant inputs and assumptions used to determine our\nexcess and obsolete inventory reserve, and to ensure the completeness and accuracy of key reports and related data used in the calculation of this reserve.\nThis material weakness did not result in any material misstatements of the Company’s financial statements or disclosures for any period presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. While the above material weakness did not result in a material\nmisstatement of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the material weakness could result in a misstatement of the Company’s interim or annual consolidated financial statements and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement that would not\nbe prevented or detected. As a result, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 based on the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nRemediation of Previously Identified Material Weakness and Continuing Material Weakness.\nThe Company has redesigned, enhanced and added controls and procedures to ensure the completeness of our cycle count program and the completeness and accuracy of key reports and related data used to monitor the results of this cycle count program. Key reports\nand report writing tools have been integrated into our enterprise management system under IT governance to ensure completeness and accuracy of the information. We reconciled all locations under the cycle count program to ensure existence of locations. We\nperformed a full physical inventory count of our raw material warehouse. We verified that all locations were counted at the appropriate frequency to ensure the physical existence of the inventory for accuracy of financial reporting. As a result of these remediation\nefforts, management has determined that, as of December 31, 2019, our controls related to our cycle count program were effectively designed, documented and maintained, and the material weakness related to these controls no longer existed.\nAdditionally, the Company has been working to redesign and implement enhanced controls and procedures related to the review of significant inputs and assumptions used to determine our excess and obsolete inventory reserve, and to ensure the completeness and\naccuracy of key reports and related data used in the calculation of the excess and obsolete inventory reserve. Key reports and calculations have been redesigned and fully integrated into our enterprise resource planning system to ensure completeness and the accuracy\nof significant inputs. New controls and procedures have also been established by the Company around the consideration of historical usage, known trends, market conditions, and estimated net realizable value of the inventory. The implementation of these measures\nis ongoing, and, while we believe that they will ultimately be effective in remediating the material weakness, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, our controls related to our excess and obsolete inventory reserve were not effectively designed\nand maintained, and the material weakness related to these controls continued to exist.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nExcept as noted in the preceding paragraphs, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\n97\nITEM 9B.

This description is based on our certificate of incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), our bylaws, as amended (the\n“Bylaws”), and applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”). This summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws, each of\nwhich is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We encourage you to read the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws and the applicable provisions of the DGCL for additional information.\nAs used herein, the terms “we,” “our” and “us” refer to ADTRAN, Inc.\nGeneral\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share.\nCommon Stock\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters properly submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors, and do not have cumulative voting rights. The\nelection of directors by our stockholders shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote on the election. All of our common stock outstanding is fully paid and nonassessable. No common\nstock is subject to call. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive proportionately any dividends as may be declared by our board of directors. There are no special rights or restrictions of any nature attaching to any of\nour common stock.\nIn the event of our liquidation or dissolution, the holders of our common stock are entitled to receive proportionately our net assets available for distribution to stockholders after the payment of all debts and other\nliabilities. Holders of our common stock have no preemptive, subscription, redemption or conversion rights.\nIndemnification of Officers and Directors\nThe Certificate of Incorporation contains provisions for the indemnification of our directors, officers, employees and certain other agents to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. These provisions may have the\npractical effect in certain cases of eliminating the ability of stockholders to collect monetary damages from indemnified individuals.\nProvisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws and the DGCL That May Have Anti-Takeover Effects\nThe Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws and the DGCL contain certain provisions that are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our board of directors. These\nprovisions are intended to avoid costly takeover battles, reduce our vulnerability to a hostile change of control and enhance the ability of our board of directors to maximize stockholder value in connection with any unsolicited offer\nto acquire us. However, these provisions may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, deter or prevent a merger or acquisition of us by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or other takeover attempt that a stockholder might\nconsider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the prevailing market price for the shares of common stock held by stockholders.\nAuthorized but Unissued Common Stock. The authorized but unissued shares of our common stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval, subject to any limitations imposed by the rules of any\nstock exchange on which our securities may be listed. These additional shares may be used for a variety of corporate finance transactions, acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and\nunreserved shares of our common stock could make more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.\nSpecial Meeting of Stockholders. The Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws provide that, except as otherwise required by law, special meetings of our stockholders can only be called by our chairman of the\nboard, our chief executive officer, our president or our board of directors.\nDelaware Business Combination Statute. We are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. Subject to certain exceptions, Section 203 prevents a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business\ncombination” with any “interested stockholder” for three years following the date that the person became an interested stockholder, unless the interested stockholder attained such status with the approval of our board of directors or\nunless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A “business combination” includes, among other things, a merger or consolidation involving us and the “interested stockholder” and the sale of more than 10%\nof our assets. In general, an “interested stockholder” is any entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or\nperson.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nAmerican Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC is the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock.\nExchange Listing\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “ADTN.”\nExhibit 10.3(b)\n[Insert Date]\nDear [Insert Name of Participant]:\nI am pleased to inform you that you have been selected to participate in the ADTRAN, Inc.

Financial reporting\nmeasures include: Company stock price; Total Shareholder Return; revenues; net income; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA); funds from operations; liquidity measures such as working capital or operating\ncash flow; return measures such as return on invested capital or return on assets; earnings measures such as earnings per share.\n3. Effective Date. This Agreement shall apply to Incentive Compensation that is approved, awarded or granted to Covered Executives on or after January 1, 2015 or the Covered Executive’s later date of employment (“Effective Date”).\n4. Recoupment; Accounting Restatement. In the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements due to the Company's material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the\nsecurities laws, the Board requires reimbursement or forfeiture of any excess Incentive Compensation received by the Covered Executive during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to\nprepare an accounting restatement.\n5. Excess Incentive Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery. The amount to be recovered will be the after-tax value of the excess of the Incentive Compensation paid to the Covered Executive based on the erroneous data over the Incentive\nCompensation that would have been paid to the Covered Executive had it been based on the restated results, as determined by the Board. If the Board cannot determine the after-tax amount of excess Incentive Compensation received by the Covered\nExecutive directly from the information in the accounting restatement, then the Board will make its determination based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement.\n6. Method of Recoupment. The Board will determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recouping excess Incentive Compensation hereunder which may include, without limitation: (a) requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive Compensation\npreviously paid; (b) seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity-based awards; (c) offsetting the recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the\nCompany to the Covered Executive; (d) cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and (e) taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Board.\n7. No Indemnification. The Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any incorrectly awarded Incentive Compensation.\n8. Interpretation. Covered Executive understands that the Board is authorized to interpret and construe the Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of the Policy and this Agreement. It is\nintended that the Policy be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act and any applicable rules or standards adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any national securities\nexchange on which the Company's securities are listed.\n9. Other Recoupment Rights. The Board intends that the Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The Board may require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement entered into on or after the\nEffective Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require a Covered Executive to execute this Agreement agreeing to the terms of the Policy. Any right of recoupment under the Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any\nother remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the\nCompany.\n10. Impracticability. The Board shall recover any excess Incentive Compensation in accordance with the Policy unless such recovery would be impracticable, as determined by Board after considering any applicable regulation of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and/or the listing standards of the national securities exchange on which the Company's securities are listed.\nAGREED TO as of the Effective Date.\nEXECUTIVE:\nBy: Title:\nEffective Date:\nExhibit 10.3(y)\nSeptember 25, 2018\nDear Raymond:\nWe are pleased to extend to you the following offer of employment with ADTRAN Inc., as a Chief Information Officer reporting to Thomas R.
