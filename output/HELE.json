Olive & June, founded in 2013, is an innovative, omni-channel nail care brand trailblazing the DIY nail revolution. Within the multi-billion-dollar beauty industry, Olive & June plays across all nail care categories: polish, artificial, tools, treatment, and care, delivering a salon-quality experience at home. Its consumer solutions-driven product innovation and digital-first model to engage and educate consumers drives brand loyalty and social media engagement well above the category averages. \n\nThe Olive & June acquisition is an excellent, complementary fit with Helen of Troy’s strategic goal of Continuing _Better Together_ M&A. Helen of Troy believes it can add value to Olive & June and use its scalable operating platform, while Olive & June can accelerate profitable growth for Helen of Troy by helping to further diversify its product offerings. As the Company continues to focus on elevating the health and performance of its core brand portfolio, it intends for Olive & June to operate in a _stand-alone but supported_ model, with the brand continuing to operate largely as it is operated today except in areas where the Company believes it can accelerate Olive & June’s momentum. \n\nThe total purchase consideration is expected to be $225 million in cash at closing, subject to certain customary closing adjustments, and a $15 million earnout subject to performance over three years. The total purchase price implies a multiple of less than 11x estimated calendar year 2025 adjusted EBITDA before synergies, which compares favorably to the Company’s recent transactions. The Company expects Olive & June’s calendar year 2024 net sales revenue to be approximately $92 million. \n\nThe acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to Helen of Troy’s revenue growth rate, gross profit margin, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted diluted EPS growth rate and free cash flow conversion. The Company expects its pro forma net leverage ratio (5) to be 3x or less at the estimated time of closing. In September 2024, the Company executed interest rate swaps on an additional $250 million of notional value with respect to its outstanding variable rate debt. The additional swaps fix the interest rate for the additional notional value at an average SOFR rate of 3.7% compared to current 30-day SOFR of 4.6% for an average period of 18 months from the date of execution. As of November 20, 2024, approximately 71% of the Company’s total debt is fixed at an average SOFR rate of 3.9% through February 2026. \n\nMs. Noel M. Geoffroy, Helen of Troy Chief Executive Officer, stated: “We could not be more excited to add Olive & June to our portfolio of leading brands and we welcome its passionate associates and visionary leadership team to the Helen of Troy family. We believe Olive & June is an excellent fit with Helen of Troy both strategically and financially. Olive & June’s innovation-driven performance, highly relevant vision of democratizing nail care for everyone, award-winning products and unique consumer engagement model are impressive and inspiring. We see significant opportunities to build on its strengths in consumer obsession and breakthrough commercial and product innovation, in addition to helping expand the brand’s availability with increased distribution. Olive & June complements our existing Beauty portfolio and broadens us beyond the Hair category, adding a consumables business that is both high growth and high margin. We look forward to working together to fully realize the potential of Olive & June.” \n\nMs. Sarah Gibson Tuttle, founder and CEO of Olive & June, said: “When I started Olive & June, the mission was simple: to make salon-quality nails accessible to everyone, everywhere. Thanks to our passionate team and loyal community, we have achieved incredible milestones—teaching millions how to do their nails at home and redefining what is possible in Beauty. Now, as we join the Helen of Troy family, a company known for elevating everyday experiences with innovative consumer products, I could not be more thrilled to lead this next chapter of growth for the brand. I have been deeply impressed by Noel’s visionary leadership and look forward to partnering with her and the entire Helen of Troy team. Together, we will continue to innovate, inspire, and deliver on our promise to be the go-to at-home nail solution for everyone, everywhere. I cannot wait to see all that we will accomplish together.” \n\nThe acquisition is expected to close before calendar year end 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. \n\n** Conference Call and Webcast **\n\nThe Company will conduct a teleconference tomorrow in conjunction with today's announcement.

To supplement its presentation, the Company discloses certain financial measures that may be considered non-GAAP such as EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted diluted EPS, free cash flow conversion, and pro forma net leverage ratio. The Company is unable to present quantitative reconciliations of its forward-looking pro forma net leverage ratio and Olive & June’s forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because such information is not available, and management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of such GAAP financial measures without unreasonable effort or expense. In addition, the Company believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. \n\n** Certain Defined Terms **\n\n(1)  |  Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as net income as reported under GAAP excluding the following items net of their applicable tax effects: acquisition-related expenses, Barbados tax reform, restructuring charges, amortization of intangible assets, and non-cash share-based compensation, as applicable, divided by the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of dilutive securities.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, acquisition-related expenses, restructuring charges, and non-cash share-based compensation.   \n(3)  |  Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales revenue.   \n(4)  |  Free Cash Flow Conversion is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital and intangible asset expenditures divided by EBITDA   \n(5)  |  Pro forma net leverage ratio is defined as the estimated net debt at the end of fiscal 2025 after giving effect to the acquisition, divided by Helen of Troy’s estimated fiscal 2025 pre-acquisition adjusted EBITDA plus the estimated pro forma adjusted EBITDA of the acquisition for the equivalent time period post-closing, as defined by Helen of Troy’s applicable debt covenants.​   \n  \n** About Helen of Troy Limited **\n\nHelen of Troy Limited (NASDAQ: HELE) is a leading global consumer products company offering creative products and solutions for its customers through a diversified portfolio of well-recognized and widely-trusted brands, including OXO, Hydro Flask, Osprey, Vicks, Braun, Honeywell, PUR, Hot Tools, Drybar, Curlsmith, and Revlon.

These factors were partially offset by Home & Outdoor growth in the home and insulated beverageware categories, international growth, and higher sales of fans and thermometers within Beauty & Wellness. \n\n\n  * Consolidated gross profit margin decreased 110 basis points to 45.6%, compared to 46.7%. The decrease in consolidated gross profit margin was primarily due to a less favorable product and customer mix within Home & Outdoor and unfavorable inventory obsolescence expense year-over-year. These factors were partially offset by lower commodity and product costs, partly driven by Project Pegasus initiatives. \n\n\n  * Consolidated selling, general and administrative expense (“SG&A”) ratio increased 140 basis points to 37.9%, compared to 36.5%. The increase in the consolidated SG&A ratio was primarily due to higher marketing expense as the Company reinvested back into its brands, unfavorable distribution center expense due to additional costs and lost efficiency associated with automation startup issues at the Tennessee distribution facility, and the impact of unfavorable operating leverage. These factors were partially offset by lower overall personnel expense, which includes the impact of lower annual incentive compensation expense. \n\n\n  * Consolidated operating income was $34.9 million, or 7.3% of net sales revenue, compared to $46.8 million, or 9.5% of net sales revenue. The 220 basis point decrease in consolidated operating margin was primarily due to an increase in the consolidated SG&A ratio and a decrease in consolidated gross profit margin, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring charges of $2.1 million. \n\n\n  * Interest expense was $13.2 million, compared to $13.7 million. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower average borrowings outstanding, partially offset by a higher average effective interest rate compared to the same period last year. \n\n\n  * Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 22.0% compared to 17.9%, primarily due to the impact of Barbados tax legislation enacted during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, shifts in the mix of income in various tax jurisdictions, and an increase in tax expense for discrete items. \n\n\n  * Net income was $17.0 million, compared to $27.4 million. Diluted EPS was $0.74, compared to $1.14. Diluted EPS decreased primarily due to lower operating income and an increase in the effective income tax rate, partially offset by lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding and a decrease in interest expense. \n\n\n  * Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $55.8 million, compared to $71.7 million. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.8% compared to 14.6%. \n\n\n\nOn an adjusted basis (non-GAAP) for the second quarters of fiscal 2025 and 2024, excluding the discrete impact of restructuring charges, amortization of intangible assets, and non-cash share-based compensation, as applicable: \n\n  * Adjusted operating income decreased $15.9 million, or 25.5%, to $46.4 million, or 9.8% of net sales revenue, compared to $62.3 million, or 12.7% of net sales revenue. The decrease in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by higher marketing expense, a less favorable product and customer mix within Home & Outdoor, unfavorable inventory obsolescence expense year-over-year, and the impact of unfavorable operating leverage. These factors were partially offset by lower overall personnel expense, which includes the impact of lower annual incentive compensation expense, and lower commodity and product costs, partly driven by Project Pegasus initiatives. \n\n\n  * Adjusted income decreased $14.2 million, or 34.1%, to $27.5 million, compared to $41.8 million. Adjusted diluted EPS decreased 30.5% to $1.21 compared to $1.74. The decrease in adjusted diluted EPS was primarily due to lower adjusted operating income and an increase in the adjusted effective income tax rate, partially offset by lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding and a decrease in interest expense. \n\n\n\n** Segment Results - Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 Compared to Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 **\n\nHome & Outdoor net sales revenue increased $2.0 million, or 0.8%, to $241.9 million, compared to $240.0 million. The increase was driven by an increase in sales in the insulated beverageware category, higher international sales primarily driven by new and expanded retailer distribution, and expanded retailer distribution in the home category. These factors were partially offset by softer consumer demand, lower replenishment orders from retail customers, and continued softness in technical packs and related accessories. \n\nHome & Outdoor operating income was $31.2 million, or 12.9% of segment net sales revenue, compared to $36.1 million, or 15.0% of segment net sales revenue. The decrease in segment operating margin was primarily due to unfavorable distribution center expense, a less favorable product and customer mix, and higher marketing expense as the segment reinvested back into its brands. These factors were partially offset by lower overall personnel expense, which includes the impact of lower annual incentive compensation expense, and favorable inventory obsolescence expense year-over-year. Adjusted operating income decreased 14.5% to $36.3 million, or 15.0% of segment net sales revenue, compared to $42.4 million, or 17.7% of segment net sales revenue. \n\nBeauty & Wellness net sales revenue decreased $19.3 million, or 7.7%, to $232.3 million, compared to $251.6 million. The decrease was driven by a decline in sales of hair appliances due to softer consumer demand, shifts in consumer spending and increased competition, lower sales of air purifiers and humidifiers driven by reduced replenishment orders from retail customers, and a decrease in water filtration product revenue due to the expiration of an out-license relationship. These factors were partially offset by fan and thermometer growth. \n\nBeauty & Wellness operating income was $3.7 million, or 1.6% of segment net sales revenue, compared to $10.7 million, or 4.3% of segment net sales revenue. The decrease in segment operating margin was primarily due to higher marketing expense as the segment reinvested back into its brands, unfavorable inventory obsolescence expense year-over-year, and the impact of unfavorable operating leverage. These factors were partially offset by lower commodity and product costs and lower overall personnel expense, which includes the impact of lower annual incentive compensation expense. Adjusted operating income decreased 48.9% to $10.2 million, or 4.4% of segment net sales revenue, compared to $19.9 million, or 7.9% of segment net sales revenue. \n\n** Balance Sheet and Cash Flow - Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 Compared to Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 **\n\n  * Cash and cash equivalents totaled $20.1 million, compared to $24.2 million. \n  * Accounts receivable turnover (5) was 69.0 days, compared to 67.9 days. \n  * Inventory was $469.6 million, compared to $435.7 million. \n  * Total short- and long-term debt was $713.2 million, compared to $844.9 million. \n  * Net cash provided by operating activities for the first six months of the fiscal year was $69.9 million, compared to $157.7 million for the same period last year. \n  * Free cash flow (1)(2) for the first six months of the fiscal year was $55.9 million, compared to $137.2 million for the same period last year. \n\n\n\n** Pegasus Restructuring Plan **\n\nThe Company previously announced a global restructuring plan intended to expand operating margins through initiatives designed to improve efficiency and effectiveness and reduce costs (collectively referred to as “Project Pegasus”). Project Pegasus includes multiple workstreams to further optimize the Company's brand portfolio, streamline and simplify the organization, accelerate and amplify cost of goods savings projects, enhance the efficiency of its supply chain network, optimize its indirect spending and improve its cash flow and working capital, as well as other activities. The Company anticipates these initiatives will create operating efficiencies, as well as provide a platform to fund future growth investments. \n\nAs previously disclosed, the Company continues to have the following expectations regarding Project Pegasus charges: \n\n  * Total one-time pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $50 million to $55 million over the duration of the plan, expected to be completed during fiscal 2025. \n  * Pre-tax restructuring charges to be comprised of approximately $15 million to $19 million of severance and employee related costs, $28 million of professional fees, $3 million to $4 million of contract termination costs, and $4 million of other exit and disposal costs. \n  * All of the Company's operating segments and shared services will be impacted by the plan and pre-tax restructuring charges include approximately $16 million to $17 million in Home & Outdoor and $34 million to $38 million in Beauty & Wellness. \n  * Pre-tax restructuring charges represent primarily cash expenditures, which are expected to be substantially paid by the end of fiscal 2025. \n\n\n\nThe Company also continues to have the following expectations regarding Project Pegasus savings: \n\n  * Targeted annualized pre-tax operating profit improvements of approximately $75 million to $85 million, which began in fiscal 2024 and are expected to be substantially achieved by the end of fiscal 2027. \n  * Estimated cadence of the recognition of the savings will be approximately 25% in fiscal 2024, which was achieved, approximately 35% in fiscal 2025, approximately 25% in fiscal 2026, and approximately 15% in fiscal 2027. \n  * Total profit improvements to be realized approximately 60% through reduced cost of goods sold and 40% through lower SG&A. \n\n\n\n** Fiscal 2025 Annual Outlook **\n\nThe Company continues to expect consolidated net sales revenue in the range of $1.885 billion to $1.935 billion, which implies a decline of 6.0% to 3.5%. The sales outlook continues to reflect the Company's view of lingering inflation and continued consumer spending softness, especially in certain discretionary categories, as well as its view of increased macro uncertainty, an increasingly stretched consumer, a more promotional environment, and retailers even more closely managing their inventory levels. The sales outlook reflects the impact of executional challenges in the Company's Tennessee distribution facility on sales that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the remediation efforts for the automation system were substantially completed, and the Company believes the impact on sales was minimal during the quarter. The Company now believes it is in a position to achieve targeted efficiency levels by the end of fiscal 2025. \n\nThe Company's fiscal year net sales outlook now reflects the following expectations by segment: \n\n  * Home & Outdoor net sales decline of 2.3% to growth of 1.4%, which includes the impact of shipping disruption in the Company's Tennessee distribution facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the prior expectation of a decline of 3.0% to 1.0%; and \n  * Beauty & Wellness net sales decline of 9.0% to 7.5%, compared to the prior expectation of a decline of 8.0% to 5.0%, both of which include a year-over-year headwind of approximately 1.0% related to the expiration of an out-license relationship in Wellness. \n\n\n\nThe Company continues to expect GAAP diluted EPS of $4.69 to $5.45 and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $7.00 to $7.50, which implies an adjusted diluted EPS decline of 21.4% to 15.8%. \n\nThe Company continues to expect adjusted EBITDA of $287 million to $297 million, which implies a decline of 14.6% to 11.8%, as benefits from Project Pegasus are reinvested for growth. The Company's outlook continues to reflect: \n\n  * a year-over-year increase in growth investment spending of approximately 100 basis points; \n  * a year-over-year headwind of approximately 50 basis points from the expiration of an out-license relationship in Wellness; \n  * margin compression of approximately 50 basis points from incremental operating expense and lost efficiency related to automation startup issues at its Tennessee distribution facility, compared to the prior expectation of 60 basis points; and \n  * margin compression from its view of a more promotional environment, a less favorable mix, and lower operating leverage due to the decline in revenue. \n\n\n\nThe Company continues to expect these factors to be partially offset by profit improvement actions implemented in the second quarter. \n\nThe Company now expects free cash flow (1)(2) in the range of $180 million to $200 million, compared to the previous range of $200 million to $240 million, and now expects its net leverage ratio (1)(3) , as defined in its credit agreement, to end fiscal 2025 at 1.90x to 1.80x, compared to the previous range of 1.60x to 1.50x. \n\nIn terms of the quarterly cadence of sales, the Company now expects a decline in net sales of approximately 4.5% to 1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. The Company now expects a decline in adjusted diluted EPS of approximately 10% to 3% in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. \n\nThe Company's consolidated net sales and EPS outlook also reflects the following assumptions: \n\n  * the severity of the cough/cold/flu season will be in line with pre-COVID historical averages; \n  * September 2024 foreign currency exchange rates will remain constant for the remainder of the fiscal year; \n  * expected interest expense in the range of $44.0 million to $46.0 million; \n  * a reported GAAP effective tax rate range of 27.3% to 29.5% for the full fiscal year 2025 and an adjusted effective tax rate range of 20.7% to 21.3%; and \n  * an estimated weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 23.1 million for the full year. \n\n\n\nThe likelihood, timing and potential impact of a significant or prolonged recession, any fiscal 2025 acquisitions and divestitures, future asset impairment charges, future foreign currency fluctuations, additional interest rate increases, or share repurchases are unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated; therefore, they are not included in the Company's outlook. \n\n** Conference Call and Webcast **\n\nThe Company will conduct a teleconference in conjunction with today's earnings release.

This press release contains non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, Adjusted Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow, and Net Leverage Ratio (“Non-GAAP Financial Measures”) that are discussed in the accompanying press release or in the preceding tables may be considered non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G, Rule 100. Accordingly, the Company is providing the preceding tables that reconcile these measures to their corresponding GAAP-based financial measures. The Company is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking expected net leverage ratio to its most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure because such information is not available, and management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of such GAAP financial measure without unreasonable effort or expense. In addition, the Company believes such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. The Company believes that these Non-GAAP Financial Measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. The Company believes that these Non-GAAP Financial Measures, in combination with the Company's financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP, provide investors with additional perspective regarding the impact of certain charges and benefits on applicable income, margin and earnings per share measures. The Company also believes that these Non-GAAP Financial Measures facilitate a more direct comparison of the Company's performance with its competitors. The Company further believes that including the excluded charges and benefits would not accurately reflect the underlying performance of the Company's operations for the period in which the charges and benefits were incurred and reflected in the Company's GAAP financial results. The material limitation associated with the use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures is that the Non-GAAP Financial Measures do not reflect the full economic impact of the Company's activities. These Non-GAAP Financial Measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not an alternative to GAAP financial measures, and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by other companies. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on non-GAAP financial measures.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less capital and intangible asset expenditures.   \n(3)  |  Net leverage ratio is calculated as (a) total borrowings under the Company's credit agreement plus outstanding letters of credit, net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, including readily marketable obligations issued, guaranteed or insured by the U.S. with maturities of two years or less, at the end of the current period, divided by (b) Adjusted EBITDA per the Company's credit agreement (calculated as EBITDA plus non-cash charges and certain allowed addbacks, less certain non-cash income, plus the pro forma effect of acquisitions and certain pro forma run-rate cost savings for acquisitions and dispositions, as applicable for the trailing twelve months ended as of the current period).   \n(4)  |  Organic business refers to net sales revenue associated with product lines or brands after the first twelve months from the date the product line or brand is acquired, excluding the impact that foreign currency remeasurement had on reported net sales revenue. Net sales revenue from internally developed brands or product lines is considered Organic business activity.   \n(5)  |  Accounts receivable turnover uses 12 month trailing net sales revenue. The current and four prior quarters' ending balances of trade accounts receivable are used for the purposes of computing the average balance component as required by the particular measure.   \n(6)  |  Domestic net sales revenue includes net sales revenue from the U.S. and Canada.   \n(7)  |  Represents a charge for uncollectible receivables due to the bankruptcy of Bed, Bath & Beyond (“Bed, Bath & Beyond bankruptcy”).   \n(8)  |  Gain on the sale of distribution and office facilities in El Paso, Texas during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024.   \n(9)  |  Represents a discrete tax charge to revalue existing deferred tax liabilities as a result of Barbados enacting a domestic corporate income tax rate of 9%, effective beginning with the Company's fiscal year 2025 (“Barbados tax reform”).   \n(10)  |  See reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP-based financial measure (net income) in the accompanying tables to this press release.   \n(11)  |  Income tax effect of adjustments is inclusive of the Barbados tax reform income tax adjustment.   \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241009133765r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**Investor Contact:** Helen of Troy Limited Anne Rakunas, Director, External Communications (915) 225-4841 \n\nICR, Inc.

These nails are incredibly thick and durable, had\nno chipping, and stayed put for 18 days — the longest amount\nof time press-ons have ever lasted on me. They did start to lift\na bit at the cuticle after about a week; they still looked just as\ngood, but I found my hair sometimes getting caught in them\nwhen I ran my fingers through it.
