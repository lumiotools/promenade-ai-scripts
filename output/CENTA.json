Distribution business,\n\nWe have recently announced that we have sold our Independent Garden Distribution business to BFG Supply. \n\nSelling this portion of our business will allow Central Garden & Pet to focus on our core competencies while continuing a relationship for our Garden branded products with a world-class distributor, BFG.​ \n\nBFG is bringing many of our trusted sales team members on board as part of this agreement, and we will have representatives in place to help assist in the transition, answer your questions, and ensure we minimize disruption to your business. Your representative will be engaged and working closely with you and your teams to ensure a seamless transition of contracts, order communications, and product supply. \n\nAdditionally, as a result of this transaction, Central will not be hosting a trade show this year. We will be working closely with BFG to ensure that you have access to their virtual and in-person shows, where you should expect to see all the great deals you have come to expect and more. ​ \n\nWe remain committed to providing both the highest quality products and service in the industry and are proud to have you as our customer. \n\nExcerpts taken out of an email announcement from:\n\nJD Walker\n\nPresident, Garden Consumer Products, Central Garden & Pet\n"

Distribution business,\n\nWe have recently announced that we have sold our Independent Garden Distribution business to BFG Supply. \n\nSelling this portion of our business will allow Central Garden & Pet to focus on our core competencies while continuing a relationship for our Garden branded products with a world-class distributor, BFG.​ \n\nBFG is bringing many of our trusted sales team members on board as part of this agreement, and we will have representatives in place to help assist in the transition, answer your questions, and ensure we minimize disruption to your business. Your representative will be engaged and working closely with you and your teams to ensure a seamless transition of contracts, order communications, and product supply. \n\nAdditionally, as a result of this transaction, Central will not be hosting a trade show this year. We will be working closely with BFG to ensure that you have access to their virtual and in-person shows, where you should expect to see all the great deals you have come to expect and more. ​ \n\nWe remain committed to providing both the highest quality products and service in the industry and are proud to have you as our customer. \n\nExcerpts taken out of an email announcement from:\n\nJD Walker\n\nPresident, Garden Consumer Products, Central Garden & Pet\n"
