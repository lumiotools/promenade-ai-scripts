(the “Tokyo Stock Exchange”) Standard Market. In this regard, CUMICA may\nconstitute “a company that has entered into a grace period pertaining to loss of status of being a substantive\nsurviving company due to a merger, etc.” under the Delisting Criteria of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, but even if\ndesignated as a company that has entered into a grace period, we will do our best to ensure that CUMICA is found\nto satisfy criteria equivalent to the initial listing examination criteria.\nIn addition, CUMICA plans to submit a proposal to amend the Articles of Incorporation (the “Articles of\nIncorporation Amendment”) to change the trade name (the “Trade Name Change”) and to change the head office\nlocation and the total number of authorized shares, etc. at CUMICA’s extraordinary general meeting of\nshareholders scheduled to be held on February 14, 2025, subject to the Share Exchange taking effect.\n2\nParticulars\nI. Regarding Management Integration Through the Share Exchange\n1. Background and Purpose of the Management Integration\nCUMICA operates in the development and sales of family condominiums, primarily in Saitama Prefecture. Its\ncondominium brands, BELLE DEMEURE and BELJOUR, are particularly noted for their high quality and\nenvironmental considerations, showcasing its advanced construction techniques. CUMICA has operated real estate\ndevelopment and construction business while leveraging its unique creativity and cost-effective business model\ndeveloped through 40 years of condominium development focused on local communities.\nSYLA, with its mission of “democratizing real estate investment around the world and enriching the 100-year\nlife era with technology and asset management,” engages in the proptech business centered on asset management\nplatform “Rimawari-kun,” development and operation of Rimawari-kun AI, and real estate development business\nincluding the SYFORME series.\nRecent years have seen rapid changes to the external environment surrounding us, with accelerating movement\nof the currents that influence long-term economic trends, such as decarbonization, decrease in the working\npopulation, technological progress, urbanization, rapidly rising construction costs, and a rise in market interest\nrates. With these changes in the external environment comes the need for the real estate industry to transform its\ntraditional business model and respond to rapid market changes. Even traditional real estate development is facing\nsignificant challenges, including more efficient development processes, project management with limited\npersonnel, timely information sharing and utilization, and mutual utilization of human resources. In this\nenvironment, the two companies entered into a capital and business alliance agreement on January 23, 2024 with\nthe aim of creating business synergies by leveraging their respective strengths and expertise and complementing\neach other’s business models. Specifically, in April 2024, CUMICA promoted collaboration between the\ncompanies by subscribing for the third-party allotment for a capital increase by SYLA’s wholly-owned subsidiary\nSYLA Co., Ltd. in order to promote joint projects by CUMICA and SYLA and to share SYLA’s condominium\ndevelopment expertise. In addition, in August 2024, from the perspective of raising funds and strengthening\nCUMICA’s financial base, SYLA sought to further strengthen the relationship by subscribing to shares of\nCUMICA’s capital increase through third-party allotment.\nIn the actual collaboration between CUMICA and SYLA, the two companies have been exploring the\ndevelopment of new products such as Combined Residence (a blend of family and single-room layouts within a\nsingle building) and Senior Tech Mansion (nursing care × IoT senior tech condominium). In addition, a wide\nrange of other collaborations have also been carried out, including SYLA providing CUMICA with operational\nsupport such as business administration and information system services, as well as financial support. However,\nCUMICA’s business base and the business environment surrounding CUMICA have become highly unstable due\nto changes in the external environment caused by background factors such as high procurement costs due to the\nongoing sharp depreciation in the yen, putting CUMICA in a difficult position, the current collaboration\nframework is not expected to be sufficient to realize further synergies, and CUMICA’s business performance has\ncontinued to decline recently. Specifically, CUMICA’s sales for the fiscal year ended May 2024 decreased\napproximately 36% from the previous year to approximately 4.8 billion yen, and operating income decreased\napproximately 73% from the previous year to approximately 300 million yen. Furthermore, forecasts for the\ncurrent fiscal year ending May 2025 have been repeatedly revised downward, with sales expected to be\napproximately 4.7 billion yen and operating income expected to be approximately 140 million yen, a further\ndecrease compared to last year.\nBased on CUMICA’s business performance mentioned above and the situation that most of CUMICA’s\nbusiness operations depend on SYLA, in order to further stabilize CUMICA’s business base and create a growth\nstrategy together with CUMICA, SYLA came to the understanding that it was essential to integrate the\nmanagement of both companies, and held repeated discussions within SYLA regarding management integration\nwith CUMICA. During the course of those discussions, SYLA came to believe that it would be possible to build\nan efficient management system and establish a business base that is unaffected by the environment with the goal\nof improving the profitability of the entire group and strengthening corporate structure by integrating the\nmanagement resources of both companies by means of implementing a share exchange in which CUMICA\n3\nbecomes the share exchange wholly-owning parent company and SYLA becomes the share exchange wholly-\nowned subsidiary, and moved forward with examining the Share Exchange. Specifically, SYLA came to the\nconclusion that, from the perspective of the nature of both companies’ business – namely that they both conduct\ntheir business in Japan – which of the two companies would be best to be delisted after the integration, and as a\nresult of comprehensive consideration from the perspective of the realization of a more nimble growth strategy\nafter the integration and the impact, etc. on the interests of CUMICA’s minority shareholders and SYLA’s\nshareholders, the best option was to aim to improve corporate value for the group as a whole by implementing\nmanagement with further group integration by means such as making SYLA a wholly-owned subsidiary through a\nshare exchange, optimizing the group-wide organizational structure, optimizing personnel, expanding business\nopportunities through information aggregation, consolidating duplicate operations at each location, and achieving\nan optimal financial strategy for the group as a whole, and on September 18, 2024, SYLA proposed the Share\nExchange to CUMICA.\nIn response to SYLA’s above proposal, CUMICA began concrete examination of the Share Exchange. In\naddition, when it began concrete examination of the Share Exchange, because SYLA is CUMICA’s largest\nshareholder that is its major shareholder and otherwise related company, and CUMICA has two directors who are\ndispatched to it from SYLA, on September 24, 2024, CUMICA established a special committee (the “Special\nCommittee”) comprising independent members without an interest in SYLA, CUMICA’s largest shareholder that\nis its major shareholder and otherwise related company, in order to eliminate the risk of a structural conflict of\ninterest with SYLA and conduct examination of the Share Exchange from a standpoint independent from SYLA\nand CUMICA to eliminate the risk of arbitrariness and conflict of interest in the decision-making process for the\nShare Exchange by CUMICA’s board of directors, ensure the fairness of the Share Exchange, and obtain an\nopinion as to whether a decision by CUMICA’s board of directors to carry out the Share Exchange would be\ndisadvantageous to minority shareholders, and also put in place a framework for specific examination, such as\nengaging outside experts. As a result of carefully examining SYLA’s proposal under this framework, CUMICA\ncame to the understanding that the Share Exchange would contribute to the improvement of CUMICA’s corporate\nvalue because the Share Exchange would facilitate closer collaboration between both companies’ groups and\nspeed up management decision-making by optimizing the group-wide organizational structure and make it\npossible to create new business opportunities and therefore achieve a more nimble management strategy for both\ncompanies’ groups from a medium- to long-term perspective by further leveraging management resources such as\nthe human resources, assets, technology, and expertise of both companies’ groups and implementing an optimal\nfinancial strategy for the group as a whole.\nAs a result of the above examination by both companies, CUMICA and SYLA agreed that in order to nimbly\nadapt to significant changes to the environment, further break new ground in the field of advanced real estate\nbusiness, realize the business of both companies at a high level with speed, and continue to expand the business\nbase and strengthen the financial base, it is necessary to promote their business as one team based on a unified\nvision and philosophy through the Management Integration, and came to the conclusion that it is necessary to\nintegrate the management of both companies as soon as possible with commitment on both sides in order to build\na close collaborative and capital relationship and came to execute the Share Exchange Agreement.\nThe strengths of CUMICA’s real estate development, construction, and real estate sales businesses lie in a\nnetwork of business partners and community-based services, while those of SYLA’s real estate and crowdfunding\nbusinesses can be found in technology, such as procurement and funding using real estate crowdfunding, and\npurchasing and sales utilizing AI and big data. Through the Management Integration, the companies will\naccelerate the realization of synergies by leveraging mutual strengths in their respective businesses going forward.\nAt the same time, by optimizing the group-wide organizational structure, optimizing personnel, expanding\nbusiness opportunities through information aggregation, consolidating duplicate operations at each location, and\nimplementing an optimal financial strategy for the group as a whole, the two companies will integrate their\nmanagement resources to build an efficient management system and work toward improving the profitability of\nthe entire group and strengthening corporate structure with the goal of creating a business base that is unaffected\nby the environment.\n2.

Furthermore, the above share exchange ratio may, if a significant change has\noccurred in the various conditions that form the basis of the calculation, be changed by\nagreement after consultation between CUMICA and SYLA.\n(Note 2) Number of shares of common stock to be delivered through the Share Exchange\nAt the time of the Share Exchange, CUMICA shall allot and deliver to shareholders of\nSYLA at the time immediately before the time of CUMICA’s acquisition of all SYLA Shares\nthrough the Share Exchange (the “Reference Time”) (however, this refers to shareholders after\n5\nthe cancellation of the treasury shares as set forth below) a number of CUMICA Shares\ncalculated based on the exchange ratio in the table above in exchange for the SYLA Shares\nheld by such shareholders. CUMICA plans to allot newly issued common shares.\nIn addition, by resolution at a SYLA Board of Directors meeting held by the day before the\neffective date of the Share Exchange, SYLA plans to cancel at the time immediately before the\nReference Time all of the treasury shares (including treasury shares acquired by SYLA\nthrough purchase of shares related to a share purchase demand exercised pursuant to the\nprovisions of Article 785(1) of the Companies Act upon the Share Exchange) held as of the\ntime immediately before the Reference Time. The total number of CUMICA Shares to be\nallotted and delivered through the Share Exchange may be revised going forward depending\non the number of treasury shares that SYLA holds by the time immediately before the\nReference Time, etc.\nFurthermore, the above “Number of shares to be delivered through the Share Exchange”\nassumes that the share options issued by SYLA that are in a condition allowing exercise are all\nexercised by the day before the effective date of the Share Exchange, and if some or all of the\nshare options have not been exercised, the number of shares to be delivered through the Share\nExchange will decrease.\n(Note 3) Handling of CUMICA Shares held by SYLA\nSYLA already holds CUMICA Shares (3,688,300 shares) and will come to hold shares of the\nwholly-owning parent company CUMICA due to the Share Exchange taking effect, but after\nthe effective date of the Share Exchange, the relevant shares, including dividends in kind to\nCUMICA, are planned to be disposed of at an appropriate time in accordance with the\nprovisions of the Companies Act.\n(Note 4) Handling of shares less than one unit\nSYLA shareholders who hold CUMICA shares constituting less than one unit (less than 100\nshares) as a result of the Share Exchange will not be able to sell such shares less than one unit\non a financial instruments exchange market, but may avail themselves of the following system\nfor CUMICA’s shares less than one unit.\nSystem for purchasing shares less than one unit (sale of shares less than one unit)\nThis system allows holders to demand that CUMICA purchase shares less than one unit\nthat they hold based on the provisions of Article 192(1) of the Companies Act.\n(4) Handling of share options and bonds with share options associated with the Share Exchange\nAs share options remaining as of this date, SYLA has issued the share options set forth in the column\nof “Share options issued by SYLA” in the table below (6,255 in total, with the number of underlying\nSYLA Shares being 48,176 shares in total) (The Series 2 share options and Series 11 share options that\nwere issued by SYLA in the past have expired, and it has not issued any bonds with share options).\nShare options issued by SYLA Share options issued by CUMICA\nNumber of\nNumber of Number of\nNumber of Exercise underlying Exercise\nunderlying share\nSeries No. share price Series No. Shares price\nShares options\noptions (Note 2) (Note 3) (Note 2)\n(Note 1) (Note 3)\n(Note 4)\nSeries 1 132 13,200 8,000 yen Series 1 132 1,452,000 73 yen\nSeries 3 10 1,000 8,000 yen – – – –\nSeries 4 2 200 11,600 yen Series 2 2 22,000 106 yen\nSeries 5 283 28,300 8,000 yen Series 3 283 3,113,000 73 yen\nSeries 6 415 415 33,320 yen Series 4 415 45,650 303 yen\nSeries 7 810 810 45,140 yen Series 5 810 89,100 411 yen\nSeries 8 50 50 48,060 yen Series 6 50 5,500 437 yen\nSeries 9 3,211 2,889 Amount of Series 7 3,211 317,889 0.00009\n6\n0.01 USD USD\nconverted converted\ninto JPY at into JPY at\nthe the\nexchange exchange\nrate on the rate on the\ndate of date of\nexercise exercise\n0.09 USD\nconverted\ninto JPY at\nthe\nSeries 10 1,312 1,312 10 USD Series 8 1,312 144,320\nexchange\nrate on the\ndate of\nexercise\n(Note 1) The class of underlying shares is SYLA Shares. The above table presents the number of\nshares to be acquired that is obtained by multiplying the number of shares of the\nunderlying SYLA Shares per share option for each series by the number of share options.\n(Note 2) The exercise price of a share option is the amount to be paid per share upon exercise of the\nshare option. It may be subject to adjustment.\n(Note 3) If any of the share options issued by SYLA that are exercisable are exercised, the number\nof share options issued by CUMICA and the number of underlying shares to be issued\nupon exercise of such share options will decrease in proportion to the number of such\nshare options exercised.\n(Note 4) The class of underlying shares is CUMICA Shares. The above table presents the number of\nshares to be acquired that is obtained by multiplying the number of shares of the\nunderlying CUMICA Shares per share option for each series by the number of share\noptions.\nIn the Share Exchange, as set forth in the above table, CUMICA will respectively allot Series 1\nthrough Series 8 share options issued by CUMICA to the share option holders pertaining to the Series 1\nand Series 4 to 10 Share Options issued by SYLA as of the Reference Time for each such share option\nthat they hold based on the details of each share option and the share exchange ratio of the Share\nExchange.\nThe time limit for exercise of the Series 3 share options issued by SYLA is December 30, 2024, and\nbecause they will be extinguished before the Share Exchange takes effect, whether or not the share\noptions are exercised, they are not subject to allotment of CUMICA’s share options.\nThrough this process, CUMICA plans to acquire in the Share Exchange the Series 1 and Series 4 to\n10 Share Options issued by SYLA as of the Reference Time and at the same time allot and deliver\nnewly issued Series 1 through Series 8 CUMICA share options. CUMICA plans to cancel the above\nacquired Series 1 and Series 4 to 10 Share Options issued by SYLA.\n3. Basis, etc. for the Details of Allotment Pertaining to the Share Exchange\n(1) Basis and reasons for the allotment\nTo ensure fairness and appropriateness in determining the share exchange ratio used in the Share\nExchange described above in 2.(3) “Details of allotment related to the Share Exchange” (the “Share\nExchange Ratio”), CUMICA and SYLA have each appointed a third-party calculation agent and various\nadvisors independent from both companies.\nSpecifically, CUMICA has appointed KK Stand by C (“StandbyC”) as its third-party calculation\nagent, Mita Securities Co., Ltd. (“Mita Securities”) as its financial advisor, and TMI Associates (“TMI”)\nas its legal advisor, and SYLA has appointed PwC Advisory LLC (“PwC”) as its financial advisor and\nthird-party calculation agent, and DT Legal (“DTL”) and Allen Overy Shearman Sterling GKJ (“AOS”)\n7\nas its legal advisors.\nAfter careful discussion and consideration by CUMICA based on the contents of the calculation\nreport regarding the share exchange ratio obtained from its third-party calculation agent StandbyC, the\nfact that the Share Exchange Ratio is within the range of the calculation results using the DCF method in\nthe calculation report, and advice from its financial advisor Mita Securities and its legal advisor TMI as\ndescribed in (4) “Measures to ensure fairness” below, and the report, etc. received from the special\ncommittee that has no interest in SYLA as described in (5) “Measures to avoid conflict of interest”\nbelow, CUMICA has concluded that the Share Exchange Ratio is appropriate and will contribute to the\ninterests of CUMICA shareholders, and has therefore determined that it is appropriate to carry out the\nShare Exchange based on the Share Exchange Ratio.\nAfter careful discussion and consideration by SYLA based on advice, etc. from its financial advisor\nand third-party calculation agent PwC and from DTL and AOS as described in (4) “Measures to ensure\nfairness” below, SYLA has concluded that the Share Exchange Ratio is appropriate based on the fact\nthat it is within the range of the calculation results using the DCF method in the calculation report\nprepared by PwC and will contribute to the interests of SYLA shareholders, and has therefore\ndetermined that it is appropriate to carry out the Share Exchange based on the Share Exchange Ratio.\nIn addition to the above, after careful examination based on the results of due diligence, etc.\nconducted by each company on the other company and comprehensive consideration of factors such as\nCUMICA and SYLA’s finances, assets, and future prospects, etc., CUMICA and SYLA have held\nrepeated negotiations and consultations with each other.\nAs a result, CUMICA and SYLA have determined that the Share Exchange Ratio is appropriate and\nwill contribute to the interests of their respective shareholders, and have therefore executed the Share\nExchange Agreement between the two companies with the approval of their respective Boards of\nDirectors.\n(2) Matters related to calculation\n(i) Name of calculation agents and relationship with both companies\nCUMICA’s third-party calculation agent StandbyC and SYLA’s third-party calculation agent PwC\nare both calculation agents independent of CUMICA and SYLA, do not constitute affiliated parties of\nCUMICA or SYLA, and have no material interests that should be stated regarding the Share Exchange.\n(ii) Overview of calculation\nStandbyC, in its calculation with respect to CUMICA, respectively adopted the average market price\nmethod, because CUMICA is listed on a financial instruments exchange and has a market stock price,\nand in addition, the discounted cash flow method (the “DCF Method”) to reflect the status of future\nbusiness activities in the evaluation.\nIn the average market price method, using the calculation reference date of November 29, 2024 as the\nreference date, StandbyC used the closing price on the reference date, and the simple average of closing\nprices for the five most recent business days, the most recent month, the three most recent months, and\nthe six most recent months before the reference date for CUMICA Shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange\nStandard Market.\nIn the DCF Method, with respect to CUMICA, the calculation was made by discounting future cash\nflows based on the financial forecasts for the periods from the fiscal year ending May 31, 2025 to the\nfiscal year ending May 31, 2027 prepared by CUMICA to the present value using a certain discount\nrate. The profit plan that constituted the assumptions for calculation includes business years in which a\nsignificant increase or decrease in profits is expected. Specifically, for the fiscal year ending May 31,\n2025, due to the current low level of acquisition of real estate for development and sale, operating\nincome is expected to be 143 million yen, a decrease by approximately 52% from 295 million yen in the\nprevious fiscal year, and net income is expected to be 79 million yen, a decrease by approximately 63%\nfrom 213 million yen in the previous fiscal year. In addition, for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2026,\ndue to the continued weakness in the acquisition of real estate for sale, operating income is expected to\n8\nbe 61 million yen, a decrease by approximately 58% from 143 million yen in the previous fiscal year,\nand net income is expected to be 21 million yen, a decrease by approximately 73% from 79 million yen\nin the previous fiscal year. In addition, for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2027, due to a recovery\nresulting from the re-strengthening of the development business, operating income is expected to be 195\nmillion yen, an increase by approximately 223% from 61 million yen in the previous fiscal year, and net\nincome is expected to be 116 million yen, an increase by approximately 441% from 21 million yen in\nthe previous fiscal year. In addition, the financial forecasts do not assume the implementation of the\nShare Exchange.\nWith respect to SYLA, StandbyC respectively adopted the average market price method, because\nSYLA’s ADSs are listed on the U.S. Nasdaq stock market and have a market stock price, and also the\nDCF Method to reflect the status of future business activities in the evaluation.\nIn the average market price method, using the calculation reference date of November 29, 2024 as the\nreference date, StandbyC used the closing price on the reference date, and the simple average of closing\nprices for the five most recent business days, the most recent month, the three most recent months, and\nthe six most recent months before the reference date for SYLA ADSs on the U.S. Nasdaq stock market.\nIn the DCF Method, with respect to SYLA, the calculation was made by discounting future cash\nflows based on the financial forecasts for the periods from the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 to\nthe fiscal year ending December 31, 2026 prepared by SYLA to the present value using a certain\ndiscount rate. The profit plan that constituted the assumptions for calculation includes business years in\nwhich a significant increase or decrease in profits is expected. Specifically, for the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2026, due to the plan to sell multiple properties with high profitability, operating income\n(consolidated) is expected to be 3.389 billion yen, an increase by 80% from 1.887 billion yen in the\nprevious fiscal year, and net income (consolidated) is expected to be 1.846 billion yen, an increase by\napproximately 129% from 808 million yen in the previous fiscal year. In addition, the financial forecasts\ndo not assume the implementation of the Share Exchange.\nThe share exchange ratio calculation results for each evaluation method when the value per share of\nCUMICA Shares is set as one are as follows. For SYLA Shares in the average market price method,\nsince SYLA ADSs are quoted in U.S. dollars and 100 SYLA ADSs equal one SYLA Share, the share\nexchange ratio is calculated upon converting the closing price or the simple average of closing prices for\none SYLA ADS to Japanese yen using the U.S. dollar rate (1 USD = 150.74 yen) on the reference date\nand making a unit conversion by multiplying by 100.\nMethod used Share exchange ratio calculation range\nAverage market price method 52.09 – 81.93\nDCF Method 93.75 – 228.61\nIn calculating the above share exchange ratio, StandbyC has in principle used the information\nprovided by both companies and publicly available information, etc. as-is, and has assumed that all of\nthe materials and information, etc. used are accurate and complete and that there are no facts\nundisclosed to StandbyC that could have a material impact on the calculation of the share exchange\nratio, and has not independently verified the accuracy and completeness of the materials and\ninformation. Furthermore, StandbyC has not independently evaluated, appraised, or assessed the assets\nor liabilities (including contingent liabilities) of the two companies and their affiliated companies,\nincluding the analysis and evaluation of individual assets and liabilities, and has not requested appraisals\nor assessments from third-party organizations. StandbyC’s share exchange ratio calculation reflects the\ninformation and economic conditions as of November 29, 2024 (however, until the end of trading on the\nU.S. Nasdaq stock market on November 29 U.S. time for SYLA ADSs), and assumes that the financial\nforecasts of each company have been reasonably considered or prepared based on the best forecasts and\njudgments available at the present time by the management of each company.\n9\nPwC, in its calculation with respect to CUMICA, respectively adopted the market price standard\nmethod, because CUMICA is listed on a financial instruments exchange and has a market stock price, as\nwell as the DCF Method to reflect the status of future business activities in the evaluation.\nIn the market price standard method, using November 29, 2024 as the reference date, PwC used the\nclosing price on the reference date, the simple average closing price and volume weighted average price\nfor the most recent month up to the reference date, and the simple average closing price and volume\nweighted average price for the three most recent months up to the reference date for CUMICA Shares\non the Tokyo Stock Exchange Standard Market.\nIn the DCF Method, with respect to CUMICA, the calculation was made by discounting future cash\nflows expected to be generated from the second quarter of the fiscal year ending May 31, 2025 onwards\nbased on various factors such as the business plan for the period from the fiscal year ending May 31,\n2025 to the fiscal year ending May 31, 2027 prepared by CUMICA, interviews with CUMICA, and\ninformation released to the public to the present value using a certain discount rate. It is stated that\nCUMICA’s business plan used by PwC in the calculation using the DCF Method includes business\nyears in which a significant increase or decrease in profits is expected. Specifically, for the fiscal year\nending May 31, 2025, operating income is expected to be 143 million yen, a decrease by approximately\n52% from 295 million yen in the previous fiscal year, and net income is expected to be 79 million yen, a\ndecrease by approximately 63% from 213 million yen in the previous fiscal year, due to the delay of real\nestate sales expected in the second half of the fiscal year ending May 31, 2025 to the following fiscal\nyear. Also, for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2026, operating income is expected to be 61 million yen, a\ndecrease by approximately 58% from 143 million yen in the previous fiscal year, and net income is\nexpected to be 21 million yen, a decrease by approximately 73% from 79 million yen in the previous\nfiscal year, due mainly to a slump in the development business. In addition, for the fiscal year ending\nMay 31, 2027, operating income is expected to be 195 million yen, an increase by approximately 223%\nfrom 61 million yen in the previous fiscal year, and net income is expected to be 116 million yen, an\nincrease by 441% from 21 million yen in the previous fiscal year, due to a re-strengthening of the\ndevelopment business. In addition, CUMICA’s financial forecasts that constitute the assumptions for\nPwC’s analysis using the DCF Method do not assume the implementation of the Share Exchange.\nWith respect to SYLA, PwC adopted each of the market price standard method, because SYLA ADSs\nare listed on the U.S. Nasdaq stock market and have a market stock price, and in addition, the DCF\nMethod to reflect the status of future business activities in the evaluation.\nIn the market price standard method, using November 29, 2024 as the reference date, PwC used the\nclosing price on the reference date, the simple average closing price and volume weighted average price\nfor the most recent month up to the reference date, and the simple average closing price and volume\nweighted average price for the three most recent months up to the reference date for SYLA ADSs on the\nU.S. Nasdaq stock market.\nIn the DCF Method, with respect to SYLA, the calculation was made by discounting future cash\nflows expected to be generated from the second half of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024\nonwards based on various factors such as the business plan for the period from the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2024 to the fiscal year ending December 31, 2026 prepared by SYLA, interviews with\nSYLA, and information released to the public to the present value using a certain discount rate. It is\nstated that the profit plan used by PwC in the calculation using the DCF Method includes business years\nin which a significant increase in profits is expected. Specifically, for the fiscal year ending December\n31, 2026, operating income is expected to be 3.389 billion yen, an increase by approximately 80% from\n1.887 billion yen in the previous fiscal year, and net income is expected to be 1.846 billion yen, an\nincrease by approximately 129% from 808 million yen in the previous fiscal year, due to an\nimprovement in profit margins due to insourcing of real estate construction and growth in the\ncrowdfunding business, in addition to the growth and expansion of the real estate development business.\nIn addition, SYLA’s financial forecasts that constitute the assumptions for PwC’s analysis using the\nDCF Method do not assume the implementation of the Share Exchange.\nThe share exchange ratio calculation results for each evaluation method when the value per share of\n10\nCUMICA Shares is set as one are as follows. For SYLA Shares in the market price standard method,\nsince the trading values of SYLA ADSs are quoted in US dollars and 100 SYLA ADSs equal one SYLA\nShare, the share exchange ratio is calculated upon converting the closing price, the simple average of\nclosing prices, or volume weighted average price for one SYLA ADS to Japanese yen using the U.S.\ndollar rate (1 USD = 150.74 yen) on the reference date and making a unit conversion by multiplying by\n100.\nMethod used Share exchange ratio calculation range\nMarket price standard method 66.30 – 79.22\nDCF Method 97.55 – 118.04\nIn calculating the above share exchange ratio, PwC has in principle used the information provided by\nboth companies and publicly available information, etc. as-is, and has assumed that all of the materials\nand information, etc. used are accurate and complete and that there are no facts undisclosed to PwC that\ncould have a material impact on the calculation of the share exchange ratio, and has not independently\nverified the accuracy and completeness of the materials and information. In addition, PwC has assumed\nthat the information pertaining to the financial forecasts of both companies (including the business plans\nand other information) has been reasonably prepared based on the best forecasts and judgments\navailable at the present time by the management teams of both companies. Furthermore, PwC has not\nindependently evaluated, appraised, or assessed the assets or liabilities (including off-balance sheet\nassets and liabilities and other contingent liabilities) of the two companies and their affiliated\ncompanies, including the analysis and evaluation of individual assets and liabilities, and has not\nrequested appraisals or assessments from third-party organizations. PwC’s share exchange ratio\ncalculation reflects the information and economic conditions as of November 29, 2024.\nFurthermore, the sole purpose of PwC's calculation is to serve as a reference for SYLA's Board of\nDirectors to consider the Share Exchange Ratio.\n(3) Expected delisting and reasons therefor\nSince SYLA will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of CUMICA on the effective date of June 1,\n2025 (scheduled) as a result of the Share Exchange, SYLA’s ADSs are scheduled to be delisted on May\n29, 2025 (U.S. time) after completing the U.S. Nasdaq stock market’s prescribed procedures. After\ndelisting, SYLA ADSs will no longer be able to be traded on the U.S. Nasdaq stock market.\nThe CUMICA Shares to be allotted to SYLA shareholders through the Share Exchange are listed on\nthe Tokyo Stock Exchange Standard Market, and trading will be possible on that market even after the\nShare Exchange, so for SYLA shareholders who will receive allotment of CUMICA Shares, although\nthere is a possibility that shares less than one unit may be allotted depending on the number of shares\nheld, it will be possible to trade CUMICA Shares of one unit or more on the Tokyo Stock Exchange\nStandard Market, and it is believed that stock liquidity can be ensured.\nIn order for those holding SYLA ADSs to receive an allotment of CUMICA Shares in the Share\nExchange, they must, prior to the effective date of the Share Exchange, receive the SYLA Shares\nrepresented by the SYLA ADSs in place of the SYLA ADSs in accordance with the procedures\nestablished by The Bank of New York Mellon, the depositary bank for the SYLA ADSs (the\n“Depositary Bank”). Investors who hold SYLA ADSs as of the effective date will not receive CUMICA\nShares in the Share Exchange, but rather, the CUMICA Shares allocated to the Depositary Bank in the\nShare Exchange (with respect to SYLA Shares represented by the SYLA ADSs) will be sold on the\nmarket etc. by the Depositary Bank, and the proceeds from such sale will be delivered to such investors\nin accordance with the provisions of the deposit agreement related to the SYLA ADSs, in accordance\nwith the percentage of SYLA ADSs held and after predetermined fees and expenses have been\nexcluded. Due to factors such as the aforementioned fees or expenses, fluctuations in the share price of\nCUMICA Shares after the effective date of the share exchange, and fluctuations in the exchange rate\n11\nbetween the Japanese yen and the US dollar, such amount may differ from the market value of\nCUMICA Shares as of the effective date if SYLA ADSs held as of the effective date are converted using\nthe Share Exchange Ratio.\nFurthermore, those holding SYLA ADSs will be able to trade their SYLA ADSs as usual on the U.S.\nNasdaq stock market until May 28, 2024 (U.S. time) (scheduled), which is the final trading date.\n(4) Measures to ensure fairness\nCUMICA and SYLA have determined that because SYLA already holds 3,688,300 CUMICA Shares\n(which accounts for 30.58% of the 12,060,300 shares that are the total number of issued shares as of\nSeptember 30, 2024), CUMICA constitutes an equity method affiliate of SYLA, and because there is a\nrelationship between the two companies as described in 4.(13) “Relationship between the companies\ninvolved” below, it is necessary to ensure the fairness of the Share Exchange, and have implemented the\nfollowing measures to ensure fairness.\n(i) Acquisition of calculation report from an independent third-party calculation agent\nCUMICA has appointed StandbyC and SYLA has appointed PwC as their respective third-party\ncalculation agents, and each has obtained a calculation report regarding the share exchange ratio from\ntheir respective calculation agents. Please see (2) “Matters related to calculation” above for an overview\nof the calculation report. Neither CUMICA nor SYLA have obtained a written opinion from their\nrespective third-party calculation agents stating that the Share Exchange Ratio is appropriate or fair from\na financial perspective (a fairness opinion).\n(ii) Advice from independent law firms\nCUMICA has appointed TMI as its legal advisor and has received legal advice from TMI regarding\nthe procedures for the Share Exchange and CUMICA’s decision-making methods and processes, etc.\nTMI is independent from both CUMICA and SYLA and has no material interest with respect to\nCUMICA or SYLA.\nSYLA has appointed DTL and AOS as its legal advisors and has received legal advice from DTL and\nAOS regarding the procedures for the Share Exchange and SYLA’s decision-making methods and\nprocesses, etc. DTL and AOS are independent from both CUMICA and SYLA and have no material\ninterest with respect to CUMICA or SYLA.\n(5) Measures to avoid conflict of interest\nBecause SYLA already holds 30.58% of CUMICA’s total number of issued shares, making CUMICA\nan equity method affiliate of SYLA, and because there is a relationship between the two companies as\ndescribed in 4.(13) “Relationship between the companies involved” below, in addition to the measures\nin (4) above, CUMICA has taken the following measures to avoid conflict of interest.\n(i) Establishment of a special committee\nIn response to receiving SYLA’s request for the Share Exchange, on September 18, 2024, because of\nthe risk of a structural conflict of interest with SYLA, which is CUMICA’s largest shareholder that is its\nmajor shareholder and an otherwise related company and dispatches two directors to it, in relation to the\nShare Exchange, CUMICA, while receiving advice from its legal advisor TMI, resolved at a meeting of\nits board of directors held on September 24, 2024 to establish the Special Committee comprising Mr.\nNobutake Nishijima and Mr. Akira Shibata, who are CUMICA’s outside directors and independent from\nSYLA, and Mr. Noboru Araki (certified public accountant, KK Bloom Advisory) and Mr. Yoshitaka\nObitsu (attorney, Socius Legal Services), who are outside experts without an interest in SYLA or\nCUMICA, and conduct examination of the Share Exchange from a standpoint independent from SYLA\nand CUMICA in order to eliminate the risk of arbitrariness and conflict of interest in the decision-\nmaking process for the Share Exchange by CUMICA’s board of directors, ensure the fairness of the\n12\nShare Exchange, and obtain an opinion as to whether a decision by CUMICA’s board of directors to\ncarry out the Share Exchange would be disadvantageous to minority shareholders. Furthermore,\nCUMICA has not changed the members of the Special Committee from the four members initially\nappointed to the Special Committee. In addition, each committee member will be paid fixed\nremuneration as consideration for their duties, irrespective of the content of the report.\nFurthermore, when examining the Share Exchange, CUMICA consulted with the Special Committee\non (a) matters relating to the reasonableness of the Share Exchange’s purpose (including whether the\nShare Exchange would contribute to the improvement of CUMICA’s corporate value), (b) matters\nrelating to the appropriateness of the transactions terms and conditions of the Share Exchange (including\nthe appropriateness of the implementation method of the Share Exchange), (c) matters relating to the\nfairness of the procedures for the Share Exchange (including examining which, and to what extent,\nmeasures to ensure fairness should be implemented), and (d) based on (a) to (c) above and other matters,\nwhether the decision by the board of directors of CUMICA to implement the Share Exchange would be\ndisadvantageous for minority shareholders (collectively the “Inquiry Matters”). When CUMICA’s board\nof directors passed its resolution establishing the Special Committee, it also resolved that ① when\nmaking the decision with respect to the Share Exchange, it would give full respect to the opinion of the\nSpecial Committee, and if the Special Committee determines that the Share Exchange is not appropriate,\nit would not make a decision to carry out the Share Exchange and ② CUMICA would grant the Special\nCommittee authority to discuss and negotiate the transaction terms and conditions, etc. of the Share\nExchange with SYLA. At the same time, the board of directors also resolved that (i) when the Special\nCommittee determines it to be necessary, it may appoint a chair and stipulate other matters regarding the\noperation of the Special Committee by a resolution of a majority of its members, (ii) the Special\nCommittee may, at CUMICA’s expense, conduct investigations with regard to the Share Exchange\n(including questioning, or requesting explanations or advice from, CUMICA’s officers and employees\nrelated to the Share Exchange and CUMICA’s advisors with respect to the Share Exchange about\nmatters necessary to examine the Inquiry Matters), (iii) the Special Committee may ① itself conduct\ndiscussions and negotiations with transaction-related parties (including, but not limited to, SYLA and\nSYLA’s advisors with respect to the Share Exchange) and ② the Special Committee may, at its\njudgment, cause the Company’s officers or employees (limited to those without a risk of conflict of\ninterest) to participate in the above discussions or negotiations, (iv) if the opinion of the Special\nCommittee on the report is not unanimous, the conclusion approved by the majority of the members\nshall be the content of the report, but any member with an objection to all or part of the content of such\nreport may request that their opinion be noted in the content of the report, (v) even if, from the\nperspective of convenience of meeting proceedings, a meeting of the Special Committee is attended by\nan officer or employee of CUMICA, or an advisor of CUMICA with respect to the Share Exchange, the\nSpecial Committee may request such attendee to leave as necessary, and (vi) when recognized to be\nnecessary, the Special Committee may, at CUMICA’s expense, appoint its own lawyer, calculation\nagent, certified public accountant, or other advisors, and the Special Committee may nominate or\nrequest the change of CUMICA’s advisors with respect to the Share Exchange, and may also issue\nnecessary directions to CUMICA’s advisors.\nDuring the period from September 25, 2024 to November 29, 2024, the Special Committee held a\ntotal of 13 meetings, and carefully examined and discussed the Inquiry Matters. Specifically, the Special\nCommittee received explanations from CUMICA regarding the background leading to receipt of the\nproposal for the Share Exchange, the purpose of the Share Exchange, the business environment,\nbusiness plans, and management issues, etc., and conducted written and verbal Q&A sessions. The\nSpecial Committee also received explanations from SYLA regarding the background leading to and\nreasons for the proposal of the Share Exchange, the purpose of the Share Exchange, the overall group\nmanagement policy after the Share Exchange, and the various terms and conditions of the Share\nExchange, etc., and conducted written and verbal Q&A sessions. In addition, the Special Committee\nreceived explanations from CUMICA regarding the details, material assumptions, and background to\npreparation, etc. of business plans prepared by CUMICA, conducted Q&A sessions, and then confirmed\nthe reasonableness thereof, and gave its approval. Additionally, the Special Committee received\nexplanations from StandbyC regarding the reasons for the calculation methods used for calculation of\n13\nthe share exchange ratio and the results of the calculation of the share exchange ratio in the Share\nExchange.\nThe Special Committee also received timely reports on the details and negotiation process, etc. from\nMita Securities, which was in charge of negotiations for CUMICA, whenever CUMICA received\nproposals regarding the Share Exchange Ratio from SYLA, and was substantially involved in the\nnegotiation process regarding the transaction terms and conditions of the Share Exchange, such as\ndeliberating and examining the details thereof, and giving directions and making requests to Mita\nSecurities. In addition, the Special Committee received explanations from TMI regarding measures\ntaken to reduce or prevent conflict of interest in the Share Exchange and regarding the Share Exchange.\nWith that background, the Special Committee conducted careful discussion and examination based on\nthese explanations, the results of calculations, and other examination materials, and submitted a report\ndated [month TBD] [day TBD], 2024 to CUMICA to the effect that (a) it found the purpose of the Share\nExchange to be reasonable (including that the Share Exchange would contribute to the improvement of\nCUMICA’s corporate value), (b) it found the transaction terms and conditions of the Share Exchange to\nbe appropriate (including that the implementation method of the Share Exchange was appropriate), (c) it\nfound the procedures for the Share Exchange to be fair (including examining which, and to what extent,\nmeasures to ensure fairness should be implemented), and (d) based on (a) to (c) above and other matters,\nthe decision of CUMICA’s board of directors to implement the Share Exchange is not disadvantageous\nto minority shareholders.\n(ii) Approval by directors excluding those with an interest\nAmong CUMICA’s five directors, Takahide Watanabe is a former director of SYLA and Tomoyoshi\nUranishi concurrently serves as an independent director of SYLA at the present time, so from the\nperspective of avoiding conflict of interest, Takahide Watanabe and Tomoyoshi Uranishi have not\nparticipated in deliberations and resolutions by the CUMICA Board of Directors regarding the Share\nExchange and have not participated in discussions and negotiations with SYLA regarding the Share\nExchange in the capacity of CUMICA.\nThe agenda item at the CUMICA Board of Directors regarding the Share Exchange was approved\nunanimously by three of the five CUMICA directors, excluding the two aforementioned directors,\nTakahide Watanabe and Tomoyoshi Uranishi.\n4.

Further details will\nbe considered going forward.\n6. Overview of Accounting Treatment\nThe Share Exchange is planned to be subject to accounting treatment as a “reverse acquisition” under the\nAccounting Standards for Business Combinations. In addition, goodwill or negative goodwill is expected to be\ngenerated in CUMICA’s consolidated financial statements as a result of the Share Exchange, but the amount of\ngoodwill or negative goodwill that will be generated is undetermined at this time.\n7. Future Outlook\nBecause the effective date of the Share Exchange is scheduled for June 1, 2025, the impact of the Share\nExchange on the financial results of both companies for the current fiscal year is expected to be minimal. In\naddition, the consolidated earnings forecast of the new integrated company after the Share Exchange will be\npromptly announced as soon as it is finalized. Furthermore, after the establishment of the new integrated company,\n16\nthe business environment surrounding the group after the Management Integration, the group’s business strategy\ngoing forward, etc. will be considered, and a medium-term management plan for the group after the Management\nIntegration will be formulated and publicly released.\nThe Share Exchange is a share exchange in which CUMICA will become the wholly-owning parent company\nand SYLA will become the wholly-owned subsidiary, and CUMICA Shares will continue to be listed on the\nTokyo Stock Exchange. In this regard, if the Tokyo Stock Exchange determines that CUMICA is not a substantive\nsurviving company after the Share Exchange, the Tokyo Stock Exchange may announce that a grace period\nregarding loss of substantive viability (improper merger, etc.) is expected to begin from the effective date of the\nShare Exchange, and in such case, an announcement to such effect will be made without delay.\nCUMICA Shares will continue to be listed even after entering the grace period. If, as a result of the substantive\nviability examination, the Tokyo Stock Exchange finds that CUMICA is not a substantively surviving company,\nthe grace period will begin from the date of the Share Exchange (June 1, 2025), and if, during the period until the\nend of the grace period on May 31, 2029, the CUMICA Shares are found to meet the standards equivalent to the\ninitial listing examination standards, the grace period will be lifted.\nThe CUMICA Shares may be delisted if they do not meet the standards set by the Tokyo Stock Exchange\nwithin the grace period, but CUMICA is scheduled to undergo an examination to be recognized as complying with\nstandards equivalent to the initial listing examination standards set by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and is making\nthorough preparations in order to be recognized as complying with the standards as soon as possible.\nIn addition, as a result of the Share Exchange, SYLA, which has CUMICA as an equity method affiliate, is\nscheduled to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of CUMICA. The accounting treatment for CUMICA’s non-\nconsolidated subsidiaries RIVER SKY HOMES.CO.,LTD., RIBERESUTE CORPORATION TAIWAN, and K.K.\nWAKABA has not yet been determined. There will be discussions with the auditing firm going forward.\nThe impact of the Share Exchange on the consolidated financial results of both companies in the fiscal year\nending May 31, 2025 is expected to be minimal, but going forward, if there is a need to revise earnings forecasts\nor if there are any matters that should announced, they will be promptly disclosed.\nII. Regarding the Trade Name Change and the Articles of Incorporation Amendment\n1.

Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates” and similar expressions or variations of such words are intended to identify forward-looking statements. For example, the Company is using forward-looking statements when it discusses the expected gross proceeds and the closing of the offering. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based upon management’s current expectations, beliefs and projections, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain. Such expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith. However, there can be no assurance that management’s expectations, beliefs and projections will be achieved, and actual results may differ materially from what is expressed in or indicated by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. For a more detailed description of the risks and uncertainties affecting the Company, reference is made to the Company’s reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including, but not limited to, the risks detailed in the Company’s annual report on Form 20-F, filed with the SEC on May 15, 2024. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. The Company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, subsequent events or circumstances, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. If the Company does update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that the Company will make additional updates with respect thereto or with respect to other forward-looking statements.
