(\"BioAge\", “the Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing therapeutic product candidates for metabolic diseases, such as obesity, by targeting the biology of human aging, today provided business updates and reported its third quarter 2024 financial results.\n\n\"The third quarter of 2024 was transformative for BioAge as we achieved two major milestones: initiating our Phase 2 STRIDES trial evaluating azelaprag in combination with tirzepatide, and completing our IPO,” said Kristen Fortney, Ph.D., CEO and co-founder of BioAge. \"The STRIDES trial is a critical step in our mission to improve outcomes for patients with obesity. We're developing an oral therapy that has the potential to enhance the weight loss benefits of incretin drugs while promoting healthy body composition. With our strong cash position following our IPO, we are well-equipped to advance our clinical programs and continue developing innovative therapies that target the biology of metabolic aging.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Business Highlights**\n\n_Clinical trials_\n\n  * In July 2024, BioAge dosed the first patient in the STRIDES Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating BioAge’s lead compound azelaprag, an oral small-molecule apelin receptor agonist, as a novel treatment for obesity in combination with tirzepatide. STRIDES is being conducted in collaboration with Eli Lilly & Company’s Chorus clinical development organization. Top-line results are anticipated in the third quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n_Corporate Updates_\n\n  * In August 2024, BioAge appointed Jean-Pierre Garnier, PhD, former CEO of GlaxoSmithKline, as Chair of the Board of Directors, succeeding James Healy, MD, PhD, who remains on the Board as a Director.\n  * In September 2024, BioAge received approximately $189.5 million in net proceeds from its initial public offering and concurrent private placement.\n  * In October 2024, the underwriters of BioAge’s IPO exercised in full their option to purchase additional shares of the Company’s common stock, yielding approximately $27.6 million in net proceeds.\n  * Total IPO proceeds and existing cash and cash equivalents extend cash runway into 2029.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nResearch and development expenses were $20.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $6.5 million for the same period in 2023. The $13.5 million increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to a $12.0 million increase in costs related to the development of azelaprag driven by the ongoing Phase 2 STRIDES trial and costs related to the manufacture of azelaprag.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $4.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.4 million for the same period in 2023. The $1.3 million increase was primarily attributable to an increase in stock-based compensation expense associated with option grants issued in 2024 to employees, executives, board members and advisors.\n\nNet loss was $23.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, or $6.70 per weighted-average common share outstanding, basic and diluted, compared to a net loss of $14.6 million, or $8.74 per weighted-average common share outstanding, basic and diluted, for the same period in 2023.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, BioAge had approximately $334.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. Based on our current operating plan, BioAge estimates that existing cash and cash equivalents, together with the net proceeds received in October 2024 from the purchase of additional shares of common stock by the underwriters of BioAge’s IPO, will be sufficient to fund operations and capital expenses into 2029.\n\n**About BioAge Labs, Inc.**\n\nBioAge is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutic product candidates for metabolic diseases, such as obesity, by targeting the biology of human aging.

(\"BioAge\"), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing therapeutic product candidates for metabolic diseases, such as obesity, by targeting the biology of human aging, today announced that it will present new preclinical data for its lead product candidate azelaprag, an orally available small molecule agonist of the apelin receptor APJ. The data will be presented at ObesityWeek 2024, held in San Antonio from November 2–6, 2024.\n\n\"Our preclinical data highlight the potential of azelaprag as a novel oral therapy for obesity,\" said Kristen Fortney, Ph.D., CEO and co-founder of BioAge. “Our two presentations provide evidence supporting the ability of BioAge’s azelaprag to enhance weight loss when combined with oral appetite suppression mechanisms, and to protect against excess weight gain and provide metabolic benefits as a monotherapy. These findings support our ongoing clinical development of azelaprag, and our broader mission to develop innovative treatments for metabolic diseases by leveraging insights from human aging biology.\"\n\nIn their two presentations, BioAge CMO and EVP Research Paul Rubin, MD, and VP Translational Aging Biology Yan Wang, PhD, will present data demonstrating that in mice on a high-fat diet, azelaprag increased weight loss and improved body composition in combination with semaglutide, tirzepatide, the oral GLP-1 receptor agonist danuglipron, or the oral CB1 inverse agonist rimonabant. These studies demonstrate the potential of azelaprag to be complementary to a range of oral appetite suppression mechanisms for the treatment of obesity.\n\nDr. Rubin’s talk will also show that in mice on a high-fat diet, azelaprag monotherapy protected against excess weight gain, improved body composition, and increased physical activity and energy expenditure, reinforcing the metabolic and exercise mimetic benefits of apelin signaling.\n\n**Oral presentation:** Wednesday, November 6, 2024, 8:45–9:00 am CST**Title:** The Apelin Receptor Agonist Azelaprag Reduces Weight Gain & Improves Body Composition in Diet-Induced Obese Mice**Session:** Corporate Orals Session 3, room 006**Presenter:** Paul Rubin, MD, Chief Medical Officer and EVP Research, BioAge Labs\n\n**Poster presentation:** Tuesday, November 5, 2024, 2:30 PM CST**Title:** The APJ Agonist Azelaprag Improves Weight Loss and Body Composition in DIO Mice on a CB1 Antagonist**Poster number:** 628**Presenter:** Yan Wang, PhD, VP Translational Aging Biology, BioAge Labs\n\nThe visual materials for the presentations will be made available on the BioAge investor website [_https://ir.bioagelabs.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=NERtRLdec0VJrFqMRBnHwBgj5D3tRFD_WE1PqXnn6Hv3PWau1TIc_67p9WRRwAGG8aEnsfdpV0EpjlwsaCwmarmRZVFbs8ZrRDzYPNUCycQ=) concurrent with the beginning of their respective sessions.\n\n**About BioAge Labs, Inc.**\n\nBioAge is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutic product candidates for metabolic diseases, such as obesity, by targeting the biology of human aging.
