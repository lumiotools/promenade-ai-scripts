(NASDAQ: RNAC) (the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering mRNA cell therapy for autoimmune diseases, today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2024, and provided business and corporate updates.\n\n“As we approach the end of what has been a year of tremendous progress for Cartesian, we remain focused on advancing our innovative pipeline as we strive toward our mission to extend the potential of cell therapy to patients with autoimmune diseases,” said Carsten Brunn, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Cartesian. “Notably, for our lead Descartes-08 program in MG, we expect to share additional data from our Phase 2b trial and the design of our upcoming Phase 3 trial by the end of the year. With a growing body of clinical evidence supporting the potential for Descartes-08 to serve as a meaningful addition to the MG treatment landscape, we are encouraged by our recent interaction with FDA regarding our plans for a Phase 3 program in MG and plan to initiate the trial in the first half of 2025.”\n\nDr. Brunn continued, “In addition to our MG development program, enrollment remains ongoing in our Phase 2 trial of Descartes-08 in patients with SLE, and we also remain on track to file an IND application for a pediatric basket study of Descartes-08 by year-end. Beyond Descartes-08, enrollment also continues in our first-in-human Phase 1 trial of Descartes-15, our next-generation autologous anti-BCMA mRNA CAR-T product candidate.”\n\n**Recent Pipeline Progress and Anticipated Milestones**\n\n**_Descartes-08 in Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (MG)_**\n\n  * **Results from Phase 2b Trial of Descartes-08 in Patients with MG Featured at the 2024 Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) Scientific Session of the** **American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) Annual Meeting.** In October 2024, data from the Company’s Phase 2b trial of Descartes-08 in patients with MG [were presented](https://ir.cartesiantherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cartesian-therapeutics-announces-presentation-results-phase-2b) at the 2024 MGFA Scientific Session of the AANEM Annual Meeting. Descartes-08, Cartesian’s lead product candidate, is an autologous anti-B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) mRNA-engineered chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (mRNA CAR-T). Positive topline results were [previously announced ](https://ir.cartesiantherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cartesian-therapeutics-announces-positive-topline-results-phase)in July 2024, with the trial meeting its primary endpoint with statistical significance as 71% of MG patients treated with Descartes-08 were observed to have a clinically meaningful improvement in MG Composite score at Month 3 compared to 25% for placebo. In addition, Descartes-08 was observed to have a favorable safety profile supporting outpatient administration without the need for lymphodepleting chemotherapy.In addition to previously announced topline results, at Month 3, patients treated with Descartes-08 were observed to have a reduction in anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody titer levels, which is believed to be an early prognostic indicator for clinical improvement in patients with MG. Additionally, treatment with Descartes-08 was not observed to lead to a decrease in vaccine titers for common viruses and was not associated with increased rates of infection or hypogammaglobulinemia.The Company announced today that it plans to present updated efficacy and safety data from the Phase 2b trial by year-end.\n\n\n  * **Planned Phase 3 Trial Expected to Commence in First Half of 2025 Following Recent Meeting with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).** Following a recent meeting with the FDA, the Company expects to commence its planned Phase 3 study of Descartes-08 in patients with MG in the first half of 2025. The Company plans to announce details regarding the trial design by year-end. Descartes-08 was previously granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy Designation and Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the treatment of MG.\n\n\n  * As previously [announced](https://ir.cartesiantherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cartesian-therapeutics-establishes-new-corporate-headquarters), the Company’s new corporate headquarters and approximately 30,000 square foot state-of-the-art current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) facility in Frederick, Maryland, is expected to support scaling of its wholly-owned, in-house cGMP manufacturing capabilities for the planned Phase 3 study in MG and commercial supply.\n\n\n\n**_Descartes-08 in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)_**\n\n  * **First Patient Dosed in Phase 2 Trial of Descartes-08 in SLE.** In July 2024, the Company [announced](https://ir.cartesiantherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cartesian-therapeutics-announces-first-patient-dosed-phase-2) dosing of the first patient in a Phase 2 open-label clinical trial evaluating Descartes-08 in SLE. The trial is designed to assess the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of outpatient Descartes-08 administration without preconditioning chemotherapy in patients with SLE. SLE is an incurable autoimmune disease marked by systemic inflammation that affects multiple organ systems and impacts approximately 1.5 million people in the United States.\n\n\n\n**_Descartes-08 in Additional Indications_**\n\n  * **Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for Descartes-08 for the Treatment of Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM).** In September 2024, the Company [announced](https://ir.cartesiantherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cartesian-therapeutics-receives-fda-rare-pediatric-disease) that the FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation to Descartes-08 for the treatment of JDM. JDM is a rare pediatric autoimmune disorder marked by pathognomonic skin rash and muscle inflammation that affects multiple organ systems and impacts approximately 4,000 people in the United States. Under the FDA’s Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Voucher Program, if Descartes-08 is approved for marketing in JDM, Cartesian may qualify for a priority review voucher that can be redeemed to receive priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product.By year-end 2024, the Company plans to file an investigational new drug (IND) application for a pediatric basket trial of Descartes-08 in certain autoimmune diseases, including JDM.\n\n\n  * **Safety and Tolerability Data to be Featured at 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition. **In November 2024, the Company [announced](https://ir.cartesiantherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cartesian-therapeutics-announces-presentation-upcoming-66th-ash) that safety and tolerability data from patients treated with Descartes-08 will be featured during a poster presentation at the upcoming 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition, being held December 7-10, 2024, in San Diego.\n\n\n\n**_Descartes-15 Program_**\n\n  * **First Patient Dosed in First-in-Human Phase 1 Trial of Descartes-15.** In September 2024, the Company [announced](https://ir.cartesiantherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cartesian-therapeutics-announces-first-patient-dosed-first-human) dosing of the first patient in its first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating Descartes-15, the Company’s next-generation autologous anti-BCMA mRNA CAR-T product candidate. Descartes-15 is designed to be administered without preconditioning chemotherapy, eliminating integrating vectors, and to have predictable and controllable pharmacokinetics, including technological advances that enhance CAR stability even in the presence of target-driven suppression of CAR. The Phase 1 dose escalation trial is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of outpatient Descartes-15 administration in patients with multiple myeloma. Following the Phase 1 dose escalation trial, the Company expects to subsequently assess Descartes-15 in autoimmune indications.\n\n\n\n**Corporate Updates**\n\n  * **Completed $130.0 Million Private Placement Equity Financing. **In July 2024, Cartesian [announced](https://ir.cartesiantherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cartesian-therapeutics-announces-130-million-private-placement) a private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing, which included participation from both new and existing investors, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $130.0 million.\n\n\n  * **Strengthened Board of Directors with Appointment of Kemal Malik. **In July 2024, the Company [announced](https://ir.cartesiantherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cartesian-therapeutics-strengthens-board-directors-appointment) the appointment of Kemal Malik, MBBS to its Board of Directors.
