Total loans, net of deferred fees increased $126.9 million, or 4.0%, during the three months ended June 30, 2024 to $3.33 billion, compared to $3.20 billion at March 31, 2024. CCBX loans increased $98.1 million, or 7.4%, primarily as a result of a $107.4 million increase in consumer and other loans, partially offset by a decrease of $26.5 million in capital call lines, as a result of normal fluctuations. CCBX loan growth is net of $155.2 million in CCBX loans sold during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. We will continue to sell loans back to our CCBX partners, pursuant to the applicable partner agreement, as part of our strategy to reduce risk, optimize the CCBX loan portfolio, maintain strong credit quality, and manage portfolio and partner limits.\n\nWe saw solid deposit growth in the second quarter, with deposits increasing $80.5 million, or 2.3%, compared to March 31, 2024. CCBX deposits grew $27.5 million, or 1.4%. Community bank deposits increased $52.9 million, or 3.7%, after two consecutive quarters of declining balances primarily as a result of letting some of our higher rate deposits run-off during those quarters. Fully insured IntraFi network reciprocal deposits increased $15.5 million to $352.3 million as of June 30, 2024, compared to $336.8 million as of March 31, 2024. These fully insured reciprocal deposits allow our larger deposit customers to fully insure their deposits through a reciprocal agreement with other banks. We continue to monitor our liquidity position through diligent management of our liquid assets and liabilities as well as maintaining access to alternative sources of funds. As of June 30, 2024, we had $487.2 million in cash on the balance sheet and the capacity to borrow up to $650.1 million from Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank discount window, and an additional $50.0 million from a correspondent bank, with no borrowings occurring, except minimal amounts borrowed to test the lines, under these facilities since the first quarter of 2022. Cash on the balance sheet and total borrowing capacity totaled $1.19 billion, which represented 33.5% of total deposits and exceeded our $532.9 million in uninsured deposits as of June 30, 2024.\n\n\"We are happy to report that we have experienced robust loan growth of $126.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. This growth can be attributed to our strong relationships with existing CCBX partners and successful efforts to attract new community bank borrowers. We are pleased to report that we are maintaining our strong credit quality, and our portfolio is performing as expected. This is a testament to our diligent risk management practices and proactive measures to optimize our loan portfolio.\n\nWe have taken steps to manage our balance sheet and we believe it is well positioned to handle upcoming expected interest rate changes. This involves carefully managing our interest rate risk exposure and implementing strategies to mitigate any adverse impacts on our financial performance from interest rate changes. By closely monitoring market trends and leveraging our expertise in financial analysis, we believe we are well positioned to adapt to changing interest rate environments.\n\nIn late 2023 and early 2024, we took proactive measures to enhance the credit quality of our CCBX loans by selling higher rate and higher risk loans. This strategic decision, although it resulted in a short-term reduction in income, is expected to result in long-term stability and success. By focusing on the quality of our loan portfolio, we believe that we are well positioned to achieve our goals and deliver sustainable financial performance in the future.\n\nWe believe our organization's strong credit quality, neutral to slightly liability sensitive balance sheet, robust loan and deposit growth, and proactive risk management measures demonstrate our commitment to maintaining a solid financial position. We remain confident in our ability to navigate changing market conditions and achieve long-term success in the BaaS and community bank space,\" stated Eric Sprink, the CEO of the Company and the Bank.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe Company has one main subsidiary, the Bank which consists of three segments: CCBX, the community bank and treasury & administration. The CCBX segment includes all of our BaaS activities, the community bank segment includes all community banking activities, and the treasury & administration segment includes treasury management, overall administration and all other aspects of the Company. \n\nNet interest income was $66.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $5.3 million, or 8.7%, from $60.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and an increase of $3.9 million, or 6.2%, from $62.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Yield on loans receivable was 11.23% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 10.85% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023. Cost of deposits was 3.58% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 3.49% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2.72% for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in net interest income compared to March 31, 2024, was a result of increased interest income due to an increase in average loans receivable partially offset by an increase in cost of deposits as a result of deposit portfolio composition and competitive pressures. The increase in net interest income compared to June 30, 2023 was largely related to increased yield on loans resulting from higher interest rates and growth in higher yielding loans. Total average loans receivable for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $3.26 billion, compared to $3.14 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and $2.97 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nInterest and fees on loans totaled $90.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $84.6 million and $80.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Total loans, net of deferred fees increased $126.9 million, or 4.0%, during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which included a $98.1 million increase in CCBX loans and an increase of $28.8 million in community bank loans. The increase in CCBX loans includes an increase of $107.4 million, or 12.4%, in consumer and other loans, $22.8 million increase in residential real estate loans and a decrease of $26.5 million, or 19.6%, in capital call lines as a result of normal balance fluctuations and business activities. We continue to monitor and manage the CCBX loan portfolio, and sold $155.2 million in CCBX loans during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 to reduce credit exposure in certain loan categories and manage credit risk, compared to sales of $100.5 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2024. We continue to reposition ourselves by managing CCBX credit and concentration levels in an effort to optimize our loan portfolio. The increase in interest and fees on loans compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was largely due to loan growth in higher yielding loans. The increase compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2023 was also largely due to growth in higher yielding loans. The FOMC has increased rates 0.25% since June 30, 2023 and last raised the target Federal Funds rate 0.25% on July 26, 2023. Loans have been repricing at these higher rates for almost a year.\n\nInterest income from interest earning deposits with other banks was $5.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $903,000 compared to March 31, 2024, due to an increase in average balance and an increase of $3.0 million compared to June 30, 2023 due to an increase in average balance and higher interest rates. The average balance of interest earning deposits with other banks for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $418.2 million, compared to $350.9 million and $211.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. The average yield on these interest earning deposits with other banks decreased nominally to 5.47% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to 5.48% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and increased from 5.08% in the quarter ended June 30, 2023.\n\nTotal interest expense was $31.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, a $1.7 million increase from the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and a $9.9 million increase from the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Interest expense on deposits was $30.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $28.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and $20.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Interest expense on interest bearing deposits increased $1.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and $9.9 million compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2023 as a result of an increase in CCBX deposits that are tied to, and reprice when the FOMC raises rates. Similarly, most of our CCBX loans also reprice when the FOMC raises interest rates. Interest expense on borrowed funds was $672,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $669,000 and $661,000 for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. The $11,000 increase in interest expense on borrowed funds from the quarter ended June 30, 2023 is the result of an increase in interest rates.\n\nTotal cost of deposits was 3.58% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 3.49% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2.72%, for the three months ended June 30, 2023. Community bank and CCBX cost of deposits were 1.77% and 4.92% respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 1.66% and 4.93%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 0.98% and 4.42% for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in cost of deposits for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the prior periods for both segments is a result of the continued higher interest rate environment. While we continue working to hold down deposit costs, the higher interest rate environment has impacted our cost of deposits and resulted in higher interest expense on interest bearing deposits as we work to retain and grow our community bank deposits and CCBX deposits continue to grow as a percent of total deposits.\n\n**Net Interest Margin**\n\nNet interest margin was 7.13% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 6.78% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in net interest margin compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to higher loan yields. Net interest margin was 7.58% for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest margin for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 was largely due to an increase in cost of deposits, partially offset by an increase in loan yield. Increases in rates on interest bearing deposits by our competitors and the growth in higher cost CCBX deposits contributed to an overall increase in interest expense on interest bearing deposits. Interest and fees on loans receivable increased $6.3 million, or 7.5%, to $90.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $84.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and increased $10.7 million, or 13.4%, compared to $80.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, due to an increase in outstanding balances and higher interest rates. Compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, there was a $3.0 million increase in interest on interest earning deposits held at other financial institutions. These interest earning deposits earned an average rate of 5.47% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to 5.48% and 5.08% for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Average investment securities decreased $65.6 million to $49.8 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024 and decreased $60.5 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 as a result of $100.0 million in AFS U.S. Treasury securities that matured on February 29, 2024. Interest on investment securities decreased $348,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024 as a result of the maturing Treasury securities. Interest on total investment securities increased $33,000 compared to June 30, 2023, as a result of increased yield. These increases in interest income were partially offset by increases in interest expense on interest bearing deposits, as previously discussed.\n\nCost of funds was 3.60% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, an increase of 8 basis points from the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and an increase of 83 basis points from the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Cost of deposits for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was 3.58%, compared to 3.49% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and 2.72% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The increased cost of funds and deposits compared to March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023 was due to the increase in interest rates compared to the previous periods and growth in higher rate CCBX deposits.\n\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2024, total loans receivable increased by $126.9 million, or 4.0%, to $3.33 billion, compared to $3.20 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. This increase consists of a $98.1 million increase in CCBX loans and $28.8 million in community bank loan growth. Total loans receivable as of June 30, 2024 increased $318.9 million compared to June 30, 2023. This increase includes community bank loan growth of $199.0 million and an increase in CCBX loans of $119.9 million. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, $155.2 million in CCBX loans were sold, compared to sales of $100.5 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\nTotal yield on loans receivable for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was 11.23%, compared to 10.85% for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, community bank loans increased 1.5%, or $28.8 million, to $1.91 billion compared to $1.88 billion at March 31, 2024, with an average yield of 6.52%. CCBX loans outstanding increased 7.4%, or $98.1 million, to $1.41 billion compared to $1.32 billion at March 31, 2024, with an average CCBX yield of 17.77%. The yield on CCBX loans does not include the impact of BaaS loan expense. BaaS loan expense represents the amount paid or payable to partners for credit enhancements, fraud enhancements and originating & servicing CCBX loans. \n\nThe following table summarizes the average yield on loans receivable and cost of deposits for our community bank and CCBX segments for the periods indicated:\n\n**For the Three Months Ended**| **For the Six Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**June 30, 2024**| **March 31, 2024**| **June 30, 2023**| **June 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2023**  \n**Yield on****Loans****(2)**| **Cost of****Deposits****(2)**| **Yield on****Loans****(2)**| **Cost of****Deposits****(2)**| **Yield on****Loans****(2)**| **Cost of****Deposits****(2)**| **Yield on****Loans****(2)**| **Cost of****Deposits****(2)**| **Yield on****Loans****(2)**| **Cost of****Deposits****(2)**  \nCommunity Bank| 6.52| %| 1.77| %| 6.46| %| 1.66| %| 6.28| %| 0.98| %| 6.49| %| 1.71| %| 6.13| %| 0.82| %  \nCCBX (1)| 17.77| %| 4.92| %| 17.34| %| 4.93| %| 16.95| %| 4.42| %| 17.56| %| 4.92| %| 16.56| %| 4.18| %  \nConsolidated| 11.23| %| 3.58| %| 10.85| %| 3.49| %| 10.85| %| 2.72| %| 11.04| %| 3.53| %| 10.42| %| 2.44| %  \n  \n(1) CCBX yield on loans does not include the impact of BaaS loan expense. BaaS loan expense represents the amount paid or payable to partners for credit and fraud enhancements and originating & servicing CCBX loans. To determine Net BaaS loan income earned from CCBX loan relationships, the Company takes BaaS loan interest income and deducts BaaS loan expense to arrive at Net BaaS loan income which can be compared to interest income on the Company’s community bank loans. See reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures at the end of this earnings release for the impact of BaaS loan expense on CCBX loan yield.(2) Annualized calculations for periods shown.\n\nThe following tables illustrates how BaaS loan interest income is affected by BaaS loan expense resulting in net BaaS loan income and the associated yield:\n\n**For the Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**June 30, 2024**| **March 31, 2024**| **June 30, 2023**  \n(dollars in thousands, unaudited)| **Income / Expense**| **Income / expense divided by average CCBX loans****(2)**| **Income / Expense**| **Income /****expense divided by average****CCBX loans****(****2)**| **Income / Expense**| **Income / expense divided by average CCBX loans****(2)**  \nBaaS loan interest income| $| 60,203| 17.77| %| $| 54,569| 17.34| %| $| 53,632| 16.95| %  \nLess: BaaS loan expense| 29,076| 8.58| %| 24,837| 7.89| %| 22,033| 6.96| %  \nNet BaaS loan income (1)| $| 31,127| 9.19| %| $| 29,732| 9.45| %| $| 31,599| 9.98| %  \nAverage BaaS Loans(3)| $| 1,362,343| $| 1,265,857| $| 1,269,406  \n**For the Six Months Ended**  \n---  \n**June 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2023**  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **Income / Expense**| **Income / expense divided by average CCBX loans****(2)**| **Income / Expense**| **Income / expense divided by average CCBX loans****(2)**  \nBaaS loan interest income| $| 114,772| 17.56| %| $| 95,851| 16.56| %  \nLess: BaaS loan expense| 53,913| 8.25| %| 39,587| 6.84| %  \nNet BaaS loan income (1)| $| 60,859| 9.31| %| $| 56,264| 9.72| %  \nAverage BaaS Loans(3)| $| 1,314,099| $| 1,167,366  \n  \n(1) A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures are set forth at the end of this earnings release.

ROA for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, was up 0.48% and down 0.31% compared to March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Noninterest expenses were higher for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023 due to an increase in BaaS loan expense, which is directly related to interest earned on CCBX loans. Noninterest expense excluding Baas loan and fraud expense was lower for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023 largely due to the $1.2 million credit for business and occupation taxes paid on CCBX income that was sourced/allocated outside the State of Washington for years 2019 through 2022.\n\nThe following table shows the Company’s key performance ratios for the periods indicated. \n\n**Three Months Ended**| **Six Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n(unaudited)| **June 30,****2024**| **March 31,****2024**| **December 31,****2023**| **September 30,****2023**| **June 30,****2023**| **June 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2023**  \nReturn on average assets (1)| 1.21| %| 0.73| %| 0.97| %| 1.13| %| 1.52| %| 0.98| %| 1.55| %  \nReturn on average equity (1)| 15.22| %| 9.21| %| 12.35| %| 14.60| %| 19.53| %| 12.26| %| 19.70| %  \nYield on earnings assets (1)| 10.49| %| 10.07| %| 9.77| %| 10.08| %| 10.18| %| 10.28| %| 9.70| %  \nYield on loans receivable (1)| 11.23| %| 10.85| %| 10.71| %| 10.84| %| 10.85| %| 11.04| %| 10.42| %  \nCost of funds (1)| 3.60| %| 3.52| %| 3.39| %| 3.18| %| 2.77| %| 3.56| %| 2.49| %  \nCost of deposits (1)| 3.58| %| 3.49| %| 3.36| %| 3.14| %| 2.72| %| 3.53| %| 2.44| %  \nNet interest margin (1)| 7.13| %| 6.78| %| 6.61| %| 7.10| %| 7.58| %| 6.96| %| 7.37| %  \nNoninterest expense to average assets (1)| 6.14| %| 6.04| %| 5.56| %| 6.23| %| 6.11| %| 6.09| %| 5.91| %  \nNoninterest income to average assets (1)| 7.30| %| 9.38| %| 6.95| %| 3.81| %| 6.90| %| 8.32| %| 6.60| %  \nEfficiency ratio| 43.19| %| 37.88| %| 41.58| %| 58.36| %| 42.92| %| 40.43| %| 42.97| %  \nLoans receivable to deposits (2)| 93.88| %| 92.42| %| 90.05| %| 90.19| %| 96.23| %| 93.88| %| 96.23| %  \n  \n(1) Annualized calculations shown for quarterly periods presented.(2) Includes loans held for sale. \n\n**Noninterest Income**\n\nThe following table details noninterest income for the periods indicated:\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**June 30,**| **March 31,**| **June 30,**  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **2024**| **2024**| **2023**  \nDeposit service charges and fees| $| 946| $| 908| $| 989  \nLoan referral fees| —| 168| 682  \nUnrealized gain (loss) on equity securities, net| 9| 15| 155  \nGain on sales of loans, net| —| —| 23  \nOther| 257| 308| 234  \nNoninterest income, excluding BaaS program income and BaaS indemnification income| 1,212| 1,399| 2,083  \nServicing and other BaaS fees| 1,525| 1,131| 895  \nTransaction fees| 1,309| 1,122| 1,052  \nInterchange fees| 1,625| 1,539| 975  \nReimbursement of expenses| 1,637| 1,033| 1,026  \nBaaS program income| 6,096| 4,825| 3,948  \nBaaS credit enhancements| 60,826| 79,808| 51,027  \nBaas fraud enhancements| 1,784| 923| 1,537  \nBaaS indemnification income| 62,610| 80,731| 52,564  \nTotal BaaS income| 68,706| 85,556| 56,512  \nTotal noninterest income| $| 69,918| $| 86,955| $| 58,595  \n  \nNoninterest income was $69.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, a decrease of $17.1 million from $87.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and a increase of $11.3 million from $58.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in noninterest income over the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease of $16.9 million in total BaaS income. The $16.9 million decrease in total BaaS income included a $19.0 million decrease in BaaS credit enhancements related to the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a $861,000 increase in BaaS fraud enhancements, and an increase of $1.3 million in BaaS program income. The increase in BaaS program income is largely due to higher servicing and other BaaS fees, transaction fees and interchange fees and our primary BaaS source for recurring fee income (see “Appendix B” for more information on the accounting for BaaS allowance for credit losses and credit and fraud enhancements). Additionally, community bank loan referral fees decreased $168,000 due to the continued high interest rate environment. Other income decreased $51,000 largely due to a decrease in SBA servicing fees. The $11.3 million increase in noninterest income over the quarter ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to a $10.0 million increase in BaaS credit and fraud enhancements, an increase of $2.1 million in BaaS program income, partially offset by a decrease of $682,000 in loan referral fees.\n\nOur CCBX segment continues to evolve, and we have 21 relationships, at varying stages, as of June 30, 2024. We continue to refine the criteria for CCBX partnerships and are exiting relationships where it makes sense and are focusing on larger more established partners, with experienced management teams, existing customer bases and strong financial positions.\n\nWe launched two new lending products through our CCBX segment in the first quarter of 2024 that can reach wide, established customer bases. One was a point-of-sale installment loan program. These loans are fully disclosed and offered as standard credit products, which we believe will minimize the concerns raised with respect to more typical point of sale \"Buy Now Pay Later\" offerings. The second product was a new credit card that will be marketed to CCBX partner customers who satisfy heightened underwriting standards.\n\nThe following table illustrates the activity and evolution in CCBX relationships for the periods presented.\n\n**As of**  \n---  \n(unaudited)| **June 30, 2024**| **March 31, 2024**| **June 30, 2023**  \nActive| 19| 19| 18  \nFriends and family / testing| 1| 1| 1  \nImplementation / onboarding| 1| 1| 1  \nSigned letters of intent| 0| 0| 1  \nWind down - active but preparing to exit relationship| 0| 0| 1  \nTotal CCBX relationships| 21| 21| 22  \n  \nThe following table details noninterest expense for the periods indicated:\n\n**Noninterest Expense**\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**June 30,**| **March 31,**| **June 30,**  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)|  **2024** |  **2024**|  **2023**  \nSalaries and employee benefits| $| 17,005| $| 17,984| $| 16,309  \nLegal and professional expenses| 3,631| 3,672| 4,645  \nData processing and software licenses| 2,924| 2,892| 1,972  \nOccupancy| 1,686| 1,518| 1,143  \nPoint of sale expense| 852| 869| 814  \nDirector and staff expenses| 470| 400| 519  \nFDIC assessments| 690| 683| 570  \nExcise taxes| (706| )| 320| 531  \nMarketing| 14| 53| 115  \nOther| 1,383| 1,867| 1,722  \nNoninterest expense, excluding BaaS loan and BaaS fraud expense| 27,949| 30,258| 28,340  \nBaaS loan expense| 29,076| 24,837| 22,033  \nBaaS fraud expense| 1,784| 923| 1,537  \nBaaS loan and fraud expense| 30,860| 25,760| 23,570  \nTotal noninterest expense| $| 58,809| $| 56,018| $| 51,910  \n  \nTotal noninterest expense increased $2.8 million to $58.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $56.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and increased $6.9 million from $51.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in noninterest expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was primarily due to a $5.1 million increase in BaaS expense (including a $861,000 increase in BaaS fraud expense and a $4.2 million increase in BaaS loan expense) (BaaS loan expense represents the amount paid or payable to partners for credit enhancements, fraud enhancements, and originating & servicing CCBX loans. BaaS fraud expense represents non-credit fraud losses on partner’s customer loan and deposit accounts. A portion of this expense is realized during the quarter during which the loss occurs, and a portion is estimated based on historical or other information from our partners), partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in excise taxes (due to the recording of $1.2 million business and occupation tax credit from the State of Washington as a result of a tax apportionment study completed to quantify revenue earned outside of the state of Washington. CCBX income is sourced to the state the partner is headquartered, and the majority of partners are located outside the state of Washington, therefore the credit was for taxes we paid on CCBX income to Washington state that was sourced to other states), $1.0 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits, a $484,000 decrease in other expenses as a result of unanticipated expenses in the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that did not recur in the current quarter and a $41,000 decrease in legal and professional fees as some of our risk management infrastructure projects are being completed. We continue to invest in our infrastructure and the automation of our processes so that they are scalable.\n\nThe increase in noninterest expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2023 were largely due to an increase of $7.3 million in BaaS partner expense (including a $7.0 million increase in BaaS loan and an increase of $247,000 in BaaS fraud expense), a $952,000 increase in data processing and software licenses due to enhancements in technology, $696,000 increase in salary and employee benefits related to hiring staff for CCBX and additional staff for our ongoing growth initiatives, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in business and occupation excise taxes as mentioned above, and a $1.0 million decrease in legal and professional fees as a result of risk management projects are being completed.\n\n**Provision for Income Taxes**\n\nThe provision for income taxes was $3.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, $1.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $3.9 million for the second quarter of 2023. The income tax provision was higher for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024 primarily due to higher net income and lower than the quarter ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to lower net income compared to that quarter. Also contributing to the variances is the tax impact of stock equity award deductions which fluctuates based on activity. The Company is subject to various state taxes that are assessed as CCBX activities and employees expand into other states, which has increased the overall tax rate used in calculating the provision for income taxes in the current and future periods. The Company uses a federal statutory tax rate of 21.0% as a basis for calculating provision for federal income taxes and 2.62% for calculating the provision for state income taxes.\n\n**Financial Condition Overview**\n\nTotal assets increased $96.3 million, or 2.5%, to $3.96 billion at June 30, 2024 compared to $3.87 billion at March 31, 2024. The increase is primarily due to a $126.9 million increase in loans receivable partially offset by $8.7 million increase in the allowance for credit losses, a $55.1 million decrease in interest earning deposits held at other banks, a $6.2 million increase in the credit enhancement asset and a $1.1 million decrease in accrued interest receivable. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we sold $155.2 million in CCBX loans compared to $100.5 million sold during the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\nTotal assets increased $426.3 million, or 12.1%, to $3.96 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $3.54 billion at June 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to loans receivable increasing $318.9 million, a $182.0 million increase in interest earning deposits with other banks, and an increase of $46.6 million in the credit enhancement asset, partially offset by a decrease of $61.5 million in investment securities compared to June 30, 2023.\n\n**Loans Receivable**\n\nTotal loans receivable increased $126.9 million to $3.33 billion at June 30, 2024, from $3.20 billion at March 31, 2024, and increased $318.9 million from $3.01 billion at June 30, 2023. The increase in loans receivable over the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was the result of an increase of $98.1 million in CCBX loans as we continue to build back this portfolio with new loans, subject to enhanced credit standards, following several periods of shrinking this portfolio to optimize our balance sheet, and a $28.8 million increase in community bank loans. We continue to monitor and manage the CCBX loan portfolio, and sold $155.2 million in CCBX loans during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 as part of our strategy to reduce risk, optimize the CCBX loan portfolio, maintain strong credit quality, and manage portfolio and partner limits. The change in loans receivable over the quarter ended June 30, 2023 includes CCBX loan growth of $119.9 million and community bank loan growth of $199.0 million as of June 30, 2024. \n\nThe following table summarizes the loan portfolio at the period indicated:\n\n**Consolidated**| **As of June 30, 2024**| **As of March 31, 2024**| **As of June 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **Amount**| **Percent**| **Amount**| **Percent**| **Amount**| **Percent**  \nCommercial and industrial loans:  \nCapital call lines| $| 109,133| 3.3| %| $| 135,671| 4.2| %| $| 138,428| 4.6| %  \nAll other commercial & industrial loans| 186,167| 5.6| 201,555| 6.3| 215,401| 7.1  \nTotal commercial and industrial loans:| 295,300| 8.9| 337,226| 10.5| 353,829| 11.7  \nReal estate loans:  \nConstruction, land and land development| 173,064| 5.2| 160,862| 5.0| 186,706| 6.2  \nResidential real estate| 517,589| 15.5| 496,305| 15.5| 463,179| 15.4  \nCommercial real estate| 1,357,979| 40.7| 1,342,489| 41.9| 1,164,088| 38.6  \nConsumer and other loans| 990,270| 29.7| 870,134| 27.1| 846,459| 28.1  \nGross loans receivable| 3,334,202| 100.0| %| 3,207,016| 100.0| %| 3,014,261| 100.0| %  \nNet deferred origination fees| (7,742| )| (7,462| )| (6,708| )  \nLoans receivable| $| 3,326,460| $| 3,199,554| $| 3,007,553  \nLoan Yield (1)| 11.23| %| 10.85| %| 10.85| %  \n  \n(1) Loan yield is annualized for the three months ended for each period presented and includes loans held for sale and nonaccrual loans.\n\nPlease see Appendix A for additional loan portfolio detail regarding industry concentrations.\n\nThe following tables detail the community bank and CCBX loans which are included in the total loan portfolio table above.\n\n**Community Bank**| **As of**  \n---|---  \n**June 30, 2024**| **March 31, 2024**| **June 30, 2023**  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **Balance**| **% to Total**| **Balance**| **% to Total**| **Balance**| **% to Total**  \nCommercial and industrial loans| $| 144,436| 7.5| %| $| 154,395| 8.2| %| $| 155,078| 9.0| %  \nReal estate loans:  \nConstruction, land and land development loans| 173,064| 9.0| 160,862| 8.5| 186,706| 10.9  \nResidential real estate loans| 229,639| 12.0| 231,157| 12.2| 211,966| 12.3  \nCommercial real estate loans| 1,357,979| 70.8| 1,342,489| 71.0| 1,164,088| 67.7  \nConsumer and other loans:  \nOther consumer and other loans| 14,220| 0.7| 1,447| 0.1| 1,457| 0.1  \nGross Community Bank loans receivable| 1,919,338| 100.0| %| 1,890,350| 100.0| %| 1,719,295| 100.0| %  \nNet deferred origination fees| (7,304| )| (7,068| )| (6,261| )  \nLoans receivable| $| 1,912,034| $| 1,883,282| $| 1,713,034  \nLoan Yield(1)| 6.52| %| 6.46| %| 6.28| %  \n  \n(1) Loan yield is annualized for the three months ended for each period presented and includes loans held for sale and nonaccrual loans.\n\n**CCBX**| **As of**  \n---|---  \n**June 30, 2024**| **March 31, 2024**| **June 30, 2023**  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **Balance**| **% to Total**| **Balance**| **% to Total**| **Balance**| **% to Total**  \nCommercial and industrial loans:  \nCapital call lines| $| 109,133| 7.7| %| $| 135,671| 10.3| %| $| 138,428| 10.7| %  \nAll other commercial & industrial loans| 41,731| 3.0| 47,160| 3.6| 60,323| 4.7  \nReal estate loans:  \nResidential real estate loans| 287,950| 20.4| 265,148| 20.1| 251,213| 19.4  \nConsumer and other loans:  \nCredit cards| 549,241| 38.7| 505,706| 38.4| 379,642| 29.3  \nOther consumer and other loans| 426,809| 30.2| 362,981| 27.6| 465,360| 35.9  \nGross CCBX loans receivable| 1,414,864| 100.0| %| 1,316,666| 100.0| %| 1,294,966| 100.0| %  \nNet deferred origination (fees) costs| (438| )| (394| )| (447| )  \nLoans receivable| $| 1,414,426| $| 1,316,272| $| 1,294,519  \nLoan Yield - CCBX (1)(2)| 17.77| %| 17.34| %| 16.95| %  \n  \n(1)CCBX yield does not include the impact of BaaS loan expense.

The increase was due to a $80.5 million increase in core deposits. Deposits in our community bank segment increased $52.9 million from $1.43 billion at March 31, 2024, to $1.49 billion at June 30, 2024 and CCBX deposits increased $27.5 million, from $2.03 billion at March 31, 2024, to $2.06 billion at June 30, 2024. The deposits from our CCBX segment are predominately classified as interest bearing demand and money market accounts. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, noninterest bearing deposits increased $19.7 million, or 3.4%, to $593.8 million from $574.1 million at March 31, 2024. Community bank noninterest bearing deposits totaled $531.6 million or 35.7% of total community bank deposits and CCBX noninterest bearing deposits totaled $62.2 million, or 3.0% of total CCBX deposits. In the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024, interest bearing demand and money market accounts increased $66.1 million, savings deposits decreased $5.3 million, and time deposits decreased $22,000. Included in total deposits is $352.3 million in IntraFi network reciprocal interest bearing demand and money market accounts as of June 30, 2024, which provides our larger deposit customers with fully insured deposits through a reciprocal agreement with other banks. Uninsured deposits decreased to $532.9 million as of June 30, 2024, compared to $495.6 million as of March 31, 2024.\n\nTotal deposits increased $380.9 million, or 12.0%, to $3.54 billion at June 30, 2024 compared to $3.16 billion at June 30, 2023. The increase is largely the result of growth in CCBX deposits. Noninterest bearing deposits decreased $131.8 million, or 18.2%, to $593.8 million at June 30, 2024 from $725.6 million at June 30, 2023 as a result of customer movement from noninterest to interest bearing accounts. Interest bearing demand and money market accounts increased $542.6 million, or 23.4%, to $2.87 billion at June 30, 2024, and savings deposits decreased $20.2 million, or 22.7%, and time deposits decreased $9.7 million, or 39.2%, in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2023. Deposits in our CCBX segment increased $403.4 million, from $1.65 billion at June 30, 2023, to $2.06 billion at June 30, 2024 and community bank deposits decreased $22.5 million, from $1.51 billion at June 30, 2023, to $1.49 billion at June 30, 2024. The deposits from our CCBX segment are predominately classified as interest bearing demand and money market accounts. Uninsured deposits decreased to $532.9 million as of June 30, 2024, compared to $632.1 million as of June 30, 2023 primarily as a result of increased usage of our cash sweep and exchange services to other banks for increased FDIC insurance coverage as described below.\n\nAdditionally, as of June 30, 2024, $117.7 million in CCBX customer deposits were transferred off the Bank’s balance sheet to other financial institutions on a daily basis for additional FDIC insurance coverage. Efforts to retain and grow core deposits are evidenced by the high ratios in these categories when compared to total deposits.\n\nThe following table summarizes the deposit portfolio for the periods indicated.\n\n**Consolidated**| **As of June 30, 2024**| **As of March 31, 2024**| **As of June 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **Amount**| **Percent of****Total****Deposits**| **Balance**| **Percent of****Total****Deposits**| **Balance**| **Percent of****Total****Deposits**  \nDemand, noninterest bearing| $| 593,789| 16.8| %| $| 574,112| 16.6| %| $| 725,592| 22.9| %  \nInterest bearing demand and money market| 2,865,773| 80.9| 2,799,667| 80.9| 2,323,164| 73.5  \nSavings| 68,777| 1.9| 74,085| 2.1| 88,991| 2.8  \nTotal core deposits| 3,528,339| 99.6| 3,447,864| 99.6| 3,137,747| 99.2  \nBrokered deposits| 1| 0.0| 1| 0.0| 1| —  \nTime deposits less than $100,000| 6,741| 0.2| 7,199| 0.2| 9,741| 0.3  \nTime deposits $100,000 and over| 8,351| 0.2| 7,915| 0.2| 15,083| 0.5  \nTotal| $| 3,543,432| 100.0| %| $| 3,462,979| 100.0| %| $| 3,162,572| 100.0| %  \nCost of deposits (1)| 3.58| %| 3.49| %| 2.72| %  \n  \n(1) Cost of deposits is annualized for the three months ended for each period presented.\n\nThe following tables detail the community bank and CCBX deposits which are included in the total deposit portfolio table above.\n\n**Community Bank**| **As of**  \n---|---  \n**June 30, 2024**| **March 31, 2024**| **June 30, 2023**  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **Balance**| **% to Total**| **Balance**| **% to Total**| **Balance**| **% to Total**  \nDemand, noninterest bearing| $| 531,555| 35.7| %| $| 515,443| 35.9| %| $| 621,012| 41.1| %  \nInterest bearing demand and money market| 876,668| 59.0| 834,725| 58.2| 778,475| 51.6  \nSavings| 63,627| 4.3| 68,747| 4.8| 85,146| 5.7  \nTotal core deposits| 1,471,850| 99.0| 1,418,915| 98.9| 1,484,633| 98.4  \nBrokered deposits| 1| 0.0| 1| 0.0| 1| 0.0  \nTime deposits less than $100,000| 6,741| 0.5| 7,199| 0.5| 9,741| 0.6  \nTime deposits $100,000 and over| 8,351| 0.5| 7,915| 0.6| 15,083| 1.0  \nTotal Community Bank deposits| $| 1,486,943| 100.0| %| $| 1,434,030| 100.0| %| $| 1,509,458| 100.0| %  \nCost of deposits(1)| 1.77| %| 1.66| %| 0.98| %  \n  \n(1) Cost of deposits is annualized for the three months ended for each period presented.\n\n**CCBX**| **As of**  \n---|---  \n**June 30, 2024**| **March 31, 2024**| **June 30, 2023**  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **Balance**| **% to Total**| **Balance**| **% to Total**| **Balance**| **% to Total**  \nDemand, noninterest bearing| $| 62,234| 3.0| %| $| 58,669| 2.9| %| $| 104,580| 6.3| %  \nInterest bearing demand and money market| 1,989,105| 96.7| 1,964,942| 96.8| 1,544,689| 93.5  \nSavings| 5,150| 0.3| 5,338| 0.3| 3,845| 0.2  \nTotal core deposits| 2,056,489| 100.0| 2,028,949| 100.0| 1,653,114| 100.0  \nBaaS-brokered deposits| —| 0.0| —| 0.0| —| —  \nTotal CCBX deposits| $| 2,056,489| 100.0| %| $| 2,028,949| 100.0| %| $| 1,653,114| 100.0| %  \nCost of deposits (1)| 4.92| %| 4.93| %| 4.42| %  \n  \n(1) Cost of deposits is annualized for the three months ended for each period presented.\n\n**Borrowings**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had the capacity to borrow up to a total of $650.1 million from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and Federal Home Loan Bank, and an additional $50.0 million from a correspondent bank, with no borrowings outstanding on these lines as of June 30, 2024.\n\n**Shareholders’ Equity**\n\nThe Company had a cash balance of $5.3 million as of June 30, 2024, which is retained for general operating purposes, including debt repayment, and for funding $593,000 in commitments to bank technology funds. \n\nTotal shareholders’ equity increased $13.0 million since March 31, 2024. The increase in shareholders’ equity was primarily due to $11.6 million in net earnings, combined with an increase of $1.4 million in common stock outstanding as a result of equity awards exercised during the three months ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Capital Ratios**\n\nThe Company and the Bank remained well capitalized at June 30, 2024, as summarized in the following table.\n\n(unaudited)| **Coastal Community Bank**| **Coastal Financial Corporation**| **Minimum Well Capitalized Ratios under Prompt Corrective Action****(1)**  \n---|---|---|---  \nTier 1 Leverage Capital (to average assets)| 9.24| %| 8.31| %| 5.00| %  \nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital (to risk-weighted assets)| 10.15| %| 9.03| %| 6.50| %  \nTier 1 Capital (to risk-weighted assets)| 10.15| %| 9.13| %| 8.00| %  \nTotal Capital (to risk-weighted assets)| 11.44| %| 11.70| %| 10.00| %  \n  \n(1) Presents the minimum capital ratios for an insured depository institution, such as the Bank, to be considered well capitalized under the Prompt Corrective Action framework. The minimum requirements for the Company to be considered well capitalized under Regulation Y include to maintain, on a consolidated basis, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 percent or greater and a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 percent or greater.\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nThe total allowance for credit losses was $147.9 million and 4.45% of loans receivable at June 30, 2024 compared to $139.3 million and 4.35% at March 31, 2024 and $110.8 million and 3.68% at June 30, 2023. The allowance for credit loss allocated to the CCBX portfolio was $126.9 million and 8.97% of CCBX loans receivable at June 30, 2024, with $21.0 million of allowance for credit loss allocated to the community bank or 1.10% of total community bank loans receivable.\n\nThe following table details the allocation of the allowance for credit loss as of the period indicated:\n\n**As of June 30, 2024**| **As of March 31, 2024**| **As of June 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **Community Bank**| **CCBX**| **Total**| **Community Bank**| **CCBX**| **Total**| **Community Bank**| **CCBX**| **Total**  \nLoans receivable| $| 1,912,034| $| 1,414,426| $| 3,326,460| $| 1,883,282| $| 1,316,272| $| 3,199,554| $| 1,713,034| $| 1,294,519| $| 3,007,553  \nAllowance for credit losses| (21,045| )| (126,869| )| (147,914| )| (21,384| )| (117,874| )| (139,258| )| (20,653| )| (90,109| )| (110,762| )  \nAllowance for credit losses to total loans receivable| 1.10| %| 8.97| %| 4.45| %| 1.14| %| 8.96| %| 4.35| %| 1.21| %| 6.96| %| 3.68| %  \n  \nProvision for credit losses - loans totaled $61.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, $79.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and $52.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. Net charge-offs totaled $53.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $57.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and $31.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans decreased to 6.57% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to 7.34% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 which we believe is a result of the steps we took to strengthen our credit quality. Provisions for credit losses – loans decreased largely due to a steadying of expected loss rates on CCBX loans receivable. CCBX partner agreements provide for a credit enhancement that covers the net-charge-offs on CCBX loans and negative deposit accounts by indemnifying or reimbursing incurred losses, except in accordance with the program agreement for one partner where the Company was responsible for credit losses on approximately 5% of a $353.6 million loan portfolio. At June 30, 2024, our portion of this portfolio represented $17.7 million in loans. The provision on the Company's portion of the portfolio was $1.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $1.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nNet charge-offs for this $17.7 million in loans were $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $2.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $917,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nThe following table details net charge-offs for the community bank and CCBX for the period indicated:\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**June 30, 2024**| **March 31, 2024**| **June 30, 2023**  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **Community Bank**| **CCBX**| **Total**| **Community Bank**| **CCBX**| **Total**| **Community Bank**| **CCBX**| **Total**  \nGross charge-offs| $| 2| $| 55,205| $| 55,207| $| 15| $| 58,979| $| 58,994| $| 9| $| 32,290| $| 32,299  \nGross recoveries| (4| )| (1,969| )| (1,973| )| (4| )| (1,772| )| (1,776| )| —| (1,340| )| (1,340| )  \nNet charge-offs| $| (2| )| $| 53,236| $| 53,234| $| 11| $| 57,207| $| 57,218| $| 9| $| 30,950| $| 30,959  \nNet charge-offs to average loans (1)| 0.00| %| 15.72| %| 6.57| %| 0.00| %| 18.18| %| 7.34| %| 0.00| %| 9.78| %| 4.19| %  \n**Six Months Ended**  \n---  \n**June 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2023**  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **Community Bank**| **CCBX**| **Total**| **Community Bank**| **CCBX**| **Total**  \nGross charge-offs| $| 17| $| 114,184| $| 114,201| $| 59| $| 66,407| $| 66,466  \nGross recoveries| (8| )| (3,741| )| (3,749| )| (5| )| (3,200| )| (3,205| )  \nNet charge-offs| $| 9| $| 110,443| $| 110,452| $| 54| $| 63,207| $| 63,261  \nNet charge-offs to average loans (1)| 0.00| %| 16.90| %| 6.95| %| 0.01| %| 10.92| %| 4.50| %  \n  \n(1) Annualized calculations shown for periods presented.\n\nThe decrease in the Company’s provision for credit losses - loans during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, is largely the result of a steadying of expected loss rates in our CCBX portfolio. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, a $62.2 million provision for credit losses - loans was recorded for CCBX partner loans based on management’s analysis, compared to the $79.7 million provision for credit losses - loans that was recorded for CCBX for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, largely as a result of the mix in CCBX loans receivable. CCBX loans have a higher level of expected losses than our community bank loans, which is reflected in the factors for the allowance for credit losses. Agreements with our CCBX partners provide for a credit enhancement which protects the Bank by indemnifying or reimbursing incurred losses.\n\nIn accordance with accounting guidance, we estimate and record a provision for expected losses for these CCBX loans and reclassified negative deposit accounts. When the provision for CCBX credit losses and provision for unfunded commitments is recorded, a credit enhancement asset is also recorded on the balance sheet through noninterest income (BaaS credit enhancements). Expected losses are recorded in the allowance for credit losses. The credit enhancement asset is relieved when credit enhancement recoveries are received from the CCBX partner. If our partner is unable to fulfill their contracted obligations then the Bank could be exposed to additional credit losses. Management regularly evaluates and manages this counterparty risk.\n\nThe factors used in management’s analysis for community bank credit losses indicated that a provision recapture of $341,000 and was needed for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to provision recaptures of $199,000 and $47,000 for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively.\n\nThe following table details the provision expense/(recapture) for the community bank and CCBX for the period indicated:\n\n**Three Months Ended**| **Six Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **June 30,****2024**| **March 31,****2024**| **June 30,****2023**| **June 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2023**  \nCommunity bank| $| (341| )| $| (199| )| $| (47| )| $| (540| )| $| 381  \nCCBX| 62,231| 79,717| 52,645| 141,948| 95,761  \nTotal provision expense| $| 61,890| $| 79,518| $| 52,598| $| 141,408| $| 96,142  \n  \nAt June 30, 2024, our nonperforming assets were $53.2 million, or 1.34% of total assets, compared to $54.9 million, or 1.42%, of total assets, at March 31, 2024, and $33.7 million, or 0.95% of total assets, at June 30, 2023. These ratios are impacted by CCBX loans over 90 days delinquent that are covered by CCBX partner credit enhancements. As of June 30, 2024, $43.9 million of the $45.2 million in nonperforming CCBX loans were covered by CCBX partner credit enhancements described above. Nonperforming assets decreased $1.7 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to a $1.7 million decrease in CCBX loans that are past due 90 days or more and still accruing. As a result of the type of loans (primarily consumer loans) originated through our CCBX partners we anticipate that balances 90 days past due or more and still accruing will generally increase as those loan portfolios grow. Installment/closed-end and revolving/open-end consumer loans originated through CCBX lending partners will continue to accrue interest until 120 and 180 days past due, respectively and are reported as substandard, 90 days or more days past due and still accruing. There were no repossessed assets or other real estate owned at June 30, 2024. Our nonperforming loans to loans receivable ratio was 1.60% at June 30, 2024, compared to 1.71% at March 31, 2024, and 1.12% at June 30, 2023.\n\nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2024, there were $2,000 community bank net recoveries and $7.9 million nonperforming community bank loans, including a multifamily loan for $6.9 million with a $1.1 million reserve to align with purchase sale agreement. For the quarter ended June 30, 2024 $53.2 million in net charge-offs were recorded on CCBX loans. These CCBX loans have a higher level of expected losses than our community bank loans, which is reflected in the factors for the allowance for credit losses.\n\nThe following table details the Company’s nonperforming assets for the periods indicated.\n\n**Consolidated**  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **As of June 30, 2024**| **As of March 31, 2024**| **As of June 30, 2023**  \n**Nonaccrual loans:**  \nCommercial and industrial loans| $| —| $| —| $| 5  \nReal estate loans:  \nConstruction, land and land development| —| —| 66  \nResidential real estate| 213| 212| 186  \nCommercial real estate| 7,731| 7,731| 7,142  \nTotal nonaccrual loans| 7,944| 7,943| 7,399  \n**Accruing loans past due 90 days or more:**  \nCommercial & industrial loans| 1,278| 1,793| 808  \nReal estate loans:  \nResidential real estate loans| 2,722| 1,796| 1,722  \nConsumer and other loans:  \nCredit cards| 36,465| 37,603| 18,306  \nOther consumer and other loans| 4,779| 5,731| 5,492  \nTotal accruing loans past due 90 days or more| 45,244| 46,923| 26,328  \n**Total nonperforming loans**|  53,188| 54,866| 33,727  \n**Real estate owned**|  —| —| —  \n**Repossessed assets**|  —| —| —  \nTotal nonperforming assets| $| 53,188| $| 54,866| $| 33,727  \nTotal nonaccrual loans to loans receivable| 0.24| %| 0.25| %| 0.25| %  \nTotal nonperforming loans to loans receivable| 1.60| %| 1.71| %| 1.12| %  \nTotal nonperforming assets to total assets| 1.34| %| 1.42| %| 0.95| %  \n  \nThe following tables detail the community bank and CCBX nonperforming assets which are included in the total nonperforming assets table above.\n\n**Community Bank**| **As of**  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **June 30,****2024**| **March 31,****2024**| **June 30,****2023**  \n**Nonaccrual loans:**  \nCommercial and industrial loans| $| —| $| —| $| 5  \nReal estate:  \nConstruction, land and land development| —| —| 66  \nResidential real estate| 213| 212| 186  \nCommercial real estate| 7,731| 7,731| 7,142  \nTotal nonaccrual loans| 7,944| 7,943| 7,399  \n**Accruing loans past due 90 days or more:**  \nTotal accruing loans past due 90 days or more| —| —| —  \nTotal nonperforming loans| 7,944| 7,943| 7,399  \n**Other real estate owned**|  —| —| —  \n**Repossessed assets**|  —| —| —  \nTotal nonperforming assets| $| 7,944| $| 7,943| $| 7,399  \nTotal community bank nonperforming assets to total consolidated assets| 0.20| %| 0.21| %| 0.21| %  \n**CCBX**| **As of**  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **June 30,****2024**| **March 31,****2024**| **June 30,****2023**  \n**Nonaccrual loans**|  $| —| $| —| $| —  \n**Accruing loans past due 90 days or more:**  \nCommercial & industrial loans| 1,278| 1,793| 808  \nReal estate loans:  \nResidential real estate loans| 2,722| 1,796| 1,722  \nConsumer and other loans:  \nCredit cards| 36,465| 37,603| 18,306  \nOther consumer and other loans| 4,779| 5,731| 5,492  \nTotal accruing loans past due 90 days or more| 45,244| 46,923| 26,328  \nTotal nonperforming loans| 45,244| 46,923| 26,328  \n**Other real estate owned**|  —| —| —  \n**Repossessed assets**|  —| —| —  \nTotal nonperforming assets| $| 45,244| $| 46,923| $| 26,328  \nTotal CCBX nonperforming assets to total consolidated assets| 1.14| %| 1.21| %| 0.74| %  \n  \n**About Coastal Financial**\n\nCoastal Financial Corporation (Nasdaq: CCB) (the “Company”), is an Everett, Washington based bank holding company whose wholly owned subsidiaries are Coastal Community Bank (“Bank”) and Arlington Olympic LLC.

We calculate tangible book value per share as total shareholders’ equity at the end of the relevant period, less goodwill and other intangible assets, divided by the outstanding number of our common shares at the end of each period. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is book value per share. We had no goodwill or other intangible assets as of any of the dates indicated. As a result, tangible book value per share is the same as book value per share as of each of the dates indicated.

As other companies may use different calculations for these adjusted measures, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled adjusted measures reported by other companies.\n\nThe following non-GAAP measures are presented to illustrate the impact of BaaS loan expense on net loan income and yield on CCBX loans and the impact of BaaS loan expense on net interest income and net interest margin.\n\nNet BaaS loan income divided by average CCBX loans is a non-GAAP measure that includes the impact BaaS loan expense on net BaaS loan income and the yield on CCBX loans. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is yield on CCBX loans.\n\nNet interest income net of BaaS loan expense is a non-GAAP measure that includes the impact BaaS loan expense on net interest income. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net interest income.\n\nNet interest margin, net of BaaS loan expense is a non-GAAP measure that includes the impact of BaaS loan expense on net interest rate margin. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net interest margin.\n\nReconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP measures are presented below.\n\n**As of and for the Three Months Ended**| **As of and for the Six Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**(dollars in thousands; unaudited)**| **June 30,****2024**| **March 31,****2024**| **June 30,****2023**| **June 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2023**  \n**Net BaaS loan income divided by average CCBX loans:**  \nCCBX loan yield (GAAP)(1)| 17.77| %| 17.34| %| 16.95| %| 17.56| %| 16.56| %  \nTotal average CCBX loans receivable| $| 1,362,343| $| 1,265,857| $| 1,269,406| $| 1,314,099| $| 1,167,366  \nInterest and earned fee income on CCBX loans (GAAP)| 60,203| 54,569| 53,632| 114,772| 95,851  \nBaaS loan expense| (29,076| )| (24,837| )| (22,033| )| (53,913| )| (39,587| )  \nNet BaaS loan income| $| 31,127| $| 29,732| $| 31,599| $| 60,859| $| 56,264  \nNet BaaS loan income divided by average CCBX loans (1)| 9.19| %| 9.45| %| 9.98| %| 9.31| %| 9.72| %  \n**Net interest margin, net of BaaS loan expense:**  \nCCBX interest margin (1)| 9.05| %| 8.60| %| 10.41| %| 8.83| %| 10.29| %  \nCCBX earning assets| 1,972,989| 1,864,156| 1,544,628| 1,918,573| 1,421,418  \nNet interest income| 44,383| 39,866| 40,107| 84,249| 72,554  \nLess: BaaS loan expense| (29,076| )| (24,837| )| (22,033| )| (53,913| )| (39,587| )  \nNet interest income, net of BaaS loan expense| $| 15,307| $| 15,029| $| 18,074| $| 30,336| $| 32,967  \nCCBX net interest margin, net of BaaS loan expense (1)| 3.12| %| 3.24| %| 4.69| %| 3.18| %| 4.68| %  \n  \n(1) Annualized calculations for periods presented.\n\n**APPENDIX A -****As of****June 30, 2024**\n\nIndustry Concentration\n\nWe have a diversified loan portfolio, representing a wide variety of industries.

Agreements with our CCBX partners provide for a credit enhancement provided by the partner which protects the Bank by indemnifying or reimbursing incurred losses. In accordance with accounting guidance, we estimate and record a provision for expected losses for these CCBX loans, unfunded commitments and negative deposit accounts. When the provision for credit losses - loans and provision for unfunded commitments is recorded, a credit enhancement asset is also recorded on the balance sheet through noninterest income (BaaS credit enhancements) in recognition of the CCBX partner legal commitment to indemnify or reimburse losses. The credit enhancement asset is relieved as credit enhancement payments and recoveries are received from the CCBX partner or taken from the partner's cash reserve account. Agreements with our CCBX partners also provide protection to the Bank from fraud by indemnifying or reimbursing incurred fraud losses. BaaS fraud includes noncredit fraud losses on loans and deposits originated through partners. Fraud losses are recorded when incurred as losses in noninterest expense, and the enhancement received from the CCBX partner is recorded in noninterest income, resulting in a net impact of zero to the income statement. Many CCBX partners also pledge a cash reserve account at the Bank which the Bank can collect from when losses occur that is then replenished by the partner on a regular interval. Although agreements with our CCBX partners provide for credit enhancements that provide protection to the Bank from credit and fraud losses by indemnifying or reimbursing incurred credit and fraud losses, if our partner is unable to fulfill their contracted obligation then the bank would be exposed to additional loan and deposit losses if the cash flows on the loans were not sufficient to fund the reimbursement of loan losses, as a result of this counterparty risk. If a CCBX partner does not replenish their cash reserve account the Bank may consider an alternative plan for funding the cash reserve. This may involve the possibility of adjusting the funding amounts or timelines to better align with the partner's specific situation. If a mutually agreeable funding plan is not agreed to, the Bank could declare the agreement in default, take over servicing and cease paying the partner for servicing the loan and providing credit enhancements. The Bank would evaluate any remaining credit enhancement asset from the CCBX partner in the event the partner failed to determine if a write-off is appropriate. If a write-off occurs, the Bank would retain the full yield and any fee income on the loan portfolio going forward, and our BaaS loan expense would decrease once default occurred and payments to the CCBX partner were stopped.\n\nThe Bank records contractual interest earned from the borrower on CCBX partner loans in interest income, adjusted for origination costs which are paid or payable to the CCBX partner. BaaS loan expense represents the amount paid or payable to partners for credit and fraud enhancements and originating & servicing CCBX loans. To determine net revenue (Net BaaS loan income) earned from CCBX loan relationships, the Bank takes BaaS loan interest income and deducts BaaS loan expense to arrive at Net BaaS loan income (_A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures are set forth in the preceding section of this earnings release.)_ which can be compared to interest income on the Company’s community bank loans.\n\nThe following table illustrates how CCBX partner loan income and expenses are recorded in the financial statements:\n\n**Loan income and related loan expense**| **Three Months Ended**| **Six Months Ended**  \n---|---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **June 30,****2024**| **March 31,****2024**| **June 30,****2023**| **June 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2023**  \nYield on loans (1)| 17.77| %| 17.34| %| 16.95| %| 17.56| %| 16.56| %  \nBaaS loan interest income| $| 60,203| $| 54,569| $| 53,632| $| 114,772| $| 95,851  \nLess: BaaS loan expense| 29,076| 24,837| 22,033| 53,913| 39,587  \nNet BaaS loan income (2)| 31,127| 29,732| 31,599| 60,859| 56,264  \nNet BaaS loan income divided by average BaaS loans (1)(2)| 9.19| %| 9.45| %| 9.98| %| 9.31| %| 9.72| %  \n  \n(1) Annualized calculation for quarterly periods shown.(2) A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures are set forth in the preceding section of this earnings release.\n\nAn increase in CCBX loans receivable resulted in increased interest income on CCBX loans during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The increase in CCBX loans receivable was primarily due to growth in the CCBX loan portfolio as part of our strategy to optimize the CCBX loan portfolio and strengthen our balance sheet through originating higher quality new loans and enhanced credit standards. Increased interest rates and growth in CCBX loans and deposits has resulted in increases in interest income and expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2023.\n\nThe following tables are a summary of the interest components, direct fees, and expenses of BaaS for the periods indicated and are not inclusive of all income and expense related to BaaS.\n\n**Interest income**| **Three Months Ended**| **Six Months Ended**  \n---|---|---  \n(dollars in thousands;

We are implementing strategies to increase fee income and we continue to build out and invest in an infrastructure that is scalable, and that we believe will enable us to be innovative leaders in financial services.”\n\n**Key Points for Third Quarter and Our Go-Forward Strategy**\n\n  * **Balance Sheet Well Positioned for Lower Rates.** Our balance sheet stands in a modestly liability sensitive position as of September 30, 2024, with $1.95 billion of CCBX deposits that contractually reprice lower immediately upon any reduction in the Federal Funds Rate, with $1.09 billion of CCBX loans repricing in 90 days or less following such reduction. The Federal Open Market Committee recently lowered the targeted Federal Funds rate 0.50% on September 19, 2024; a reduction of 0.50% compared to June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The rate decrease came late in the quarter, so the full impact of this and any subsequent rate changes will be reflected in future periods. \n  * **Expanding Relationships with CCBX Partners.** We continue to focus on expanding product offerings with existing CCBX partners. We believe that launching new products with existing partners positions us to reach a wide and established customer base with modest increase in enterprise risk. Products launched in 2024 with existing partners have gained traction and are growing the balance sheet and increasing income. The pipeline for CCBX is active, although we expect to remain selective in adding new partners to manage risk and capital.\n  * **On-going Loan Sales.** We sold $423.7 million loans in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as part of our strategy to balance credit risk, manage partner and lending limits, protect capital levels and move credit card balances to an off balance sheet fee generating model. We are retaining a portion of the fee income for our role in processing transactions on sold credit card balances. This provides an on-going and passive revenue stream with no on balance sheet risk.\n  * **Continued Regulatory and Compliance Infrastructure Investments Position Us Well for Next Phase of Growth.** We continue to utilize co-sourced personnel as a component of our risk and compliance efforts. This flexible co-sourcing approach allows us to manage the growth of our internal team while also ensuring CCBX has the resources it needs. While we remain 100% indemnified against partner fraud losses, we were encouraged to see fraudulent activity amongst our partners remains low during the current quarter, compared to the same period last year, a positive indicator of our continued investments in our risk infrastructure.\n  * **Reorganization and Strengthening of Talent to Accommodate Growth and Plans for the Future.** We recently announced the bifurcation of the President of the Bank into two roles, appointing Brian Hamilton as President of CCBX, the Fintech and BaaS segment of the Bank, with Curt Queyrouze serving as President of the community bank and corporate credit.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\nThe tables below outline some of our key operating metrics.\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data;

(3) We calculate book value per share as total shareholders’ equity at the end of the relevant period divided by the outstanding number of our common shares at the end of each period.(4) Tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate tangible book value per share as total shareholders’ equity at the end of the relevant period, less goodwill and other intangible assets, divided by the outstanding number of our common shares at the end of each period. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is book value per share. We had no goodwill or other intangible assets as of any of the dates indicated. As a result, tangible book value per share is the same as book value per share as of each of the dates indicated.

ROA for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, increased 0.13% and 0.21% compared to June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Noninterest expenses were higher for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 largely due to an increase in BaaS loan expense, which is directly related to the increase in the amount of interest earned on CCBX loans.\n\nThe following table shows the Company’s key performance ratios for the periods indicated. \n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n(unaudited)| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **March 31,****2024**| **December 31,****2023**| **September 30,****2023**  \nReturn on average assets (1)| 1.34| %| 1.21| %| 0.73| %| 0.97| %| 1.13| %  \nReturn on average equity (1)| 16.67| %| 15.22| %| 9.21| %| 12.35| %| 14.60| %  \nYield on earnings assets (1)| 10.79| %| 10.49| %| 10.07| %| 9.77| %| 10.08| %  \nYield on loans receivable (1)| 11.43| %| 11.23| %| 10.85| %| 10.71| %| 10.84| %  \nCost of funds (1)| 3.62| %| 3.60| %| 3.52| %| 3.39| %| 3.18| %  \nCost of deposits (1)| 3.59| %| 3.58| %| 3.49| %| 3.36| %| 3.14| %  \nNet interest margin (1)| 7.41| %| 7.13| %| 6.78| %| 6.61| %| 7.10| %  \nNoninterest expense to average assets (1)| 6.54| %| 6.14| %| 6.04| %| 5.56| %| 6.23| %  \nNoninterest income to average assets (1)| 7.98| %| 7.30| %| 9.38| %| 6.95| %| 3.81| %  \nEfficiency ratio| 43.10| %| 43.19| %| 37.88| %| 41.58| %| 58.36| %  \nLoans receivable to deposits (2)| 94.46| %| 93.88| %| 92.42| %| 90.05| %| 90.19| %  \n  \n(1) Annualized calculations shown for quarterly periods presented.(2) Includes loans held for sale.\n\n**Management Outlook; CEO Eric Sprink**\n\n“As we look ahead to the fourth quarter and 2025, we remain laser focused on building out our technology and risk management infrastructure to more efficiently support our next phase of growth within CCBX. While the balance sheet re-mix earlier this year resulted in a short-term reduction to income, we continue to make strategic decisions which are enhancing credit quality, generating passive fee income, strengthening our talent and growing relationships with established and prospective CCBX partners all of which are expected to position Coastal to be more profitable in 2025.”\n\n**Coastal Financial Corporation Overview**\n\nThe Company has one main subsidiary, the Bank which consists of three segments: CCBX, the community bank and treasury & administration. The CCBX segment includes all of our BaaS activities, the community bank segment includes all community banking activities, and the treasury & administration segment includes treasury management, overall administration and all other aspects of the Company. \n\n**CCBX Performance Update**\n\nOur CCBX segment continues to evolve, and we have 22 relationships, at varying stages, as of September 30, 2024. We continue to refine the criteria for CCBX partnerships, are exiting relationships where it makes sense for us to do so and are focusing on larger more established partners, with experienced management teams, existing customer bases and strong financial positions.\n\nWe are expanding product offerings with our existing CCBX partners. We believe that launching new products with existing partners positions us to reach a wide and established customer base with a modest increase in regulatory risk given we have already vetted these partners and have operational history. Products launched earlier in the year with existing partners have gained traction and are growing the balance sheet and increasing income. We continue to sell loans as part of our strategy to balance partner and lending limits, and manage the loan portfolio and credit quality. We retain a portion of the fee income for our role in processing transactions on sold credit card balances. This is expected to provide an on-going and passive revenue stream with no on balance sheet risk.\n\nThe following table illustrates the activity and evolution in CCBX relationships for the periods presented.\n\n**As of**  \n---  \n(unaudited)| **September 30, 2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \nActive| 19| 19| 18  \nFriends and family / testing| 1| 1| 1  \nImplementation / onboarding| 1| 1| 1  \nSigned letters of intent| 1| 0| 1  \nWind down - active but preparing to exit relationship| 0| 0| 1  \nTotal CCBX relationships| 22| 21| 22  \n  \nCCBX loans increased $106.9 million, or 7.6%, despite selling $423.7 million loans during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to $1.52 billion, while we continued to enhance credit standards on new CCBX loan originations. In accordance with the program agreement for one partner, effective April 1, 2024, the portion of the CCBX portfolio that we are responsible for losses on decreased from 10% to 5%. At September 30, 2024 the portion of this portfolio for which we are responsible represented $19.8 million in loans.\n\nThe following table details the CCBX loan portfolio:\n\n**CCBX**| **As of**  \n---|---  \n**September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **Balance**| **% to Total**| **Balance**| **% to Total**| **Balance**| **% to Total**  \nCommercial and industrial loans:  \nCapital call lines| $| 103,924| 6.8| %| $| 109,133| 7.7| %| $| 114,174| 9.6| %  \nAll other commercial & industrial loans| 36,494| 2.4| 41,731| 3.0| 58,869| 5.0  \nReal estate loans:  \nResidential real estate loans| 265,402| 17.5| 287,950| 20.4| 251,775| 21.3  \nConsumer and other loans:  \nCredit cards| 633,691| 41.6| 549,241| 38.7| 440,993| 37.3  \nOther consumer and other loans| 482,228| 31.7| 426,809| 30.2| 316,987| 26.8  \nGross CCBX loans receivable| 1,521,739| 100.0| %| 1,414,864| 100.0| %| 1,182,798| 100.0| %  \nNet deferred origination (fees) costs| (447| )| (438| )| (424| )  \nLoans receivable| $| 1,521,292| $| 1,414,426| $| 1,182,374  \nLoan Yield - CCBX (1)(2)| 17.35| %| 17.77| %| 17.05| %  \n  \n(1) CCBX yield does not include the impact of BaaS loan expense.

We continue to monitor and manage the CCBX loan portfolio, and sold $423.7 million in CCBX loans during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to sales of $155.2 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2024. We continue to reposition ourselves by managing CCBX credit and concentration levels in an effort to optimize our loan portfolio and generate off balance sheet fee income.\n\nOur credit card program through CCBX continues to grow in dollars and number of active cards as shown in the graph below:\n\n![Graph 1](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/2d50cba0-18d9-4c78-8e96-0418250a8658/image2.png)\n\nThe following table details the CCBX deposit portfolio:\n\n**CCBX**| **As of**  \n---|---  \n**September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **Balance**| **% to Total**| **Balance**| **% to Total**| **Balance**| **% to Total**  \nDemand, noninterest bearing| $| 60,655| 2.9| %| $| 62,234| 3.0| %| $| 67,782| 3.9| %  \nInterest bearing demand and money market| 1,991,858| 94.6| 1,989,105| 96.7| 1,679,921| 95.9  \nSavings| 5,204| 0.3| 5,150| 0.3| 4,529| 0.2  \nTotal core deposits| 2,057,717| 97.8| 2,056,489| 100.0| 1,752,232| 100.0  \nOther deposits| 47,046| 2.2| —| 0.0| —| —  \nTotal CCBX deposits| $| 2,104,763| 100.0| %| $| 2,056,489| 100.0| %| $| 1,752,232| 100.0| %  \nCost of deposits (1)| 4.82| %| 4.92| %| 4.80| %  \n  \n(1) Cost of deposits is annualized for the three months ended for each period presented.CCBX deposits increased $48.3 million, or 2.3%, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 to $2.10 billion.

Amounts in excess of FDIC insurance coverage are transferred, using a third party facilitator/vendor sweep product, to participating financial institutions.\n\n**Community Bank Performance Update**\n\nIn the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the community bank saw net loans decrease $14.5 million, or 0.8%, to $1.90 billion.\n\nThe following table details the Community Bank loan portfolio:\n\n**Community Bank**| **As of**  \n---|---  \n**September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **Balance**| **% to Total**| **Balance**| **% to Total**| **Balance**| **% to Total**  \nCommercial and industrial loans| $| 152,161| 8.0| %| $| 144,436| 7.5| %| $| 158,232| 8.8| %  \nReal estate loans:  \nConstruction, land and land development loans| 163,051| 8.6| 173,064| 9.0| 167,686| 9.4  \nResidential real estate loans| 212,467| 11.2| 229,639| 12.0| 225,372| 12.6  \nCommercial real estate loans| 1,362,452| 71.5| 1,357,979| 70.8| 1,237,849| 69.1  \nConsumer and other loans:  \nOther consumer and other loans| 14,173| 0.7| 14,220| 0.7| 2,483| 0.1  \nGross Community Bank loans receivable| 1,904,304| 100.0| %| 1,919,338| 100.0| %| 1,791,622| 100.0| %  \nNet deferred origination fees| (6,764| )| (7,304| )| (6,961| )  \nLoans receivable| $| 1,897,540| $| 1,912,034| $| 1,784,661  \nLoan Yield(1)| 6.64| %| 6.52| %| 6.20| %  \n  \n(1) Loan yield is annualized for the three months ended for each period presented and includes loans held for sale and nonaccrual loans.Community bank loans had a $10.0 million decrease in construction, land and land development loans, partially offset by an increase of $7.7 million in commercial and industrial loans and an increase in commercial real estate loans of $4.5 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024; consumer and other loans were flat.\n\nThe following table details the community bank deposit portfolio:\n\n**Community Bank**| **As of**  \n---|---  \n**September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **Balance**| **% to Total**| **Balance**| **% to Total**| **Balance**| **% to Total**  \nDemand, noninterest bearing| $| 518,772| 34.1| %| $| 531,555| 35.6| %| $| 584,004| 37.9| %  \nInterest bearing demand and money market| 552,108| 36.3| 876,668| 59.0| 852,747| 55.5  \nSavings| 62,272| 4.1| 63,627| 4.3| 80,099| 5.2  \nTotal core deposits| 1,133,152| 74.5| 1,471,850| 98.9| 1,516,850| 98.6  \nOther deposits| 373,681| 24.5| 1| 0.0| 1| 0.0  \nTime deposits less than $100,000| 6,305| 0.4| 6,741| 0.5| 8,635| 0.6  \nTime deposits $100,000 and over| 9,387| 0.6| 8,351| 0.6| 11,982| 0.8  \nTotal Community Bank deposits| $| 1,522,525| 100.0| %| $| 1,486,943| 100.0| %| $| 1,537,468| 100.0| %  \nCost of deposits(1)| 1.92| %| 1.77| %| 1.31| %  \n  \n(1) Cost of deposits is annualized for the three months ended for each period presented.Community bank deposits increased $35.6 million, or 2.4%, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to $1.52 billion. This is the second consecutive quarter of growth after allowing higher rate balances to run-off earlier in the year. The community bank segment includes noninterest bearing deposits of $518.8 million, or 34.1%, of total community bank deposits, resulting in a cost of deposits of 1.92%, which compared to 1.77% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Margin Discussion**\n\nNet interest income was $72.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $5.9 million, or 9.0%, from $66.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and an increase of $10.0 million, or 16.0%, from $62.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest income compared to June 30, 2024, was a result of increased interest income due to an increase in average loans receivable partially offset by an increase in cost of funds. The increase in net interest income compared to September 30, 2023 was largely related to increased yield on loans resulting from higher interest rates and growth in higher yielding loans partially offset by an increase in cost of funds relating to higher interest rates and growth in interest bearing deposits. \n\nNet interest margin was 7.41% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.13% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, with the increase primarily due to higher loan yields. Net interest margin was 7.10% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was largely due to an increase in loan yield partially offset by higher interest rates on interest bearing deposits. Interest and fees on loans receivable increased $8.6 million, or 9.5%, to $99.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $90.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and increased $15.9 million, or 19.1%, compared to $83.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to an increase in outstanding balances and higher interest rates. \n\nAverage investment securities decreased $795,000 to $49.0 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 and decreased $69.0 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of maturing securities.\n\nCost of funds was 3.62% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2 basis points from the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and an increase of 44 basis points from the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Cost of deposits for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 3.59%, compared to 3.58% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and 3.14% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increased cost of funds and deposits compared to June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was due to the continued high interest rate environment. The late September reduction in the Fed funds rate is expected to help to lower our cost of deposits in future periods.\n\nThe following table summarizes the average yield on loans receivable and cost of deposits:\n\n**For the Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \n**Yield on****Loans****(2)**| **Cost of****Deposits****(2)**| **Yield on****Loans****(2)**| **Cost of****Deposits****(2)**| **Yield on****Loans****(2)**| **Cost of****Deposits****(2)**  \nCommunity Bank| 6.64| %| 1.92| %| 6.52| %| 1.77| %| 6.20| %| 1.31| %  \nCCBX (1)| 17.35| %| 4.82| %| 17.77| %| 4.92| %| 17.05| %| 4.80| %  \nConsolidated| 11.43| %| 3.59| %| 11.23| %| 3.58| %| 10.84| %| 3.14| %  \n  \n(1) CCBX yield on loans does not include the impact of BaaS loan expense. BaaS loan expense represents the amount paid or payable to partners for credit and fraud enhancements and originating & servicing CCBX loans. To determine Net BaaS loan income earned from CCBX loan relationships, the Company takes BaaS loan interest income and deducts BaaS loan expense to arrive at Net BaaS loan income which can be compared to interest income on the Company’s community bank loans. See reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures at the end of this earnings release for the impact of BaaS loan expense on CCBX loan yield.(2) Annualized calculations for periods shown.\n\nThe following tables illustrates how BaaS loan interest income is affected by BaaS loan expense resulting in net BaaS loan income and the associated yield:\n\n**For the Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \n(dollars in thousands, unaudited)| **Income / Expense**| **Income / expense divided by average CCBX loans****(2)**| **Income / Expense**| **Income / expense divided by****average CCBX loans****(2)**| **Income / Expense**| **Income / expense divided by average CCBX loans****(2)**  \nBaaS loan interest income| $| 67,692| 17.35| %| $| 60,203| 17.77| %| $| 56,279| 17.05| %  \nLess: BaaS loan expense| 32,612| 8.36| %| 29,076| 8.58| %| 23,003| 6.97| %  \nNet BaaS loan income (1)| $| 35,080| 8.99| %| $| 31,127| 9.19| %| $| 33,276| 10.08| %  \nAverage BaaS Loans(3)| $| 1,552,443| $| 1,362,343| $| 1,309,380  \n  \n(1) A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures are set forth at the end of this earnings release.(2) Annualized calculations shown for quarterly periods presented.(3) Includes loans held for sale.\n\n**Noninterest Income Discussion**\n\nNoninterest income was $80.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $10.2 million from $69.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and an increase of $45.5 million from $34.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in noninterest income over the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase of $9.9 million in total BaaS income. The $9.9 million increase in total BaaS income included a $9.3 million increase in BaaS credit enhancements related to the provision for credit losses, a $300,000 increase in BaaS fraud enhancements, and an increase of $340,000 in BaaS program income. The increase in BaaS program income is largely due to higher servicing and other BaaS fees, transaction fees and interchange fees and our primary BaaS source for recurring fee income (see “Appendix B” for more information on the accounting for BaaS allowance for credit losses and credit and fraud enhancements). Additionally, other income increased $229,000 largely due to increased incoming ACH activity.\n\nThe $45.5 million increase in noninterest income over the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a $43.4 million increase in BaaS credit and fraud enhancements, and an increase of $2.0 million in BaaS program income.\n\n**Noninterest Expense Discussion** Total noninterest expense increased $6.8 million to $65.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $58.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and increased $9.1 million from $56.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in noninterest expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024, was primarily due to a $3.8 million increase in BaaS expense (including a $300,000 increase in BaaS fraud expense and a $3.5 million increase in BaaS loan expense). BaaS loan expense represents the amount paid or payable to partners for credit enhancements, fraud enhancements, and originating & servicing CCBX loans. BaaS fraud expense represents non-credit fraud losses on partner’s customer loan and deposit accounts. A portion of this expense is realized during the quarter in which the loss occurs, and a portion is estimated based on historical or other information from our partners, partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in excise taxes (due to the recording of $1.2 million business and occupation tax credit from the State of Washington which resulted in the recognition of a net credit of $706,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to expense of $762,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024). We also recorded an increase of $587,000 in data processing and software licenses as a result of our continued investment in our infrastructure and the automation of our processes so that they are scalable and an increase of $499,000 in point of sale expenses as a result of increased partner transaction activity.\n\nThe increase in noninterest expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was largely due to an increase of $8.8 million in BaaS partner expense (including a $9.6 million increase in BaaS loan expense partially offset by a decrease of $766,000 in BaaS fraud expense), a $1.1 million increase in data processing and software licenses due to enhancements in technology, and a $526,000 increase in occupancy expense, largely due to higher software depreciation/amortization expense, partially offset by a $986,000 decrease in salary and employee benefits largely as a result of some one-time costs that were expensed in the quarter ended September 30, 2023 for which there was no similar expense in the current quarter, and an $850,000 decrease in legal and professional expenses as a result of risk management and projects being completed.\n\n**Provision for Income Taxes**\n\nThe provision for income taxes was $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, $3.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $2.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. The income tax provision was lower for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024 as a result of the deductibility of certain equity awards which reduced tax expense despite net income being higher and higher than the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher net income compared to that quarter.\n\nThe Company is subject to various state taxes that are assessed as CCBX activities and employees expand into other states, which has increased the overall tax rate used in calculating the provision for income taxes in the current and future periods. The Company uses a federal statutory tax rate of 21.0% as a basis for calculating provision for federal income taxes and 2.62% for calculating the provision for state income taxes.\n\n**Financial Condition Overview**\n\nTotal assets increased $104.3 million, or 2.6%, to $4.07 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to $3.96 billion at June 30, 2024. The increase is primarily due to stronger loan growth partially offset by lower cash balances. Total loans receivable increased $92.4 million to $3.42 billion at September 30, 2024, from $3.33 billion at June 30, 2024.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had the capacity to borrow up to a total of $656.3 million from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and Federal Home Loan Bank, and an additional $50.0 million from a correspondent bank no borrowings outstanding on these lines as of September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company had a cash balance of $5.9 million as of September 30, 2024, which is retained for general operating purposes, including debt repayment, and for funding $530,000 in commitments to bank technology funds. \n\nUninsured deposits were $542.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $532.9 million as of June 30, 2024.\n\nTotal shareholders’ equity increased $15.2 million since June 30, 2024. The increase in shareholders’ equity was primarily due to $13.5 million in net earnings, combined with an increase of $1.8 million in common stock outstanding as a result of equity awards exercised during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company and the Bank remained well capitalized at September 30, 2024, as summarized in the following table.\n\n(unaudited)| **Coastal Community Bank**| **Coastal Financial Corporation**| **Minimum Well Capitalized Ratios under Prompt Corrective Action****(1)**  \n---|---|---|---  \nTier 1 Leverage Capital (to average assets)| 9.29| %| 8.40| %| 5.00| %  \nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital (to risk-weighted assets)| 10.36| %| 9.26| %| 6.50| %  \nTier 1 Capital (to risk-weighted assets)| 10.36| %| 9.35| %| 8.00| %  \nTotal Capital (to risk-weighted assets)| 11.65| %| 11.90| %| 10.00| %  \n  \n(1) Presents the minimum capital ratios for an insured depository institution, such as the Bank, to be considered well capitalized under the Prompt Corrective Action framework. The minimum requirements for the Company to be considered well capitalized under Regulation Y include to maintain, on a consolidated basis, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 percent or greater and a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 percent or greater.\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nThe total allowance for credit losses was $170.3 million and 4.98% of loans receivable at September 30, 2024 compared to $147.9 million and 4.45% at June 30, 2024 and $101.1 million and 3.41% at September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit loss allocated to the CCBX portfolio was $150.1 million and 9.87% of CCBX loans receivable at September 30, 2024, with $20.1 million of allowance for credit loss allocated to the community bank or 1.06% of total community bank loans receivable.\n\nThe following table details the allocation of the allowance for credit loss as of the period indicated:\n\n**As of September 30, 2024**| **As of June 30, 2024**| **As of September 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **Community Bank**| **CCBX**| **Total**| **Community Bank**| **CCBX**| **Total**| **Community Bank**| **CCBX**| **Total**  \nLoans receivable| $| 1,897,540| $| 1,521,292| $| 3,418,832| $| 1,912,034| $| 1,414,426| $| 3,326,460| $| 1,784,661| $| 1,182,374| $| 2,967,035  \nAllowance for credit losses| (20,132| )| (150,131| )| (170,263| )| (21,045| )| (126,869| )| (147,914| )| (21,316| )| (79,769| )| (101,085| )  \nAllowance for credit losses to total loans receivable| 1.06| %| 9.87| %| 4.98| %| 1.10| %| 8.97| %| 4.45| %| 1.19| %| 6.75| %| 3.41| %  \n  \nNet charge-offs totaled $49.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $53.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and $36.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans decreased to 5.65% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.57% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which we believe is a result of the steps we took manage our credit quality. CCBX partner agreements provide for a credit enhancement that covers the net-charge-offs on CCBX loans and negative deposit accounts by indemnifying or reimbursing incurred losses, except in accordance with the program agreement for one partner where the Company was responsible for credit losses on approximately 5% of a $400.8 million loan portfolio. At September 30, 2024, our portion of this portfolio represented $19.8 million in loans. Net charge-offs for this $19.8 million in loans were $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $579,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe following table details net charge-offs for the community bank and CCBX for the period indicated:\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **Community Bank**| **CCBX**| **Total**| **Community Bank**| **CCBX**| **Total**| **Community Bank**| **CCBX**| **Total**  \nGross charge-offs| $| 398| $| 52,907| $| 53,305| $| 2| $| 55,205| $| 55,207| $| 3| $| 37,876| $| 37,879  \nGross recoveries| (3| )| (4,066| )| (4,069| )| (4| )| (1,969| )| (1,973| )| (3| )| (1,042| )| (1,045| )  \nNet charge-offs| $| 395| $| 48,841| $| 49,236| $| (2| )| $| 53,236| $| 53,234| $| —| $| 36,834| $| 36,834  \nNet charge-offs to average loans (1)| 0.08| %| 12.52| %| 5.65| %| 0.00| %| 15.72| %| 6.57| %| 0.00| %| 11.16| %| 4.77| %  \n  \n(1) Annualized calculations shown for periods presented.\n\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a $72.1 million provision for credit losses - loans was recorded for CCBX partner loans based on management’s analysis, compared to the $62.2 million provision for credit losses - loans that was recorded for CCBX for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. CCBX loans have a higher level of expected losses than our community bank loans, which is reflected in the factors for the allowance for credit losses. Agreements with our CCBX partners provide for a credit enhancement which protects the Bank by indemnifying or reimbursing incurred losses.\n\nIn accordance with accounting guidance, we estimate and record a provision for expected losses for these CCBX loans and reclassified negative deposit accounts. When the provision for CCBX credit losses and provision for unfunded commitments is recorded, a credit enhancement asset is also recorded on the balance sheet through noninterest income (BaaS credit enhancements). Expected losses are recorded in the allowance for credit losses. The credit enhancement asset is relieved when credit enhancement recoveries are received from the CCBX partner. If our partner is unable to fulfill their contracted obligations then the Bank could be exposed to additional credit losses. Management regularly evaluates and manages this counterparty risk.\n\nThe factors used in management’s analysis for community bank credit losses indicated that a provision recapture of $519,000 and was needed for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to a provision recapture of $341,000 and provision of $664,000 for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The recapture in the current period was largely due to a change in remaining average lives of community bank loans.\n\nThe following table details the provision expense/(recapture) for the community bank and CCBX for the period indicated:\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \nCommunity bank| $| (519| )| $| (341| )| $| 664  \nCCBX| 72,104| 62,231| 26,493  \nTotal provision expense| $| 71,585| $| 61,890| $| 27,157  \n  \nAt September 30, 2024, our nonperforming assets were $54.7 million, or 1.34%, of total assets, compared to $53.2 million, or 1.34%, of total assets, at June 30, 2024, and $43.5 million, or 1.18%, of total assets, at September 30, 2023. These ratios are impacted by nonperforming CCBX loans that are covered by CCBX partner credit enhancements. As of September 30, 2024, $52.0 million of the $53.6 million in nonperforming CCBX loans were covered by CCBX partner credit enhancements described above.\n\nNonperforming assets increased $1.5 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024. This change is largely due to an increase in CCBX nonaccrual loans partially offset by a decrease in community bank nonaccrual loans. CCBX nonaccrual loans increased $8.0 million as a result of a new collection practice that places certain loans on nonaccrual status to improve collectability, $5.3 million of these loans are less than 90 days past due as of September 30, 2024. CCBX loans that are past due 90 days or more and still accruing was $45.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to $45.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. As a result of the type of loans (primarily consumer loans) originated through our CCBX partners we anticipate that balances 90 days past due or more and still accruing will generally increase as those loan portfolios grow. Installment/closed-end and revolving/open-end consumer loans originated through CCBX lending partners will continue to accrue interest until 120 and 180 days past due, respectively and are reported as substandard, 90 days or more days past due and still accruing. There were no repossessed assets or other real estate owned at September 30, 2024. Our nonperforming loans to loans receivable ratio was 1.60% at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.60% at June 30, 2024, and 1.47% at September 30, 2023.\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were $395,000 community bank net charge-offs and $1.1 million nonperforming community bank loans. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024 $48.8 million in net charge-offs were recorded on CCBX loans. These CCBX loans have a higher level of expected losses than our community bank loans, which is reflected in the factors for the allowance for credit losses.\n\nThe following table details the Company’s nonperforming assets for the periods indicated.\n\n**Consolidated**| **As of**  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \n**Nonaccrual loans:**  \nCommercial and industrial loans| $| 198| $| —| $| 2  \nReal estate loans:  \nConstruction, land and land development| —| —| —  \nResidential real estate| 44| 213| 176  \nCommercial real estate| 831| 7,731| 7,145  \nConsumer and other loans:  \nCredit cards| 7,987| —| —  \nTotal nonaccrual loans| 9,060| 7,944| 7,323  \n**Accruing loans past due 90 days or more:**  \nCommercial & industrial loans| 1,593| 1,278| 1,387  \nReal estate loans:  \nResidential real estate loans| 3,025| 2,722| 1,462  \nConsumer and other loans:  \nCredit cards| 34,562| 36,465| 24,807  \nOther consumer and other loans| 6,412| 4,779| 8,561  \nTotal accruing loans past due 90 days or more| 45,592| 45,244| 36,217  \n**Total nonperforming loans**|  54,652| 53,188| 43,540  \n**Real estate owned**|  —| —| —  \n**Repossessed assets**|  —| —| —  \nTotal nonperforming assets| $| 54,652| $| 53,188| $| 43,540  \nTotal nonaccrual loans to loans receivable| 0.27| %| 0.24| %| 0.25| %  \nTotal nonperforming loans to loans receivable| 1.60| %| 1.60| %| 1.47| %  \nTotal nonperforming assets to total assets| 1.34| %| 1.34| %| 1.18| %  \n  \nThe following tables detail the CCBX and community bank nonperforming assets which are included in the total nonperforming assets table above.\n\n**CCBX**| **As of**  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \n**Nonaccrual loans:**  \nConsumer and other loans:  \nCredit cards| $| 7,987| $| —| $| —  \nTotal nonaccrual loans| 7,987| —| —  \n**Accruing loans past due 90 days or more:**  \nCommercial & industrial loans| 1,593| 1,278| 1,387  \nReal estate loans:  \nResidential real estate loans| 3,025| 2,722| 1,462  \nConsumer and other loans:  \nCredit cards| 34,562| 36,465| 24,807  \nOther consumer and other loans| 6,412| 4,779| 8,561  \nTotal accruing loans past due 90 days or more| 45,592| 45,244| 36,217  \nTotal nonperforming loans| 53,579| 45,244| 36,217  \n**Other real estate owned**|  —| —| —  \n**Repossessed assets**|  —| —| —  \nTotal nonperforming assets| $| 53,579| $| 45,244| $| 36,217  \nTotal CCBX nonperforming assets to total consolidated assets| 1.32| %| 1.14| %| 0.98| %  \n**Community Bank**| **As of**  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \n**Nonaccrual loans:**  \nCommercial and industrial loans| $| 198| $| —| $| 2  \nReal estate:  \nConstruction, land and land development| —| —| —  \nResidential real estate| 44| 213| 176  \nCommercial real estate| 831| 7,731| 7,145  \nTotal nonaccrual loans| 1,073| 7,944| 7,323  \n**Accruing loans past due 90 days or more:**  \nTotal accruing loans past due 90 days or more| —| —| —  \nTotal nonperforming loans| 1,073| 7,944| 7,323  \n**Other real estate owned**|  —| —| —  \n**Repossessed assets**|  —| —| —  \nTotal nonperforming assets| $| 1,073| $| 7,944| $| 7,323  \nTotal community bank nonperforming assets to total consolidated assets| 0.03| %| 0.20| %| 0.20| %  \n  \n**About Coastal Financial**\n\nCoastal Financial Corporation (Nasdaq: CCB) (the “Company”), is an Everett, Washington based bank holding company whose wholly owned subsidiaries are Coastal Community Bank (“Bank”) and Arlington Olympic LLC.

As other companies may use different calculations for these adjusted measures, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled adjusted measures reported by other companies.\n\nThe following non-GAAP measures are presented to illustrate the impact of BaaS loan expense on net loan income and yield on CCBX loans and the impact of BaaS loan expense on net interest income and net interest margin.\n\nNet BaaS loan income divided by average CCBX loans is a non-GAAP measure that includes the impact BaaS loan expense on net BaaS loan income and the yield on CCBX loans. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is yield on CCBX loans.\n\nNet interest income net of BaaS loan expense is a non-GAAP measure that includes the impact BaaS loan expense on net interest income. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net interest income.\n\nNet interest margin, net of BaaS loan expense is a non-GAAP measure that includes the impact of BaaS loan expense on net interest rate margin. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net interest margin.\n\nReconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP measures are presented below.\n\n**As of and for the Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**(dollars in thousands; unaudited)**| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \n**Net BaaS loan income divided by average CCBX loans:**  \nCCBX loan yield (GAAP)(1)| 17.35| %| 17.77| %| 17.05| %  \nTotal average CCBX loans receivable| $| 1,552,443| $| 1,362,343| $| 1,309,380  \nInterest and earned fee income on CCBX loans (GAAP)| 67,692| 60,203| 56,279  \nBaaS loan expense| (32,612| )| (29,076| )| (23,003| )  \nNet BaaS loan income| $| 35,080| $| 31,127| $| 33,276  \nNet BaaS loan income divided by average CCBX loans (1)| 8.99| %| 9.19| %| 10.08| %  \n**Net interest margin, net of BaaS loan expense:**  \nCCBX interest margin (1)| 9.64| %| 9.05| %| 9.66| %  \nCCBX earning assets| 2,048,918| 1,972,989| 1,684,012  \nNet interest income| 49,637| 44,383| 40,990  \nLess: BaaS loan expense| (32,612| )| (29,076| )| (23,003| )  \nNet interest income, net of BaaS loan expense| $| 17,025| $| 15,307| $| 17,987  \nCCBX net interest margin, net of BaaS loan expense (1)| 3.31| %| 3.12| %| 4.24| %  \n  \n(1) Annualized calculations for periods presented.\n\n**APPENDIX A -****As of****September 30, 2024**\n\nIndustry Concentration\n\nWe have a diversified loan portfolio, representing a wide variety of industries.

Agreements with our CCBX partners provide for a credit enhancement provided by the partner which protects the Bank by indemnifying or reimbursing incurred losses. In accordance with accounting guidance, we estimate and record a provision for expected losses for these CCBX loans, unfunded commitments and negative deposit accounts. When the provision for credit losses - loans and provision for unfunded commitments is recorded, a credit enhancement asset is also recorded on the balance sheet through noninterest income (BaaS credit enhancements) in recognition of the CCBX partner legal commitment to indemnify or reimburse losses. The credit enhancement asset is relieved as credit enhancement payments and recoveries are received from the CCBX partner or taken from the partner's cash reserve account. Agreements with our CCBX partners also provide protection to the Bank from fraud by indemnifying or reimbursing incurred fraud losses. BaaS fraud includes noncredit fraud losses on loans and deposits originated through partners. Fraud losses are recorded when incurred as losses in noninterest expense, and the enhancement received from the CCBX partner is recorded in noninterest income, resulting in a net impact of zero to the income statement. Many CCBX partners also pledge a cash reserve account at the Bank which the Bank can collect from when losses occur that is then replenished by the partner on a regular interval. Although agreements with our CCBX partners provide for credit enhancements that provide protection to the Bank from credit and fraud losses by indemnifying or reimbursing incurred credit and fraud losses, if our partner is unable to fulfill their contracted obligation then the bank would be exposed to additional loan and deposit losses if the cash flows on the loans were not sufficient to fund the reimbursement of loan losses, as a result of this counterparty risk. If a CCBX partner does not replenish their cash reserve account the Bank may consider an alternative plan for funding the cash reserve. This may involve the possibility of adjusting the funding amounts or timelines to better align with the partner's specific situation. If a mutually agreeable funding plan is not agreed to, the Bank could declare the agreement in default, take over servicing and cease paying the partner for servicing the loan and providing credit enhancements. The Bank would evaluate any remaining credit enhancement asset from the CCBX partner in the event the partner failed to determine if a write-off is appropriate. If a write-off occurs, the Bank would retain the full yield and any fee income on the loan portfolio going forward, and our BaaS loan expense would decrease once default occurred and payments to the CCBX partner were stopped.\n\nThe Bank records contractual interest earned from the borrower on CCBX partner loans in interest income, adjusted for origination costs which are paid or payable to the CCBX partner. BaaS loan expense represents the amount paid or payable to partners for credit and fraud enhancements and originating & servicing CCBX loans. To determine net revenue (Net BaaS loan income) earned from CCBX loan relationships, the Bank takes BaaS loan interest income and deducts BaaS loan expense to arrive at Net BaaS loan income (_A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures are set forth in the preceding section of this earnings release.)_ which can be compared to interest income on the Company’s community bank loans.\n\nThe following table illustrates how CCBX partner loan income and expenses are recorded in the financial statements:\n\n**Loan income and related loan expense**| **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \nYield on loans (1)| 17.35| %| 17.77| %| 17.05| %  \nBaaS loan interest income| $| 67,692| $| 60,203| $| 56,279  \nLess: BaaS loan expense| 32,612| 29,076| 23,003  \nNet BaaS loan income (2)| $| 35,080| $| 31,127| $| 33,276  \nNet BaaS loan income divided by average BaaS loans (1)(2)| 8.99| %| 9.19| %| 10.08| %  \n  \n(1) Annualized calculation for quarterly periods shown.(2) A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures are set forth in the preceding section of this earnings release.\n\nAn increase in average CCBX loans receivable resulted in increased interest income on CCBX loans during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The increase in average CCBX loans receivable was primarily due to growth in the CCBX loan portfolio as part of our strategy to optimize the CCBX loan portfolio and strengthen our balance sheet through originating higher quality new loans and enhanced credit standards. Increased interest rates and growth in CCBX loans and deposits has resulted in increases in interest income and expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe following tables are a summary of the interest components, direct fees, and expenses of BaaS for the periods indicated and are not inclusive of all income and expense related to BaaS.\n\n**Interest income**| **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \nLoan interest income| $| 67,692| $| 60,203| $| 56,279  \nTotal BaaS interest income| $| 67,692| $| 60,203| $| 56,279  \n**Interest expense**| **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \nBaaS interest expense| $| 24,819| $| 24,119| $| 20,384  \nTotal BaaS interest expense| $| 24,819| $| 24,119| $| 20,384  \n**BaaS income**| **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \n**BaaS program income:**  \nServicing and other BaaS fees| $| 1,044| $| 1,525| $| 997  \nTransaction fees| 1,696| 1,309| 1,036  \nInterchange fees| 1,853| 1,625| 1,216  \nReimbursement of expenses| 1,843| 1,637| 1,152  \nBaaS program income| 6,436| 6,096| 4,401  \n**BaaS indemnification income:**  \nBaaS credit enhancements| 70,108| 60,826| 25,926  \nBaaS fraud enhancements| 2,084| 1,784| 2,850  \nBaaS indemnification income| 72,192| 62,610| 28,776  \nTotal noninterest BaaS income| $| 78,628| $| 68,706| $| 33,177  \n  \nServicing and other BaaS fees decreased $481,000 in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024 while transaction fees and interchange fees increased $387,000 and $228,000, respectively.

In connection with the reorganization of the role of the President, the Bank also announced that Curt Queyrouze, the President of the Company and the Bank, will serve as President of the community bank division and will be responsible for leading the community bank and corporate credit.\n\n“As Coastal focuses on growing CCBX, we continuously seek out individuals with the skillsets and experience that we believe will bolster our banking-as-a-service division and who complement the leadership team already in place,” said Eric Sprink, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. “We were fortunate to add Brian to our Board of Directors earlier this year and since then, he has been an invaluable contributor to the Company and the Bank. Brian’s appointment to this new role will allow the Company to benefit more deeply from his background and extensive expertise in banking, lending, payments and digital products development,” Mr. Sprink added.\n\n“Outside of CCBX, Coastal has been a fixture of community banking in the Puget Sound region for decades. We are excited to be able to bring that local, customer-first, community banking perspective and experience to new customers by evolving the community banking division to incorporate additional digital access for customers,” said Mr. Sprink. “Curt’s leadership, experience, and foresight have been key to Coastal’s success since he was appointed as President, and we are excited for him to build Coastal’s community bank division.”\n\nMr. Hamilton is a seasoned financial technology executive and business leader, with more than 25 years of experience in banking, lending, payments and digital product development. Mr. Hamilton has held senior leadership roles at Capital One, serving as President of their Merchant Services division, Wells Fargo and Verifone, in addition to founding and operating multiple companies in the fintech space. Most recently Mr. Hamilton was co-founder and CEO of ONE (One Finance Inc.), which was acquired by a Walmart led joint venture in 2022. Prior to co-founding ONE, he was the founder of Azlo, a digital bank for small businesses, and helped to build out the BBVA Open Platform for sponsor banking services.\n\n“I am thrilled to deepen my relationship with the Coastal team in my new role leading the CCBX business. I have been lucky enough to work with many in management and across the Company and the Bank since joining the Board of Directors. I am excited to be able to take the experiences I gained and serve the Company and the Bank both as a member of management and as a director,” said Mr. Hamilton.\n\n**About Coastal Financial Corporation**\n\nCoastal Financial Corporation (NASDAQ: CCB), is an Everett, Washington-based Bank holding company with Coastal Community Bank (the “Bank”) a full-service commercial bank, as its sole wholly-owned banking subsidiary.

We are implementing strategies to increase fee income and we continue to build out and invest in an infrastructure that is scalable, and that we believe will enable us to be innovative leaders in financial services.”\n\n**Key Points for Third Quarter and Our Go-Forward Strategy**\n\n  * **Balance Sheet Well Positioned for Lower Rates.** Our balance sheet stands in a modestly liability sensitive position as of September 30, 2024, with $1.95 billion of CCBX deposits that contractually reprice lower immediately upon any reduction in the Federal Funds Rate, with $1.09 billion of CCBX loans repricing in 90 days or less following such reduction. The Federal Open Market Committee recently lowered the targeted Federal Funds rate 0.50% on September 19, 2024; a reduction of 0.50% compared to June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The rate decrease came late in the quarter, so the full impact of this and any subsequent rate changes will be reflected in future periods. \n  * **Expanding Relationships with CCBX Partners.** We continue to focus on expanding product offerings with existing CCBX partners. We believe that launching new products with existing partners positions us to reach a wide and established customer base with modest increase in enterprise risk. Products launched in 2024 with existing partners have gained traction and are growing the balance sheet and increasing income. The pipeline for CCBX is active, although we expect to remain selective in adding new partners to manage risk and capital.\n  * **On-going Loan Sales.** We sold $423.7 million loans in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as part of our strategy to balance credit risk, manage partner and lending limits, protect capital levels and move credit card balances to an off balance sheet fee generating model. We are retaining a portion of the fee income for our role in processing transactions on sold credit card balances. This provides an on-going and passive revenue stream with no on balance sheet risk.\n  * **Continued Regulatory and Compliance Infrastructure Investments Position Us Well for Next Phase of Growth.** We continue to utilize co-sourced personnel as a component of our risk and compliance efforts. This flexible co-sourcing approach allows us to manage the growth of our internal team while also ensuring CCBX has the resources it needs. While we remain 100% indemnified against partner fraud losses, we were encouraged to see fraudulent activity amongst our partners remains low during the current quarter, compared to the same period last year, a positive indicator of our continued investments in our risk infrastructure.\n  * **Reorganization and Strengthening of Talent to Accommodate Growth and Plans for the Future.** We recently announced the bifurcation of the President of the Bank into two roles, appointing Brian Hamilton as President of CCBX, the Fintech and BaaS segment of the Bank, with Curt Queyrouze serving as President of the community bank and corporate credit.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\nThe tables below outline some of our key operating metrics.\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data;

(3) We calculate book value per share as total shareholders’ equity at the end of the relevant period divided by the outstanding number of our common shares at the end of each period.(4) Tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate tangible book value per share as total shareholders’ equity at the end of the relevant period, less goodwill and other intangible assets, divided by the outstanding number of our common shares at the end of each period. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is book value per share. We had no goodwill or other intangible assets as of any of the dates indicated. As a result, tangible book value per share is the same as book value per share as of each of the dates indicated. (5) Nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans include loans 90+ days past due and accruing interest. (6) Annualized calculations.\n\n**Key Performance Ratios**\n\nReturn on average assets (\"ROA\") was 1.34% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.21% and 1.13% for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. ROA for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, increased 0.13% and 0.21% compared to June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Noninterest expenses were higher for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 largely due to an increase in BaaS loan expense, which is directly related to the increase in the amount of interest earned on CCBX loans.\n\nThe following table shows the Company’s key performance ratios for the periods indicated. \n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n(unaudited)| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **March 31,****2024**| **December 31,****2023**| **September 30,****2023**  \nReturn on average assets (1)| 1.34| %| 1.21| %| 0.73| %| 0.97| %| 1.13| %  \nReturn on average equity (1)| 16.67| %| 15.22| %| 9.21| %| 12.35| %| 14.60| %  \nYield on earnings assets (1)| 10.79| %| 10.49| %| 10.07| %| 9.77| %| 10.08| %  \nYield on loans receivable (1)| 11.43| %| 11.23| %| 10.85| %| 10.71| %| 10.84| %  \nCost of funds (1)| 3.62| %| 3.60| %| 3.52| %| 3.39| %| 3.18| %  \nCost of deposits (1)| 3.59| %| 3.58| %| 3.49| %| 3.36| %| 3.14| %  \nNet interest margin (1)| 7.41| %| 7.13| %| 6.78| %| 6.61| %| 7.10| %  \nNoninterest expense to average assets (1)| 6.54| %| 6.14| %| 6.04| %| 5.56| %| 6.23| %  \nNoninterest income to average assets (1)| 7.98| %| 7.30| %| 9.38| %| 6.95| %| 3.81| %  \nEfficiency ratio| 43.10| %| 43.19| %| 37.88| %| 41.58| %| 58.36| %  \nLoans receivable to deposits (2)| 94.46| %| 93.88| %| 92.42| %| 90.05| %| 90.19| %  \n  \n(1) Annualized calculations shown for quarterly periods presented.(2) Includes loans held for sale.\n\n**Management Outlook; CEO Eric Sprink**\n\n“As we look ahead to the fourth quarter and 2025, we remain laser focused on building out our technology and risk management infrastructure to more efficiently support our next phase of growth within CCBX. While the balance sheet re-mix earlier this year resulted in a short-term reduction to income, we continue to make strategic decisions which are enhancing credit quality, generating passive fee income, strengthening our talent and growing relationships with established and prospective CCBX partners all of which are expected to position Coastal to be more profitable in 2025.”\n\n**Coastal Financial Corporation Overview**\n\nThe Company has one main subsidiary, the Bank which consists of three segments: CCBX, the community bank and treasury & administration. The CCBX segment includes all of our BaaS activities, the community bank segment includes all community banking activities, and the treasury & administration segment includes treasury management, overall administration and all other aspects of the Company. \n\n**CCBX Performance Update**\n\nOur CCBX segment continues to evolve, and we have 22 relationships, at varying stages, as of September 30, 2024. We continue to refine the criteria for CCBX partnerships, are exiting relationships where it makes sense for us to do so and are focusing on larger more established partners, with experienced management teams, existing customer bases and strong financial positions.\n\nWe are expanding product offerings with our existing CCBX partners. We believe that launching new products with existing partners positions us to reach a wide and established customer base with a modest increase in regulatory risk given we have already vetted these partners and have operational history. Products launched earlier in the year with existing partners have gained traction and are growing the balance sheet and increasing income. We continue to sell loans as part of our strategy to balance partner and lending limits, and manage the loan portfolio and credit quality. We retain a portion of the fee income for our role in processing transactions on sold credit card balances. This is expected to provide an on-going and passive revenue stream with no on balance sheet risk.\n\nThe following table illustrates the activity and evolution in CCBX relationships for the periods presented.\n\n**As of**  \n---  \n(unaudited)| **September 30, 2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \nActive| 19| 19| 18  \nFriends and family / testing| 1| 1| 1  \nImplementation / onboarding| 1| 1| 1  \nSigned letters of intent| 1| 0| 1  \nWind down - active but preparing to exit relationship| 0| 0| 1  \nTotal CCBX relationships| 22| 21| 22  \n  \nCCBX loans increased $106.9 million, or 7.6%, despite selling $423.7 million loans during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to $1.52 billion, while we continued to enhance credit standards on new CCBX loan originations. In accordance with the program agreement for one partner, effective April 1, 2024, the portion of the CCBX portfolio that we are responsible for losses on decreased from 10% to 5%.

This is the second consecutive quarter of growth after allowing higher rate balances to run-off earlier in the year. The community bank segment includes noninterest bearing deposits of $518.8 million, or 34.1%, of total community bank deposits, resulting in a cost of deposits of 1.92%, which compared to 1.77% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Margin Discussion**\n\nNet interest income was $72.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $5.9 million, or 9.0%, from $66.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and an increase of $10.0 million, or 16.0%, from $62.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest income compared to June 30, 2024, was a result of increased interest income due to an increase in average loans receivable partially offset by an increase in cost of funds. The increase in net interest income compared to September 30, 2023 was largely related to increased yield on loans resulting from higher interest rates and growth in higher yielding loans partially offset by an increase in cost of funds relating to higher interest rates and growth in interest bearing deposits. \n\nNet interest margin was 7.41% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.13% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, with the increase primarily due to higher loan yields. Net interest margin was 7.10% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was largely due to an increase in loan yield partially offset by higher interest rates on interest bearing deposits. Interest and fees on loans receivable increased $8.6 million, or 9.5%, to $99.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $90.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and increased $15.9 million, or 19.1%, compared to $83.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to an increase in outstanding balances and higher interest rates. \n\nAverage investment securities decreased $795,000 to $49.0 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 and decreased $69.0 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of maturing securities.\n\nCost of funds was 3.62% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2 basis points from the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and an increase of 44 basis points from the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Cost of deposits for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 3.59%, compared to 3.58% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and 3.14% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increased cost of funds and deposits compared to June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was due to the continued high interest rate environment. The late September reduction in the Fed funds rate is expected to help to lower our cost of deposits in future periods.\n\nThe following table summarizes the average yield on loans receivable and cost of deposits:\n\n**For the Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \n**Yield on****Loans****(2)**| **Cost of****Deposits****(2)**| **Yield on****Loans****(2)**| **Cost of****Deposits****(2)**| **Yield on****Loans****(2)**| **Cost of****Deposits****(2)**  \nCommunity Bank| 6.64| %| 1.92| %| 6.52| %| 1.77| %| 6.20| %| 1.31| %  \nCCBX (1)| 17.35| %| 4.82| %| 17.77| %| 4.92| %| 17.05| %| 4.80| %  \nConsolidated| 11.43| %| 3.59| %| 11.23| %| 3.58| %| 10.84| %| 3.14| %  \n  \n(1) CCBX yield on loans does not include the impact of BaaS loan expense. BaaS loan expense represents the amount paid or payable to partners for credit and fraud enhancements and originating & servicing CCBX loans. To determine Net BaaS loan income earned from CCBX loan relationships, the Company takes BaaS loan interest income and deducts BaaS loan expense to arrive at Net BaaS loan income which can be compared to interest income on the Company’s community bank loans. See reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures at the end of this earnings release for the impact of BaaS loan expense on CCBX loan yield.(2) Annualized calculations for periods shown.\n\nThe following tables illustrates how BaaS loan interest income is affected by BaaS loan expense resulting in net BaaS loan income and the associated yield:\n\n**For the Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \n(dollars in thousands, unaudited)| **Income / Expense**| **Income / expense divided by average CCBX loans****(2)**| **Income / Expense**| **Income / expense divided by****average CCBX loans****(2)**| **Income / Expense**| **Income / expense divided by average CCBX loans****(2)**  \nBaaS loan interest income| $| 67,692| 17.35| %| $| 60,203| 17.77| %| $| 56,279| 17.05| %  \nLess: BaaS loan expense| 32,612| 8.36| %| 29,076| 8.58| %| 23,003| 6.97| %  \nNet BaaS loan income (1)| $| 35,080| 8.99| %| $| 31,127| 9.19| %| $| 33,276| 10.08| %  \nAverage BaaS Loans(3)| $| 1,552,443| $| 1,362,343| $| 1,309,380  \n  \n(1) A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures are set forth at the end of this earnings release.(2) Annualized calculations shown for quarterly periods presented.(3) Includes loans held for sale.\n\n**Noninterest Income Discussion**\n\nNoninterest income was $80.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $10.2 million from $69.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and an increase of $45.5 million from $34.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in noninterest income over the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase of $9.9 million in total BaaS income. The $9.9 million increase in total BaaS income included a $9.3 million increase in BaaS credit enhancements related to the provision for credit losses, a $300,000 increase in BaaS fraud enhancements, and an increase of $340,000 in BaaS program income. The increase in BaaS program income is largely due to higher servicing and other BaaS fees, transaction fees and interchange fees and our primary BaaS source for recurring fee income (see “Appendix B” for more information on the accounting for BaaS allowance for credit losses and credit and fraud enhancements). Additionally, other income increased $229,000 largely due to increased incoming ACH activity.\n\nThe $45.5 million increase in noninterest income over the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a $43.4 million increase in BaaS credit and fraud enhancements, and an increase of $2.0 million in BaaS program income.\n\n**Noninterest Expense Discussion** Total noninterest expense increased $6.8 million to $65.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $58.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and increased $9.1 million from $56.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in noninterest expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024, was primarily due to a $3.8 million increase in BaaS expense (including a $300,000 increase in BaaS fraud expense and a $3.5 million increase in BaaS loan expense). BaaS loan expense represents the amount paid or payable to partners for credit enhancements, fraud enhancements, and originating & servicing CCBX loans. BaaS fraud expense represents non-credit fraud losses on partner’s customer loan and deposit accounts. A portion of this expense is realized during the quarter in which the loss occurs, and a portion is estimated based on historical or other information from our partners, partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in excise taxes (due to the recording of $1.2 million business and occupation tax credit from the State of Washington which resulted in the recognition of a net credit of $706,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to expense of $762,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024). We also recorded an increase of $587,000 in data processing and software licenses as a result of our continued investment in our infrastructure and the automation of our processes so that they are scalable and an increase of $499,000 in point of sale expenses as a result of increased partner transaction activity.\n\nThe increase in noninterest expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was largely due to an increase of $8.8 million in BaaS partner expense (including a $9.6 million increase in BaaS loan expense partially offset by a decrease of $766,000 in BaaS fraud expense), a $1.1 million increase in data processing and software licenses due to enhancements in technology, and a $526,000 increase in occupancy expense, largely due to higher software depreciation/amortization expense, partially offset by a $986,000 decrease in salary and employee benefits largely as a result of some one-time costs that were expensed in the quarter ended September 30, 2023 for which there was no similar expense in the current quarter, and an $850,000 decrease in legal and professional expenses as a result of risk management and projects being completed.\n\n**Provision for Income Taxes**\n\nThe provision for income taxes was $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, $3.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $2.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. The income tax provision was lower for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024 as a result of the deductibility of certain equity awards which reduced tax expense despite net income being higher and higher than the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher net income compared to that quarter.\n\nThe Company is subject to various state taxes that are assessed as CCBX activities and employees expand into other states, which has increased the overall tax rate used in calculating the provision for income taxes in the current and future periods. The Company uses a federal statutory tax rate of 21.0% as a basis for calculating provision for federal income taxes and 2.62% for calculating the provision for state income taxes.\n\n**Financial Condition Overview**\n\nTotal assets increased $104.3 million, or 2.6%, to $4.07 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to $3.96 billion at June 30, 2024. The increase is primarily due to stronger loan growth partially offset by lower cash balances. Total loans receivable increased $92.4 million to $3.42 billion at September 30, 2024, from $3.33 billion at June 30, 2024.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had the capacity to borrow up to a total of $656.3 million from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and Federal Home Loan Bank, and an additional $50.0 million from a correspondent bank no borrowings outstanding on these lines as of September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company had a cash balance of $5.9 million as of September 30, 2024, which is retained for general operating purposes, including debt repayment, and for funding $530,000 in commitments to bank technology funds. \n\nUninsured deposits were $542.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $532.9 million as of June 30, 2024.\n\nTotal shareholders’ equity increased $15.2 million since June 30, 2024. The increase in shareholders’ equity was primarily due to $13.5 million in net earnings, combined with an increase of $1.8 million in common stock outstanding as a result of equity awards exercised during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company and the Bank remained well capitalized at September 30, 2024, as summarized in the following table.\n\n(unaudited)| **Coastal Community Bank**| **Coastal Financial Corporation**| **Minimum Well Capitalized Ratios under Prompt Corrective Action****(1)**  \n---|---|---|---  \nTier 1 Leverage Capital (to average assets)| 9.29| %| 8.40| %| 5.00| %  \nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital (to risk-weighted assets)| 10.36| %| 9.26| %| 6.50| %  \nTier 1 Capital (to risk-weighted assets)| 10.36| %| 9.35| %| 8.00| %  \nTotal Capital (to risk-weighted assets)| 11.65| %| 11.90| %| 10.00| %  \n  \n(1) Presents the minimum capital ratios for an insured depository institution, such as the Bank, to be considered well capitalized under the Prompt Corrective Action framework. The minimum requirements for the Company to be considered well capitalized under Regulation Y include to maintain, on a consolidated basis, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 percent or greater and a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 percent or greater.\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nThe total allowance for credit losses was $170.3 million and 4.98% of loans receivable at September 30, 2024 compared to $147.9 million and 4.45% at June 30, 2024 and $101.1 million and 3.41% at September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit loss allocated to the CCBX portfolio was $150.1 million and 9.87% of CCBX loans receivable at September 30, 2024, with $20.1 million of allowance for credit loss allocated to the community bank or 1.06% of total community bank loans receivable.\n\nThe following table details the allocation of the allowance for credit loss as of the period indicated:\n\n**As of September 30, 2024**| **As of June 30, 2024**| **As of September 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **Community Bank**| **CCBX**| **Total**| **Community Bank**| **CCBX**| **Total**| **Community Bank**| **CCBX**| **Total**  \nLoans receivable| $| 1,897,540| $| 1,521,292| $| 3,418,832| $| 1,912,034| $| 1,414,426| $| 3,326,460| $| 1,784,661| $| 1,182,374| $| 2,967,035  \nAllowance for credit losses| (20,132| )| (150,131| )| (170,263| )| (21,045| )| (126,869| )| (147,914| )| (21,316| )| (79,769| )| (101,085| )  \nAllowance for credit losses to total loans receivable| 1.06| %| 9.87| %| 4.98| %| 1.10| %| 8.97| %| 4.45| %| 1.19| %| 6.75| %| 3.41| %  \n  \nNet charge-offs totaled $49.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $53.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and $36.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans decreased to 5.65% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.57% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which we believe is a result of the steps we took manage our credit quality. CCBX partner agreements provide for a credit enhancement that covers the net-charge-offs on CCBX loans and negative deposit accounts by indemnifying or reimbursing incurred losses, except in accordance with the program agreement for one partner where the Company was responsible for credit losses on approximately 5% of a $400.8 million loan portfolio. At September 30, 2024, our portion of this portfolio represented $19.8 million in loans. Net charge-offs for this $19.8 million in loans were $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $579,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe following table details net charge-offs for the community bank and CCBX for the period indicated:\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **Community Bank**| **CCBX**| **Total**| **Community Bank**| **CCBX**| **Total**| **Community Bank**| **CCBX**| **Total**  \nGross charge-offs| $| 398| $| 52,907| $| 53,305| $| 2| $| 55,205| $| 55,207| $| 3| $| 37,876| $| 37,879  \nGross recoveries| (3| )| (4,066| )| (4,069| )| (4| )| (1,969| )| (1,973| )| (3| )| (1,042| )| (1,045| )  \nNet charge-offs| $| 395| $| 48,841| $| 49,236| $| (2| )| $| 53,236| $| 53,234| $| —| $| 36,834| $| 36,834  \nNet charge-offs to average loans (1)| 0.08| %| 12.52| %| 5.65| %| 0.00| %| 15.72| %| 6.57| %| 0.00| %| 11.16| %| 4.77| %  \n  \n(1) Annualized calculations shown for periods presented.\n\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a $72.1 million provision for credit losses - loans was recorded for CCBX partner loans based on management’s analysis, compared to the $62.2 million provision for credit losses - loans that was recorded for CCBX for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. CCBX loans have a higher level of expected losses than our community bank loans, which is reflected in the factors for the allowance for credit losses. Agreements with our CCBX partners provide for a credit enhancement which protects the Bank by indemnifying or reimbursing incurred losses.\n\nIn accordance with accounting guidance, we estimate and record a provision for expected losses for these CCBX loans and reclassified negative deposit accounts. When the provision for CCBX credit losses and provision for unfunded commitments is recorded, a credit enhancement asset is also recorded on the balance sheet through noninterest income (BaaS credit enhancements). Expected losses are recorded in the allowance for credit losses. The credit enhancement asset is relieved when credit enhancement recoveries are received from the CCBX partner. If our partner is unable to fulfill their contracted obligations then the Bank could be exposed to additional credit losses. Management regularly evaluates and manages this counterparty risk.\n\nThe factors used in management’s analysis for community bank credit losses indicated that a provision recapture of $519,000 and was needed for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to a provision recapture of $341,000 and provision of $664,000 for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The recapture in the current period was largely due to a change in remaining average lives of community bank loans.\n\nThe following table details the provision expense/(recapture) for the community bank and CCBX for the period indicated:\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \nCommunity bank| $| (519| )| $| (341| )| $| 664  \nCCBX| 72,104| 62,231| 26,493  \nTotal provision expense| $| 71,585| $| 61,890| $| 27,157  \n  \nAt September 30, 2024, our nonperforming assets were $54.7 million, or 1.34%, of total assets, compared to $53.2 million, or 1.34%, of total assets, at June 30, 2024, and $43.5 million, or 1.18%, of total assets, at September 30, 2023. These ratios are impacted by nonperforming CCBX loans that are covered by CCBX partner credit enhancements. As of September 30, 2024, $52.0 million of the $53.6 million in nonperforming CCBX loans were covered by CCBX partner credit enhancements described above.\n\nNonperforming assets increased $1.5 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024. This change is largely due to an increase in CCBX nonaccrual loans partially offset by a decrease in community bank nonaccrual loans. CCBX nonaccrual loans increased $8.0 million as a result of a new collection practice that places certain loans on nonaccrual status to improve collectability, $5.3 million of these loans are less than 90 days past due as of September 30, 2024. CCBX loans that are past due 90 days or more and still accruing was $45.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to $45.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. As a result of the type of loans (primarily consumer loans) originated through our CCBX partners we anticipate that balances 90 days past due or more and still accruing will generally increase as those loan portfolios grow. Installment/closed-end and revolving/open-end consumer loans originated through CCBX lending partners will continue to accrue interest until 120 and 180 days past due, respectively and are reported as substandard, 90 days or more days past due and still accruing. There were no repossessed assets or other real estate owned at September 30, 2024. Our nonperforming loans to loans receivable ratio was 1.60% at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.60% at June 30, 2024, and 1.47% at September 30, 2023.\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were $395,000 community bank net charge-offs and $1.1 million nonperforming community bank loans. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024 $48.8 million in net charge-offs were recorded on CCBX loans. These CCBX loans have a higher level of expected losses than our community bank loans, which is reflected in the factors for the allowance for credit losses.\n\nThe following table details the Company’s nonperforming assets for the periods indicated.\n\n**Consolidated**| **As of**  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \n**Nonaccrual loans:**  \nCommercial and industrial loans| $| 198| $| —| $| 2  \nReal estate loans:  \nConstruction, land and land development| —| —| —  \nResidential real estate| 44| 213| 176  \nCommercial real estate| 831| 7,731| 7,145  \nConsumer and other loans:  \nCredit cards| 7,987| —| —  \nTotal nonaccrual loans| 9,060| 7,944| 7,323  \n**Accruing loans past due 90 days or more:**  \nCommercial & industrial loans| 1,593| 1,278| 1,387  \nReal estate loans:  \nResidential real estate loans| 3,025| 2,722| 1,462  \nConsumer and other loans:  \nCredit cards| 34,562| 36,465| 24,807  \nOther consumer and other loans| 6,412| 4,779| 8,561  \nTotal accruing loans past due 90 days or more| 45,592| 45,244| 36,217  \n**Total nonperforming loans**|  54,652| 53,188| 43,540  \n**Real estate owned**|  —| —| —  \n**Repossessed assets**|  —| —| —  \nTotal nonperforming assets| $| 54,652| $| 53,188| $| 43,540  \nTotal nonaccrual loans to loans receivable| 0.27| %| 0.24| %| 0.25| %  \nTotal nonperforming loans to loans receivable| 1.60| %| 1.60| %| 1.47| %  \nTotal nonperforming assets to total assets| 1.34| %| 1.34| %| 1.18| %  \n  \nThe following tables detail the CCBX and community bank nonperforming assets which are included in the total nonperforming assets table above.\n\n**CCBX**| **As of**  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \n**Nonaccrual loans:**  \nConsumer and other loans:  \nCredit cards| $| 7,987| $| —| $| —  \nTotal nonaccrual loans| 7,987| —| —  \n**Accruing loans past due 90 days or more:**  \nCommercial & industrial loans| 1,593| 1,278| 1,387  \nReal estate loans:  \nResidential real estate loans| 3,025| 2,722| 1,462  \nConsumer and other loans:  \nCredit cards| 34,562| 36,465| 24,807  \nOther consumer and other loans| 6,412| 4,779| 8,561  \nTotal accruing loans past due 90 days or more| 45,592| 45,244| 36,217  \nTotal nonperforming loans| 53,579| 45,244| 36,217  \n**Other real estate owned**|  —| —| —  \n**Repossessed assets**|  —| —| —  \nTotal nonperforming assets| $| 53,579| $| 45,244| $| 36,217  \nTotal CCBX nonperforming assets to total consolidated assets| 1.32| %| 1.14| %| 0.98| %  \n**Community Bank**| **As of**  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \n**Nonaccrual loans:**  \nCommercial and industrial loans| $| 198| $| —| $| 2  \nReal estate:  \nConstruction, land and land development| —| —| —  \nResidential real estate| 44| 213| 176  \nCommercial real estate| 831| 7,731| 7,145  \nTotal nonaccrual loans| 1,073| 7,944| 7,323  \n**Accruing loans past due 90 days or more:**  \nTotal accruing loans past due 90 days or more| —| —| —  \nTotal nonperforming loans| 1,073| 7,944| 7,323  \n**Other real estate owned**|  —| —| —  \n**Repossessed assets**|  —| —| —  \nTotal nonperforming assets| $| 1,073| $| 7,944| $| 7,323  \nTotal community bank nonperforming assets to total consolidated assets| 0.03| %| 0.20| %| 0.20| %  \n  \n**About Coastal Financial**\n\nCoastal Financial Corporation (Nasdaq: CCB) (the “Company”), is an Everett, Washington based bank holding company whose wholly owned subsidiaries are Coastal Community Bank (“Bank”) and Arlington Olympic LLC.

Agreements with our CCBX partners provide for a credit enhancement provided by the partner which protects the Bank by indemnifying or reimbursing incurred losses. In accordance with accounting guidance, we estimate and record a provision for expected losses for these CCBX loans, unfunded commitments and negative deposit accounts. When the provision for credit losses - loans and provision for unfunded commitments is recorded, a credit enhancement asset is also recorded on the balance sheet through noninterest income (BaaS credit enhancements) in recognition of the CCBX partner legal commitment to indemnify or reimburse losses. The credit enhancement asset is relieved as credit enhancement payments and recoveries are received from the CCBX partner or taken from the partner's cash reserve account. Agreements with our CCBX partners also provide protection to the Bank from fraud by indemnifying or reimbursing incurred fraud losses. BaaS fraud includes noncredit fraud losses on loans and deposits originated through partners. Fraud losses are recorded when incurred as losses in noninterest expense, and the enhancement received from the CCBX partner is recorded in noninterest income, resulting in a net impact of zero to the income statement. Many CCBX partners also pledge a cash reserve account at the Bank which the Bank can collect from when losses occur that is then replenished by the partner on a regular interval. Although agreements with our CCBX partners provide for credit enhancements that provide protection to the Bank from credit and fraud losses by indemnifying or reimbursing incurred credit and fraud losses, if our partner is unable to fulfill their contracted obligation then the bank would be exposed to additional loan and deposit losses if the cash flows on the loans were not sufficient to fund the reimbursement of loan losses, as a result of this counterparty risk. If a CCBX partner does not replenish their cash reserve account the Bank may consider an alternative plan for funding the cash reserve. This may involve the possibility of adjusting the funding amounts or timelines to better align with the partner's specific situation. If a mutually agreeable funding plan is not agreed to, the Bank could declare the agreement in default, take over servicing and cease paying the partner for servicing the loan and providing credit enhancements. The Bank would evaluate any remaining credit enhancement asset from the CCBX partner in the event the partner failed to determine if a write-off is appropriate. If a write-off occurs, the Bank would retain the full yield and any fee income on the loan portfolio going forward, and our BaaS loan expense would decrease once default occurred and payments to the CCBX partner were stopped.\n\nThe Bank records contractual interest earned from the borrower on CCBX partner loans in interest income, adjusted for origination costs which are paid or payable to the CCBX partner. BaaS loan expense represents the amount paid or payable to partners for credit and fraud enhancements and originating & servicing CCBX loans. To determine net revenue (Net BaaS loan income) earned from CCBX loan relationships, the Bank takes BaaS loan interest income and deducts BaaS loan expense to arrive at Net BaaS loan income (_A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures are set forth in the preceding section of this earnings release.)_ which can be compared to interest income on the Company’s community bank loans.\n\nThe following table illustrates how CCBX partner loan income and expenses are recorded in the financial statements:\n\n**Loan income and related loan expense**| **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \nYield on loans (1)| 17.35| %| 17.77| %| 17.05| %  \nBaaS loan interest income| $| 67,692| $| 60,203| $| 56,279  \nLess: BaaS loan expense| 32,612| 29,076| 23,003  \nNet BaaS loan income (2)| $| 35,080| $| 31,127| $| 33,276  \nNet BaaS loan income divided by average BaaS loans (1)(2)| 8.99| %| 9.19| %| 10.08| %  \n  \n(1) Annualized calculation for quarterly periods shown.(2) A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures are set forth in the preceding section of this earnings release.\n\nAn increase in average CCBX loans receivable resulted in increased interest income on CCBX loans during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The increase in average CCBX loans receivable was primarily due to growth in the CCBX loan portfolio as part of our strategy to optimize the CCBX loan portfolio and strengthen our balance sheet through originating higher quality new loans and enhanced credit standards. Increased interest rates and growth in CCBX loans and deposits has resulted in increases in interest income and expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe following tables are a summary of the interest components, direct fees, and expenses of BaaS for the periods indicated and are not inclusive of all income and expense related to BaaS.\n\n**Interest income**| **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \nLoan interest income| $| 67,692| $| 60,203| $| 56,279  \nTotal BaaS interest income| $| 67,692| $| 60,203| $| 56,279  \n**Interest expense**| **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \nBaaS interest expense| $| 24,819| $| 24,119| $| 20,384  \nTotal BaaS interest expense| $| 24,819| $| 24,119| $| 20,384  \n**BaaS income**| **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands; unaudited)| **September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \n**BaaS program income:**  \nServicing and other BaaS fees| $| 1,044| $| 1,525| $| 997  \nTransaction fees| 1,696| 1,309| 1,036  \nInterchange fees| 1,853| 1,625| 1,216  \nReimbursement of expenses| 1,843| 1,637| 1,152  \nBaaS program income| 6,436| 6,096| 4,401  \n**BaaS indemnification income:**  \nBaaS credit enhancements| 70,108| 60,826| 25,926  \nBaaS fraud enhancements| 2,084| 1,784| 2,850  \nBaaS indemnification income| 72,192| 62,610| 28,776  \nTotal noninterest BaaS income| $| 78,628| $| 68,706| $| 33,177  \n  \nServicing and other BaaS fees decreased $481,000 in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024 while transaction fees and interchange fees increased $387,000 and $228,000, respectively.
