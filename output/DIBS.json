This latest iteration continues an industry-leading program to seek feedback on design trends, including project types, sourcing, styles, motifs, and colors. These insights suggest the top trends for the coming year, as well as those losing appeal, and indicate year-over-year shifts. \n\n![Miami Beach Apartment by Charlap Hyman & Herrero \\(Image Credit: Chris Mottalini\\)](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20241112477735/en/2302077/4/Miami_Beach_Apartment.jpg)\n\nMiami Beach Apartment by Charlap Hyman & Herrero (Image Credit: Chris Mottalini)\n\n“Every year, our Designer Trends Survey allows us to not just identify the stylistic shifts and emerging trends that will shape the way we live in the coming months,” said Anthony Barzilay Freund, Editorial Director at 1stDibs, “but also to understand the forces dictating these trends—the “why’s”—as articulated by the talented interior designers around the world who participate.” \n\nHere’s what the interior designers had to say: \n\n**Part 1: What’s In**\n\n**Color Trends: Earthy and Rich Tones Dominate; Chocolate Brown Takes the Cake**\n\nWarm chocolate brown stakes its claim as designers’ top choice for the most popular color of 2025. The earthy hue was the top pick for 32% of those surveyed, almost doubling the percentage of designers who favored it in 2023 (17%). Although demand for this color is experiencing a significant spike, interest in dark red and burgundy has also increased, from 7% for 2024 to 20% for 2025. Meanwhile, light blues like Sky and Robin’s-egg have experienced a steady rise to 19% (up from 14% in 2023), indicating an ongoing penchant for soft, calming blues. Light green and sage may have peaked in the predictions for 2024 (26%), but these hues continue to be among the favorites in their color family for 2025 (19%), with emerald green sitting at the top (22%). These color trends reflect a desire for earthy and natural tones. \n\n**Design Styles by Decade**\n\nVintage furniture and decor are still in high demand, with 81% of designers sourcing products from the 1920s through the 1990s in 2024. Looking at predictions made for 2023, 2024, and 2025, the Art Deco and Bauhaus aesthetics of the 1920s and 1930s continue to gain favor, increasing from 23% for 2023 to 28% for 2025. However, interest in the mid-century modern designs of the 1950s keeps cooling, with just 7% of designers saying those styles are ripe for a comeback in 2025. \n\n**Organic Patterns and Design Aesthetics**\n\nOrganic patterns and motifs, along with bold and large-scale prints and florals, are expected to remain the favored patterns for 2025, even given the steady decline in both, with bold designs dropping to 15% (from 21% for 2024) and organic patterns dropping to 12% (from 18% for 2024). While some designs, like Moroccan and checks, have faded, animal prints have gained momentum, increasing from 4% for 2024 to 6% for 2025. Additionally, the 2024 design aesthetics most likely to remain popular in 2025 are maximalism (tapped by 33% of designers), eclecticism (33%), and organic modernism (31%). \n\n**Icons of Seating and Lighting**\n\nFollowing a slight decline for 2023 and 2024, the Eames lounge chair and ottoman have experienced a resurgence, predicted by 23% of designers to be the most popular iconic vintage seating in 2025, up from 15% for 2024. The Vladimir Kagan Serpentine sofa sits comfortably in second place (13%). Previously unranked, the Kaare Klint Safari chair has claimed third place (8%). \n\nMurano-glass pendants and chandeliers have experienced a solid upward trend, expected to be the most popular iconic vintage lighting in 2025 by 27% of respondents (up from 19% for 2024), indicating a growing preference for ornate styles. The Noguchi Akari lamp takes second place, with 16%, rising three percentage points from predictions for 2024. The stark difference in aesthetics between the two most popular designs indicates two strong preferences dividing designers. \n\n**Curvy Shapes Continue to Dominate**\n\nWhen asked which furniture, lighting and decor trends will become popular in 2025, the highest percentage of designers chose curvy and irregular shapes. Claiming almost half the votes, with 47%, this trend was followed by oversized pendant lighting (27%). When it comes to design features and elements expected to be popular in 2025, colorful painted murals (28%), patterned wallpaper (26%) and wallpapered ceilings (26%) were among the top choices. Discreet technology (35%) claimed first place, with designers expecting a growing demand for seamless tech integration in homes. These preferences reflect the desire to embrace new technologies without compromising on bold interiors that welcome personalization and creativity. \n\n**Part 2: What’s Out**\n\n**Color Trends: Muted Hues Decline, and Goodbye, Barbie Pink**\n\nWhile deep earthy and rich tones are on the rise, muted hues have suffered a significant drop. Dark yellow and mustard colorways fell five percentage points, to 15% for 2025 from 20% for 2024. Dark blue and navy returned to their 2023 spot, at 11%, after experiencing a quick spike in popularity during 2024, at 14%. Meanwhile, the popularity of dark gray and slate has fallen by half for 2025, sitting as low as 5% versus 10% for 2024. Barbie’s hot pink, which owned a 6% share of popularity for 2024, has experienced a dramatic decrease to 2% for 2025. \n\n**Home Office Boom Fades**\n\nAs hybrid work becomes the norm, the demand for dedicated home offices has drastically decreased. Only 13% of designers expect that home office renovations will be their most requested projects in 2025, down from 32% for 2023, signaling a shift toward more flexible, functional living spaces. \n\n**Iconic Seating Falls Off**\n\nA consistent and meaningful shift has been noted for Wishbone and Soriana seating. The Hans Wegner Wishbone chair declined from 11% for 2023 to 7% for 2025. Likewise, the Afra & Tobia Scarpa Soriana designs have decreased steadily in popularity over the past three years, from 10% for 2022 to 5% for 2025. \n\n**Custom Pieces Continue to Decline**\n\nThe average percentage of customized pieces designers use in their projects continues to decline, dropping from 51% for 2020 to 46% for 2024. Additionally, 62% of designers responded that they plan to purchase more artisan furniture in 2025, compared with 35% who plan to purchase more items from large manufacturers. Sourcing expectations for 2025 remain consistent with 2024, favoring new or contemporary items, while antique pieces — those made before 1920 — are least likely to be sourced. That said, there has been an uptick in designers expecting to shop antiques, from 56% for 2024 to 62% for 2025, which is also more than in the previous 4 years. \n\n**Part 3: Room-by-Room Design Requests**\n\n**Living Rooms and Kitchens Are Top Priorities for 2025**\n\nKitchens are predicted to be the most requested renovation projects for 2025, with 61% of homeowners expected to be seeking updates, up from 54% for 2024. Living rooms follow closely at 51%, down from 62% for 2024. These shifts reflect a growing emphasis on personal wellness as homeowners prioritize creating spaces that support self-care and everyday comfort. With more time spent at home cooking and focusing on self-care routines, living rooms and kitchens are essential areas for renovation, aligning with a broader trend toward enhancing wellness-focused, multifunctional spaces. \n\n**What If Money Were No Object?**\n\nFor projects with unlimited budgets, closets with extra space and storage are still tops among additional rooms designers expect to recommend to their clients, coming in at 53% for 2025, down from 2024’s 57%. Recommendations for guest suites follow close behind, at 50%, with scullery and outdoor kitchens tying at 45%, part of a continued trend for more cooking and meal preparation space to entertain. Massage rooms, treehouses and pet rooms continue to be among the least recommended spaces. Bowling alleys have seen an unexpected uptick, with 2% of designers saying they would recommend them to clients, up from 1% last year. \n\n**Part 4: The Impact of AI**\n\n**AI’s Impact Remains Unclear**\n\nWhile Artificial intelligence (AI) has not yet heavily penetrated the design process, with just 16% of designers leveraging the technology in their work in 2024, its adoption is expected to increase, with 24% of designers saying they plan to use it in 2025. Still, almost 60% of designers indicate that they will not use AI-powered processes in 2025 or are undecided about implementing the technology. Their responses to the open-ended survey questions reflect awareness and expectation that AI’s influence will undoubtedly grow. \n\n**Part 5: Predictions for the Future**\n\nWhile trends are ever-evolving, the focus on sustainability and technology has noticeably intensified in recent years, with designers consistently looking to incorporate more of these products and materials in their projects. The number of projects expected to have some sustainability requirement in 2025 averages 43%. In 2023, there was a heightened emphasis on supply-chain challenges and pandemic-related disruptions. Now, the conversation is shifting toward technological integration and client demands for more unusual, sustainable solutions. \n\n**Methodology**\n\n1stDibs commissioned researchers with Surveys & Forecasts, LLC, a full-service strategic research consultancy based in South Norwalk, CT, to conduct 643 online interviews between July and August 2024.

(NASDAQ: DIBS), a leading online marketplace for luxury design products (\"1stDibs\" or the \"Company\"), today reported financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n** Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights **\n\n  * Net revenue was $21.2 million, an increase of 3% year-over-year. \n  * Gross profit was $15.0 million, a decrease of 1% year-over-year. \n  * Gross margin was 71.0%, compared to 73.3% in the third quarter 2023. \n  * GAAP net loss was $5.7 million compared to a net loss of $3.3 million in the third quarter 2023. \n  * Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin was $(3.0) million and (14.1)%, respectively, compared to $(1.8) million and (8.7)%, respectively, in the third quarter 2023. \n  * Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $109.4 million as of September 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n\"Our third quarter results reflect the progress we are making across key operational metrics, including two consecutive quarters of growth in both revenue and orders and sequential improvement for active buyers,\" said David Rosenblatt, 1stDibs Chief Executive Officer. “Despite ongoing challenges in the luxury housing market, our focus on conversion is proving effective and we remain on track to return to GMV growth in the fourth quarter.\" \n\nTom Etergino, Chief Financial Officer of 1stDibs said, “We are making strategic decisions to align our resources with what matters most – sustainable growth and profitability. Looking forward, we will continue to review the business to identify opportunities to improve efficiency and drive operating leverage.” \n\n** Other Recent Business Highlights and Third Quarter Key Operating Metrics **\n\n  * In August 2024, 1stDibs' Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $10.0 million of its common stock. \n  * Gross Merchandise Value (\"GMV\") was $84.6 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year. \n  * Number of Orders was approximately 33K, an increase of 7% year-over-year. \n  * Active Buyers was approximately 63K, a decrease of 1% year-over-year. \n\n\n\n** Financial Guidance and Outlook **\n\nThe Company’s fourth quarter 2024 guidance is below. \n\n**Q4 2024 Guidance**  \n---  \nGMV  |  $86 million - $93 million   \nNet revenue  |  $21.4 million - $22.7 million   \nAdjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP)  |  (17%) - (13%)   \n  \nActual results may differ materially from our Financial Guidance and Outlook as a result of, among other things, the factors described under “Forward-Looking Statements” below. \n\nA GAAP reconciliation to our non-GAAP guidance measure (adjusted EBITDA) is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the potential variability and uncertainty of expenses that may be incurred in the future. Stock-based compensation expense is impacted by the timing of employee stock transactions, the future fair market value of our common stock, and our future hiring and retention needs, all of which are difficult to predict and subject to change. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in the financial statement tables for our historical non-GAAP financial results included in this press release. \n\n** Webcast Information **\n\n1stDibs will host a webcast to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results today at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Investors and participants can access the webcast at the 1stDibs Investor Relations website (investors.1stdibs.com). A replay of the webcast will be available through the same link following the webcast, for one year thereafter. \n\n** Disclosure Information **\n\nIn compliance with disclosure obligations under Regulation FD, 1stDibs announces material information to the public through a variety of means, including filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, company blog posts, public conference calls and webcasts, as well as the investor relations website. \n\n** About 1stDibs **\n\n1stDibs is a leading online marketplace for connecting design lovers with highly coveted sellers and makers of vintage, antique, and contemporary furniture, home décor, art, jewelry, watches and fashion. \n\n** Forward-Looking Statements **\n\nThis press release contains or references \"forward-looking statements\" and \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable federal and state securities laws (collectively, \"forward-looking statements\").

GMV includes all sales reported to us by our sellers, whether transacted through the 1stDibs marketplace or reported as an offline sale. We view GMV as a measure of the total economic activity generated by our online marketplace, and as an indicator of the scale and growth of our online marketplace and the health of our ecosystem. Our historical performance for GMV may not be indicative of future performance in GMV. \n\n_Number of Orders_\n\nWe define Number of Orders as the total number of orders placed or reported through the 1stDibs marketplace in a given month, minus cancellations within that month. Our historical performance for Number of Orders may not be indicative of future performance in Number of Orders. \n\n_Active Buyers_\n\nWe define Active Buyers as buyers who have made at least one purchase through our online marketplace during the 12 months ended on the last day of the period presented, net of cancellations. A buyer is identified by a unique email address; thus an Active Buyer could have more than one account if they were to use a separate unique email address to set up each account. We believe this metric reflects scale, engagement and brand awareness, and our ability to convert user activity on our online marketplace into transactions. Our historical performance for Active Buyers may not be indicative of future performance in new Active Buyers. \n\n**1STDIBS.COM, INC.** **CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS** **(Amounts in

EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net loss adjusted to exclude: (1) depreciation and amortization; (2) stock-based compensation expense; (3) other income, net; and (4) strategic alternative expenses. We also provide Adjusted EBITDA Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure that presents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue. Below is a reconciliation of net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA. \n\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures, because they are key measures used by our management team to help us to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. We also use these measures to analyze our financial results, establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business, and make strategic decisions. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the income and expenses that we exclude from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Accordingly, we believe that these metrics provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, enhances the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by our management in their financial and operational decision-making. We also believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core business and results of operations over multiple periods with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors, and to analyze our cash performance. \n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way that these measures are calculated. The non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered as the sole measure of our performance and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplemental in nature, and are not intended, and should not be construed, as a substitute for the related financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. These limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin include the following: \n\n  * The exclusion of certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization of property and equipment. While these are non-cash charges, we may need to replace the assets being depreciated in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for these replacements or new capital expenditure requirements; \n  * The exclusion of stock-based compensation expense, which has been a significant recurring expense and will continue to constitute a significant recurring expense for the foreseeable future, as equity awards are expected to continue to be an important component of our compensation strategy; \n  * The exclusion of other income, net, which includes interest income related to our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency exchange; \n  * The exclusion of strategic alternative expenses in connection with capital return strategies, buy- and sell-side mergers, acquisitions and partnerships which include integration costs, sale of a business or subsidiary, business optimization costs related to revisions of operational objectives and priorities which include restructuring charges, in all cases outside the ordinary course. \n\n\n\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin alongside other financial performance measures, including net loss and our other GAAP results. The information in the tables below sets forth the non-GAAP financial measures along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. \n\n**1STDIBS.COM, INC.** **Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA** **(Amounts in thousands)** **(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet loss  |  $  |  (5,683  |  )  |  $  |  (3,305  |  )  |  $  |  (13,423  |  )  |  $  |  (19,758  |  )   \nExcluding:   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  507  |  449  |  1,439  |  1,815   \nStock-based compensation expense  |  3,902  |  2,982  |  11,008  |  9,340   \nOther income, net  |  (1,713  |  )  |  (1,928  |  )  |  (5,823  |  )  |  (6,093  |  )   \nProvision for income taxes  |  4  |  —  |  8  |  —   \nStrategic alternative expenses  |  —  |  —  |  425  |  3,061   \nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)  |  $  |  (2,983  |  )  |  $  |  (1,802  |  )  |  $  |  (6,366  |  )  |  $  |  (11,635  |  )   \nDivided by:   \nNet revenue  |  $  |  21,190  |  $  |  20,663  |  $  |  65,487  |  $  |  63,762   \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin (non-GAAP)  |  (14.1  |  )%  |  (8.7  |  )%  |  (9.7  |  )%  |  (18.2  |  )%   \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241108165287r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**Media:** Jennifer Miller jennifer.miller@1stdibs.com\n\n**Investor Relations:** Kevin LaBuz investors@1stdibs.com\n\nSource: 1stdibs.Com, Inc.\n\n**Multimedia Files:**\n\n[ View all news ](/news/default.aspx)\n"

Looking forward, we will\ncontinue to review the business to identify opportunities to improve efficiency and drive operating\nleverage.”\nOther Recent Business Highlights and Third Quarter Key Operating Metrics\n• In August 2024, 1stDibs' Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program\nauthorizing the Company to repurchase up to $10.0 million of its common stock.\n• Gross Merchandise Value (\"GMV\") was $84.6 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year.\n• Number of Orders was approximately 33K, an increase of 7% year-over-year.\n• Active Buyers was approximately 63K, a decrease of 1% year-over-year.\n1\nFinancial Guidance and Outlook\nThe Company’s fourth quarter 2024 guidance is below.\nQ4 2024 Guidance\nGMV $86 million - $93 million\nNet revenue $21.4 million - $22.7 million\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) (17%) - (13%)\nActual results may differ materially from our Financial Guidance and Outlook as a result of, among other\nthings, the factors described under “Forward-Looking Statements” below.\nA GAAP reconciliation to our non-GAAP guidance measure (adjusted EBITDA) is not available on a\nforward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the potential variability and uncertainty of\nexpenses that may be incurred in the future. Stock-based compensation expense is impacted by the timing\nof employee stock transactions, the future fair market value of our common stock, and our future hiring\nand retention needs, all of which are difficult to predict and subject to change. We have provided a\nreconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in the financial statement tables for our\nhistorical non-GAAP financial results included in this press release.\nWebcast Information\n1stDibs will host a webcast to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results today at 8:00 a.m. Eastern\nTime.

Any statements in this press release, other than\nstatements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial\nposition, business strategy and plans, objectives of management for future operations, long term operating\nexpenses, and expectations for capital requirements, may be deemed to be forward-looking statements.

These forward-looking statements include, but are not\nlimited to, statements regarding the following: (1) our continued efforts to lay the foundation for future\ngrowth; (2) our focus on efficiency and steps to align our expenses to current demand and the impact\nthereof; (3) our progress towards reaccelarating sustainable growth, reducing our cost, increasing\noperating leverage, and re-engineering our cost base; (4) the implementation of our stock repurchase\nprogram; and (5) our future results of operations and financial position, including our financial guidance\nand outlook.

Investors are therefore cautioned not\nto place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject\nto risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those\ndiscussed or implied in the forward-looking statements.

We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.\nMoreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from\ntime to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all\nfactors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual\nresults to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make.

GMV includes all sales reported to us by our sellers, whether transacted through the 1stDibs\nmarketplace or reported as an offline sale. We view GMV as a measure of the total economic activity\ngenerated by our online marketplace, and as an indicator of the scale and growth of our online\nmarketplace and the health of our ecosystem. Our historical performance for GMV may not be indicative\nof future performance in GMV.\nNumber of Orders\nWe define Number of Orders as the total number of orders placed or reported through the 1stDibs\nmarketplace in a given month, minus cancellations within that month. Our historical performance for\nNumber of Orders may not be indicative of future performance in Number of Orders.\nActive Buyers\nWe define Active Buyers as buyers who have made at least one purchase through our online\nmarketplace during the 12 months ended on the last day of the period presented, net of cancellations. A\nbuyer is identified by a unique email address; thus an Active Buyer could have more than one account if\nthey were to use a separate unique email address to set up each account. We believe this metric reflects\nscale, engagement and brand awareness, and our ability to convert user activity on our online marketplace\ninto transactions.

(2) stock-based compensation expense; (3) other income,\nnet; and (4) strategic alternative expenses. We also provide Adjusted EBITDA Margin, a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure that presents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue. Below is a reconciliation of net loss, the most\ndirectly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures,\nbecause they are key measures used by our management team to help us to assess our operating performance and\nthe operating leverage in our business. We also use these measures to analyze our financial results, establish budgets\nand operational goals for managing our business, and make strategic decisions. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA\nand Adjusted EBITDA Margin help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by\nthe effect of the income and expenses that we exclude from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin.\nAccordingly, we believe that these metrics provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and\nevaluating our results of operations, enhances the overall understanding of our past performance and future\nprospects, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by our management in their\nfinancial and operational decision-making. We also believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core business and results of operations\nover multiple periods with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to investors, and to analyze our cash performance.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by\nother companies due to differences in the way that these measures are calculated. The non-GAAP financial\nmeasures presented should not be considered as the sole measure of our performance and should not be considered\nin isolation from, or as a substitute for, comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nFurther, these non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of\ncertain expenses that are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, these non-\nGAAP financial measures should be considered as supplemental in nature, and are not intended, and should not be\nconstrued, as a substitute for the related financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. These\nlimitations of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin include the following:\n• The exclusion of certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization of property and\nequipment. While these are non-cash charges, we may need to replace the assets being depreciated in the\nfuture and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for these replacements or new capital\nexpenditure requirements;\n• The exclusion of stock-based compensation expense, which has been a significant recurring expense and\nwill continue to constitute a significant recurring expense for the foreseeable future, as equity awards are\nexpected to continue to be an important component of our compensation strategy;\n• The exclusion of other income, net, which includes interest income related to our cash, cash equivalents and\nshort-term investments and realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency exchange;\n• The exclusion of strategic alternative expenses in connection with capital return strategies, buy- and sell-\nside mergers, acquisitions and partnerships which include integration costs, sale of a business or subsidiary,\nbusiness optimization costs related to revisions of operational objectives and priorities which include\nrestructuring charges, in all cases outside the ordinary course.\n10\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin alongside\nother financial performance measures, including net loss and our other GAAP results. The information in the tables\nbelow sets forth the non-GAAP financial measures along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial\nmeasures.\n11\n1STDIBS.COM, INC.\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA\n(Amounts in thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss $ (5,683) $ (3,305) $ (13,423) $ (19,758)\nExcluding:\nDepreciation and amortization 507 449 1,439 1,815\nStock-based compensation expense 3,902 2,982 11,008 9,340\nOther income, net (1,713) (1,928) (5,823) (6,093)\nProvision for income taxes 4 — 8 —\nStrategic alternative expenses — — 425 3,061\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ (2,983) $ (1,802) $ (6,366) $ (11,635)\nDivided by:\nNet revenue $ 21,190 $ 20,663 $ 65,487 $ 63,762\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin (non-GAAP) (14.1) % (8.7) % (9.7) % (18.2) %\n12"

Any statements contained in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical facts, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position,\nbusiness strategy and plans, objectives of management for future operations, long term operating expenses, and expectations for capital requirements, may be\ndeemed to be forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the words “may,” “might,” “will,” “can,” “could,”\n“would,” “should,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “objective,” “target,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “project,” “potential,” “continue,” and\n“ongoing,” or the negative of these terms, or other comparable terminology intended to identify statements about the future. These statements involve known\nand unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from the\ninformation expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about:\n• our future financial performance, including our expectations regarding our net revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, and our ability to achieve\nand maintain future profitability, in particular with respect to the impacts of inflation, macroeconomic uncertainty, and geopolitical instability;\n• our ability to effectively manage or sustain our growth and to effectively expand our operations, including entering and scaling our presence\ninternationally;\n• our growth strategies, plans, objectives and goals;\n• the market demand for the products offered on our online marketplace, including vintage, antique, and contemporary furniture, home décor, jewelry,\nwatches, art, and fashion, new and authenticated luxury design products in general, and the online market for these products;\n• our ability to compete with existing and new competitors in existing and new markets;\n• our ability to attract and retain sellers and buyers;\n• our ability to increase the supply of luxury design products offered through our online marketplace;\n• our ability to timely and effectively scale our operations;\n• our ability to develop and protect our brand;\n• our ability to comply with laws and regulations;\n• our expectations regarding outstanding litigation;\n• our expectations and management of future growth;\n• our expectations concerning relationships with third parties;\n• economic and industry trends, projected growth, or trend analysis;\n• our estimated market opportunity;\n• our ability to add capacity, capabilities, and automation to our operations;\n• the increased expenses associated with being a public company;\n• the effect of catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions, such as the ongoing impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the uncertainty with\nrespect to potential resurgences, on our business and operations;\n• our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights and successfully defend against claims of infringement,\nmisappropriation, or other violations of third-party intellectual property;\n• the availability of capital to grow our business;\n• our ability to successfully defend any future litigation brought against us;\n• our ability to implement and maintain effective policies, procedures, and internal controls;\n• adverse economic or market conditions that may harm our business;\n• exposure to increased economic and operational uncertainties from operating a global business, including the effects of foreign currency exchange;\n• the dependence of our business on our ability to attract and retain talented employees;\n• potential changes in laws and regulations applicable to us or our sellers, or our sellers’ ability to comply therewith; and\n• the amount of time for which we expect our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances and other available financial resources to be\nsufficient to fund our operations.\nThese forward-looking statements reflect our management’s beliefs and views with respect to future events and are based on estimates and assumptions as\nof the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in these\nforward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” as well as those discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. As a result of these factors, we cannot\nassure you that the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will prove to be accurate. Furthermore, if our forward-looking\nstatements prove to be inaccurate, the inaccuracy may be material. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not\nregard these statements as a representation or warranty by us or any other person that we will achieve our objectives and plans in any specified timeframe, or at\nall. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management\nto predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual\nresults to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue\nreliance on these forward-looking statements.\nIn addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based on\ninformation available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. While we believe that such information provides a reasonable basis for these\nstatements, such information may be limited or incomplete.

All intercompany accounts and transactions have\nbeen eliminated in consolidation. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP\nhave been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Therefore, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”) for the year\nended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 29, 2024.\nThe consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, included herein, was derived from the audited financial statements as of that date, but does not\ninclude all disclosures including certain notes required by GAAP on an annual reporting basis.\nIn the opinion of the Company, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring\nadjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of its financial position and its results of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the\ninterim periods.

As a result of the reduction, the Company incurred approximately $2.0 million in non-recurring\nrestructuring charges in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisting primarily of employee severance and benefits costs. As of September 30, 2024,\nall $2.0 million has been paid.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred $0.4 million of additional employee severance and benefits costs which is\nanticipated to be paid over the next nine months.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the\nexpense is included within the respective financial statement line items on the condensed consolidated statements of operations as shown in the table below:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nCost of revenue $ — $ 135\nSales and marketing — 789\nTechnology development — 1,044\nGeneral and administrative 372 36\nTotal $ 372 $ 2,004\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts\nof revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in these condensed consolidated financial statements\ninclude, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, provision for transaction losses, impairment assessment of goodwill, capitalization of internal-use software\nand determination of useful lives, income taxes, and the valuation of stock-based compensation and leases. The Company evaluates its estimates and\nassumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nThe following represents the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as of the periods presented:\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 22,018 $ 32,442\nRestricted cash, non-current 3,641 3,336\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 25,659 $ 35,778\nThe Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be\ncash equivalents. Certain cash equivalents consist of investments in debt securities that are classified as available-for-sale. As of September 30, 2024, the\nCompany’s restricted cash relates to $3.6 million in Letters of Credit for its office leases in New York, New York.

The carrying value of the\nrestricted cash approximates fair value.\n14\n1STDIBS.COM, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which aims to\nimprove reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The standard will require all\npublic entities, including those with a single reportable segment, to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim\nbasis. The guidance requires a public entity to disclose the significant expense categories and amounts that are regularly provided to the chief operating\ndecision-maker. This standard is effective for the Company’s annual report ending December 31, 2024, and for interim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with\nearly adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance and, while it has a single reportable segment,\nit expects to enhance its current disclosures in the notes to the financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which modifies the rules on\nincome tax disclosures. The standard will require entities to disclose (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) the income or loss from continuing\noperations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (3) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations\n(separated by federal, state and foreign). ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose their income tax payments to international, federal, state and local\njurisdictions, among other changes. The new standard is effective for the Company’s annual report ending December 31, 2025. The Company is currently\nevaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n2. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nCertain assets and liabilities are carried at fair value in accordance with GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an\nasset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants on the measurement date.\nValuation techniques used to measure fair value require the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable\ninputs. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the\nlowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of\nthe following three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable:\n• Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2—Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, such as quoted prices for similar assets\nor liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for\nsubstantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n• Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity that are significant to determining the fair value of the assets or\nliabilities, including pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, and similar techniques.\n15\n1STDIBS.COM, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nShort-term investments and certain cash equivalents consist of investments in debt securities that are available-for-sale.

If the loss is not probable or the amount of the loss\ncannot be reasonably estimated, the Company discloses the claim if the likelihood of a potential loss is reasonably possible. The Company does not believe that\nit is party to any pending legal proceedings that are likely to have a material effect on its business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n24\n1STDIBS.COM, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nIndemnification\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to vendors, lessors, business partners, and other\nparties with respect to certain matters including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements or from intellectual property infringement\nclaims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with members of its Board and officers that will require\nthe Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The\nmaximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is, in many cases, unlimited.\nTo date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications.\n25\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial\nstatements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based\nupon current plans, expectations, and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these\nforward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical\nresults are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.\nCompany Overview\nWe are one of the world’s leading online marketplaces for connecting design lovers with many of the best sellers and makers of vintage, antique, and\ncontemporary furniture, home décor, jewelry, watches, art, and fashion. We believe we are a leading online marketplace for these luxury design products based\non the aggregate number of such listings on our online marketplace and our Gross Merchandise Value (“GMV”). Our thoroughly vetted seller base, in-depth\nmarketing content, and custom-built technology platform create trust in our brand and facilitate high-consideration purchases. By disrupting the way these\nitems are bought and sold, we are both expanding access to, and growing the market for, luxury design products.\n1stDibs began in 2000 with the vision of bringing the magic of the Paris flea market online by creating a listings site for top vintage and antique furniture\nsellers. Soon thereafter, we moved our headquarters to New York City and focused primarily on adding U.S.-based sellers to our site. The quality of our initial\nseller base enabled us to build a reputation in the design industry as a trusted source for unique luxury design products. In over two decades of operating\nhistory, we have strengthened our brand and deepened our seller relationships. We launched our e-commerce platform in 2013 and transitioned to a full e-\ncommerce marketplace model in 2016. Since inception we have expanded our offerings to other verticals such as home decor, jewelry, watches, art, and\nfashion. We provide our sellers, the vast majority of which are small businesses, access to a global community of buyers and a platform to facilitate e-\ncommerce at scale. Our sellers use our platform to manage their inventory, build their digital marketing presence, and communicate and negotiate prices\ndirectly with buyers. We provide our buyers a trusted purchase experience with our user-friendly interface, dedicated specialist support, and 1stDibs Promise,\nour comprehensive buyer protection program. We operate an asset-light business model which allows us to scale in a capital efficient manner. While we enable\nshipping and fulfillment logistics, we do not take physical possession of the items sold on our online marketplace.\nKey Operating and Financial Metrics\nWe use the following key metrics and non-GAAP measures to evaluate our performance, identify trends affecting our business, and make strategic\ndecisions:\n• GMV;\n• Number of Orders;\n• Active Buyers; and\n• Adjusted EBITDA (see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net loss, the most directly\ncomparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA).\nFor GMV, Number of Orders, and Active Buyers, these metrics are based on internal company data, assumptions, and estimates and are used in managing\nour business. We believe that these figures are reasonable estimates, and we actively take measures to improve their accuracy, such as eliminating known\nfictitious or duplicate accounts. There are, however, inherent challenges in gathering accurate data across large online and mobile populations. For example,\nindividuals may have multiple email accounts in violation of our terms of service, which would result in an Active Buyer being counted more than once, thus\nimpacting the accuracy of our number of Active Buyers. In addition, certain metrics, such as the number of Active Buyers, and Number of Orders, and GMV\nare measured based on such numbers as reported in a given month, minus cancellations within that month. As we do not retroactively adjust such numbers for\ncancellations occurring after the month, the metrics presented do not reflect subsequent order cancellations. We regularly review and may adjust our processes\nfor calculating these metrics to\n26\nimprove their accuracy. These key operating and financial metrics may vary from period to period and should not be viewed as indicative of other metrics.\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nGMV $ 84,613 $ 88,983 $ 267,813 $ 275,905\nNumber of Orders 33,347 31,202 102,614 98,988\nActive Buyers 62,527 63,227 62,527 63,227\nAdjusted EBITDA (unaudited) $ (2,983) $ (1,802) $ (6,366) $ (11,635)\nGross Merchandise Value\nWe define GMV as the total dollar value from items sold by our sellers through 1stDibs in a given month, minus cancellations within that month, and\nexcluding shipping and sales taxes. GMV includes all sales reported to us by our sellers, whether transacted through the 1stDibs online marketplace or reported\nas an offline sale. We view GMV as a measure of the total economic activity generated by our online marketplace and as an indicator of the scale, growth, and\nhealth of our online marketplace. Our historical performance for GMV may not be indicative of future performance in GMV.\nNumber of Orders\nWe define Number of Orders as the total number of orders placed or reported through the 1stDibs online marketplace in a given month, minus\ncancellations within that month. Our historical performance for Number of Orders may not be indicative of future performance in Number of Orders.\nActive Buyers\nWe define Active Buyers as buyers who have made at least one purchase through our online marketplace during the 12 months ended on the last day of the\nperiod presented, net of cancellations. A buyer is identified by a unique email address; thus an Active Buyer could have more than one account if they were to\nuse a separate unique email address to set up each account. We believe this metric reflects scale, engagement and brand awareness, and our ability to convert\nuser activity on our online marketplace into transactions. Our historical performance for Active Buyers may not be indicative of future performance in new\nActive Buyers.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, other income, net, provision for\nincome taxes, gain on sale of business, and strategic alternative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure used by our management and board\nof directors to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage of our business. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA helps identify underlying trends\nin our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the income and expenses that we exclude from Adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, we believe that\nAdjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhances the overall\nunderstanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by our management\nin their financial and operational decision-making. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and for a reconciliation of net loss, the most\ndirectly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nNet Revenue\nOur net revenue consists principally of seller marketplace services. Seller marketplace services primarily consist of marketplace transactions,\nsubscriptions, and listing fees. Marketplace transaction fees are collected when sellers pay us commissions ranging from 5% to 50% of GMV and processing\nfees, which are approximately 3% of the buyer’s total payment, net of expected refunds. If a seller accepts a return or refund of an on-platform purchase, the\nrelated commission and processing fees are refunded. Subscriptions provide access to our online marketplace, allowing sellers, who are our customers, to\nexecute successful purchase transactions with buyers. We offer our sellers various subscription pricing tiers which allows them to choose the plan that best fits\ntheir business, with choices of a higher monthly subscription fee and lower commission rates or lower monthly subscription fee and higher commission rates.\nAdditionally, some sellers have no monthly subscription fees and higher commission rates, however, we no longer offer this option to new sellers. Listing fee\nrevenue is collected when sellers pay us for promoting certain products on their behalf and at their discretion through our online marketplace. Advertisements\nconsist of impression-based ads displayed on our online marketplace on the seller’s behalf.\n27\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue includes payment processor fees and hosting expenses. Cost of revenue also includes expenses associated with payroll, employee benefits,\nstock-based compensation, other headcount-related expenses associated with operations personnel supporting revenue-related operations and logistics,\nconsulting costs, and amortization expense related to our capitalized internal-use software.\nIn certain transactions where our shipping services are elected by sellers, we facilitate shipping of items purchased from the seller to the buyer. The\ndifference between the amount collected for shipping and the amount charged by the shipping carrier is included in cost of revenue in our consolidated\nstatements of operations. We facilitate fulfillment and shipping, but do not take ownership of or manage inventory.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit is net revenue less cost of revenue, and gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of net revenue. Gross profit has been, and will continue to\nbe, affected by various factors, including leveraging economies of scale, the costs associated with hosting our platform, the level of amortization of our\ninternal-use software, the fluctuations in shipping costs including our ability to pass these costs on to buyers, and the extent to which we expand our operations.\nWe expect that our gross margin will fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these various factors.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and\nmarketing personnel, advertising expense, consulting costs, and promotional discounts offered to new and existing buyers. Advertising expenses consist\nprimarily of costs incurred promoting and marketing our services, such as costs associated with acquiring new users through performance-based marketing,\nsocial media programs, email, and events. Promotional discounts and incentives represent incentives solely to end buyers and, therefore, are not considered\npayments made to our customers. Buyers are not our customers because access to the 1stDibs online marketplace is free for buyers, and we have no\nperformance obligations with respect to buyers.\nTechnology Development\nTechnology development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related expenses associated with\nengineering and product development personnel and consulting costs related to technology development. We expense all technology development expenses as\nincurred, except for those expenses that meet the criteria for capitalization as internal-use software.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, other headcount-related expenses associated with\nfinance, legal, facility and human resources related personnel, lease expense, net of sublease income, business liability insurance, accounting, professional fees,\nand depreciation and amortization of property and equipment. We expense all general and administrative expenses as incurred.\nProvision for Transaction Losses\nProvision for transaction losses primarily consists of transaction loss expense associated with our buyer protection program, including damages to products\ncaused by shipping and transit, items that were not received or not as represented by the seller, and reimbursements to buyers at our discretion if they are\ndissatisfied with their experience. The provision for transaction losses also includes bad debt expense associated with our accounts receivable balance.\n28\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet revenue $ 21,190 $ 20,663 $ 65,487 $ 63,762\nCost of revenue 6,154 5,510 18,520 19,144\nGross profit 15,036 15,153 46,967 44,618\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing 9,146 8,411 27,580 28,007\nTechnology development 5,471 4,515 15,686 17,199\nGeneral and administrative 6,864 6,772 20,756 22,323\nProvision for transaction losses 947 688 2,183 2,940\nTotal operating expenses 22,428 20,386 66,205 70,469\nLoss from operations (7,392) (5,233) (19,238) (25,851)\nOther income, net:\nInterest income 1,357 1,757 4,695 4,933\nOther, net 356 171 1,128 1,160\nTotal other income, net 1,713 1,928 5,823 6,093\nNet loss before income taxes (5,679) (3,305) (13,415) (19,758)\nProvision for income taxes (4) — (8) —\nNet loss $ (5,683) $ (3,305) $ (13,423) $ (19,758)\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet revenue 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 %\nCost of revenue 29 27 28 30\nGross profit 71 73 72 70\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing 44 41 42 44\nTechnology development 26 22 24 27\nGeneral and administrative 32 33 32 35\nProvision for transaction losses 4 3 3 5\nTotal operating expenses 106 99 101 111\nLoss from operations (35) (26) (29) (41)\nOther income, net:\nInterest income 6 9 7 8\nOther, net 2 1 2 2\nTotal other income, net 8 10 9 10\nNet loss before income taxes (27) (16) (20) (31)\nProvision for income taxes — — — —\nNet loss (27)% (16)% (20)% (31)%\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nNet Revenue\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nNet revenue $ 21,190 $ 20,663 $ 527 3 %\n29\nNet revenue was $21.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $20.7 million for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. The increase of $0.5 million, or 3%, was primarily driven by various strategic initiatives we actioned to improve our take rates, including commission re-\ntiering.\nOur marketplace transaction fees represent the majority of our net revenue and accounted for 74% and 71% of our net revenue for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Subscription fees accounted for 22% and 24% of our net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively.\nCost of Revenue\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nCost of revenue $ 6,154 $ 5,510 $ 644 12 %\nCost of revenue was $6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $5.5 million for the three months ended September 30,\n2023.

The decrease in gross profit and gross margin for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was primarily driven by cost of revenue increasing more than the increase in net revenue as outlined above.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nSales and marketing $ 9,146 $ 8,411 $ 735 9 %\nSales and marketing expense was $9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $8.4 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase of $0.7 million, or 9%, was primarily driven by a $0.2 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $0.2 million increase in\nstock-based compensation expense resulting from our annual compensation increases in March. There was also a $0.2 million increase in general marketing\nspend, including performance marketing.\nTechnology Development\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nTechnology development $ 5,471 $ 4,515 $ 956 21 %\nTechnology development expense was $5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $4.5 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2023.

There was a $0.4 million increase in stock based compensation expense relating to our annual compensation\nincreases in March, and a $0.4 million increase in professional fees relating to additional consulting projects. These were partially offset by a $0.5 million\ndecrease in lease expense, net, primarily due to sublease income related to our August 2023 sublease for our former New York City corporate headquarters.\n30\nProvision for Transaction Losses\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nProvision for transaction losses $ 947 $ 688 $ 259 38 %\nProvision for transaction losses was $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $0.7 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.

We also use this measure to analyze our financial results, establish budgets and\noperational goals for managing our business, and make strategic decisions. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA helps identify underlying trends in our business\nthat could otherwise be masked by the effect of the income and expenses that we exclude from Adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted\nEBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, enhances the overall understanding of\nour past performance and future prospects, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by our management in their financial\nand operational decision-making. We also believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure provides an additional tool for investors to use in\ncomparing our core business and results of operations over multiple periods with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to investors, and to analyze our operating performance.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the\nway that these measures are calculated. The non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered as the sole measure of our performance and\nshould not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-\nGAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplemental in nature, and are not intended, and should\nnot be construed, as a substitute for the related financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. These limitations of Adjusted EBITDA include the\nfollowing:\n• The exclusion of certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization of property and equipment. While these are non-cash\ncharges, we may need to replace the assets being depreciated in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for these\nreplacements or new capital expenditure requirements;\n• The exclusion of stock-based compensation expense, which has been a significant recurring expense and will continue to constitute a significant\nrecurring expense for the foreseeable future, as equity awards are expected to continue to be an important component of our compensation strategy;\n• The exclusion of other income, net, which includes interest income related to our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and realized and\nunrealized gains and losses on foreign currency exchange; and\n• The exclusion of strategic alternative expenses in connection with capital return strategies, buy- and sell-side mergers, acquisitions and partnerships\nwhich include integration costs, sale of a business or subsidiary, business optimization costs related to revisions of operational objectives and priorities\nwhich include restructuring charges, in all cases outside the ordinary course.\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net loss and our other\nGAAP results.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as our net loss, excluding: (1) depreciation and amortization; (2) stock-based compensation expense; (3) other income, net;\n(4) provision for income taxes; and (5) strategic alternative expenses. The following table provides a reconciliation of net loss, the most directly comparable\nGAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss $ (5,683) $ (3,305) $ (13,423) $ (19,758)\nDepreciation and amortization 507 449 1,439 1,815\nStock-based compensation expense 3,902 2,982 11,008 9,340\nOther income, net (1,713) (1,928) (5,823) (6,093)\nProvision for income taxes 4 — 8 —\nStrategic alternative expenses — — 425 3,061\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (2,983) $ (1,802) $ (6,366) $ (11,635)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $109.4 million and an accumulated deficit of $327.1 million. Net\ncash used in operating activities was $5.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We expect operating losses and negative cash flows from\noperations to continue in the foreseeable future as we continue\n33\nto strategically invest in growth activities. Our principal use of cash is to fund our operations including platform development to support our strategic initiatives\nand anticipated share repurchases under the 2024 Stock Repurchase Program.\nBased on our current plans, we believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital\nexpenditure requirements through at least the next 12 months. We expect to continue to incur substantial expenditures in the near term to support our ongoing\nactivities. While management believes that our current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are sufficient to fund our operating expenses and\ncapital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months, we may need to borrow funds or raise additional equity to achieve our longer-term business\nobjectives.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n• the emergence of competing online marketplaces and other adverse market developments;\n• the timing and extent of our sales and marketing and technology development expenditures; and\n• any investments, acquisitions or other similar strategic endeavors we may choose to pursue in the future.\nA change in the outcome of any of these or other variables could significantly impact our operating plans, and we may need additional funds to meet\noperational needs and capital requirements associated with such plans. In addition, any future borrowings may result in additional restrictions on our business\nand any issuance of additional equity would result in dilution to investors. If we are unable to raise additional capital when we need it, it could harm our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn August 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the 2023 Stock Repurchase Program to repurchase up to an aggregate of $20.0 million of our common\nstock. In June 2024, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to our 2023 Stock Repurchase Program to an aggregate authorized repurchase amount of\n$25.5 million. On June 10, 2024, we announced the completion of our 2023 Stock Repurchase Program.\nIn August 2024, the Board of Directors authorized the 2024 Stock Repurchase Program to repurchase up to an aggregate of $10.0 million of our common\nstock.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, 191,935 shares of our common stock were purchased under the 2024 Stock Repurchase Program for a\ntotal cost of $0.9 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 4.3 million shares of our common stock were purchased for a total cost of\n$22.8 million and includes purchases under both the 2023 and the 2024 Stock Repurchase Programs.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (5,708) $ (11,475)\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities 15,325 (109,600)\nNet cash used in financing activities (25,155) (1,234)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 222 44\nNet decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ (15,316) $ (122,265)\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and was driven primarily by a $2.2 million decrease\nin accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of payments and invoices, a $2.2 million decrease in operating lease liabilities due to the continued\nlease payments on our previous and current NYC headquarters, partially offset by our sublease income, and a $1.8 million decrease in other current liabilities\nand other liabilities related to payments to settle multiple Sales and other non-income tax contingencies. Theses decreases were partially offset by a $2.7\nmillion increase in payables due to sellers due to timing of the bi-weekly payments we make to our sellers.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $11.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and was driven primarily by net revenue decreasing\nat a faster pace than operating expenses. Our changes in operating assets and liabilities were impacted by a negative change in operating lease liabilities of $2.1\nmillion due to the continued lease payments on our NYC headquarters and a $1.2 million change in other assets, primarily related to the $1.1 million broker fee\npaid in connection with our subleasing of our NYC headquarters.\n34\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $15.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and was driven primarily by $85.6 million\nmaturities and sales of short-term investments, partially offset by $68.9 million purchases of short-term investments.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $109.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and was driven primarily by $166.5 million\npurchases of short-term investments, partially offset by $58.2 million maturities of short-term investments.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $25.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and was driven primarily by $22.8 million in\npurchases of our common stock as part of our 2023 and 2024 Stock Repurchase Programs and $3.2 million of payments for taxes related to net share\nsettlements of stock-based compensation awards, partially offset by $0.8 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $1.2 million and was driven primarily by $1.3 million of\npurchases of our common stock as part of our 2023 Stock Repurchase Program.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were no material changes in commitments under contractual obligations compared to the contractual obligations disclosed\nin our Form 10-K.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a description\nof recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nEmerging Growth Company\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised\naccounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with\nnew or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that (i) we are no longer an\nemerging growth company or (ii) we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, these\nfinancial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective\ndates. We may choose to early adopt any new or revised accounting standards whenever such early adoption is permitted for private companies.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The\npreparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\nrevenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable\nunder the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that\nthere are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nThere have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates included in our Form 10-K.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including\nthe effects of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about these market risks\nare described below. At times, our cash balances with individual banking institutions are in excess of federally insured limits. We have not experienced any\ncredit losses related to our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments balances.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nInterest rate risk relates to the loss we could incur in our cash portfolios due to a change in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash\nequivalents and short-term investments of $109.4 million. Our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of demand and money market accounts, as well as\navailable-for-sale debt securities with an original maturity of 90 days or less. Our short-term investments consist primarily of U.S. Government agency and\nTreasury\n35\nsecurities, as well as commercial paper and corporate notes which have an original maturity greater than 90 days and are highly liquid in nature. Due to the\nnature of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, we would expect a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates to result\nin an approximate increase or decrease of $0.7 million in our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. While these are our best estimates of the\nimpact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes\nare instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes of this magnitude are rarely instantaneous or parallel.\nOur principal use of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments is to fund our operations including platform development to support our strategic\ninitiatives and anticipated share repurchases under the 2024 Stock Repurchase Program. The remainder of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments\nare held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nForeign Currency Risk\nOur net revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, Euros, and British pounds, depending on the currency selection of the seller. Our cost of revenue\nand operating expenses are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. As our online marketplace continues to grow globally, our results of operations and cash\nflows may be subject to fluctuations due to the change in foreign exchange rates. To date, fluctuations due to changes in the Euro and British pound have not\nbeen significant, but we may experience material foreign exchange gains and losses in our statement of operations in the future. As of September 30, 2024, we\nwould expect an adverse 10% change in current exchange rates to result in no more than a $2.4 million decrease in net revenue for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nCredit Risk\nWe are exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable balances. This risk is mitigated by requiring upfront payment for many of our services and due to our\ndiverse customer base, dispersed over various geographic regions and industrial sectors. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no\nsingle customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue. We maintain provisions for potential credit losses and such losses to date have been within\nour expectations. We evaluate the solvency of our customers on an ongoing basis to determine if additional allowances for doubtful accounts need to be\nrecorded.\nInflation Risk\nOur results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation\ndue to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe certain metrics, including our GMV and net revenue, have been negatively impacted, both\ndirectly and indirectly, by macroeconomic factors, including inflation and as a result significant capital market and housing market volatility. Additionally, if\nour costs were to become subject to inflationary pressures, we might not be able to fully offset such higher costs through net revenue and GMV increases. Our\ninability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot assure you our business will not be affected in the\nfuture by inflation.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures as of September 30, 2024. “Disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files\nor submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii)\naccumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 at the reasonable assurance level.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired\ncontrol objectives. Our management recognizes that any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain judgments and\nassumptions and cannot provide absolute assurance that its objectives will be met. Similarly, an evaluation of controls cannot provide absolute assurance that\nmisstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.\n36\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nHowever, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors\nand all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the\ncontrol system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be\nconsidered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be\nfaulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons,\nby the collusion of two or more people or by management override of controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential\nfuture conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n37\nPart II - Other Information\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings and subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation\nand claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of current matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations. Even if any particular litigation or claim is not resolved in a manner that is adverse to our interests, such litigation can have a\nnegative impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources from our business, and other factors.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nprospects, operating results or cash flows. For a detailed discussion of certain risks that affect our business, refer to the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our\n2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nThe risks described in our 2023 Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. We describe in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q certain known trends and uncertainties that affect our business. Additional risks and\nuncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business,\noperating results and financial condition.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n(c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe following table presents details of our monthly share repurchases for the three months ended September 30, 2024:\nTotal number of Shares\nPurchased as Part of Publicly Approximate Dollar Value of Shares\nTotal Number of Shares Average Price Paid per Announced Plans or that May Yet be Purchased under the\nPeriod Purchased Share (a) Programs (b) Plans or Programs (in thousands)\nJuly 1, 2024 - July 31,\n2024 — $ — — $ —\nAugust 1, 2024 -August\n31, 2024 84,642 $ 4.77 84,642 $ 9,596\nSeptember 1, 2024-\nSeptember 31, 2024 107,293 $ 4.77 107,293 $ 9,084\nTotal 191,935 191,935\n(a) Average price per share includes broker commissions.\n(b) On August 20, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a 2024 Stock Repurchase Program to repurchase up to an aggregate of $10.0 million of our common stock.\nThe Company’s officers and directors are required to comply with the Company’s securities trading policy at all times, including during a repurchase\nprogram. The securities trading policy, among other things, prohibits trading in the Company’s securities when in possession of material non-public\ninformation and restricts the ability of certain officers or director from transacting in the Company’s securities during specific blackout periods, subject to\ncertain limited exceptions, including transactions pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan that complies with the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act.\nItem 5. Other Information\n(c) Adoption or Termination of Insider Trading Arrangements\nNo directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) of the Company adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a\nnon-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (in each case, as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K) for the purchase or sale of the Company’s securities during\nthe quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n38\nItem 6.
