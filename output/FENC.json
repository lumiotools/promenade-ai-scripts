(NASDAQ:FENC; TSX: FRX), a specialty pharmaceutical company, today reported its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update.\n\n“I am pleased with the progress that we have made since recently joining Fennec in August as CEO. We are making significant headway that will position us for near-term and sustainable growth, including market expansion to the Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) community with payor reimbursement, and adoption within prominent academic centers,” said Jeff Hackman, chief executive officer of Fennec Pharmaceuticals. “Our strategic and focused investments in educational initiatives reflect the strength of the foundation we are building upon with PEDMARK. Together with the recent executive leadership team appointments combined with Fennec’s talented employee base, I believe that we are well positioned to execute, accelerate growth and unlock value across all key market segments.”\n\n**Recent Developments and Highlights:**\n\n  * **Appointed Pierre S. Sayad, PhD, M.S., as chief medical officer, Terry Evans as chief commercial officer and Christiana Cioffi, MBA, as chief strategy officer. **Seasoned biopharmaceutical industry executives with proven clinical, commercial, sales, operational, and oncology market expertise will significantly accelerate our ability to build upon and seamlessly execute our integrated commercial strategy for PEDMARK and create shareholder value. \n  * **Surpassed greater than 90% reimbursement for PEDMARK in the AYA population in Q3.** Insights from a market and situational analysis to better understand patient incidence and addressable patient populations identified significant near-and long-term opportunities across the Pediatric and AYA market segments. The opportunity for the AYA segment is significant with at least 10,000 patients treated annually with cisplatin, including primary tumors such as germ cell tumors and thyroid tumors. The incidence of ototoxicity induced by cisplatin has been estimated to be 36% of adult patients with cancer and 40%-60% of pediatric cancer patients.i\n  * **PEDMARQSI commercial launch in Europe**: Following the exclusive licensing agreement announcement executed in March with Norgine, PEDMARQSI is expected to be available in select markets in Europe in the coming months, which will generate additional revenue for Fennec in 2025 and beyond.\n  * **Investigator-initiated clinical trial (STS-J01) in Japan evaluating PEDMARK fully enrolled in October 2024: **The clinical trial of STS-J01 evaluates the efficacy and safety of PEDMARK in reducing ototoxcity induced by cisplatin in children and AYAs with localized solid tumors. The primary endpoint of the trial is to assess the frequency of hearing impairment at the end of treatment. Results of the trial are expected in 2025 with the potential evaluation for registration of PEDMARK in Japan thereafter. \n  * **Participation in Key Scientific Meetings:** During the third quarter, Fennec actively participated in key regional and national scientific meetings, including the National Community Oncology Dispensing Association (NCODA) International Fall Summit, the Testicular Cancer Awareness Foundation’s annual Conference and the Association of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Nurses (APHON) annual meeting.\n\n\n\n**Financial Results for the Third Quarter 2024**\n\n  * **Net Product Sales –** The Company recorded net product sales of $7.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to $6.5 million in net product sales for the same period in 2023. \n  * **Cash Position –** Cash and cash equivalents were $40.3 million on September 30, 2024. Cash decreased by $2.7 million over the previous quarter. The decrease in cash is the result of cash inflows from net sales offset by cash outlays for operating expenses related to the promotion of our product, selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses. We anticipate that our cash, cash equivalents and investment securities as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund our planned operations into at least 2026.\n  * **Selling and Marketing Expenses** –The Company recorded $4.6 million in selling and marketing expenses for the period ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase is largely related to additional selling and marketing expenses as the Company expanded its focus in the AYA and community oncology population during 2024.\n  * **General and Administrative (G &A) Expenses** – G&A expenses were $6.1 million compared to $3.8 million in the same period in 2023 and $6.9 million in the second quarter of 2024. The increase includes additional expenses related to non-cash equity compensation, one-time severance related to our previous CEO and ongoing IP litigation expenses. \n  * **Net Earnings –** Net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $5.7 million (basic and diluted loss of $0.21 per share) compared to a net loss of $1.9 million (basic and diluted loss of $0.07 per share) for the same period in 2023.\n\n\n\n**Q3 2024 Conference Call Information****Date:** Thursday, November 7, 2024**Time:** 8:30 a.m. ET**Link:** <https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/e6my278s>\n\nTo access the conference call, dial 888-596-4144 or 646-968-2525 internationally and referencing the conference access ID: 6896851.

Unfortunately, platinum-based therapies can cause ototoxicity, or hearing loss, which is permanent, irreversible, and particularly harmful to the survivors of pediatric cancer.ii\n\nThe incidence of ototoxicity depends upon the dose and duration of chemotherapy, and many of these children require lifelong hearing aids or cochlear implants, which can be helpful for some, but do not reverse the hearing loss and can be costly over time.iii Infants and young children that are affected by ototoxicity at critical stages of development lack speech and language development and literacy, and older children and adolescents often lack social-emotional development and educational achievement.iv\n\n**PEDMARK****®****(sodium thiosulfate injection)** PEDMARK® is the first and only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved therapy indicated to reduce the risk of ototoxicity associated with cisplatin treatment in pediatric patients with localized, non-metastatic, solid tumors. It is a unique formulation of sodium thiosulfate in single-dose, ready-to-use vials for intravenous use in pediatric patients. PEDMARK is also the first and only therapeutic agent with proven efficacy and safety data with an established dosing regimen, across two open-label, randomized Phase 3 clinical studies, the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) Protocol ACCL0431 and SIOPEL 6.\n\nIn the U.S. and Europe, it is estimated that, annually, more than 10,000 children may receive platinum-based chemotherapy. The incidence of ototoxicity depends upon the dose and duration of chemotherapy, and many of these children require lifelong hearing aids. There is currently no established preventive agent for this hearing loss and only expensive, technically difficult, and sub-optimal cochlear (inner ear) implants have been shown to provide some benefit. Infants and young children that suffer ototoxicity at critical stages of development lack speech language development and literacy, and older children and adolescents lack social-emotional development and educational achievement.\n\nPEDMARK has been studied by co-operative groups in two Phase 3 clinical studies of survival and reduction of ototoxicity, COG ACCL0431 and SIOPEL 6. Both studies have been completed. The COG ACCL0431 protocol enrolled childhood cancers typically treated with intensive cisplatin therapy for localized and disseminated disease, including newly diagnosed hepatoblastoma, germ cell tumor, osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, and other solid tumors. SIOPEL 6 enrolled only hepatoblastoma patients with localized tumors.\n\n**Indications and Usage** PEDMARK® (sodium thiosulfate injection) is indicated to reduce the risk of ototoxicity associated with cisplatin in pediatric patients 1 month of age and older with localized, non-metastatic solid tumors.\n\n**Limitations of Use** The safety and efficacy of PEDMARK have not been established when administered following cisplatin infusions longer than 6 hours. PEDMARK may not reduce the risk of ototoxicity when administered following longer cisplatin infusions, because irreversible ototoxicity may have already occurred.\n\n**Important Safety Information** PEDMARK is contraindicated in patients with history of a severe hypersensitivity to sodium thiosulfate or any of its components.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions occurred in 8% to 13% of patients in clinical trials. Monitor patients for hypersensitivity reactions. Immediately discontinue PEDMARK and institute appropriate care if a hypersensitivity reaction occurs. Administer antihistamines or glucocorticoids (if appropriate) before each subsequent administration of PEDMARK. PEDMARK may contain sodium sulfite; patients with sulfite sensitivity may have hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or severe asthma episodes. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in people with asthma.\n\nPEDMARK is not indicated for use in pediatric patients less than 1 month of age due to the increased risk of hypernatremia or in pediatric patients with metastatic cancers.\n\nHypernatremia occurred in 12% to 26% of patients in clinical trials, including a single Grade 3 case. Hypokalemia occurred in 15% to 27% of patients in clinical trials, with Grade 3 or 4 occurring in 9% to 27% of patients. Monitor serum sodium and potassium levels at baseline and as clinically indicated. Withhold PEDMARK in patients with baseline serum sodium greater than 145 mmol/L.\n\nMonitor for signs and symptoms of hypernatremia and hypokalemia more closely if the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls below 60 mL/min/1.73m2.\n\nAdminister antiemetics prior to each PEDMARK administration. Provide additional antiemetics and supportive care as appropriate.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (≥25% with difference between arms of >5% compared to cisplatin alone) in SIOPEL 6 were vomiting, nausea, decreased hemoglobin, and hypernatremia. The most common adverse reaction (≥25% with difference between arms of >5% compared to cisplatin alone) in COG ACCL0431 was hypokalemia.\n\nPlease see full Prescribing Information for PEDMARK® at: [www.PEDMARK.com](https://pedmark.com/pedmark-pi/).\n\n**About Fennec Pharmaceuticals** Fennec Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of PEDMARK® to reduce the risk of platinum-induced ototoxicity in pediatric patients.
