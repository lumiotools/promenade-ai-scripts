(Nasdaq: TMC) (“TMC” or “the Company”), an explorer of lower-impact battery metals from seafloor polymetallic nodules, today provided a corporate update and financial results for the third quarter ending September 30, 2024.\n\n**Q3 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Current liquidity available from our cash on hand and our credit facilities of approximately $63 million as of date of filing\n  * Borrowing capacity of our unsecured credit facilities increased by $10.5 million as of date of filing:\n    * ERAS/Barron facility increased from $25 million to $38 million ($33.8 million available), and;\n    * Allseas Group SA affiliate facility reduced from $27.5 million to $25.0 million (undrawn)\n  * $5.7 million cash used in operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024\n  * Net loss of $20.5 million and net loss per share of $0.06 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024\n\n\n\n**Registered Direct Offering**\n\n  * Registered Direct Offering resulting in expected minimum gross proceeds of $17.5 million through equity issuance at $1.00 per share\n  * The Registered Direct Offering is led by TMC’s largest non-affiliate institutional shareholder\n  * The transaction includes warrant coverage of 50% (1 warrant for every 2 common shares purchased) with a warrant strike price of $2.00 per share\n  * Warrants contain a call provision which forces exercise if the 30-day volume weighted-average price (“VWAP”) of TMC common stock exceeds $5.00\n\n\n\nGerard Barron, Chairman & CEO of The Metals Company commented: “This week we announced June 27, 2025, as the date for NORI to submit its exploitation application to the ISA. This decision, made in close consultation with NORI’s Sponsoring State Nauru, represents years of preparation, backed by the largest dataset ever collected on the deep sea in international waters. We’re excited to share our application with the ISA and stakeholders and recognize the responsibility that comes with submitting the world’s first application of this kind.\n\nAfter years of conversations with shareholders, it’s clear that the delivery of the Mining Code by the ISA is viewed as a key catalyst for TMC. Recent discussions with Member States and the incoming ISA Secretary-General give me confidence that there is no change in the ISA’s commitment to deliver on its mandate. But until we have sufficient regulatory progress—whether through delivery of the Mining Code or clarity on the ISA’s application review process—investors can rest assured we won’t be raising funds for CAPEX for the Hidden Gem production system upgrades.\n\nWhile getting the NORI-D Project permitted and into production has been our strong focus, TMC’s value goes beyond our first project. With over half a billion dollars invested over the past decade in building our project development capabilities in deepsea minerals, we’re well-positioned to capitalize on new opportunities as the world’s major economies turn to the seafloor for metals essential to the energy transition, defense, infrastructure, and a growing global population. I look forward to sharing more on how we plan to capitalize on this shift.\n\nIn the meantime, we’re watching promising momentum in Washington, with several initiatives expected to gain traction post-election. One of Washington’s strongest nodule resource development supporters, Rep. Elise Stefanik, has been tapped as UN Ambassador, and Marco Rubio, another key supporter, is set to become Secretary of State, which oversees the ISA file. We anticipate the Pentagon’s long-awaited report on nodules to be released soon, and we’re encouraged by the increased U.S. interest in the ISA’s work. The world is moving toward responsible development of seafloor metals—and TMC retains its substantial lead in this industry.”\n\n**Operational Highlights****November 14, 2024 Registered Direct Offering** $17.5 million minimum amount raised through a registered direct offering, led by TMC's largest non-affiliate institutional shareholder. Shares were issued at $1.00 per share, with half warrant at $2.00 per share expiring in 5 years.\n\n**Application Submission and Strategy** NORI has set the date of June 27, 2025 for its expected submission of its ISA exploitation application. According to the ISA Council's decisions [ISBA/28/C/24](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Gd1BKaTyDgUyjRGnWt_uvbGJDPMysKJlPu9v118e1UNfIEiV5S6ob-lJbxAZ7gpXdxVk_u-HrZqk38DbxlKED2Vprp7IXWXx10WkeRVRMX-1tpcVcTYudFxooCu-SbjW) and [ISBA/28/C/25](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Gd1BKaTyDgUyjRGnWt_uvYe1o1M0o99kCy0uEDCuDsK5zRYaSShS7cj6SL8ixTktn0MIiUWXufUUXdzDA9NqklrInU-ia4WwBzGvV8MgsUkOoVQ7bqkA-n8xMz0MOGop), if NORI submits an application for a plan of work for exploitation before the RRPs have been adopted, the ISA Council at its next meeting, as a matter of priority, will consider the process for considering such an application. The ISA Council is not scheduled to meet again until March 2025 and the Company believes it is unlikely that the ISA Council would consider an application for a plan of work for exploitation before this session. In light of this, Nauru has formally requested that the ISA clarify the submission and review process for such an application at the March 2025 meetings before NORI submits the Application and, therefore, has decided to submit the Application after the March 2025 meetings on June 27, 2025.\n\n**Operating Expense Reductions and Deferral of Capital Expenditures** Following the expected submission of the Application by NORI, the Company expects quarterly cash use of less than $5 million as the Application is reviewed. The Company has already begun the process of reducing or eliminating certain operating expenses to ensure the Company’s financial resiliency. Further, the Company does not expect to raise funds for capital expenditures related to the preparation of the Hidden Gem vessel for commercial production until such time as the final Mining Code is adopted, the Application is approved, or until other potential non-dilutive strategic financing is in place. The Company expects to provide further updates on the potential timing of the start of commercial production following sufficient clarity on these items.\n\n**Expanded Company Strategy** Given the significant rise in seafloor resource exploration opportunities around the globe and the Company’s leadership position and experience in this industry, having invested over $500 million since inception to achieve milestones in environmental research, resource definition, test mining and test processing, the Company is exploring a new strategy to (1) develop a services business for seafloor resource development and (2) optimize and diversify its resource portfolio within international waters and in national jurisdictions. We are in discussions with several parties on services contracts to provide our expertise in the areas of new exploration plans of work, resource definition, environmental impact assessments, data management and offshore campaign execution. We are also actively evaluating opportunities for the Company to enter new exploration contract areas, already permitted properties and producing properties.\n\n**Global stakeholder webinar on NORI’s Cultural Heritage Impact Assessment:** In September, TMC subsidiary NORI held a webinar with its technical expert, SEARCH Inc. to provide an update on its Cultural Heritage Impact Assessment (CHIA) for the NORI-D polymetallic nodule project in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone in international waters. NORI reported on its baselining work and recent consultations in Nauru and Tonga, both of which form components of the cultural heritage assessment being studied as part of the NORI-D Project.\n\n**Industry Update**\n\n**Progress on ISA Mining Code:** Council completed a first reading of the consolidated text of the draft regulations on exploitation of mineral resources in the Area, at the July 2024 Council meeting. It was agreed that a revised consolidated text would be provided by the end of November 2024. TMC has engaged with Secretary-General-Elect Carvalho and expects to work with her in a constructive manner as the ISA continues to work to have the final Mining Code adopted.\n\n**TMC CEO Testifies to U.S. House of Representatives on Benefits of Nodules:** In September, TMC CEO Gerard Barron gave testimony during a meeting of the Critical Mineral Policy Working Group for the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party to discuss the U.S.’ heavy reliance on Chinese imports of critical minerals and policy solutions to incentivise greater cooperation with allies to create alternative supplies. Mr Barron spoke to the potential of seafloor nodules to secure U.S. supplies of key minerals for the energy transition and defence sectors.\n\n**Financial Results Overview** At September 30, 2024, we held cash of approximately $0.4 million and short-term debt of $9.2 million, with an affiliate of Allseas Group SA ($5 million) and with the Barron/ERAS unsecured credit facility ($4.2 million). We believe that our total liquidity including cash, the committed proceeds from our latest financing and borrowing availability under our credit facility with ERAS Capital LLC and Mr. Barron, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure commitments for at least the next twelve months from today.\n\nWe reported a net loss of approximately $20.5 million, or $0.06 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net loss of $12.5 million, or $0.04 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Exploration and evaluation expenses during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $11.8 million compared to $7.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the exploration and evaluation expenses in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation of $1.8 million due to the amortization of the fair value of RSUs and options granted to the directors and officers in the second quarter of 2024, increase in mining, technological and process development of $1.0 million resulting from increased engineering work by Allseas and higher personnel costs of $1.0 million.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $8.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to $4.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, reflecting an increase in share-based compensation of $1.8 million due to the amortization of the fair value of RSUs and options granted to the directors and officers in the second quarter of 2024, an increase in legal and consulting costs of $1.0 million and higher personnel costs of $0.5 million.\n\n**Conference Call** We will hold a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. EDT to provide an update on recent corporate developments, third quarter 2024 financial results and upcoming milestones.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Conference Call Details**  \n---  \nDate:| Thursday, November 14, 2024  \nTime:| 4:30 pm EDT  \nAudio-only Dial-in:| [Register Here](https://register.vevent.com/register/BIbff74087ffd64a0584a63add4c90fc5b)  \nVirtual webcast w/ slides:| [Register Here](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/gvdq8oyq/)  \n  \nPlease register with the links above at least ten minutes prior to the conference call.

(Nasdaq: TMC) (“TMC” or “the Company”), an explorer of lower-impact battery metals from seafloor polymetallic nodules, today provided a corporate update on the expected submission date of the application to the ISA for an exploitation contract, and an expanded company strategy.\n\n**Update Highlights:**\n\n  * Following discussions between TMC subsidiary Nauru Ocean Resources Inc (NORI) and its sponsoring state, the Republic of Nauru, NORI has set the date of June 27, 2025 for the expected submission of its ISA exploitation application\n  * Given it is unlikely the ISA would consider an application prior to its March 2025 session, the Republic of Nauru has requested in a formal letter that the ISA clarify the submission and review process during the March session, with the goal of providing certainty for all stakeholders and allowing for review to begin immediately after NORI’s submission under an agreed-upon process\n  * Following the expected submission of NORI’s application, the Company expects quarterly cash use of less than $5 million as the application is reviewed, and does not expect to raise funds for capital expenditures relating to the preparation of the Hidden Gem vessel for commercial production until increased regulatory certainty is achieved or non-dilutive financing is secured\n  * The Company has begun to explore a new strategy to (1) develop a services business for seafloor resource development and (2) optimize and diversify its resource portfolio within international waters and in certain national jurisdictions\n\n\n\nGerard Barron, TMC Chairman and CEO, commented: “After many years of conversations with current and prospective shareholders, it remains clear that the key catalyst everyone is waiting for is the delivery of the Mining Code. Following discussions with Member States and the incoming ISA Secretary-General during the UN General Assembly in September, I remain confident that the work on the Mining Code remains on track. These discussions have also informed the decision to submit the NORI application in June 2025, in consultation with Nauru. Investors can be assured that we will not be raising funds for CAPEX related to the Hidden Gem vessel until we see sufficient regulatory progress, whether through delivery of the Mining Code or additional clarity on the ISA’s review of our application based on the draft regulations.\n\nBut TMC’s value proposition extends beyond a narrow focus on the Mining Code and NORI application. We are now in a strong position to leverage our investment of over half a billion dollars and capabilities developed over the last decade-plus, as the eyes of the world’s largest economies turn to the seafloor to produce the metals needed for the energy transition, defense, infrastructure and the needs of a growing world population. I look forward to providing further color on this strategy.”\n\n**Application Submission and Strategy** NORI has set the date of June 27, 2025 for its expected submission of its ISA exploitation application. According to the ISA Council's decisions [ISBA/28/C/24](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=dD6tp054mC8e-LSdphZcTOTYr-mGqksnh8IiGyoxqHQRg1pUVfogXU8zCzrLi7AEY3OzYyMxqc1nabs5hcv5phMKwvNMTPgqEDmet4S9MLa860yhtiCSJu9pFkGKQVqJ) and [ISBA/28/C/25](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=dD6tp054mC8e-LSdphZcTDYtj2GgfRn1QIJv5SmNz_F3Qum9JXgGGjPzaAA5vTnZIY5t49EaVtaeM-EWJGADGLXh9bfX_nel0nHIEo-vzHdVE8vctOEiO10LdZ4vqQKl), if NORI submits an application for a plan of work for exploitation before the RRPs have been adopted, the ISA Council at its next meeting, as a matter of priority, will consider the process for considering such an application. The ISA Council is not scheduled to meet again until March 2025 and the Company believes it is unlikely that the ISA Council would consider an application for a plan of work for exploitation before this session. In light of this, Nauru has formally requested that the ISA clarify the submission and review process for such an application at the March 2025 meetings before NORI submits the Application and, therefore, has decided to submit the Application after the March 2025 meetings on June 27, 2025.\n\n**ISA Progress on the Mining Code** The ISA Council completed a first reading of the consolidated text of the draft Mining Code at the July 2024 Council meeting. It was agreed that a revised consolidated text of the draft Mining Code would be provided to the ISA Council by the end of November 2024. The Company has engaged with Leticia Reis de Carvalho, the newly-elected Secretary General of the ISA, and expects to work with Ms. Carvalho in a constructive manner as the ISA continues to work to have the final Mining Code adopted.\n\n**Operating Expense Reductions and Deferral of Capital Expenditures** Following the expected submission of the Application by NORI, the Company expects quarterly cash use of less than $5 million as the Application is reviewed. The Company has already begun the process of reducing or eliminating certain operating expenses to ensure the Company’s financial resiliency.\n\nFurther, the Company does not expect to raise funds for capital expenditures related to the preparation of the Hidden Gem vessel for commercial production until such time as the final Mining Code is adopted, the Application is approved, or until other potential non-dilutive strategic financing is in place. The Company expects to provide further updates on the potential timing of the start of commercial production following sufficient clarity on these items.\n\n**Expanded Company Strategy** Given the significant rise in seafloor resource exploration opportunities around the globe and the Company’s leadership position and experience in this industry, having invested over $500 million since inception to achieve milestones in environmental research, resource definition, test mining and test processing, the Company is exploring a new strategy to (1) develop a services business for seafloor resource development and (2) optimize and diversify its resource portfolio within international waters and in national jurisdictions. We are in discussions with several parties on services contracts to provide our expertise in the areas of new exploration plans of work, resource definition, environmental impact assessments, data management and offshore campaign execution. We are also actively evaluating opportunities for the Company to enter new exploration contract areas, already permitted properties and producing properties.\n\n**About The Metals Company** The Metals Company is an explorer of lower-impact battery metals from seafloor polymetallic nodules, on a dual mission: (1) supply metals for the global energy transition with the least possible negative impacts on planet and people and (2) trace, recover and recycle the metals we supply to help create a metal commons that can be used in perpetuity. The Company through its subsidiaries holds exploration and commercial rights to three polymetallic nodule contract areas in the Clarion Clipperton Zone of the Pacific Ocean regulated by the International Seabed Authority and sponsored by the governments of Nauru, Kiribati and the Kingdom of Tonga.
