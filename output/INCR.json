We had the opportunity to sit down with Chris Mayer, the man behind _100 Baggers_ , to uncover the key drivers behind long-term shareholder value. He shares insights on one of his current holdings, the power of reinvestment, why patience might be your most valuable asset, and the most common mistakes investors make.\n\n**Hi Chris, we'd love to start by learning more about your journey. Could you start by briefly telling our readers a little about yourself and your background?**\n\nSure. I run Woodlock House Family Capital, which is a long-only hedge fund with about $200 million in assets under management. We opened our doors in January 2019 with $25 million in seed money from the Bonner family. I run a concentrated portfolio, 11 names. We look to get to know our businesses well and keep for a long time.\n\nBut maybe I should back up a bit and say how I got here. I studied finance in college. I started in corporate banking in 1994 as a credit analyst. The bank had a program where they would pay for your MBA based on your grades. I don't remember the scale exactly, but if you got A's you got 100% reimbursed. Needless to say, I was a good student.\n\nIn a few years I became a corporate loan officer. It was a great place to begin, because you really study businesses from the ground up, getting into the weeds with, for example, field audits where you test accounts receivable and things like that. There is a laser focus on free cash flow and ability to repay your loan. You get to know management. You think about business values. It's good training for a future investor.\n\nAnyway, I was good at that and enjoyed it, but had a passion for investing in equities and writing. I edited a newsletter at the bank, which I started and which we sent to our best customers. It included my thoughts on the markets and things like book reviews and even interviews.\n\nEventually, in 2004, I started my own newsletter focused on investing in the stock market. I would print out copies and mail them. My wife and I would stuff envelopes at the kitchen table. I think I had about 150 subscribers six months in. And then I made a deal with Agora in Baltimore to publish and market it.\n\nSo, I was able to take a nights-and-weekend hobby and turn it into a full-time gig. I had a model portfolio of recommended stocks that I tracked for subscribers. That was a lot of fun, writing that letter. I traveled all over the world – even to some out of the way places like Mongolia, Myanmar… all through Asia really, South America, the South Pacific. I would write to my subscribers about my adventures. I was like the Anthony Bourdain of finance, looking for cool ideas in odd places, meeting interesting characters and just trying to figure out how the world worked. It was great.\n\nBut there was this pull to manage money. Because I had a good track record, I had several offers to manage money but it was never the right fit. But in 2016, I had the chance to work with the Bonner family office. The Bonner family was my publisher and the majority owner of Agora. They are wonderful partners. So I did that and had good success in a short time, but eventually that led to starting Woodlock House with the Bonner family seed money. So here I am.\n\n**What first drew you into the world of investing, and how has your philosophy evolved over the years?**\n\nWell, I grew up in a financial family, you could say. My dad worked for GEICO for a long time and met [Warren Buffett](/insights/investment-strategy/warren-buffett-the-oracle-of-omaha-s-road-to-success) and I heard all the stories, such as when Buffett met with Lorimer Davidson on a Saturday morning and so on. And my mom was a banker.\n\nWe had a subscription to Fortune Magazine and I remember reading about Buffett there. And my dad always had business books around. I remember reading things like Ray Kroc's book on McDonald's and Barbarians at the Gate and [Sam Walton's ](/insights/business-philosophy/sam-walton-building-walmart)Made in America. I also remember the crash of '87 being something that drew my interest in this thing called the stock market where people seemed to make and lose fortunes. All seemed very exciting and I wanted to learn more.\n\nSo, naturally I started with Buffett, the most famous investor. And I learned he had a teacher, [Ben Graham](/insights/investment-strategy/benjamin-graham-the-father-of-value-investing). That led to Security Analysis. I have a distinct memory of holding that fat book as a late teen and not understanding much of it at all, but thinking it was a magical book, a wizard’s book that showed the secrets of how to make a lot of money. I was determined to understand it.\n\nAs for how my views evolved, I started in that early Buffett / Ben Graham sort of way. And Marty Whitman was a big influence. And [Peter Lynch](/insights/investment-strategy/get-to-know-peter-lynch). And [Greenblatt's](/insights/investment-strategy/joel-greenblatt-the-magic-of-value-investing) book, You Can Be a Stock Market Genius. And the usual greats. But over time, I evolved to become more like [Munger](/insights/investment-strategy/the-extraordinary-life-of-charlie-munger), looking for quality that you own for a long time.\n\nWhen I wrote _100 Baggers_ , doing that work was kind of an epiphany itself. I learned a lot doing that work. And I got to meet and spend time with [Chuck Akre](/insights/investment-strategy/chuck-akre-above-average-returns-and-a-legendary-framework). I'd say the way I invest these days is most aligned with the way Chuck thinks about investing. He's had a big influence on me.\n\n**Outside of the financial world, what are some of your biggest passions or hobbies?**\n\nI like to read. I have a home library full of philosophical books. It's my happy place. But beyond that, I love to play golf. I live right across the street from a golf course. And there are six golf courses within 20 minutes of my house. I also like to cook. My wife and I experiment all the time with New York Times recipes. I like to go for hikes. I enjoy traveling.\n\n**What key traits did you find most common among companies that achieved 100-bagger status?**\n\nBig growth. Maybe obvious, but almost all of these 100 baggers become substantially bigger businesses over time. Of course, you can't just have growth. And that gets to the key feature – which is a high return on capital, earned repeatedly over a long period of time.\n\nThink about it conceptually: If you start with $10,000 and earn 20% on that in year 1, then you have $2,000 in profit. If you can reinvest the $2,000 then you have $12,000 invested for year two. Another 20% in year two takes you to $14,400. You do that for 25 years, you have your 100-bagger.\n\nObviously, I'm vastly simplifying. There are taxes and other things to consider here. But it gives you your north star. Everything should be analyzed in this framework: compounding capital for a long time. And so, if you do think like this, you will find your focus shifts to things like competition and capital allocation. Meanwhile, other factors most investors slave over – like the present multiple of earnings or cash flow – tend to take a back seat.\n\nAnother important factor was that many of the 100 baggers had talented entrepreneurs driving them at least in the early days. It's easy to see this when you just look at many of the names and can readily identify the entrepreneur. [Apple](/insights/company-research/apple-from-garage-upstart-to-global-giant) and Steve Jobs. [Wal-Mart](/insights/company-research/walmart-walton-retailing-and-everyday-low-prices) and Sam Walton. [Charles Schwab](/companies/the-charles-schwab-corporation_4480) and, well, Charles Schwab. The list goes on.\n\n**Which of these traits do you believe are most underappreciated by investors?**\n\nI think reinvestment is most underappreciated. Even investors who get the idea of investing in quality companies and owning them for a long time miss the reinvestment aspect, or don't fully appreciate how important it is over a long period of time. And so they own companies that are high quality in many respects but that pay out big dividends, for example.\n\nThere is a place for dividends, of course, but if you are focusing on 100 baggers, then a dividend is, in the words of Thomas Phelps, \"an expensive luxury.\" It is a leak in your boat that slows the compounding process.\n\n[![Chris Mayer and his book 100 Baggers](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/969x834/2f8d919856/chris_mayer_100_baggers.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality\\(85\\))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/969x834/2f8d919856/chris_mayer_100_baggers.png)\n\nChris Mayer next to one of his large bookcases, displaying his book 100 Baggers.\n\n[![Chris Mayer and his book 100 Baggers](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/969x834/2f8d919856/chris_mayer_100_baggers.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality\\(85\\))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/969x834/2f8d919856/chris_mayer_100_baggers.png)\n\nChris Mayer next to one of his large bookcases, displaying his book 100 Baggers.\n\n**You discuss 'founder-led' companies in your book. Can you elaborate on why founder involvement is such a powerful predictor of high returns?**\n\n_\"Founders tend to think long-term and are opportunistic, whereas hired hands often fall for the quarterly earnings game and give guidance and stuff like that.\"_\n\nIt is hard to quantify. We see the output – those examples of super successful companies led by a founder, but the input, the exact process that leads to that output, is a mix of anecdotal evidence.\n\nIntuitively, an entrepreneur is someone who has a passion for the business, has vision and pushes it in a way a hired hand usually doesn't. Founders tend to think long-term and are opportunistic, whereas hired hands often fall for the quarterly earnings game and give guidance and stuff like that... Anecdotally, a founder-led company is more likely to not even have an earnings call. I think of [Constellation Software](/insights/company-research/constellation-software-acquiring-and-empowering). Or [Berkshire](/companies/berkshire-hathaway-inc_3476), for that matter.\n\nFrom my own experience, I also notice little things that founder led companies do. How they travel. Where they live. What their office space looks like. Are founder-led companies more cost-conscious? Does this add incrementally to their advantage? I can't prove it, but I suspect so.\n\n**Do you think it's harder to find 100 baggers in today's market, given the rise of information accessibility and trading technology?**\n\nNot really because there is a great deal of judgment involved. It's not a quantitative exercise. It has a quantitative element. But you have to think deeply about a company's competitive advantage and whether it is something that can go the distance – you need 20 to 25 years of high performance; that was the time frame for the bulk of the 100 baggers in the study, though of course some did it in less time and some took longer.\n\nSecond, it's not just about finding them. You have to hold on a long time, through ups and downs, through long stretches where the stock goes nowhere. And all the while you are assaulted with new ideas, people telling you to buy this, sell that, the drumbeat of economic data and other noise. The bigger challenge may not be finding a business that becomes a 100 bagger. The bigger challenge may be holding on to it.\n\n**How does your other book,****_How Do You Know?_****, differ from**** _100 Baggers_****? And if you had to pick just one takeaway from**** _How Do You Know?_****, what would you say is the most important lesson or insight?**\n\nIt's totally different, much more philosophical than focused on the nuts and bolts of investing. It's based on the ideas of Alfred Korzybski, one of my favorite thinkers, who created a discipline called general semantics. You can think of it as a mental model, a valuable aid to critical thinking. There hasn't been a book applying general semantics to investing since 1958. So in writing this book, I'm bringing back some needed arcana.\n\nOne takeaway? I dislike trying to compress such a rich set of ideas into a soundbite. But to play along, I'll say one big insight comes from an adage Korzybski popularized, which is \"the map is not the territory.\"\n\nHow we use labels, for example, while handy, can blind us to what's really going on. When we call a stock a \"small cap\" – what are we really saying? What use is such a term?\n\nSo people think \"small caps\" have bigger opportunities to grow than \"large caps.\" But in reality a company with a $600 million market that has saturated its market may have much less upside than a $20 billion market cap company with a gigantic global opportunity in front of it. So to \"focus on small caps\" is a needless self-defeating proposition that has nothing to do with the compounding we talked about earlier.\n\n\"Market caps\" as a category are created to sell funds, but otherwise have no relevance to the art of investing itself. Neither do labels like \"growth stock\" or \"value investing.\" There are so many useless terms floating around. But anyway, getting to know a bit of Korzybski’s work will help clean up your linguistic hygiene.\n\n**How much emphasis do you place on traditional financial metrics versus qualitative factors like culture and leadership?**\n\nI like to say the quantitative stuff is the baseline. It's where I start. I want to see those high returns on capital, for example. There are financial metrics that have to be there. But the qualitative stuff is more important, especially as a long-term owner of businesses. I don't care how good the numbers are if these things are missing.\n\n**When it comes to knowing when to sell, what are the red flags or criteria you follow to make those decisions confidently?**\n\nWhen to sell is a reversal of the process that got you to buy in the first place. So for me, high returns on capital and reinvestment are initially part of the thesis, when those become threatened, it is time to go.\n\nEasy to say, hard in practice. Nobody is really a good seller. We all have great exits, of course. But if you're in this business long enough, especially if you are generally buying good businesses, you're going to look up what you sold some day and be astonished at how foolish you were. And those kinds of mistakes are invisible to most but the costs are huge.\n\nAs for red flags, I'd say a general guide would be if management strays from the playbook. If they tell you they won't ever issue stock to do an acquisition and then they do it, it's probably time to go. Keep an eye on competition. Loss of market share is a big red flag.\n\n**What qualities in a business are most predictive of exceptional long-term value creation?**\n\nIt seems to me having a defendable competitive position is number one. Those high returns are no good if a competitor can come along and grind that down. There are many ingredients that go into understanding a competitive advantage, which go beyond what we can cover here. But there are lots of books and articles out there.\n\n**What do you think the most common mistakes are among investors?**\n\n_\"Every investment really has a handful of things that are really critical. Everything else is noise.\"_\n\nPaying attention to things that don't matter. That's easily the biggest mistake. What doesn't matter? What the Fed might do. What the economy might do. What the latest guru says about the market's valuation. What interest rates might do. What's going to happen next quarter. Politics. The list is long. These things are unpredictable and not worth spending time on.\n\nThe other big mistake is weighing way too heavily things that are happening now. It's funny, I keep an investment journal. And I keep good notes on companies I'm invested in. I comment on the quarterly reports and such. And looking back on these notes is always enlightening. Because I can clearly see how so little of the details mattered. The concerns of the day dissolve into nothingness over a period of years. And yet they seemed so important at the time.\n\nEvery investment really has a handful of things that are really critical. Everything else is noise. The job of the investor is to find out what those key things are. And stay focused on those things.\n\n**Can you give us an example of a company you found an especially compelling investment opportunity, and what specific characteristics drew you to it?**\n\nOne stock I bought recently is [Computer Modelling Group](/companies/computer-modelling-group-ltd_15909), listed in Canada. There is a certain [Constellation Software](/insights/company-research/constellation-software-acquiring-and-empowering) influence here; Mark Miller is chairman of the board. The largest shareholder is a Constellation board member. And the head of acquisitions is an ex-CSI guy. The CEO, Pramod Jain, gets it.\n\nEarly in 2024 they adopted CSI-style compensation, which rewards ROIC + growth and requires part of the bonus to purchase shares in the open market. I love all of this. And then you have a steady, high-return, cash-spinning, moaty software business at the core. They've got lots of room to deploy capital in a big market and grow.\n\nOne negative is the dividend. But I'd expect them to cut or do away with the dividend entirely at some point as they ramp up their M&A program. They've only done two so far. The stock sold off heavily after a soft quarter in November, which is a gift for the longer-term shareholders.\n\nSo, yeah, this one has the whole package – great incentives, great team, great balance sheet, high returns, lots of room to deploy capital – and now, because of the selloff, a very good valuation to boot. I even like the boring, non-promotional name. It's a sleep-well-at-night investment for me and I expect to own shares for a long time.\n\n**Reflecting on your own career and experiences, what would you consider your biggest investment mistake, and what did it teach you?**\n\nI don't know my biggest investment mistake. I guess, looking back on it, all that time I spent looking for cheap stocks and flipping them when they no longer looked cheap. I'd be much richer if instead of looking doing that, I invested in companies I could own for two decades.\n\nI remember in the 2008 crisis getting excited about net-nets. I don't own any of them today. And, I didn't own them for very long, period. I'd have been better off if I just bought [Mastercard and Visa](/insights/company-research/visa-and-mastercard-the-global-payment-duopoly) and left them alone. Or [Copart](/insights/company-research/the-rise-of-copart-from-salvage-yard-to-tech-giant). Or [Heico](/companies/heico-corporation_10968). Or [Constellation Software](/insights/company-research/constellation-software-acquiring-and-empowering). It's a long list, actually.\n\nAnyway, what they taught, what they seared into my memory, is the power of leaving the stocks of good companies alone. And to do that, you need to tune out a lot of noise as I've mentioned.\n\n**For investors starting out today, what practical advice would you give to help them identify high-potential, long-term investments?**\n\nStudy great businesses. Really, learn what makes them tick. Why have they been so successful? Then, ideally, you'd look for smaller, younger versions of those companies. Study what you're interested in. And happy hunting.\n\nThere is no easy way to do this. It's like I can just give you a checklist of five bullets and say \"here you go, find companies that have these.\" There is more nuance to the whole thing. We've talked about a lot of the guardrails, the key things you want to look for.\n\n**Investing requires both mental discipline and emotional resilience. What habits or practices help you stay balanced and focused?**\n\n_\"All of these distractions will make it seem like something important is happening every day. When, most of the time, the opposite is true.\"_\n\nNumber one is be careful what you put your attention on. Don't even let the noise in your field of vision if you can help it. Never watch financial coverage on TV. Forget about reading the daily financial news. Forget about the economic indicators – like the CPI or whatever.\n\nThose things are distractions. And they will work on your mind, in ways you don't necessarily see or feel. All of these distractions will make it seem like something important is happening every day. When, most of the time, the opposite is true.\n\nYou have to cultivate that long-term mentality and to do that means screening out a lot of noise. Once you do that, it's easier to not get emotional. Social media is a double-edged sword. I've made some good contacts on X, but it's also full of people who don't know what they're talking about.\n\nKeep your own counsel, do your own work – and have confidence in your own work – and you will also build conviction naturally, along with that mental discipline and emotional resilience.\n\n**If you were to write a follow-up to**** _100 Baggers_****today, what new insights or modifications would you add to the book?**\n\nI've said this before, but I'd modify the part where I tell people to look at companies with market caps of less than $1 billion. I'd say to focus on the engines of compounding, as we've talked about, and not worry so much if the market cap is $1 billion or $10 billion.\n\nSecond, I'd add a chapter on serial acquirers. I don't like the name, but it seems to have stuck. Serial acquirers grow mainly through acquisitions. And I think there is, still, a wide misperception that acquisitive companies are \"bad.\" But it's proven a very good model. Constellation Software is one we mentioned. But there are others.\n\n**Finally, if you could recommend one book (besides your own!) or source of inspiration that has had a profound impact on your life, what would it be and why?**\n\nWell, as far as my investing life, I'd say _100 to 1 in the Stock Market_ by Thomas Phelps. Because that set me on the path to write _100 Baggers_ and led to a profound change in how I think about investing. Otherwise, it is hard to say because many books have had a big impact on me at different points in time, nudging me this way or that, but I don't think of all these books as particularly important today, if you know what I mean.\n\nStill, if I had to name one, I'd say Alfred Korzybski's _Science and Sanity_ , originally published in 1933. Because Korzybki's ideas changed how I view the world forever. There are not many books you can say that about. I wrote two books around his ideas! And today I serve as a trustee for the Institute of General Semantics, which he founded. There isn't a day that goes by where I don't use something that Korzybski taught.\n\nHaving said that, _Science and Sanity_ is a difficult book.

It's one of the most impressive business stories of the last decade, achieving a revenue growth CAGR of 49% from its IPO in 2015 to 2023, with an EBIT margin north of 60%. Let's trace the steps, strategy, and innovative spark that have crowned Evolution as the reigning kingmaker in the gambling world.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n  * **From startup to giant:** Evolution transformed from a small Latvian studio into a near-monopoly in live casino and one of Sweden's largest companies by market cap in less than 20 years.\n\n  * **Financials few can match:** With a 49% CAGR since its 2015 IPO and 60%+ EBIT margins, Evolution's meteoric rise is almost unheard of.\n\n  * **Best-in-class ROIC:** Savvy business moves, like co-funding studios with clients, have driven a remarkable ROIC often exceeding 100%.\n\n  * **Relentless player focus:** Chief Product Officer Todd Haushalter credits Evolution's success to a \"relentless focus on the player,\" shaping every game and experience since 2015.\n\n  * **Still room for growth:** The U.S. market is beginning to legalize online gambling on a state-by-state basis, unlocking a vast and largely untapped opportunity.\n\n\n\n\nThis article was written in collaboration with Speedwell Research and draws on their [74-page research report](https://speedwellresearch.com/2023/12/19/evolution/).\n\n## Evolution's Remarkable Journey\n\nOur story begins with two childhood friends, far from the casino floors of Monte Carlo or the flash of Las Vegas, brainstorming about how to revolutionize an industry most saw as mature and set in its ways. It was 2006, and Jens von Bahr and Fredrik Österberg were contemplating what had always seemed like an exciting market: online gambling. But they saw a way to do it differently – to make online gambling feel as immersive and exciting as the real thing. Why not bring the thrill of a live casino experience directly into people's homes, allowing players to feel like they're right in the action, even while lounging on the couch?\n\nFrom that spark, [Evolution Gaming](/companies/evolution_3967) was born. It started as a high-stakes bet on video streaming technology, charismatic live dealers, and high-tech studios. They set up their first studio in Riga, Latvia, not with the intention of becoming just another gambling operator, but to provide a next-level experience for players. Instead of chasing players directly, Evolution aimed to be the engine that powered casinos.\n\nThat was almost 20 years ago, and Evolution is now one of Europe's most impressive financial success stories during the last two decades. Since its IPO in 2015, the company's stock price has surged an astonishing ~58x. The numbers are hard to ignore: revenue has increased by 26x since the IPO, and the EBIT margin – starting at an impressive 27.6% – has expanded to 65.1% on a TTM basis, with a return on invested capital frequently exceeding 100%.\n\nWhen we set out to write this article, we decided to reach out to one of the most prominent figures behind Evolution's success: Todd Haushalter, Chief Product Officer since they went public in 2015. There's no one better to ask about what keeps them ahead of the competition. Here's how he put it:\n\n_\"There is a lot of trust between coworkers at Evolution, and that allows us to go much faster. [...] This shows up everywhere in the company and allows for decisions to be made fast. We are not always exactly right but we are mostly right and if we are wrong we can change it back. And somehow this all happens in Evolution without any politics. The company is remarkably unpolitical.\"_\n\nThere are obviously more secrets to unfold. Let's find out what makes Evolution's story one for the books.\n\n## A Scandinavian Start with Big Ambitions\n\nEvolution's founding story is as much about timing as it is about vision and risk. In 2006, online gambling was booming, but still primitive in many ways. While online poker and digital slot machines were already thriving, there was something crucial missing: the real-time thrill of live-dealer games. Most platforms struggled to replicate the experience of a real casino – the live tables had low-quality video, lagging streams, and dealers who lacked the spark and joy that make a casino feel alive. That's when Evolution's founders stepped in with an ambition to fill this gap.\n\nJens von Bahr and Fredrik Österberg weren't cut from the same cloth as your typical tech founders. Before Evolution, Jens had lived a life that could best be described as eclectic. He wore many hats along the way: running a second-hand sportswear store, working in Vietnam's travel industry, earning an MBA in Australia, and serving as CEO of makeup operations in Sri Lanka for Oriflame. It was a pretty unusual trajectory, and none of these ventures quite lit fire in him. He was still searching for his true calling.\n\nMeanwhile, Fredrik was carving a different path in the digital sports world. He worked with Sportal, a pioneering digital sports media platform, during the early days of the internet. His experience gave him a front-row seat to the tech world's rapid evolution, and he began to grasp the untapped potential of online platforms to reshape traditional industries. The two childhood friends frequently kept in touch, swapping business ideas and dreaming of starting something together one day.\n\nWhile many entrepreneurs were betting on poker and sports betting, Jens and Fredrik zeroed in on live casinos. The idea was straightforward: players craved the immersive experience of a live casino but wanted the convenience of playing from home. It was a bold idea, especially since live-streaming technology at the time was still clunky and unreliable. But the two founders were convinced that if they could deliver a high-quality, seamless streaming experience with engaging dealers, they'd be onto something big.\n\nAccording to Speedwell Research (2023), the first big test for the founders came with a pitch to Unibet founder Anders Ström, a rising star in online gambling at the time.\n\n_\"One of the first people to get the idea pitched to them was Unibet founder Anders Ström. But the idea was too early: the picture quality and bandwidth lag made for an unimpressive experience. He would pass, but thought there was long-term potential.\"_\n\nStröm thought the concept had potential but wasn't sure the technology could live up to it. Looking back, this decision is likely Ström's \"biggest miss\" financially. His encouragement however seemed to light a fire under Jens and Fredrik, who still needed funding to turn this ambitious idea into something real.\n\nEnter Richard Hadida, a British entrepreneur who believed in their vision and had the connections to make it happen. He introduced Jens and Fredrik to British real estate moguls Richard and Ian Livingstone, whose backing helped secure the capital needed to launch their first product. Hadida joined as the third co-founder and creative director. With funding secured, the trio was ready to get building, and Evolution Gaming was officially born in 2006 (now called simply \"Evolution\" following an official name change in 2020).\n\nThe founders set up their first studio in Riga, Latvia, that same year. The choice of location wasn't accidental; Latvia offered favorable business conditions, a talented workforce, and relatively low costs. Evolution invested in high-definition cameras, fast internet connections, and a team of professional dealers. The objective was unique at the time and marked a stark contrast to the RNG-based (Random Number Generator) casino games of the era, which arguably sought to \"automate\" the casino experience. Evolution wanted to make it as alive as possible.\n\n## The Rise and Beauty of Live Casino\n\nIn 2007, Evolution launched its first live dealer games, including Live Roulette and Live Blackjack. It wasn't exactly smooth sailing from the start. Selling this product as a newcomer to already established operators proved challenging, especially since the infrastructure still had its flaws.\n\nA critical shift began working in Evolution's favor once the product reached a certain quality level. Rather than building its own player base from the ground up, Evolution chose to focus on B2B partnerships – a strategic move that allowed them to tap into established user bases. A breakthrough came in 2009 when it signed a deal with Unibet, showing that the investor pitch for Ström might not have been a waste of time after all.\n\nAnother major milestone came in 2010 when one of Evolution's first clients took a bold step and gave live casino games a dedicated tab on its website. The result? An instant hit. Players flocked to the live games, not just for the thrill of real-time action – it turned out they trusted human dealers over digital \"randomness,\" which some worried could be rigged. Was this a lucky break or a strategic masterstroke by Evolution? That's up for debate – but the impact was undeniable.\n\nThe success of live casino games suddenly became proof of just how big Evolution could get, and everyone in the industry was starting to take notice. Back in 2010, most online gambling operators were still heavily invested in sports betting or poker – nothing close to the live experience Evolution was introducing. And honestly, being an online gambling operator is no cakewalk. Operators were mainly just repackaging sportsbooks and other third-party games onto their platforms – a pretty commodified setup that still works the same way today.\n\nTo stand out, these operators were throwing huge budgets into marketing, fighting tooth and nail to attract players, which meant the whole industry was feeling the pinch on margins. Evolution's live casino model, though? A totally fresh product it could cross-sell to the sports bettors and poker players already on board, setting them apart from competitors who hadn't jumped on the live casino bandwagon yet.\n\nSoon, it was almost a race among operators to partner up with Evolution's live games thanks to the massive appeal. And here's the genius part: while Evolution provided the content, it didn't have to spend a dime on customer acquisition. The same live streams could also be sold to several operators simultaneously, just adding more clients to the same infrastructure it had already built. How's that for operating leverage?\n\n_\"Live Casino was an entirely new product for them to upsell their users on and it would also differentiate them from other operators who lacked that category. Once one operator saw how popular it was with players, all of them needed it.\"_\n\n– Speedwell Research, 2023\n\nIn Evolution's own view, the live casino value chain consists of three main layers: technology providers, operators, and end-users. Evolution firmly positions itself in the first category as a B2B technology provider, supplying the picks and shovels for the modern-day gold rush towards online gambling. And, as history has shown, the real winners in any gold rush are often those who sell the tools, not those chasing the treasure.\n\nEvolution's position allows it to support the \"diggers\" without getting its hands dirty – meaning it remains extremely capital-light, avoiding the need to acquire customers directly or even build its own studios in some cases. Yes, Evolution has occasionally had clients co-fund new studios or cover the entire cost. This approach allows the company to expand its studio capacity efficiently while also catering to each operator's unique preferences. This is what's behind Evolution's impressive ~100% ROIC and 65% EBIT margin.\n\n[![Evolutions's position in the online casino value chain](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1786/92e3424785/evo-evolution_positioning-in-the-online-casino-value-chain.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality\\(85\\))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1786/92e3424785/evo-evolution_positioning-in-the-online-casino-value-chain.png)\n\nEvolution's position in the online casino value chain.\n\n[![Evolutions's position in the online casino value chain](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1786/92e3424785/evo-evolution_positioning-in-the-online-casino-value-chain.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality\\(85\\))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1786/92e3424785/evo-evolution_positioning-in-the-online-casino-value-chain.png)\n\nEvolution's position in the online casino value chain.\n\nBy 2010, Evolution had established itself in the European market and won the EGR Live Casino Supplier of the Year award for the first time – a title it would go on to secure on multiple occurrences. Innovation continued with the launch of Live Casino Hold'em in 2010, one of its first poker-based live dealer games, and Live Baccarat in 2012, marking its first Asia-focused game. Evolution's approach was clear: continue innovating within the live casino space rather than competing in the broader online casino market dominated by slot machines and RNG games.\n\n## Expanding Globally and Going Public\n\nWith a strong grip on the European market, Evolution set its sights on an even bigger prize: global expansion. It went public on March 20, 2015, on the Nasdaq First North Premier Exchange, a European platform for high-growth companies, valued at around €330 million (about $340 million). Evolution did not raise any money at the IPO; instead, one can assume it served as a strategic signal to the industry that Evolution was on the rise – or rather, going global – building credibility with institutions in a heavily regulated industry.\n\nBy this time, Evolution had already earned a reputation as the best in the business, snagging the \"Live Casino Supplier of the Year\" award four times in just five years. And while the company had already seen impressive growth with a CAGR of 24.6% between 2012 and 2014, the real growth explosion was still around the corner.\n\nThe 2015 IPO prospectus revealed an interesting snapshot of Evolution's ownership. The first big backer Richard Livingstone still held a hefty 33% stake, while founders Jens and Fredrik each controlled 17%, with Hadida holding 10%. In other words, Evolution's leadership still had massive skin in the game almost a decade after the company was born. This ownership structure was powerful, not just on paper, but in practice. With a rock-solid team and full commitment to live casino, Evolution stood out as the only company putting 100% of its focus here, riding the advantage of being a true first-mover in the space.\n\nHowever, some shareholders decided to cash in a bit during the IPO. Altogether, about 40% of the company changed hands as existing investors sold portions of their stakes. Jens von Bahr and Fredrik Österberg each reduced their holdings from 17% to 10%, and Livingstone sold down his 33% share to 16.5%.\n\nAccording to the IPO prospectus, Europe's gambling market in 2013 was valued at €95.9 billion, with online gambling making up €14.5 billion (15% of the whole market). Live casino games accounted for just €771 million, or 0.8% of the total market. This was even after Evolution had gained traction from 2006 to 2013.\n\nBut things were shifting. Online gambling was steadily chipping away at traditional land-based casino revenue, while live casino games were quickly carving out a larger share within the online sector itself from a small base – where Evolution was the best. This created a dual structural growth engine and arguably ideal conditions. Adding to this momentum, continued advances in internet speed, payment options, bandwidth, and the growing shift toward mobile gaming all stacked the deck further in Evolution's favor.\n\nAt this stage, Evolution's ambitions were clear: to dominate globally.\n\n## Enter Martin Carlesund and Todd Haushalter\n\nMartin Carlesund and Todd Haushalter joined Evolution Gaming in 2015, becoming two of the most influential figures in the company's journey. They brought an explosive mix of strategy and creative innovation that kicked off Evolution's next era. Carlesund initially joined as CEO of Evolution Malta with extensive experience in tech and online operations, and was quickly promoted to Group CEO in 2016. His background offered a unique blend of tech and operations – qualities he brought to Evolution with a clear goal: to scale fast and become a global leader. Carlesund saw Evolution as \"one of the most exciting companies\" in the gambling sector, providing the perfect playground to push for hyper-growth. Jens Von Bahr stepped down but remained as Chairman when Carlesund was appointed CEO, a position he still holds today.\n\nAppointed as Chief Product Officer, Haushalter complemented Carlesund's strategic drive with a customer-focused vision honed at MGM Resorts and Shuffle Master. His philosophy was simple yet bold: make online gambling as entertaining as possible. Haushalter's creative mind fueled groundbreaking products like Dream Catcher and Lightning Roulette, which weren't just new games but an entirely new experience that players hadn't seen before (more on this later). His influence helped position Evolution not just as a game provider but as a major entertainment brand within the online casino world.\n\nBoth Carlesund and Haushalter saw something in Evolution that made them jump at the opportunity. For Carlesund, the appeal was a live casino niche that was just about to explode; Evolution had the potential to lead the pack if it could scale quickly and innovate continually. For Haushalter, it was the platform itself – a blank slate where he could test daring new ideas and, as he puts it, \"reinvent what online gambling could be.\" Together, they formed a power duo: Carlesund driving strategy and market expansion, and Haushalter injecting creativity and a keen eye for what players truly enjoy.\n\nIf there's a cornerstone to their success, it's their obsessive focus on customer experience. Carlesund believes that every product and service should revolve around what the player wants, not just what the company thinks will make money. He pushed Evolution to consider what players actually experience during each game – right down to the smallest details.\n\nSince the 2015 IPO, Evolution has grown from being valued at around €$330 million to over €20 billion. Carlesund credits this growth to their \"passion for product,\" which translates to a long-term focus rather than short-term profit chasing. Evolution's commitment to player-centric games, backed by strong financial discipline, created a virtuous cycle: popular games attracted more players, which funded even more innovation.\n\n## World Domination\n\nHaushalter's mission was clear when he joined: innovate beyond the traditional live table games and craft experiences that didn't just replicate the casino floor but went beyond it. Early successes like Dream Catcher, Evolution's first \"game show\" title launched in 2017, introduced a live wheel format unlike anything seen before. \n\nSo, what exactly is a game show? It's sort of a hybrid – combining the classic experience of table games and money wheels with the excitement of world-famous game shows and board games. A high-energy format that's immersive, interactive, and downright fun. Not only did Dream Catcher set the stage for a new era in online gambling, but it also cemented game shows as one of Evolution's most powerful competitive advantages.\n\nHere's Haushalter's own description of Dream Catcher in a press release from 2017 (sourced with [Quartr Pro](/pages/products/quartr-pro)):\n\n_\"This is a momentous launch for us because Dream Catcher will expose live casino to players who don't play table games and therefore don't play live casino. There are millions of slot, bingo, and other players who we are reaching out to with this product. It is intentionally simple and friendly to play, and with the potential for the 2x and 7x multipliers to keep hitting sequentially, players can win thousands of times their initial bet, just like in slots. It is almost like a game show that you can play along with at home. Both slot and table game players will find it a familiar and an enjoyable way to play. We really tried hard to make Dream Catcher a game that will expand the live casino space and we hope the players find it as fun as we do.\"_\n\nAnother successful game by Evolution is Lightning Roulette (also a game show). Launched in 2018, this game became a hit due to its innovative use of random multipliers (ranging from 50x to 500x) combined with the classic roulette format. As you might have guessed, Lightning Roulette has won multiple awards including the prestigious \"Game of the Year\" title, and it remains one of the most-played live dealer games worldwide to this day.\n\n[![Evolution Gaming - Casino games](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1600/a015faf419/evolution_evo_casino-games.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality\\(85\\))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1600/a015faf419/evolution_evo_casino-games.png)\n\nTwo of Evolution's most popular games.\n\n[![Evolution Gaming - Casino games](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1600/a015faf419/evolution_evo_casino-games.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality\\(85\\))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1600/a015faf419/evolution_evo_casino-games.png)\n\nTwo of Evolution's most popular games.\n\nCarlesund had his sights set on taking Evolution global, and in 2018, he kicked things off in North America, planting the company's first flag in New Jersey with a live casino studio. But this was just the beginning. Evolution kept moving quickly, securing licenses in key states like Pennsylvania and Michigan as online gambling took off in the states. The North American expansion was instantly a major win, giving Evolution a launchpad to tap into the rapidly growing and large market. And it didn't stop there. Evolution set up for growth in Canada, Latin America, and beyond. By 2018, Evolution had grown its revenue from €76 million in 2015 to €245 million, representing a 48% CAGR, with EBIT margin rising from 28% to 36.5%, and it had just entered North America.\n\nThis is also where their big acquisition journey kicked off. Evolution made its first move at the end of 2018 by acquiring the competitor Ezugi for $12 million in cash, with the chance to add another $6 million in earn-outs. This deal didn't just bring new licenses in places like South Africa; it also pushed them further into big markets like the U.S. and Asia. Ezugi was in fact the only other licensed live casino supplier in the U.S. at the time, which meant Evolution would be the sole player in a market just beginning to legalize state-by-state.\n\nHere's another compelling insight from Speedwell Research (2023):\n\n_\"While competitors like Playtech were focused on locking in casino operators with long-term contracts to eliminate supplier competition, Evolution took a different route. They capitulated that many operators wouldn't want to be beholden to a single casino supplier, so instead of contractually locking in operators, they focused on making new, fun games that would allow them to remain each operator's most important supplier and thus gain negotiating leverage.\"_\n\nIn essence, while others tried to corner operators with contracts (more on this and competition later), Evolution saw a better way to capture loyalty – creativity and gameplay innovation. By constantly rolling out new, engaging games, it secured the spot as each operator's key supplier without forcing exclusivity. This philosophy of thriving on competition, rather than shutting it down, was echoed by Martin Carlesund already back then. His words in the Q1 2019 earnings call, now almost a tagline for Evolution's approach, went like this:\n\n_\"I believe in competition. And I think that the competition is good. It makes you be on your toes, and you want to do better every day. And we believe that we increased actually gaps to competition by far now with the launch that we do and what we did in 2018 and what we did in 2017 as well. So we are -- we're happy with that and continue to fight to be even better this year and next year and the year beyond that.\"_\n\nWith North America booming and profits climbing, Evolution now had plenty of firepower for more acquisitions. By 2020, revenue had soared to $561 million, and EBIT had jumped to 53.4% (up from $245 million and 36.5% just two years prior!). Riding this wave of success, Evolution made a bold move that year and acquired Swedish NetEnt for ~€2 billion. This was its first step into slots (RNG) and marked a shift from its sole focus on live casino.\n\nNetEnt's portfolio gave Evolution access to one of the most established digital slot libraries, adding immediate variety to its offerings. But this acquisition wasn't just about content; it was about infrastructure. With NetEnt's distribution channels and relationships, Evolution gained a much stronger foothold across Europe, boosting its leverage in global markets and opening doors for cross-promotion of live and slot games. That's probably why Evolution was willing to pay a seemingly hefty price – about 10x sales and 35x EBIT – to bring NetEnt into the fold. Evolution acquired two more slot-makers in the following years, Big Time Gaming and Nolimit City.\n\nHowever, if Evolution's leadership has made any missteps, it's probably the hefty price tags on these RNG acquisitions. Speedwell Research comments:\n\n_\"These deals have been a disappointment. While they have built up a formidable position in slots with these acquisitions, many of these acquired companies' biggest hits were created before they were absorbed into Evolution. Whether the innovative culture of these companies were eroded in the integration or if it is simply bad luck that no games have since become a breakout hit, what is clear is that the \"RNG\" segment of Evolution has been sagging.\"_\n\nRNG however achieved an 8% year-over-year growth in Q3 2024, marking a positive shift after several quarters of falling short of their high single-digit growth target. This could indicate a turning point in the performance trend. Time will tell.\n\nIn the same year that Evolution acquired NetEnt and embarked on an aggressive M&A strategy, it launched what would become the most successful live casino game in history: Crazy Time. The game centers around a large, colorful spinning wheel divided into segments featuring different prizes, multipliers, and bonus games. Players place bets on the segment they believe the wheel will land on, but the real excitement lies in the bonus rounds.\n\nCrazy Time offers four dynamic bonus games – Coin Flip, Cash Hunt, Pachinko, and Crazy Time – each with unique mechanics and the potential for massive payouts. From the thrill of a coin toss with high multipliers to the high-energy chaos of the Crazy Time bonus round, the game has become a benchmark in live casino entertainment.\n\nBelow is the aggregated monthly average player data for Evolution's English-speaking game shows globally. As illustrated in the chart, Crazy Time accounts for about half of the player numbers:\n\n[![Evolution Gaming \\(EVO\\): Aggregated monthly average player numbers; globally](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1809/7ac147227b/evolution-aggregated-monthly-no-of-players.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality\\(85\\))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1809/7ac147227b/evolution-aggregated-monthly-no-of-players.png)\n\nAggregated monthly average player numbers; globally, English-speaking Evolution game shows (data: Alinea Analytics).\n\n[![Evolution Gaming \\(EVO\\): Aggregated monthly average player numbers; globally](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1809/7ac147227b/evolution-aggregated-monthly-no-of-players.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality\\(85\\))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1809/7ac147227b/evolution-aggregated-monthly-no-of-players.png)\n\nAggregated monthly average player numbers; globally, English-speaking Evolution game shows (data: Alinea Analytics).\n\n## The First Big Pullback\n\nIt's 2021, and Evolution practically owns the live casino space and just keeps growing. Since going public in 2015, sales have grown at a 56% CAGR, and the EBIT margin has now hit 61%. Market cap has reached €27 billion ($32 billion), putting them nearly on par with giants like [Spotify](/insights/company-research/spotifys-rise-to-global-dominance-in-music-streaming) and [H&M](/companies/hennes-mauritz_5511) – not bad for a live casino supplier. But you know how it goes: when things seem almost too perfect, there's usually a pullback. Evolution was about to face its most turbulent period since the IPO.\n\nIn November 2021, a report from an alleged short-seller accused Evolution of enabling gambling in blacklisted markets, including U.S.-sanctioned countries like Iran and Syria. These allegations suggested that Evolution's games were accessible in regions where gambling is strictly prohibited, raising serious legal and ethical concerns.\n\nThe report's claims were not about revenues from \"unregulated\" markets – areas without explicit gambling laws – but rather about operations in countries where gambling is outright banned. If true, these allegations could imply that Evolution was facilitating access to its games in regions under U.S. sanctions, potentially leading to severe penalties.\n\nAnd the market reacted; Evolution's stock dropped by over 30% in a week. The report however seemed to misunderstand Evolution's business model. As a B2B provider, Evolution supplies its gaming content to licensed operators, who then offer these games to end-users. It's thus the operators who handle all monetary transactions with their end-users who hold the responsibility here.\n\nIn response to the allegations, Evolution published a press release just days after the accusation. An excerpt from the release (sourced with [Quartr Pro](/pages/products/quartr-pro)):\n\n_\"Evolution does not handle any players or any of the players' money. Evolution provides a service to the operator who in turn provides their services to the players. It is the operator's responsibility to conduct a KYC on each player and decide what markets to focus on and what players to accept. It is the operator's responsibility to comply with their regulation and their license. [...] The control of who plays the game is a strict responsibility of the operator.\"_\n\nEven though Evolution handled the whole situation pretty well – with no fines or penalties from regulators – the stock is still down about 30% from its 2021 peak. Part of that drop is however just the stock settling back after the pandemic-fueled surge that boosted demand and sent the price soaring.\n\n## Business and Financials\n\nAlright, so here we are in November 2024. Revenue has increased by 26x since the IPO, and the EBIT margin has expanded to 65.1%, with a return on invested capital frequently exceeding 100%. The absolute numbers are €2 billion in revenue, €1.3 billion in EBIT, and €1 billion in free cash flow on a TTM basis. The revenue growth in the last quarter was 15% and Evolution's market cap is now ~€18 billion.\n\n### The rise of Evolution visualized:\n\n[![Infograph illustrating Evolution Gaming's world-class operating leverage.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1809/bd514667bc/evo_world-class-financials.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality\\(85\\))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1809/bd514667bc/evo_world-class-financials.png)\n\nOver the last decade, Evolution has grown its revenue and EBIT by 57x and 122x respectively.\n\n[![Infograph illustrating Evolution Gaming's world-class operating leverage.](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1809/bd514667bc/evo_world-class-financials.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality\\(85\\))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1809/bd514667bc/evo_world-class-financials.png)\n\nOver the last decade, Evolution has grown its revenue and EBIT by 57x and 122x respectively.\n\nSo, here's the big question: where can this go over time?\n\n### The Gambling Market\n\nLet's start by looking at the size of the market. H2CG, a leading market data and intelligence consultancy specializing in the gambling industry, updates the market data each new quarter (this is the source that Evolution itself often references in its earnings reports).\n\nH2CG estimated that 2023 brought in around $536 billion globally in gross wins for regulated (white/gray) gambling. In the gambling market, gross win (sometimes called gross gaming revenue or GGR) refers to the total amount of money wagered by players minus the payouts or winnings paid back to them. In simpler terms, the gross win is the \"house take\" – the money that stays with the gambling operator after all player winnings are accounted for.\n\nIn 2023, online gambling took up 24.6% of the total $536 billion gambling market, hitting a record $132 billion. Live casino games made up around 20% of that online segment, meaning live casino alone accounted for about 5% of the total gambling market. It's been the fastest-growing part of online gambling for a long time, with an impressive annual growth rate of 24% from 2019 to 2023. Speedwell Research on how this relates to Evolution:\n\n_\"We have to rely more on anecdotes from industry experts and operator commentary. [...] Commentary has suggested that Evolution has anywhere from a 60-80% market share of live casino in Europe, as well as virtual domination in the US with 90%+ share.\"_\n\nThe 5% share of the gambling market held by live casinos, along with the rapid growth in this niche, suggests that there's still plenty of room for Evolution to expand.\n\n### Revenue Breakdown\n\nEvolution splits its revenue into two main segments: Live, which makes up a big 84%, and RNG which brings in the other 16% (Q3 2024). Unlike live casino, the RNG business has been slow-growing in the low single-digits range since the acquisition. Evolution's management has however stayed optimistic, regularly saying they expect higher growth in this area – and they're just starting to see it with 8.5% growth in the last quarter.\n\nIn terms of the geographical split, Asia has emerged as the largest region by revenue, accounting for 33% of the total in 2023 (with 40% of this coming from regulated markets – more on what this means later). Each region is experiencing steady growth, driven by the structural trends outlined above. North America is currently Evolution's fastest-growing market, with year-over-year growth of 18% (excluding \"Other,\" which primarily includes Africa and contributes only ~4% to total revenue).\n\n[![Evolution gaming: Total revenue by segment, comparing 2019 with 2023](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1796/e8e4811475/evo_product-segment-and-geography-breakdown.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality\\(85\\))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1796/e8e4811475/evo_product-segment-and-geography-breakdown.png)\n\nEvolution revenue breakdown: segment and geographical split.\n\n[![Evolution gaming: Total revenue by segment, comparing 2019 with 2023](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1796/e8e4811475/evo_product-segment-and-geography-breakdown.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality\\(85\\))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1796/e8e4811475/evo_product-segment-and-geography-breakdown.png)\n\nEvolution revenue breakdown: segment and geographical split.\n\n### Customer Base\n\nEvolution serves a diverse range of clients, from major global brands to specialized niche operators. Notable names include [DraftKings](/companies/draftkings-inc_5712), FanDuel, William Hill, BetMGM, and 888 Casino. The larger partnerships often feature customized elements like branded gaming tables, client-specific logos and colors, dealers in branded uniforms, and dealers trained to cater to particular player groups. This customization not only boosts customer satisfaction but also explains why new studios are frequently co-funded by clients.\n\nBy the end of 2023, Evolution's client base included around 800 customers, spanning online operators and land-based casinos. The revenue details in the 2023 annual report also show that the largest customer made up about 13% of Evolution's revenue, with the top five customers contributing around 41% collectively (sourced with [Quartr Pro](/pages/products/quartr-pro)).\n\nBy working with a wide range of operators across multiple markets, Evolution lowers its risk of relying too heavily on any single source of revenue. This is especially crucial for Evolution because, by spreading its customer base across different regulatory environments, it also reduces its regulatory risk.\n\n### Regulated vs. Unregulated\n\nIn the gambling world, revenue splits into two main streams: regulated and unregulated markets. Regulated markets are simply places where the law has given a thumbs-up to gambling – under certain rules of course. These rules may limit game types, restrict advertising, or enforce taxes. In contrast, unregulated markets don't have specific laws for or against gambling. It's a legal gray zone; no one's given the green light, but no one's put up a stop sign either.\n\nBalancing these two revenue streams can be tricky for companies like Evolution. Regulated markets often mean stability. Evolution operates with country-specific licenses in places like the UK and Sweden. That means it follows strict rules, paying local taxes, and meeting regulatory standards. The upside? Regulators in these countries are clear on what's legal and what's not, so there's less guesswork. The downside? Higher operating costs due to taxes, fees, and compliance requirements. Still, the predictability and potential for long-term growth make regulated markets more appealing. As you're probably aware of, the capital markets are not a huge fan of risk or uncertainty – this can be seen clearly in the gambling world where companies with lots of exposure to unregulated markets are given lower multiples.\n\nUnregulated markets – sometimes called \"gray markets\" – bring in revenue from areas where laws are vague, outdated, or non-existent. Asia, Latin America, and parts of Eastern Europe fall into this category. Here, Evolution usually supplies games to so-called aggregators. An aggregator handles contracts and integrations with multiple casino suppliers, offering operators a single, seamless integration to access a full range of casino content. Evolution doesn't need to apply for licenses in these cases, and there are typically fewer regulations around player identity verification and anti-money laundering. The appeal is lower operating costs, no direct taxes, and often rapid growth potential. The key risk is that regulatory environments can change suddenly. Countries that are \"gray\" today might impose a crackdown tomorrow, cutting off access without much warning.\n\nFor Evolution, the choice between regulated and unregulated markets isn't binary – it's arguably more of a balancing act. On one hand, regulated markets give them legitimacy and access to stable, long-term revenue streams (and greater validation from the capital markets). On the other hand, unregulated markets offer fast growth with fewer barriers and, of course, a much larger market than if Evolution operated only in regulated markets.\n\nThe company has increasingly focused on regulated markets in recent years, especially as more countries open up to legal online gambling. But Evolution doesn't want to give up on the gray markets for obvious reasons – unregulated revenue was 61% of the total as of Q3 2024. In 2020, 65% of revenue came from unregulated markets, so the split has remained fairly steady over the recent years.\n\nSo, Evolution's revenue story is much about managing both sides: playing by the book in regulated markets while keeping an eye on shifting sands in the unregulated ones. As more regions are regulating gambling, it's likely Evolution will continue leaning into licensed markets, but the gray market still offers growth, opportunity, and, yes, a bit of risk.\n\nThere's however a strong argument – highlighted in the press release following the 2021 short report – that makes Evolution's position in the value chain quite solid for unregulated revenue. Operators are responsible for ensuring players can legally access games, verifying player identities (through KYC protocols), and implementing anti-money laundering measures. As a supplier, Evolution generally isn't held accountable for who plays their games. Speedwell Research adds:\n\n_\"We know that Evolution games can be played in Black Markets with some technical manipulation. Regulators could decide that this mere fact makes Evolution ineligible for licenses in a regulated market. While Evolution has a strong defense and it seems unlikely for, say, New Jersey Gaming Regulators to care about online gaming activity in Malaysia, it is a risk. However, each market also has its only regulators, and so all of them coming to that same conclusion seems much less likely.\"_\n\nWhen discussing regulated vs. unregulated gambling, it's important to mention that legal gambling brings several benefits to society compared to black or gray markets. It shifts gambling from shady, hidden backrooms to regulated, transparent spaces and, of course, brings in tax and creates \"real\" jobs. Here's why it can be of benefit:\n\nJob creation: From casino staff to tech jobs in online gaming, legal gambling creates thousands of jobs and brings in tax.\n\nPlayer safety: Regulated gambling ensures players are protected with safeguards like age checks, addiction support, and anti-money laundering measures. It's far safer than the underground alternative.\n\nCuts out illegal gambling and crime: By legalizing it, the crimes tied to the black market gets mitigated.\n\nWith this in mind, and given Evolution's place in the value chain, it's reasonable to assume that 1) we might see a continuing wave of markets turning \"white,\" simply due to government incentives and 2) the risk associated with the company's unregulated revenue might not be as high as some argue – especially considering that this revenue is spread across numerous regions.\n\n## Competitive Landscape\n\nAt the heart of competition in the live casino industry is the battle for players' time and for operators to choose one supplier over another. It really all comes down to who has the best games and the right infrastructure to support them at scale. Evolution has actually said a few times that even companies like [Coinbase](/companies/coinbase-global-inc_4189), [Robinhood](/insights/company-research/robinhood-revolutionizing-retail-investing), and [Netflix](/insights/company-research/inside-netflix-innovation-originals-and-cultural-phenomena) count as competitors since they're all fighting for players' attention and likely because there haven't been many \"real\" competitors to speak of (this is beginning to change however, more on this later).\n\nEvolution has long been regarded as a near-monopoly. However, a few other players worth mentioning exist. In Europe and North America, Evolution's main rivals are [Playtech](/companies/playtech-plc_11665) and Pragmatic Play. There's also Vivo Games, which actually won the EGR live casino award in 2022. In a 2022 presentation, Haushalter listed 41 B2B casino suppliers when talking about the competitive landscape for context. So, while there are plenty of competitors, few of them are significant for Evolution.\n\nSo, how has Evolution managed to establish such a dominant position in what might seem like a simple and straightforward business? After all, building studios, hiring, and training staff should be all it takes to compete, right? Yet, it's far from that simple.\n\nHaushalter has a way of explaining Evolution's tech that makes you realize just how intricate it all is. From the outside, Evolution's live casino games might look like a simple stream of a dealer spinning a roulette wheel or dealing blackjack. But as Haushalter often points out, what's happening behind the scenes is a whole different story.\n\nHe's described Evolution's setup as this complex mix of high-end studio production, advanced live-streaming, and the kind of game mechanics that make everything run smoothly, no matter how many people are playing. Imagine managing multiple HD cameras, high-quality sound, real-time streaming, and keeping everything lag-free – all while handling real money transactions at a massive scale. And if that wasn't enough, Evolution's tech also has to fend off cheating attempts, which have been tried occasionally. \n\n_\"Algorithms can check if a wheel has a slight natural bias to tell the player where to bet. Wheel clocking programs can calculate the speed of the ball or wheel and automatically place bets. Shuffle tracking or Ace tracking can give a player an edge in card games. Whereas it's illegal to use your phone at a Las Vegas table to prevent cheating, a player at home has free reign to do anything they wish to give them an edge. Advanced anti-cheating systems are required to prevent all of this.\"_\n\n– Speedwell Research (2023)\n\nAs you've now understood, Evolution has a highly complex infrastructure and tech that really has to work flawlessly – at a very large scale. According to Haushalter, it's this unwavering focus on quality that's been baked into Evolution since day one. We asked Haushalter how Evolution ensures it stays ahead of the competition, here's what he said:\n\n_\"We relentlessly focus on the player. As a B2B supplier this is not always the case in our industry, because operators, competitors, etc all can have an influence on what you do. Everyone talks about this, but then they make games with high house-advantage to please operators or they just make a game that is nothing more than a copycat to please owners, and they miss the core elements of success. When you focus on the player, you agonize over those playing on low bandwidth on old phones, and you put in the extra work to ensure that they too have a great experience. When we create new games, we think about how every element is connected and then how that game is connected to the lobby and to other games, and if it's true to the experience we want to create. Sometimes we are wrong and the games fail and then we spend unusually significant amounts of time beating ourselves up learning why, so we don't make the same mistake twice.\"_\n\nHe's also mentioned that Evolution's platform can handle huge numbers of players at once, across every device you can think of. This isn't easy when you're talking about keeping streams stable and sharp during peak times. Haushalter says that everything from their streaming tech to security systems has been designed to make the player experience as immersive as possible. And it's this level of complexity coupled with the relentless focus on the player, Haushalter believes, that gives Evolution a real edge in the industry.\n\nNow, let's have a brief look at Evolution's two closest competitors, Playtech and Pragmatic:\n\n### Playtech\n\nPlaytech was founded in 1999, when Israeli entrepreneur Teddy Sagi set out to change online gambling by building games aimed at helping operators attract players. In the early days, Playtech focused on traditional online gambling – slots, table games, poker – the essentials for any online casino operator.\n\nWhen the live casino scene took off, Playtech followed closely behind Evolution. But Playtech took a different approach than the one outlined by Haushalter above. While Evolution focused on innovation and the player, Playtech locked in operators with exclusive 10-year contracts. Sure, this provided some stability, but it also meant Playtech's growth strategy was more about securing clients than pushing the boundaries of the live casino experience. Over time, this \"lock-in\" approach didn't quite deliver the long-term advantage they might have hoped for.\n\nPlaytech also earned a bit of a reputation as a \"copycat\" of Evolution. This has ironically worked to some extent since they're now the second-largest player in live casino. But the strategy arguably comes with an admission that they're content with the number-two spot, essentially leaving the leadership crown to Evolution.\n\nIn 2023, Playtech achieved €1.7 billion in revenue with a 13.5% EBIT margin, reflecting a 6.6% CAGR in sales over the previous five years. This €1.7 billion in revenue is roughly on par with Evolution's. Playtech's business is however much broader, encompassing both a B2C operation and a B2B segment with a wide array of products and services, including online casino software, poker platforms, bingo systems, sports betting solutions, and live dealer games. Exactly how much revenue its live casino offering generates is unfortunately not public information.\n\n### Pragmatic Play\n\nPragmatic Play was founded a bit later than Playtech, in 2015. The story however starts in 2008 when a company called TopGaming Technologies was making waves in the online gambling world for their buggy games and some sketchy business practices. Players reported strange occurrences: jackpots that weren't always paid out, slot symbols vanishing, and low return-to-player (RTP) rates. For those unfamiliar, RTP is the percentage of total money bet that a player can expect to win back on average; for example, an RTP of 90% means that the player gets back 90% of what they put in on average, with the house keeping the rest 10% as profit. For reference, Evolution has over 99% RTP rates on several games – known for being the highest in the industry. TopGaming shut down in 2015 after some turbulent years, and Pragmatic Play was born.\n\n_\"TopGaming disappeared in 2015, and a group of investors with a majority stake renamed it Pragmatic Play. It is not clear if this was a revamp and turnaround of TopGaming or new investors and managers just buying the shell of the company for its licenses. Some website forum operators have claimed they received legal action for suggesting there is any connection, but we couldn't find any corroborating evidence. Either way, the new brand worked, and Pragmatic Play's slots started becoming popular.\"_\n\n– Speedwell Research (2023)\n\nDespite its unpromising beginnings, Pragmatic found solid footing in the slots market. A major milestone in the company's growth came in June 2018, when it acquired Extreme Live Gaming from the Novomatic Group, marking Pragmatic's entry into the live casino space. Extreme Live Gaming's founder, Darwyn Palenzuela, brought impressive credentials having served as Evolution Gaming's first Chief Technology Officer from 2006 to 2011. Though Palenzuela didn't stay long with Pragmatic, the acquisition gave the company a substantial boost, positioning them as one of the acknowledged challengers to Evolution. Speedwell Research adds:\n\n_\"As a privately held company, it is hard to learn a lot about Pragmatic, but we know operators and ex-Evolution employees mention them and Playtech the most when it comes to competition.\"_\n\nPragmatic, like Playtech, has also done some copying of Evolution, though they aren't criticized for it as much as Playtech. This suggests that Pragmatic's goal may be to secure the #2 spot in the live casino industry rather than directly challenge Evolution. The message from Evolution's closest competitors is quite clear – they aren't even aiming to beat them – at least not yet.\n\nHowever, there is compelling data on the aggregated average number of players (globally, for English-speaking game show titles) suggesting that Pragmatic Play is quite rapidly capturing market share from Evolution. This arguably marks the first time in Evolution's history that a significant competitive threat has emerged. We believe this partly explains Evolution's year-to-date stock performance (-18%).\n\n### Evolution vs. Pragmatic Play and Playtech visualized:\n\n[![Infograph comparing the no. of monthly players between 2020 through 2024 for Evolution, Pragmatic Play and Playtech](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1809/e5b3b3d604/evolution-gaming-vs-competitors_pragmatic-play_and_playtech.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality\\(85\\))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1809/e5b3b3d604/evolution-gaming-vs-competitors_pragmatic-play_and_playtech.png)\n\nEvolution vs. Pragmatic Play and Playtech: Aggregated monthly average player numbers (data: Alinea Analytics).\n\n[![Infograph comparing the no. of monthly players between 2020 through 2024 for Evolution, Pragmatic Play and Playtech](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1809/e5b3b3d604/evolution-gaming-vs-competitors_pragmatic-play_and_playtech.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality\\(85\\))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1600x1809/e5b3b3d604/evolution-gaming-vs-competitors_pragmatic-play_and_playtech.png)\n\nEvolution vs. Pragmatic Play and Playtech: Aggregated monthly average player numbers (data: Alinea Analytics).\n\n## Capital Allocation\n\nThere's a lot of fascinating ground to cover on capital allocation. When it comes to operational decisions – such as building new studios, which account for most of the CapEx – Evolution has been extraordinary. However, capital allocation at the board level raises some questions.\n\nEvolution has an insane track record of delivering exceptional returns on capital. As we've previously discussed, being a B2B provider offers key advantages: it doesn't need to acquire end customers; it can connect multiple customers to the same studios; and co-funding new studios with clients often results in jaw-dropping returns on invested capital, frequently exceeding 100%.\n\nThis is undeniably impressive and indicates that Evolution should focus more on deploying additional capital. The company however faces a natural and common limitation: there's only so much capital it can deploy at such high rates due to its consistent dividend policy since IPO (paying out at least 50% of net income annually). This policy has constrained Evolution's ability to reinvest more or pursue other value-accretive activities, like share repurchases.\n\nA prime example of this tension emerged with their acquisition of NetEnt. The deal was financed with stock rather than cash or debt, leading to significant dilution for existing shareholders. In hindsight, this decision effectively traded a share of Evolution's booming live casino business for NetEnt's less profitable and slower-growing slots segment. The dilution might have been less severe without the constraints imposed by the dividend policy. Speedwell Research adds:\n\n_\"When they acquired NetEnt, they used stock which proved to be very dilutive to shareholders, giving them a piece of the much worse slots business in exchange for their more profitable and growing live casino business. But in Evolution's defense, there is a bit of hindsight bias in that claim. When they struck the NetEnt acquisition, their valuation was ~50x earnings, and they didn't know their earnings would increase 200% in two years.\"_\n\nThe dividend policy, combined with an M&A history that's not flawless, arguably suggests that Evolution's board is not fully considering opportunity costs when making capital allocation decisions. This is a common issue, partly due to the \"this is how things are usually done\" framework and the desire for existing shareholders to have a consistent cash flow stream. However, Evolution has significantly increased its share repurchases since 2021.\n\nAll that said, Evolution arguably has both signs of strengths and weaknesses in its approach to capital allocation. Without the constraints of the dividend policy and with greater flexibility as a consequence, it might have delivered even greater shareholder value.\n\n### The Large Growth Option\n\nAll eyes in the gambling industry are currently on the North American market, which only began legalizing online gambling state-by-state a few years ago. And the numbers? In 2023, the total North American gambling market was valued at around $120 billion, according to Modor Intelligence and Grand View Research. What's interesting is that online gambling has just started to claim a share of this enormous pie – with Evolution best positioned to lead. While there's uncertainty here, a $30 billion share for online gambling in the next five years isn't out of the question.\n\nThere's however a big question mark regarding the timeline, due to the uncertain timing of state by state legalization. Evolution currently holds licenses in all the states that allow online casinos: Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The company was quick to enter these markets, and its acquisition of Ezugi – already licensed in several states – helped secure a strong foothold early on as we addressed earlier. However, competitors like Playtech and Pragmatic have since entered the scene.\n\n_\"Almost 30 states have legalized online sports betting but only seven states have legalized online casino. There are 10 states that have introduced various online casino legislation, but none have been approved yet. New York, Illinois, and Ohio are among those that have proposed legislation, which are each meaningful markets with populations exceeding >10mn.\"_\n\n– Speedwell Research (2023)\n\nTo understand the U.S. gambling market, we need to take a look at the Wire Act. Passed in 1961, the Wire Act was crafted to combat organized crime by cutting off a major source of income for the mob: interstate betting operations. Officially called the Interstate Wire Act, this law makes it illegal to use wire communications to place bets or wagers across state lines. This meant telephones at the time, but as technology evolved, the law has been interpreted (and reinterpreted) to address internet and digital communications.\n\nThe Wire Act was first designed with sports betting in mind. In fact, its language specifically mentions \"bets or wagers on any sporting event or contest,\" so while it clearly targeted sports gambling, it didn't necessarily address other types of gambling. The Wire Act has however for long been interpreted as such that any form of cross-state online gambling has been on shaky legal ground. The idea was simple: stop bets from crossing state borders, and you limit organized crime's reach.\n\nThen came the 2000s and the explosion of online gambling. Everyone was suddenly betting online, and there was a big question mark around what exactly the Wire Act applied to in this digital age. In 2011, the Department of Justice issued a pivotal opinion that changed the game: they stated that the Wire Act's prohibitions only applied to sports betting and not to other types of online gambling, like poker or casino games. This opened the door for states to legalize and regulate online gambling within their own borders, without fear of violating federal law – so long as they kept the wagers from crossing state lines. Speedwell Research notes:\n\n_\"This not only means that they need a license in each state they operate, but they also cannot have a central hub to serve multiple markets like they do in Europe and Asia with their Riga and Malta studios. This creates a chicken and egg problem for competitors because Evolution already has deals with most large sports betting operators including Fan Duel, DraftKings, and BetMGM. A potential competitor would have to get licensed and set up a studio without any assurances that gaming operators will add them to their platform (remember, dedicated and branded tables), or even if they do, that their customers would use their games over Evolution's.\"_\n\nThis 2011 interpretation fueled the rise of legal online gambling in places like Delaware, New Jersey, and Nevada, which pioneered online casino and poker markets. The Department of Justice revisited the Wire Act under a new administration in 2018, issuing a new opinion that the law applied to all forms of interstate online gambling, not just sports betting. This flip-flop created uncertainty and even led to a lawsuit by the New Hampshire Lottery Commission, which feared the revised opinion would threaten its online lottery operations.\n\nBy 2021, a federal court ruled in favor of New Hampshire, affirming the 2011 interpretation that the Wire Act only applies to sports betting. This ruling reestablished some stability, particularly for online casinos and poker, allowing them to operate legally as long as they don't cross state lines with their bets or data.\n\nAs we've already mentioned, exactly how live casino will develop in the U.S. is still uncertain. There's however a significant potential for more states to legalize online gambling – a shift that would greatly benefit Evolution. In case you've forgotten, it controls roughly 90% of the U.S. live casino market according to expert commentary. Also, the need for a separate license and studio in each state makes it challenging for competitors to enter the U.S. market. This requirement likely strengthens Evolution's competitive advantage in the U.S. even more than in other regions.\n\nAll in all, the North American gambling scene is a fascinating mix of fast-paced growth, evolving regulations, and game-changing technology. It's an industry that's reshaping itself year by year, driven by a mix of economic opportunity, consumer demand, and the promise of digital transformation. But as it grows, it'll have to keep navigating those tricky waters of addiction prevention, privacy, and regulation. One thing seems certain: it'll be a market worth watching in the years to come.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\nEvolution's journey is remarkable. By staying laser-focused on delivering top-notch live dealer experiences, the company has managed to capture nearly the entire market in North America and a significant share globally, often leaving competitors playing catch-up.\n\nIn an industry known for high stakes, Evolution's primary successful \"gambles\" have arguably been its relentless focus on live casinos, staying narrow in its niche. It has also emphasized what truly matters – having the best products – while making smart business decisions like operating solely as a B2B provider and co-funding studios with partners. As the U.S. and other regions slowly move toward broader legalization of online gambling, Evolution's potential only continues to expand.\n\nFor now, Evolution is well-positioned as the gold standard of live casino, and with every state or country that legalizes online gambling, its future only gets brighter. The house may not always win – but if Evolution's track record is any indication, it sure seems like this one does.\n\nLast but not least, a huge thanks to Speedwell Research once again for allowing us to draw from their Evolution research and collaborating with us on this deep dive.\n\n**Primary Sources:**\n\n  * [ Speedwell Research (2023)](https://speedwellresearch.com/2023/12/19/evolution/)\n\n  * [Evolution IPO Prospectus (2015)](https://www.evolution.com/investors/reports/prospectus/)\n\n  * [Evolution annual and quarterly reports, press releases, and transcripts (Quartr Pro)](https://web.quartr.com/companies/3967)\n\n  * [H2 Gambling Capital (2024)](https://h2gc.com/news/general/global-gambling-industry-generates-536bn-in-2023-with-7-growth-expected-in-2024)\n\n  * [Alinea Analytics (2024)](https://alineaanalytics.com/)\n\n\n\n\n### Have you tried the Quartr mobile app?\n\nGet free access to live earnings calls, transcripts, analyst estimates, and more\n\n  * [Get the app](/download)\n\n  * [Learn more](/products/mobile-app)\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\n\n[![Recap - 12](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/2688x1512/624031d9f1/recap-12.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality\\(85\\))Earnings Season Recap #12Earnings call quotes from Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and more](/insights/company-research/recap-12)\n\n[Company Research](/insights/company-research)\n\n2023-01-27\n"
