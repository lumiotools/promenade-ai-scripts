Roanoke\nGas’ utility operations are subject to regulation by the Virginia State Corporation Commission as\nto its rates, charges and certain other business activities, including mergers, acquisitions and the\nissuance of securities.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 519 Kimball Avenue, N.E., Roanoke, Virginia\n24016, telephone number (540) 777-4427.\nTHE PLAN\nThe plan provisions are set forth below. By participating in the plan, you agree to all terms\nand conditions of the plan, as it may be amended from time to time. You should read this\nprospectus carefully before participating in the plan and keep it for future reference.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PLAN\nResources’ Board of Directors adopted the Plan effective after the close of business on July\n1, 1999, as an amendment to and complete restatement of the former Roanoke Gas Company\nDividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. Thereinafter:\n Effective as of April 28, 2003, the Board of Directors amended and restated the Plan;\n Effective February 11, 2005, Resources again amended and restated the Plan; and\n Effective January 1, 2011, the Plan was again amended to require at least 10% of any\ndividends to be paid on shares of common stock held in the Plan and/or registered in\nthe shareholder’s name must be reinvested in common stock.\nThe following is a description, in question and answer format, of the provisions of the Plan\nas presently in effect.\nPURPOSE\n1. What is the purpose of the Plan?\nThe purpose of this Plan is to provide shareholders of record with a simple,\nconvenient and economical means of purchasing shares of our common stock and\nreinvesting cash dividends in additional shares of common stock. To the extent that shares\nof common stock are issued directly by Resources, Resources will receive additional funds\nfor its general corporate purposes (see “Use of Proceeds” below).\nADVANTAGES\n2. What are the advantages of participation in the Plan?\nParticipants in the Plan can:\n• Reinvest all or part of cash dividends paid on all shares of common stock\nregistered in your name (certificate form) automatically in shares of common\nstock.\n• Invest additional cash, within specified limits, in shares of common stock.\nPurchases may, at your option, be made monthly through automatic\ndeductions from your bank account.\n• Avoid brokerage commissions or service charges in connection with\npurchases under the Plan.\n• Invest the full amount of all regular cash dividends and cash contributions\nbecause the Plan permits fractions of shares to be credited to your account.\n• Deposit with the Agent shares of common stock held in your name. This\nrelieves you of the responsibility for the safekeeping of certificates\nrepresenting your shares.\n• Avoid cumbersome record-keeping through the Plan’s reporting services.\nADMINISTRATION\n3. Who administers the Plan?\nBroadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions (“Broadridge”) is the Agent for the Plan. In\nthis capacity it administers the Plan for participants, keeps records, sends statements of\naccount to participants and performs other duties relating to the Plan. Shares purchased\nthrough the Plan will be purchased through a registered broker-dealer engaged by Broadridge\nand will be registered in the name of the Agent or its nominee as agent for participants in\nthe Plan.\nThe Agent’s contact information is as follows:\nRegular Mail Overnight Courier\nBroadridge Corporate Issuer Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions\nSolutions Attn: IWS\nP.O. Box 1342 1155 Long Island Ave\nBrentwood, NY 11717 Edgewood, NY 11717\n(844) 388-9273\nwww.broadridge.com/RGCO/\n2\nThe Agent may at any time resign by giving 90 days written notice to Resources or\nbe removed by Resources upon 90 days written notice by Resources to the Agent. If a\nvacancy occurs in the office of the Agent, Resources must appoint a successor Agent, which\nmay be Resources. There is an appointed officer or officers of Resources who will\ncoordinate administration of the Plan with the Agent. Questions regarding the Plan can be\ndirected either to Resources at (540) 777-3853 or the Agent at (844) 388-9273.\nPARTICIPATION\n4. Who is eligible to participate?\nYou may participate in the Plan if you are a holder of record of shares of our common\nstock.\nIf your shares of common stock are registered in names other than yours (e.g., in the\nnames of brokers, nominees, etc.), you must become a holder of record by having the shares\ntransferred into your name.\n5. How can I participate in the Plan?\nIf you are a shareholder, you may participate in the Plan by completing an\nEnrollment Form and returning it to the Agent. If the common stock is registered in more\nthan one name (i.e., joint tenants, trustees, etc.), all registered holders must sign an\nEnrollment Form.\nYou will become a participant in the Plan upon the Agent's receipt of your properly\ncompleted Enrollment Form.\nIf you wish the reinvestment of dividends under the Plan to begin as of a given\nInvestment Date, your Enrollment Form must be received by the Agent no later than five\ndays prior to the record date immediately preceding the Investment Date (see question 13\nfor the timing of purchases). Unless your Enrollment Form is received at least five days\nprior to the record date, reinvestment of dividends under the Plan may not begin until the\nInvestment Date following the next record date.\nOptional cash payments received with or after receipt of your initial Enrollment\nForm but prior to two business days before the Investment Date will be invested on the first\nInvestment Date coinciding with or immediately following the date the Enrollment Form is\neffective. However, if payment is received less than two business days before the Investment\nDate, it will be held until the next Investment Date (see questions 8 and 9). No interest will\nbe paid on and no refunds will be made of any payments awaiting investment.\nAn Enrollment Form may be obtained at any time by contacting the Agent (see\nquestion 3 for the Agent's address) or you may enroll online at:\nwww.broadridge.com/RGCO/.\nIf you are already enrolled and participating in the Plan, you do not need to\ntake any further action at this time.\n3\n6. What does the Enrollment Form provide?\nThe Enrollment Form authorizes the Agent to do the following:\nDividend Reinvestment - Automatically reinvest in additional shares of common\nstock all or a portion of cash dividends received on all shares of common stock registered in\nyour name (see questions 7 and 11).\nOptional Cash Payments - Upon receipt of optional cash payments of at least $25\nper payment, up to a maximum of $40,000 per calendar year, arrange for the purchase of\ncommon stock for your account on the next appropriate Investment Date (see questions 8, 9,\nand 10).\nSafekeeping of Shares - Hold any shares you deliver to the Agent in safekeeping\npursuant to the terms of the Plan (see question 26).\nREINVESTMENT OF DIVIDENDS\n7. How can I change the share amount of cash dividends on shares registered in my name\nto be reinvested?\nDividends are paid based on the number of shares owned. If you wish to change the\nnumber of shares on which cash dividends are reinvested, you may do so by submitting a\nrevised Enrollment Form on shares registered in your name (certificate form) to the Agent.\nHowever, at least 10% of any dividends paid on shares of common stock held in the Plan\nand/or registered in the shareholder’s name must be reinvested in common stock. The\nrevised Enrollment Form will be effective within 30 days after it is received by the Agent.\nOPTIONAL CASH PAYMENTS\n8. Who is eligible to make optional cash payments?\nYou are eligible to make optional cash payments at any time if you are a shareholder.\nThe amounts of optional cash payments may vary as long as they are at least $25 per payment\nand your total purchases for the calendar year do not exceed $40,000.\nAll checks for optional cash payments must be made payable to the Agent. Optional\ncash payments must be mailed to the Agent, accompanied by a correctly completed\nEnrollment Form or the bottom portion of your DRIP statement if you are already enrolled.\nEnrollment Forms may be obtained at any time by contacting the Agent. Optional cash\npayment enrollments can be made online at www.broadridge.com/RGCO/.\n9. When should optional cash payments be made?\nOptional cash payments can be made at any time; however, you are encouraged to\nmake equal monthly payments to the Plan (see question 10 regarding automatic monthly\npurchases). You may make the first optional cash payment when enrolling by including a\ncheck payable to the Agent with your Enrollment Form.\n4\nAll optional cash payments must be received by the Agent at least two business days\nbefore the Investment Date (see question 13) in order to be used to purchase common stock\nfor your account on that Investment Date. Payments received less than two business days\nbefore an Investment Date will be held until the next Investment Date. No interest will be\npaid on and no refunds will be made of any cash payments awaiting investment.\n10. Can I make automatic optional cash payments through automatic deductions from my\nbank account?\nYes. You may make automatic monthly optional cash payments of a specified\namount (not less than $25 per payment, nor more than $40,000 in total payments per calendar\nyear) by electronic fund transfer from a pre-designated United States bank account. To\ninitiate automatic monthly deductions, you must complete and sign Enrollment Form and\nreturn it to the Agent, together with a voided blank check for the account from which the\nfunds are to be drawn. Enrollment Forms are available from the Agent. These forms will be\nprocessed and will become effective as promptly as practicable.\nOnce automatic monthly deductions commence, funds will be drawn from your\ndesignated bank account on the 25th of each calendar month and will be invested on the next\nInvestment Date. You may change or terminate automatic monthly deductions by\ncompleting and submitting to the Agent a new Enrollment Form. To be effective with respect\nto a particular Investment Date, the new Enrollment Form must be received by the Agent no\nlater than twenty business days prior to the end of the calendar month preceding the\nInvestment Date.\nYou may make optional cash payments online as a one-time event or elect automatic\nmonthly fund transfers from a pre-designated United States bank account. The online feature\nmay be accessed at www.broadridge.com/RGCO/ .\nPURCHASES\n11. How can I purchase common stock under the Plan?\nYou may purchase common stock through:\n• Automatic reinvestment of the amount of shares, as you designate, of\ndividends received on all shares of common stock registered in your name\n(less any withholding taxes). Your designation of the dividends to be\nreinvested may be for any share amount up to the total shares registered in\nyour name provided the total dividends reinvested are not less than 10% of\nany dividends paid on shares of common stock registered in your name and/or\nheld in your account under the Plan (see question 7 for information on how\nto change the amount of shares to be reinvested). The amount of shares not\ndesignated for reinvestment, if any, will be sent directly to you in cash.\nRegardless of the amount of dividends designated for reinvestment, with\n5\nrespect to shares registered in your name, at least 10% of the dividends\nreceived on Resources common stock held in your account under the Plan will\nbe reinvested (see questions 18 and 19); and/or\n• Optional cash payments of not less than $25 per payment nor more than\n$40,000 per calendar year (including any initial investment; see questions 8,\n9, and 10 for certain information regarding optional cash payments).\nAll shares purchased for your account will be held in your account under the Plan in\nthe name of the Agent or its nominee (see question 3). You may request a stock certificate\nfor shares held in your Plan account as described in question 21.\n12. How many shares of common stock will be purchased for me and what is the source of\nshares purchased through the Plan?\nThe number of shares purchased for you will depend on the amount of your\nreinvested dividends and/or optional cash payments, and the purchase price of the common\nstock. Your account will be credited with the number of shares, including fractions computed\nto three decimal places, equal to:\n• The total amount of dividends invested on an Investment Date (less any\napplicable withholding taxes) divided by the purchase price per share; plus\n• The amount of optional cash payments invested on your behalf on an\nInvestment Date, divided by the purchase price per share.\nAt Resources’ option, purchases will be made directly from Resources, in the open\nmarket, or a combination of the two. Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, Resources can change\nits determination regarding the source of the shares only once every three months.\n13. When will purchases be made?\nShares acquired directly from Resources will be purchased once each calendar month\non the first business day of the month if cash has been timely received for your account,\nwhether through the payment of dividends to be automatically reinvested or the receipt of an\noptional cash payment. This date is referred to as the Investment Date (see questions 5, 9\nand 18). Shares purchased in the open market will be made on or within 30 days after the\nInvestment Date. The Agent may arrange for the purchase of shares in the open market over\nseveral days within this 30-day period.\nIn those instances where shares are purchased directly from Resources, you will\nbecome the owner of the shares on the Investment Date. In those instances where shares are\npurchased, in whole or in part, in the open market, you will become the owner of the shares\non the last day the broker-dealer engaged by the Agent purchases the shares in the open\nmarket. Regardless of the method of purchase, the holding period for federal income tax\npurposes will commence the day immediately following the day on which you become the\nowner of the shares purchased for your account.\n6\n14. What is the price of shares of common stock purchased under the Plan?\nThe purchase price for each share of common stock will not be affected by whether\nthe funds being invested are attributable to dividends or optional cash payments.\nThe purchase price of shares acquired directly from Resources will be the closing\nprice of Resources’ common stock on the Investment Date, as reported by the NASDAQ\nStock Market. If no report is made as of the Investment Date, the purchase price will be\nestablished based on the closing price as reported for the nearest day immediately preceding\nthe Investment Date.\nThe purchase price of shares acquired in the open market will be the weighted\naverage purchase price of shares purchased for the relevant Investment Date.\nNo common stock will be purchased from or issued by Resources at less than its par\nvalue (i.e., $5 per share). If the market price of common stock is less than par value on an\nInvestment Date, then all purchases will be made in the open market.\nSALE OF PLAN SHARES\n15. How can shares of common stock be sold?\nYou can sell all or part of your shares of common stock held by the Plan in either of\ntwo ways. First, you may request certificates or have your broker to request the Plan Agent\nto electronically transfer the number of whole shares you want to sell through the DRS\nProfile System and arrange for the sale of these shares through a broker-dealer of your choice\n(see question 21).\nAlternatively, you may request that the Agent sell for you some or all of your shares\nheld by the Plan. The Agent will sell your shares for you through broker-dealers selected by\nthe Agent in its sole discretion.\nIf you request that the Agent arrange for the sale of your shares, you will be charged\na handling fee by the Agent and a commission by the broker-dealer selected by the Agent\nwhich will be deducted from the cash proceeds paid to you. The amount of the commission\nwill vary depending on the broker-dealer selected and other factors. The handling fee\ncharged by the Agent is currently $15.00 per transaction and $0.10 per share, subject to\nchange. Participants should contact the Agent at the phone number listed in response to\nquestion 3 to verify the Agent’s handling fee before requesting a sale of shares through the\nPlan.\nShares being sold for you may be aggregated with those of other Plan participants\nwho have requested sales. In that event, you will receive proceeds based on the average sales\nprice of all shares sold, less your pro rata share of brokerage commissions, service charge\nand any applicable taxes.\n16. When will shares of common stock be sold?\n7\nThe Agent will generally arrange for sales of Plan shares at least weekly and as often\nas daily. Payment will be made by check and mailed to the participant’s address of record\nas soon as practicable after the settlement date of the sale or remitted via ACH. You may\nalso process your request online at or by phone at (844) 388-9273.\nAs an added security measure, Broadridge may apply a five business-day hold period\nto the initial association of banking account information to investor accounts as well as\nchanges made to established direct deposit or direct debit instructions. This hold period is a\nmethod of preventing unauthorized transactions. The optional investment will be made by\nthe independent purchasing agent and will occur within (5) five business days after\nreceiving.\nCOSTS\n17. Are there any expenses to participants in connection with purchases or sales under the\nPlan?\nYou will incur no brokerage commissions or fees for purchases made through the\nPlan unless, as noted below, you do not provide the Agent with sufficient funds for the\npurchases. There are no brokerage fees on newly issued shares purchased from Resources\nfor your account. Brokerage fees on shares purchased on the open market will be paid by\nResources, and, for tax purposes, these fees will be considered additional dividend income\nto you. All costs of administering the Plan will be paid by Resources (see question 25). If\nyou request that the Agent arrange a sale of shares held by the Plan for you, all fees will be\ndeducted from the proceeds of the sale (see question 15).\nIf the Agent does not receive a payment because of insufficient funds or incorrect\ndraft information, the requested purchase will be deemed void, and the Agent will\nimmediately remove from your account any shares of common stock purchased in\nanticipation of receiving such funds, and will be entitled to sell the shares to satisfy the\namount owed. If the net proceeds from any sale of shares of common stock are insufficient\nto satisfy the balance of the collected amounts, the Agent may arrange for sales of additional\nshares from your account as necessary to satisfy the uncollected balance.\nIn addition, the Agent may charge your account for an “insufficient funds” fee, which\nis at this time $25.00. The Agent may place a hold on your account until the “insufficient\nfunds” fee is received from you, or may sell shares from your account to satisfy any\nuncollected amounts.\nAdditional Fees:\nOvernight mailings $25.00/mailing\nReplacement check $3.00\nDuplicate Account statements:\nElectronic- No charge\nPaper- $5.00\nDuplicate Confirmation statements:\n8\nElectronic- No charge\nPaper- $5.00\nDIVIDENDS\n18. Will I be credited with dividends on shares held in my account under the Plan?\nYes. The Agent will receive the regular dividends for all shares of common stock\nheld in your account under the Plan on the dividend record date and will credit the dividends\nto your account on the basis of full and fractional shares held on the record date. At least\n10% of the dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock\nas a dividend reinvestment.\n19. How can I obtain partial or no reinvestment of dividends received on shares held in my\naccount under the Plan?\nThe partial or no dividend reinvestment feature is available only for shares registered\nin your name (i.e. shares not held in the Plan). If you would like to obtain partial or no\ndividend reinvestment on shares of common stock held in your account under the Plan, you\nmust:\n• Submit a written request to the Agent to issue a stock certificate registering\nin your name the whole shares held in your account under the Plan (see\nquestion 21); and\n• If you have not previously done so, submit an Enrollment Form requesting\npartial or no dividend reinvestment of shares registered in your name.\nHowever, at least 10% of any dividends paid on shares of common stock held\nin your name and/or in the Plan on your behalf must be reinvested in common\nstock (see question 11).\nREPORTS TO PARTICIPANTS\n20. How often will account statements be sent to me?\nThe Agent will provide you a statement of account no later than twenty-five days\nfollowing each dividend reinvestment. If you are making purchases, you will receive a\ntransaction confirmation reflecting the specific activity for the month in which the purchase\nwas made. The statement will show the following information for the Investment Date:\n• The total amount invested by the Agent (dividends and cash payments less\nany applicable tax withheld);\n• The number of shares of common stock allocated to your account;\n• The cost per share of the allocated common stock;\n• The number of shares of common stock for which certificates have been\nissued, if any;\n• The number of shares of common stock held in the plan, if any; and\n9\n• The beginning and ending balances in your account.\nCERTIFICATES\n21. When will I receive a certificate for shares purchased under the Plan?\nCertificates for shares of common stock purchased through the Plan will not be issued\nto you unless you request them. All shares credited to your Plan account will be issued to\nthe Agent or its nominee as your agent. The number of shares credited to your account will\nbe shown on your account statement.\nA certificate for any number of whole shares credited to your Plan account will be\nissued upon written request, and the shares represented by that certificate will be withdrawn\nfrom your Plan account. Your request should be mailed to the Agent. You may also request\nany or all full shares to be issued by phone at (844) 388-9273.\nCertificates for fractional shares will not be issued under any circumstances. Upon\nissuance of a certificate, you will have all rights of ownership, and neither the Agent nor\nResources will have any responsibility with respect to the common stock. Withdrawal of\nshares in certificate form does not terminate participation in the Plan (see question 22 for\ninstructions on issuance of certificates when you withdraw from the Plan).\nWITHDRAWAL AND TERMINATION\n22. When and how may I withdraw from the Plan?\nYou may withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving notice to the Agent. The\nwithdrawal date will be no more than 30 days after the Agent’s receipt of your notice. If\nyour request to terminate participation is received more than five (5) days prior to any\ndividend payable date, the dividend will be paid to you in cash. If your request is received\nless than five (5) days prior to any dividend payable date, then the dividend will be reinvested\nand all future dividends will be paid out in cash on all balances.\nAs soon as practicable after the withdrawal date, the Agent will issue to you a\ncertificate for all whole shares of common stock in your account, (see question 21).\nNotice of death, liquidation or other termination of your legal existence will\nconstitute notice of withdrawal from the Plan. Settlement will be made with your legal\nrepresentative or successor in interest and neither the Agent nor Resources will in any way\nbe liable for settlements made with those persons.\n23. What happens to fractional shares when I withdraw from the Plan?\nNo fractional share will be issued to you, but the cash value of any fractional share\nin your account will be paid to you. The fractional share will be valued as of the market\nprice sold. Payment for any fractional share will be made as soon as practicable after the\nwithdrawal date, net of any fees charged by the Agent, and any cash awaiting investment will\nalso be paid at that time.\n10\n24. If I withdraw from the Plan, can I rejoin?\nIf you withdraw from the Plan, you may rejoin at any time by again completing and\nreturning to the Agent an Enrollment Form as long as you are a current shareholder. You\nwill once again become a participant in the Plan within 30 days following the Agent’s receipt\nof a properly completed Enrollment Form (see question 5).\nFEDERAL TAX CONSEQUENCES\n25. What are the federal income tax consequences of participation in the Plan?\nNeither Resources nor the Agent makes any representation as to the income or other\ntax consequences of participation in the Plan. Nevertheless, it is our understanding that you\nmust report as dividend income an amount equal to the dividends paid on stock purchased\non your behalf plus brokerage fees paid by Resources on shares purchased on the open\nmarket. Your federal income tax basis of the common stock received by you under the Plan\nwill be the purchase price of the common stock. The holding period for shares of common\nstock acquired under the Plan will begin on the day following the date as of which the shares\nwere purchased for your account. A whole share resulting from the acquisition of two or\nmore fractional shares on different Investment Dates will have a split holding period.\nYou will not realize any taxable income upon the receipt of certificates for whole\nshares credited to your account under the Plan, either upon a request for a certificate or upon\nwithdrawal from or termination of the Plan. If you receive cash for a fractional share credited\nto your account, however, you will realize a capital gain or loss if the common stock is a\ncapital asset in your hands. Also, in the event of a sale of a fractional share pursuant to\nwithdrawal from the Plan, if the consideration received exceeds fair market value as\ndetermined by Internal Revenue Service regulations, you will have dividend income equal to\nthe difference. Gain or loss will also be realized by you upon the sale or exchange of shares\nafter you withdraw such shares from the Plan. The amount of such gain or loss is the\ndifference between the amount that you receive for each whole or fractional share and your\ntax basis.\nThe preceding discussion concerning tax consequences is provided for\ninformational purposes only. You are urged to seek professional advice with respect to\nyour personal tax situation.\nOTHER INFORMATION\n26. How do I take advantage of the Plan’s stock safekeeping feature?\nYou may deposit with the Agent shares of common stock held in your name. This\nrelieves you of the responsibility for safekeeping of certificates.\nIf you wish to take advantage of the safekeeping feature of the Plan, you should mail\nthe certificates representing your shares to the Agent (see question 3 for the Agent’s address).\nCertificates should be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested,\n11\naccompanied by a completed Enrollment Form specifying that the shares are furnished for\nsafekeeping. The Agent will confirm the receipt of any shares which are delivered for\nsafekeeping by reflecting the deposit of the shares on your account statement (see question\n20 regarding statement of account). Shares delivered for safekeeping will be held in the\nname of the Agent or its nominee, and at least 10% of the dividends received on these shares\nwill be reinvested.\nIf you withdraw from the Plan, the Agent will, as soon as practicable, return all of\nyour shares which are then being held for safekeeping by issuing a new certificate for the\nshares.\n27. What happens if I sell or transfer shares of common stock or acquire additional shares\nof common stock?\nIf you have elected to have all or a part of your cash dividends automatically\nreinvested and you subsequently sell or transfer all or any part of the common stock\nregistered in your account, automatic reinvestments of dividends will continue as long as\nthere are shares of common stock registered in your name or held for you by the Agent or\nuntil termination of enrollment. Similarly, if you acquire additional shares of common stock\nand those shares are registered the same as the participating shares, dividends (or a\npercentage of the dividends as directed by you) paid on the acquired common stock will\nautomatically be reinvested until you terminate your enrollment.\n28. What limitations are imposed on me with regard to common stock held under the Plan?\nYou have no right to draw checks or drafts against your account or to give instructions\nto the Agent to perform any acts not expressly provided for in the Plan. In addition, you\ncannot sell, pledge, assign, encumber, or otherwise dispose of your rights in your individual\naccount.\n29. What happens if Resources has a common stock rights offering, issues a stock dividend,\nor declares a stock split?\nIn the event Resources makes available to holders of common stock rights or warrants\nto purchase additional shares of common stock or other securities, the Agent will sell any\nstock rights or warrants applicable to any common stock held in your account and reinvest\nthe proceeds in common stock as of the next Investment Date. If the rights or warrants have\nno market value, the Agent may allow them to expire.\nAny stock dividend or shares issued pursuant to any stock split received by the Agent\nwith respect to common stock held in your account will immediately be credited to your\naccount.\nIn the event of a stock split, stock dividend or other similar transaction, the number\nof shares covered by this Prospectus will be adjusted accordingly. Transaction processing\nmay either be curtailed or suspended until the completion of any stock dividend, stock split\nor corporate action.\n12\n30. How will my Plan shares be voted at annual or special meetings of shareholders?\nYou have all rights of any other holder of common stock with respect to your shares\ncredited to your Plan account.\nFull and fractional shares held in the Plan for you will be voted as you direct. Proxy\nmaterials will be sent to each participant of record in connection with annual and special\nmeetings of shareholders. The proxy will apply to all shares owned by you, including shares\nheld in your Plan account. All Plan shares will be voted in accordance with the instructions\ngiven by you on the proxy card, if properly signed and delivered.\n31. What are the responsibilities of the Agent and Resources?\nAll notices from the Agent or Resources to you will be sent to your last address of\nrecord. The mailing of a notice to your last address of record will satisfy the Agent’s or\nResources’ duty of giving you notice. Therefore, you must provide prompt notification of\nany change of address. Notice to the Agent or Resources is effective when actually received.\nNeither the Agent nor Resources will be liable for any acts done or any omission to\nact, including, without limitation, any claims of liability:\n• With respect to the prices at which common stock is purchased or sold for\nyour account and the time at which such purchases or sales are made;\n• For any fluctuation in the market value before or after the purchase or sale of\ncommon stock; or\n• For continuation of your account until receipt by the Agent of notice in writing\nof your death, liquidation, or other legal dissolution.\nYou assume all risks inherent in the ownership of any common stock purchased under\nthe Plan, whether or not the actual stock certificate has been issued to you. You have no\nguarantee against a decline in the price or value of the common stock, and Resources assumes\nno obligation to repurchase any shares of common stock purchased under the Plan.\n32. May the Plan be changed or discontinued?\nResources reserves the right to amend the Plan at any time and, upon any such\namendment, to notify you and the Agent of the effective date of the amendment. Resources\nalso reserves the right to terminate the Plan at any time upon giving 30 days’ written notice\nto you and the Agent. Resources also may terminate the Plan immediately, without notice\nto you, in order to correct any material noncompliance of the Plan with any applicable law.\nAs of the date of this Prospectus, 417,802 shares of Resources’ common stock are\navailable for issuance under the Plan. The number of shares covered by the Plan may be\nfurther adjusted from time to time to prevent dilution or enlargement caused by stock splits,\nstock dividends, recapitalizations, mergers, consolidations, combinations or exchanges of\nshares, reorganizations, and similar corporate transactions.\n13\n33. What is the effect of termination or amendment of the Plan?\nNo amendment or termination will affect your interest in the Plan that has accrued\nprior to the date of the amendment or termination. In the event of the termination of the Plan,\nthe Agent will make a distribution of common stock and cash as if you had withdrawn from\nthe Plan as soon as practicable, but not later than 30 days after the termination of the Plan.\nYou will incur no service charges or other fees upon such termination.\n34. How is the Plan to be interpreted?\nAny questions of interpretation arising under the Plan will be determined by\nResources, and any such determination shall be final.\n14\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nFrom time to time, Resources may publish forward-looking statements relating to such matters as\nanticipated financial performance, business prospects, technological developments, new products,\nresearch and development activities and similar matters. These statements are based on\nmanagement’s current expectations and information available at the time of such statements and\nare believed to be reasonable and are made in good faith. The Private Securities Litigation Reform\nAct of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. In order to comply with the\nterms of the safe harbor, the Company notes that a variety of factors could cause the Company’s\nactual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations\nexpressed in the Company’s forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties that may\naffect the operations, performance, development and results of the Company’s business include,\nbut are not limited to, the following: (i) general economic conditions both locally and nationally;\n(ii) impact of environmental legislation or regulations regarding limitations on carbon dioxide\nemissions or other similar restrictions; (iii) impact of potential increased regulatory oversight and\ncompliance requirements due to financial, environmental, safety and system integrity laws and\nregulations; (iv) failure to obtain timely rate relief from regulatory authorities for increasing\noperating or gas costs; (v) the potential loss of large-volume industrial customers to alternate fuels,\nfacility closings or production changes; (vi) security breach or cyber-attacks on the Company’s\ncomputer systems could corrupt financial information, expose confidential personal information or\ncompromise the safe and reliable delivery of natural gas; (vii) increases in interest rates; (viii) effect\nof weather conditions and natural disasters on production and distribution facilities and the related\neffect on supply availability and price; (ix) changes in accounting regulations and practices, which\ncould change the accounting treatment for certain transactions; (x) access to capital markets and the\navailability of debt and equity financing to support future capital expenditures; (xi) volatility in\nactuarially determined benefit costs and plan asset performance; (xii) increased customer\ndelinquencies and conservation efforts resulting from high fuel costs, difficult economic conditions\nand/or colder weather; (xiii) volatility in the price and availability of natural gas; (xiv) failure or\ndelay of the Company’s investment in the Mountain Valley Pipeline; (xv) failure or demand for\nnatural gas; and (xvi) impact of potential increases in corporate income tax rates and other taxes.\nAll of these factors are difficult to predict and many are beyond the Company’s control.\nAccordingly, while the Company believes its forward-looking statements to be reasonable, there\ncan be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived\nfrom them will be realized.\nWhen used in the Company’s documents or news releases, the words, “anticipate,” “believe,”\n“intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “budget,” “assume,”\n“indicate” or similar words or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “can,”\n“could” or “may” are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements\nreflect the Company’s current expectations only as of the date they are made. The Company\nassumes no duty to update these statements should expectations change or actual results differ\nfrom current expectations except as required by applicable laws and regulations.\n15\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\nWe intend to use the proceeds we receive from purchases under the Plan for capital\nexpenditures and for other general corporate purposes of Resources and, in our discretion, of our\nwholly owned subsidiaries, subject to any regulatory approvals. We are unable to estimate the\namount of proceeds that will be devoted to any specific purpose.\nLEGAL MATTERS\nWoods Rogers PLC has advised Resources on certain legal matters with respect to the Plan\nand the registration of certain shares of common stock issuable under the Plan, including an opinion\nas to the legality of such shares. Several principals of the firm of Woods Rogers PLC and members\nof their immediate families beneficially own shares of common stock of Resources.\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION\nResources is subject to the informational requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, and files reports, proxy statements, and other information with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\n1. Basis of Presentation\nResources is an energy services company primarily engaged in the sale and distribution of natural gas. The condensed consolidated financial\nstatements include the accounts of Resources and its wholly owned subsidiaries: Roanoke Gas, Diversified Energy and Midstream.\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of\nonly normal recurring accruals) necessary to fairly present Resources' financial position as of June 30, 2024, cash flows for the nine months\nended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations, comprehensive income, and changes in stockholders' equity for the three and\nnine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 are not indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024 as quarterly earnings are affected by the highly seasonal nature of the\nbusiness and weather conditions generally result in greater earnings during the winter months.\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented under the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nPursuant to those rules, certain information and note disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance\nwith GAAP have been condensed or omitted. Although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate, the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and the related notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes contained in the\nCompany’s Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023. The September 30, 2023 consolidated balance sheet was included in the\nCompany’s audited financial statements included in Form 10-K.\nRoanoke Gas' line of credit is renewed annually in March, and there was $7.6 million outstanding under the line of credit at June 30, 2024. In\nMarch and May 2024, Midstream refinanced nearly $32 million of long-term debt that was scheduled to mature in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025.\nSee Notes 6 and 7 for a discussion of these transactions. In the future, there may be circumstances where such refinancing is not entirely within\nthe Company's control and disclosure under ASU 2014-15 is warranted.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results\ncould differ from those estimates.\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in the Company's\nForm 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nCertain amounts previously disclosed have been reclassified to conform to current year presentations.\n7\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRecently Issued or Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) - Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate\nReform on Financial Reporting. In combination with ASU 2021-01 and ASU 2022-06, the ASU provides temporary optional guidance to\nease the potential burden in accounting for and recognizing the effects of reference rate change on financial reporting. The new guidance applies\nspecifically to contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR, or any other referenced rate that is expected to be discontinued due\nto reference rate reform. The new guidance is effective for the Company through December 31, 2024. The Intercontinental Exchange\nBenchmark Administration, the administrator for LIBOR and other inter-bank offered rates, announced that the LIBOR rates for one-day,\none-month, six-month and one-year would cease publication in June 2023 and that no new financial contracts may use LIBOR after December\n31, 2021. Subsequent to June 30, 2023, the one-day, one-month, six-month, and one-year LIBOR settings will continue to be published under\nan unrepresentative synthetic methodology until the end of September 2024 in order to bridge the transition to other reference rates. The\nCompany has transitioned all LIBOR-based variable rate notes to a new reference rate as of June 30, 2024. Each of the revised notes has a\ncorresponding swap that was also transitioned to align with the related notes. See Note 7 and Note 9 for more information.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures. The new guidance is designed to provide users of financial statements with enhanced disclosures regarding the information\nprovided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and how the CODM uses the information in assessing the performance of each\nsegment. The Company is currently evaluating the new standard and determining the additional disclosure requirements. The new guidance is\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2024.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The new\nguidance requires that on an annual basis public business entities disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation table and provide\nadditional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (items equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed\nby multiplying pretax income or loss by the applicable statutory rate). The required disclosures will provide more granularity regarding the\npayment of income taxes to federal, state and foreign entities. The Company does not expect certain requirements of this ASU to have a\nsignificant impact to its current disclosures as all of its operations are domestic and reside in two states. Changes to the rate reconciliation table\nwill result in additional disclosure. The new guidance is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15,\n2024.\nIn March 2024, the SEC issued its final rule that requires registrants to provide climate disclosures in their annual reports and registration\nstatements. The new guidance requires that registrants provide information about specified financial statement effects of severe weather events\nand other natural conditions, certain carbon offsets and renewable energy certificates, and material impacts on financial estimates and\nassumptions in the footnotes to financial statements. The rule also requires additional disclosures outside of the financial statements including\ngovernance and oversight of material climate-related risks, the material impact of climate risks on the company's strategy, business model and\noutlook, risk management processes for material climate-related risks and material climate targets and goals. The Company is currently\nevaluating the new rule and determining the impact of the additional disclosure requirements, as well as the data needed and the source of that\ndata to comply with required disclosures. The new rule is currently effective for fiscal years beginning in 2027 for smaller reporting companies.\nThe final rule was scheduled to become effective May 28, 2024; however, the SEC has voluntarily stayed the rule's effective date pending\njudicial review. Depending on when the legal challenges are resolved, the mandatory compliance date may be retained or delayed.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued by the FASB, SEC or other standard-setting bodies are not currently applicable to the\nCompany or are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n2. Revenue\nThe Company assesses new contracts and identifies related performance obligations for promises to transfer distinct goods or services to the\ncustomer. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations have been satisfied. In the case of Roanoke Gas, the Company contracts with\nits customers for the sale and/or delivery of natural gas.\n8\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC.

Based on its evaluation, the\nCompany has concluded that these tariff-based revenues fall within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Tariff\nrates represent the transaction price. Performance obligations created under these tariff-based sales include the cost of natural gas sold to\ncustomers (commodity) and the cost of transporting natural gas through the Company’s distribution system to customers (delivery). The\ndelivery of natural gas to customers results in the satisfaction of the Company’s respective performance obligations over time.\nAll customers are billed monthly based on consumption as measured by metered usage with payments due 20 days from the rendering of the\nbill. Revenue is recognized as bills are issued for natural gas that has been delivered or transported. In addition, the Company utilizes the\npractical expedient that allows an entity to recognize the invoiced amount as revenue, if that amount corresponds to the value received by the\ncustomer. Since customers are billed tariff rates, there is no variable consideration in the transaction price.\n9\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nUnbilled revenue is included in residential and commercial revenues in the preceding table. Natural gas consumption is estimated for the period\nsubsequent to the last billed date and up through the last day of the month. Estimated volumes and approved tariff rates are utilized to calculate\nunbilled revenue. The following month, the unbilled estimate is reversed, the actual usage is billed and a new unbilled estimate is calculated. The\nCompany obtains metered usage for transportation and interruptible customers at the end of each month, thereby eliminating any unbilled\nconsideration for these rate classes.\nOther revenues\nOther revenues primarily consist of miscellaneous fees and charges, utility-related revenues not directly billed to utility customers and billings for\nnon-utility activities. Customers are invoiced monthly based on services provided for these activities. The Company utilizes the practical\nexpedient allowing revenue to be recognized based on invoiced amounts. The transaction price is based on a contractually predetermined rate\nschedule; therefore, the transaction price represents total value to the customer and no variable price consideration exists.\nAlternative revenue program revenues\nARPs, which fall outside the scope of ASC 606, are SCC approved mechanisms that allow for the adjustment of revenues for certain broad,\nexternal factors, or for additional billings if the entity achieves certain performance targets. The Company's ARPs include its WNA, which\nadjusts revenues for the effects of weather temperature variations as compared to the 30-year average; the SAVE Plan over/under collection\nmechanism, which adjusts revenues for the differences between SAVE Plan revenues billed to customers and the revenue earned, as calculated\nbased on the timing and extent of infrastructure replacement completed during the period; and the RNG over/under collection mechanism,\nwhich adjusts revenues similar to the SAVE Plan, but is calculated based on the timing and costs associated with owning, operating and\nmaintaining the RNG facility. These amounts are ultimately collected from, or returned to, customers through future rate changes as approved\nby the SCC.\nCustomer accounts receivable and liabilities\nAccounts receivable, as reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, includes both billed and unbilled customer revenues, as well as\namounts that are not related to customers. The balances of customer receivables are provided below:\nCurrent Assets Current Liabilities\nTrade accounts Unbilled Customer Customer\nreceivable(1) revenue(1) credit balances deposits\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ 2,782,025 $ 1,240,097 $ 1,972,132 $ 1,476,321\nBalance at June 30, 2024 3,783,662 1,423,346 1,075,453 1,586,618\nIncrease (decrease) $ 1,001,637 $ 183,249 $ (896,679) $ 110,297\n(1) Included in accounts receivable in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Furthermore, the Company did not incur any significant costs to\nobtain contracts.\n3. Segment Information\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by\nthe Company's executive management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company uses operating income\nand equity in earnings to assess segment performance.\nIntersegment transactions are recorded at cost.\nThe reportable segments disclosed herein are defined as follows:\nGas Utility - The natural gas segment of the Company generates revenue from its tariff rates and other regulatory mechanisms through which it\nprovides the sale and distribution of natural gas to its residential, commercial and industrial customers.\n10\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n4. Rates and Regulatory Matters\nThe SCC exercises regulatory authority over the natural gas operations of Roanoke Gas. Such regulation encompasses terms, conditions and\nrates to be charged to customers for natural gas service, safety standards, service extension and depreciation.\nIn response to continued inflationary pressures, Roanoke Gas filed a general rate application on February 2, 2024 with the SCC seeking to\nincrease its non-gas base rates by $4.33 million and its permitted return on equity from 9.44% to 10.35% reflecting its higher cost of capital,\nincluding higher interest expense. The SCC permitted the Company to implement its new rates on an interim basis for customer billings on or\nafter July 1, 2024, subject to refund. The SCC’s review of Roanoke Gas’ filing is underway and a hearing has been set for November 7,\n2024.\nThe SCC requires regulated utilities within the state to perform a depreciation study every five years and to submit the study for SCC approval.\nThe Company's current depreciation rates are based on the last depreciation study approved by the SCC in 2019. As part of the general rate\napplication filed in February 2024, the Company submitted its requisite depreciation study and proposed new depreciation rates. In July 2024,\nthe Company received administrative approval from the SCC staff that authorized the new depreciation rates. The new depreciation rates will\nresult in a small decrease in depreciation expense for fiscal 2024, as the new depreciation rates are effective retroactive to October 1, 2023.\nThis adjustment to depreciation expense will be reflected in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\nOn December 2, 2022, Roanoke Gas filed an expedited rate application with the SCC seeking an $8.55 million annual increase in its non-gas\nbase rates, of which $4.05 million was being recovered through the SAVE Rider. The proposed interim rates went into effect January 1, 2023,\nsubject to refund. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company reached a settlement with the SCC staff on all outstanding issues in the\ncase. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company agreed to an annual incremental revenue requirement of $7.45 million. The Company\nbegan billing the approved rates effective October 1, 2023. The SCC issued its Final Order in the matter on December 19, 2023 in which it\napproved the settlement agreement in its entirety. Refunds, which had previously been accrued, were made to customers in February 2024.\nOn August 31, 2023, the SCC approved the Company's new SAVE Plan and Rider with rates effective October 1, 2023. Under this plan,\nRoanoke Gas can recover costs associated with an estimated $8.5 million in SAVE eligible investment in fiscal 2024 and an estimated\ncumulative investment of $49.5 million over the proposed five-year plan period ending September 30, 2028. The plan was approved with a\nrevenue requirement of approximately $366,000 for fiscal 2024. On June 28, 2024, Roanoke Gas filed for approval of an updated annual\nSAVE Rider rate to become effective October 1, 2024. The proposed SAVE rate is based on an estimated $9.13 million of SAVE eligible\ninvestment during fiscal 2025 which results in a revenue requirement of $1.53 million. The Company expects a Final Order from the SCC in\nSeptember 2024.\nBy Order dated September 1, 2023, the SCC approved the Company’s RNG Rider effective for the period October 1, 2023 through\nSeptember 30, 2024. In its Order, the SCC directed the Company to file an application to update the RNG Rider by May 30, 2024. In\ncompliance with the SCC’s directive, on May 30, 2024, Roanoke Gas filed for an update to its annual RNG Rider to become effective\nOctober 1, 2024. The revenue requirement associated with the proposed RNG Rider is $1.56 million, offset by the sale of environmental\ncredits in the amount of $1.11 million as well as credits for the over-recovery of costs during the prior year of approximately $35,000, resulting\nin a net revenue requirement of approximately $415,000. The Company expects a Final Order from the SCC in September 2024.\nRoanoke Gas is authorized by the SCC to acquire certain natural gas distribution assets from a local housing authority at five separate\napartment complexes, located in the Company’s service territory. The housing authority renews existing natural gas distribution facilities to\ninclude mains and services then transfers ownership of these facilities to Roanoke Gas. In turn, Roanoke Gas assumes responsibility for the\noperation and maintenance of these assets and recognizes a gain related to the asset acquisition equal to the cost associated with the renewal.\n12\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe assets of two complexes were transferred to Roanoke Gas in fiscal 2022. On September 29, 2023, the housing authority transferred the\nassets from one additional apartment complex to Roanoke Gas and the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $311,000 during\nthe fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The authority is substantially complete with renewing the fourth complex, which may be transferred to\nRoanoke Gas before the end of this fiscal year. The timing of funding and the completion of the asset renewals for the final complex is uncertain\nat this time.\n5. Other Investments\nMidstream owns a less than 1% equity investment in the LLC that owns the MVP, which went into service in June 2024. Midstream is also a\nless than 1% investor, accounted for under the cost method, in Southgate, which is in the design and permitting phase.\nWhile under construction, AFUDC provided the majority of the income recognized by Midstream. The amount of AFUDC recognized during\nthe current and prior year is included in the equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate in the tables below. AFUDC ceased in June 2024\nwhen the pipeline went into service.\nThe Company participates in the earnings of the MVP proportionate to its level of investment. With the MVP in operation, the Company\nrecognizes its share of earnings from the MVP, favorably adjusted for a basis difference between the Company's proportional share of assets\nand its carrying value that arose when the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of its investment in 2022. This basis\ndifference will be amortized over the operational life of the MVP. Midstream assesses the value of its investment in the LLC on at least a\nquarterly basis, and no impairment indicators were identified in fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2024 to date.\nFunding for Midstream's investments has been provided through equity contributions from Resources and unsecured promissory notes as\ndetailed in Note 7.\nInvestment balances of MVP and Southgate, as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, are reflected in the table below:\nBalance Sheet location: June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nOther Assets:\nMVP $ 20,076,299 $ 17,096,476\nSouthgate 99,360 90,617\nInvestment in unconsolidated affiliates $ 20,175,659 $ 17,187,093\nThree Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30,\nIncome Statement location: 2024 2023 2024 2023\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate $ 282,604 $ 519,482 $ 2,979,823 $ 523,581\nJune 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nUndistributed earnings, net of income taxes, of MVP in retained earnings, excluding\nimpairment $ 11,896,616 $ 9,683,797\nThe undistributed earnings does not include the impairment of the investment in the LLC.\n13\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n6. Short-Term Debt\nOn March 24, 2023, Roanoke Gas entered into an unsecured Revolving Note in the principal amount of $25 million. On March 31, 2024, the\nRevolving Note was amended to extend the maturity date to March 31, 2025. Other key terms and requirements of the Revolving Note were\nretained. The Revolving Note's variable interest rate is based upon Term SOFR plus 110 basis points and provides for multiple tier borrowing\nlimits to accommodate seasonal borrowing demands. The Company's total available borrowing limits during the term of the Revolving Note\ncurrently range from $15 million to $25 million. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had an outstanding balance of $7,615,825 under the\nRevolving Note.\n7. Long-Term Debt\nOn March 6, 2024, Midstream entered into the Sixth Amendment to Credit Agreement and related Promissory Notes on the non-revolving\ncredit facility. The Sixth Amendment revised the interest rate from Term SOFR plus 2.00% to Term SOFR plus 2.00% subject to adjustment\nto Term SOFR plus 1.75% and Term SOFR plus 1.55% upon meeting certain milestones. The Sixth Amendment also consolidated the\nPromissory Notes to one Promissory Note with one lender, increased the available non-revolving credit facility to $25 million, and extended the\nmaturity date to December 31, 2025. All other terms and requirements remain unchanged.\nOn May 2, 2024, Midstream established a new $9 million revolving line of credit facility. The interest rate on the borrowings under the facility is\nDaily Simple SOFR plus 2.215%; the arrangement included a 0.40% upfront fee and 0.125% unused line fee. The facility matures on May\n2, 2026.\nOn May 29, 2024, Midstream paid in full the $9 million note payable that was set to mature June 1, 2024.\nOn June 28, 2023, Midstream amended and restated its $14 million and $8 million Term Notes initially entered into on June 12, 2019 and\nNovember 1, 2021, respectively. The amendments revised each of the original Term Note's interest rate from LIBOR plus 115 basis points to\nDaily Simple SOFR plus 126.448 basis points, effective July 1, 2023. On March 6, 2024, Midstream further amended and restated its $8\nmillion Term Note. The amendment suspended quarterly principal payments beginning April 1, 2024 through January 1, 2025. Principal\npayments will commence again on April 1, 2025. All other terms and requirements of the Term Notes were retained. In conjunction with the\noriginal amendment of the Term Notes in June 2023, Midstream also amended the corresponding interest rate swaps associated with the Term\nNotes. The amendments provided for the floating rates on the interest rate swaps to continue to match the rate of the associated notes as well\nas retain the overall fixed interest rates of 3.24% and 2.443%, respectively. The interest rate swap related to the $8 million Term Note was not\namended on March 6, 2024, but the Company did re-designate its hedge documentation to address the suspension of repayments.\nOn March 24, 2023, Roanoke Gas amended and restated the $10 million Term Note originally entered into on September 24, 2021. The\namendment revised the original Term Note's interest rate from LIBOR plus 100 basis points to Term SOFR plus 100 basis points. All other\nterms and requirements of the original Term Note were retained. The effective date of the Amended Term Note was April 1, 2023. In\naddition, on April 3, 2023, the interest rate swap was amended to align with the Amended Term Note and retained the fixed interest rate of\n2.49%. In connection with the Revolving Note and Amended Term Note, Roanoke Gas also amended and restated the Loan Agreement\ndated September 24, 2021.

Derivatives and Hedging\nThe Company’s hedging and derivative policy allows management to enter into derivatives for the purpose of managing the commodity and\nfinancial market risks of its business operations, including the price of natural gas and the cost of borrowed funds. This policy specifically\nprohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes.\nThe Company has four interest rate swaps associated with certain of its variable rate debt as of June 30, 2024. Roanoke Gas\nhas two variable-rate term notes in the amounts of $15 million and $10 million, with corresponding swap agreements to effectively convert the\nvariable interest rates into fixed rates of 2.00% and 2.49%, respectively. Midstream has two swap agreements corresponding to the variable\nrate term notes with original principal amounts of $14 million and $8 million. The swap agreement pertaining to the $14 million note effectively\nconverts the variable interest rate into a fixed rate of 3.24%. The swap agreement pertaining to the $8 million note remains in place and was\nconcurrently re-designated to hedge an applicable portion of the note taking into account the temporary suspension of amortization described in\nNote 7, and converts that portion of the note to a fixed rate of 2.443%. The swaps qualify as cash flow hedges with changes in fair value\nreported in other comprehensive income. No portion of the swaps were deemed ineffective during the periods presented.\nThe fair value of the current and non-current portions of the interest rate swaps are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets\nunder the caption interest rate swaps. The table in Note 11 reflects the effect on income and other comprehensive income of the Company's\ncash flow hedges.\n9. Fair Value Measurements\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes each input to the valuation method\nused to measure fair value of financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured and reported on a fair value basis into one of the\nfollowing three levels:\nLevel 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the\nmeasurement date.\nLevel 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices in Level 1 that are either for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or\nsimilar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, or inputs\nthat are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\nLevel 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement\ndate, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions.\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to\nunobservable inputs (Level 3).\n17\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as required by\nexisting guidance and the fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy:\nFair Value Measurements - June 30, 2024\nQuoted Significant\nPrices Other Significant\nin Active Observable Unobservable\nFair Markets Inputs Inputs\nValue (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nInterest rate swaps $ 3,236,627 $ — $ 3,236,627 $ —\nTotal $ 3,236,627 $ — $ 3,236,627 $ —\nLiabilities:\nNatural gas purchases $ 1,955,937 $ — $ 1,955,937 $ —\nTotal $ 1,955,937 $ — $ 1,955,937 $ —\nFair Value Measurements - September 30, 2023\nQuoted Significant\nPrices Other Significant\nin Active Observable Unobservable\nFair Markets Inputs Inputs\nValue (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nInterest rate swaps $ 4,617,455 $ — $ 4,617,455 $ —\nTotal $ 4,617,455 $ — $ 4,617,455 $ —\nLiabilities:\nNatural gas purchases $ 1,022,662 $ — $ 1,022,662 $ —\nTotal $ 1,022,662 $ — $ 1,022,662 $ —\nThe fair value of the interest rate swaps are determined by using the counterparty's proprietary models and certain assumptions regarding past,\npresent and future market conditions.\nUnder the asset management contract, a timing difference can exist between the payment for natural gas purchases and the actual receipt of\nsuch purchases. Payments are made based on a predetermined monthly volume with the price based on weighted average first of the month\nindex prices corresponding to the month of the scheduled payment. At June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had recorded\nin accounts payable the estimated fair value of the liability valued at the corresponding first of month index prices for which the liability is\nexpected to be settled.\n18\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe Company’s nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis consist of its AROs. The AROs are measured\nat fair value at initial recognition based on expected future cash flows required to settle the obligation.\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, borrowings under line-of-credit, accounts payable (with the exception of\nthe timing difference under the asset management contracts), customer credit balances and customer deposits is a reasonable estimate of fair\nvalue due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments. In addition, the carrying amount of the variable rate line-of-credit is a\nreasonable approximation of its fair value.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are not adjusted to fair value in the financial\nstatements:\nFair Value Measurements - June 30, 2024\nQuoted Significant\nPrices Other Significant\nin Active Observable Unobservable\nCarrying Markets Inputs Inputs\nValue (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nLiabilities:\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt $ 400,000 $ — $ — $ 400,000\nNotes payable 136,615,000 — — 132,886,828\nTotal $ 137,015,000 $ — $ — $133,286,828\nFair Value Measurements - September 30, 2023\nQuoted Significant\nPrices Other Significant\nin Active Observable Unobservable\nCarrying Markets Inputs Inputs\nValue (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nLiabilities:\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt $ 10,975,000 $ — $ — $ 10,975,000\nNotes payable 126,100,000 — — 120,298,658\nTotal $ 137,075,000 $ — $ — $131,273,658\nThe fair value of long-term debt is estimated by discounting the future cash flows of the fixed rate debt based on the underlying Treasury rate or\nother Treasury instruments with a corresponding maturity period and estimated credit spread extrapolated based on market conditions since the\nissuance of the debt.\nASC 825, Financial Instruments, requires disclosures regarding concentrations of credit risk from financial instruments. Cash equivalents are\ninvestments in high-grade, short-term securities (original maturity less than three months), placed with financially sound institutions. Accounts\nreceivable are from a diverse group of customers including individuals and small and large companies in various industries. No individual\ncustomer amounted to more than 5% of total accounts receivable at June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The Company maintains certain\ncredit standards with its customers and requires a customer deposit if warranted.\n19\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n10.

Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rates for the three-month and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 reflected in the table below are less than the\ncombined federal and state statutory rate of 25.74%. The reduction to the effective tax rates for the three-month and nine-month periods\nended June 30, 2024 is due to additional tax deductions from the amortization of excess deferred taxes and amortization of RNG tax credits\ndeferred as a regulatory liability. The reduction to the effective tax rates for the three-month and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2023 is\ndue to additional tax deductions from the amortization of excess deferred taxes and amortization of R&D tax credits deferred as a regulatory\nliability.\nThree Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nEffective tax rate 23.1% 23.8% 23.5% 23.7%\nThe Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and state income tax returns in Virginia and West Virginia, and thus subject to\nexaminations by federal and state tax authorities.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company’s regulated operations follow the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC 980, Regulated Operations. A regulated\ncompany may defer costs that have been or are expected to be recovered from customers in a period different from the period in which the\ncosts would ordinarily be charged to expense by an unregulated enterprise. When this situation occurs, costs are deferred as assets in the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheet (regulatory assets) and amortized into expense over periods when such amounts are reflected in\ncustomer rates. Additionally, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and\nfor current collection in customer rates of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future (regulatory liabilities). In the event the provisions\nof ASC 980 no longer apply to any or all regulatory assets or liabilities, the Company would write off such amounts and include the effects in\nthe condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income in the period which ASC 980 no longer applied.\nRegulatory assets included in the Company’s accompanying balance sheets are as follows:\nJune 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nAssets:\nCurrent Assets:\nRegulatory assets:\nAccrued WNA revenues $ 1,918,161 $ 414,689\nUnder-recovery of gas costs 316,729 1,383,340\nUnder-recovery of RNG revenues 1,215,411 797,804\nAccrued pension 60,755 243,017\nOther deferred expenses 12,762 15,426\nTotal current 3,523,818 2,854,276\nOther Non-Current Assets:\nRegulatory assets:\nPremium on early retirement of debt 1,170,418 1,256,059\nAccrued pension 3,786,265 3,786,265\nOther deferred expenses 314,999 347,121\nTotal non-current 5,271,682 5,389,445\nTotal regulatory assets $ 8,795,500 $ 8,243,721\n22\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC.

Commitments and Contingencies\nRoanoke Gas currently holds the only franchises and/or CPCNs to distribute natural gas in its service area. These franchises generally extend\nfor multi-year periods and are renewable by the municipalities, including exclusive franchises in the cities of Roanoke and Salem and the Town\nof Vinton, Virginia. All three franchises are set to expire December 31, 2035. In 2019, the SCC issued an order granting a CPCN to furnish\ngas to all of Franklin County. Unlike the CPCNs for the other counties served by Roanoke Gas, the Franklin County CPCN was scheduled to\nterminate within five years of the date of the order if Roanoke Gas did not furnish gas service to the designated service area. In November\n2023, the SCC granted Roanoke Gas a three-year extension on the CPCN. Roanoke Gas has commissioned its new gate station in Franklin\nCounty, and expects to deliver gas to its first customer in Franklin County this fiscal year.\nDue to the nature of the natural gas distribution business, the Company has entered into agreements with both suppliers and pipelines for natural\ngas commodity purchases, storage capacity and pipeline delivery capacity. The Company utilizes asset managers to assist in optimizing the use\nof its transportation, storage rights and gas supply in order to provide a secure and reliable source of natural gas to its customers. The\nCompany also has storage and pipeline capacity contracts to store and deliver natural gas to the Company’s distribution system. Roanoke Gas\nis currently served directly by three primary pipelines that deliver all of the natural gas supplied to the Company’s distribution system.\nDepending on weather conditions and the level of customer demand, failure of one of these transmission pipelines could have a major adverse\nimpact on the Company's ability to deliver natural gas to its customers and its results of operations. With the MVP now in service, there is an\nenhanced reliability in the system and the Company's ability to meet demands for natural gas.\n23\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n15. Employee Benefit Plans\nThe Company has both a pension plan and a postretirement plan. The pension plan covers the Company’s employees hired before January 1,\n2017 and provides a retirement benefit based on years of service and employee compensation. The postretirement plan, covering employees\nhired before January 1, 2000, provides certain health care and supplemental life insurance benefits to retired employees who meet specific age\nand service requirements.

Service cost is included in operations and maintenance expense in the condensed consolidated statements\nof income.\nFor the three-month and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2024, no funding contributions were made to the pension plan or postretirement\nplan. The Company is not currently planning to make any funding contributions to either plan for the remainder of fiscal 2024.\n16. Leases\nThe Company leases certain assets including office space and land classified as operating leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is\na lease at inception of the agreement based on the terms and conditions in the contract. The operating lease ROU assets and operating lease\nliabilities are recognized as the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most of the\nleases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an estimate of its secured incremental borrowing rate based on the information\navailable at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The incremental borrowing rate is determined by\nmanagement aided by inquiries of a third party.\nLease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. The Company made an\naccounting policy election that payments under agreements with an initial term of 12 months or less will not be included on the condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet but will be recognized when paid in the consolidated statements of operations.\n24\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company entered into a land lease in conjunction with its RNG facility that has a 20-year term with two five-year\nrenewal options that are not considered part of the ROU asset and liability as the decision to elect said options will be made by the Company in\nthe future. The Company also has three other operating leases with original terms ranging from 3 to 6 years.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 2 – MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains forward-looking statements that relate to future transactions, events or expectations. In addition, Resources may publish\nforward-looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance, business prospects, technological developments, new\nproducts, research and development activities, operational impacts and similar matters. These statements are based on management’s current\nexpectations and information available at the time of such statements and are believed to be reasonable and are made in good faith. The Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. In order to comply with the terms of the safe\nharbor, the Company notes that a variety of factors could cause the Company’s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated\nresults or other expectations expressed in the Company’s forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations,\nperformance, development and results of the Company’s business include, but are not limited to, those set forth in the following discussion and within\nItem 1A “Risk Factors” in the Company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. All of these factors are difficult to predict and many are beyond the\nCompany’s control. Accordingly, while the Company believes its forward-looking statements to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that they\nwill approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized. When used in the Company’s documents or news\nreleases, the words, “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “predict,” “target,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “budget,”\n“assume,” “indicate” or similar words or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “can,” “could,” “may” or \"might\" are intended\nto identify forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements reflect the Company’s current expectations only as of the date they are made. The Company assumes no duty to\nupdate these statements should expectations change or actual results differ from current expectations except as required by applicable laws and\nregulations.\nThe three-month and nine-month earnings presented herein should not be considered as reflective of the Company’s consolidated financial results for\nthe fiscal year ending September 30, 2024. The total revenues and margins realized during the first nine months reflect higher billings due to the\nweather-sensitive nature of the natural gas business.\nOverview\nResources is an energy services company primarily engaged in the regulated sale and distribution of natural gas to approximately 62,800 residential,\ncommercial and industrial customers in Roanoke, Virginia and surrounding localities through its Roanoke Gas subsidiary. Midstream, a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Resources, is a less than 1% investor in both the MVP and Southgate. The utility operations of Roanoke Gas are regulated by the\nSCC, which oversees the terms, conditions and rates charged to customers for natural gas service, safety standards, extension of service and\ndepreciation. The Company is also subject to regulation from the United States Department of Transportation in regard to the construction,\noperation, maintenance, safety and integrity of its transmission and distribution pipelines. FERC regulates the prices for the transportation and\ndelivery of natural gas to the Company’s distribution system and underground storage services. In addition, the Company is subject to other\nregulations which are not necessarily industry specific.\n26\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNearly all of the Company’s revenues are derived from the sale and delivery of natural gas to Roanoke Gas customers based on rates and fees\nauthorized by the SCC. These rates are designed to provide the Company with the opportunity to recover its gas and non-gas expenses and to earn\na reasonable rate of return for shareholders based on normal weather. These rates are determined based on various rate applications filed with the\nSCC. Generally, investments related to extending service to new customers are recovered through the additional revenues generated by the non-gas\nbase rates in place at that time. The investment in replacing and upgrading existing infrastructure, as well as recovering increases in non-gas expenses\ndue to inflationary pressures, regulatory requirements or operational needs, are generally not recoverable until a formal rate application is filed to\ninclude the additional investment and higher costs, and new non-gas base rates are approved.\nBeginning January 1, 2023, Roanoke Gas implemented interim, non-gas base rates designed to provide $8.55 million in additional annual revenues in\nresponse to higher operating costs and to recover its investment in non-SAVE related projects since the prior non-gas base rate increase in fiscal\n2019. Revenues from the SAVE Plan and Rider were incorporated into the interim, non-gas base rates. On December 19, 2023, the SCC issued a\nfinal order approving a non-gas base rate increase of $7.45 million. The order also directed Roanoke Gas to refund the excess revenues collected\nduring the time the interim rates were in effect with interest. Refunds to customers, which were accrued in fiscal 2023 and reflected in regulatory\nliabilities, were made in February 2024. On February 2, 2024, primarily in response to continued inflationary pressures, Roanoke Gas filed for a\nnon-gas base rate increase of $4.33 million, which reflected an increase in the Company's authorized return on equity from 9.44% to 10.35%. The\nnew interim non-gas base rates went into effect for customer billings on or after July 1, 2024, subject to refund. These additional revenues are\nsubject to refund pending audit, which is currently underway. A hearing has been set for November 7, 2024. See the Regulatory section for\nadditional information.\nDuring the most recent quarter, the LLC completed and received all necessary approvals to initiate service. The MVP went into service in June\n2024, and the shipper agreements became active on July 1, 2024. See the Equity Investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline section for additional\ninformation on the MVP.\nAs the Company’s business is seasonal in nature, volatility in winter weather and the commodity price of natural gas can impact the effectiveness of\nthe Company’s rates in recovering its costs and providing a reasonable return for its shareholders. In order to mitigate the effect of weather variations\nand other factors not provided for in the Company's base rates, Roanoke Gas has certain approved rate mechanisms in place that help provide\nstability in earnings, adjust for volatility in the price of natural gas and provide a return on qualified infrastructure investment. These mechanisms\ninclude the SAVE Rider, WNA, ICC, RNG Rider and PGA.\nThe SAVE Plan and Rider provides the Company with a mechanism through which it recovers costs related to qualified SAVE infrastructure\ninvestments on a prospective basis, until a rate application is filed incorporating these investments in non-gas base rates. SAVE Plan revenues\nincreased by approximately $127,000 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 and decreased by approximately $833,000 for the nine-\nmonth period ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same periods last year, reflecting the movement of the SAVE Plan revenues into the new non-\ngas base rates on January 1, 2023. Roanoke Gas filed and received approval from the SCC for a new SAVE Plan and Rider with new rates placed\ninto effect on October 1, 2023 that is expected to result in approximately $366,000 in SAVE-related revenues during fiscal 2024. Additional\ninformation regarding the SAVE Plan and Rider is provided under the Regulatory section below.\n27\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe WNA mechanism reduces the volatility in earnings due to the variability in temperatures during the heating season. The WNA is based on the\nmost recent 30-year temperature average and provides the Company with a level of earnings protection when weather is warmer than normal and\nprovides its customers with price protection when weather is colder than normal. The WNA allows the Company to recover from its customers the\nlost margin (excluding gas costs) from warmer-than-normal weather and correspondingly requires the Company to refund the excess margin earned\nfor colder-than-normal weather. The WNA mechanism used by the Company is based on a linear regression model that determines the value of a\nsingle heating degree day and thereby estimates the revenue adjustment based on weather variance from normal. Any billings or refunds related to\nthe WNA are completed following each WNA year, which extends for the 12-month period from April to March. For the three and nine\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, the Company accrued approximately $821,000 and $3,689,000 in additional revenues under the WNA model for\nweather that was 48% and 19% warmer than normal, respectively, compared to approximately $290,000 and $2,902,000 in additional revenues for\nweather that was 18% and 15% warmer than normal for the corresponding periods last year. The WNA balance for the 12-month period\nended March 31, 2024 was approximately $3,282,000, and is being collected from customers over a three-month period that began in May 2024.\nThe Company has an approved rate structure to mitigate the impact of the financing costs of its natural gas inventory. Under this rate structure,\nRoanoke Gas recognizes revenue by applying the ICC factor, based on the Company’s weighted-average cost of capital, including interest rates on\nshort-term and long-term debt, and the Company’s authorized return on equity, to the average cost of natural gas inventory during the period. Total\nICC revenues decreased by approximately $3,000 and $198,000 for the three-month and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to the corresponding periods last year, due to lower natural gas commodity prices during the 2023 summer storage injection\nseason resulting in a lower average cost of natural gas in storage. Accordingly, fiscal 2024 and 2025 ICC revenues are expected to continue to\nremain below last year's levels.\nIn March 2023, Roanoke Gas began operating the RNG facility, through a cooperative agreement with the Western Virginia Water Authority, to\nproduce commercial quality RNG for delivery into its distribution system. With SCC approval, Roanoke Gas is allowed to recover the costs\nassociated with the investment in RNG facilities and the related operating costs through an RNG Rider. Customers receive the benefit of\nthe monetization of environmental credits generated through the production of RNG. Roanoke Gas recognized approximately $394,000 and\n$1,211,000 in RNG revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to approximately $283,000 and $366,000\nfor the corresponding periods in the prior year.\nThe cost of natural gas, which is a pass-through cost, is independent of the Company's non-gas rates. Accordingly, the Company's approved billing\nrates include a component designed to allow for the recovery of the cost of natural gas used by its customers. This rate component, referred to as\nthe PGA, allows the Company to pass along to its customers increases and decreases in natural gas costs through a quarterly filing, or more frequent\nif necessary, with the SCC. Once SCC approval is received, the Company adjusts the gas cost component of its rates. As actual costs will differ\nfrom the projections used in establishing the PGA rate, the Company will either over-recover or under-recover its actual gas costs during the period.\nThe difference between actual costs incurred and costs recovered through the application of the PGA is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability. At\nthe end of the annual deferral period, the balance is amortized over an ensuing 12-month period as amounts are reflected in customer billings.\nResults of Operations\nThe analysis on the results of operations is based on the consolidated operations of the Company, which is primarily associated with the utility\nsegment. Additional segment analysis is provided when Midstream's investment in affiliates represents a significant component of the comparison.\nThe Company's operating revenues are affected by the cost of natural gas, as reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of income under\ncost of gas - utility. The cost of natural gas, which includes commodity price, transportation, storage, injection and withdrawal fees, with any increase\nor decrease offset by a correlating change in revenue through the PGA, is passed through to customers at cost. Accordingly, management believes\nthat gross utility margin, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as utility revenues less cost of gas, is a more useful and relevant measure to analyze\nfinancial performance. The term gross utility margin is not intended to represent or replace operating income, the most comparable GAAP financial\nmeasure, as an indicator of operating performance and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The\nfollowing results of operations analyses will reference gross utility margin.\n28\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024:\nNet income decreased by $530,124 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year, primarily due to increased\ninflationary pressures on operating expenses, lower AFUDC from the MVP as the project transitioned from construction to in service and higher\ninterest rates, partially offset by WNA and RNG revenues.\nThe tables below reflect operating revenues, volume activity and heating degree days.\nThree Months Ended June 30, Increase /\n2024 2023 (Decrease) Percentage\nOperating Revenues\nGas utility $ 14,431,379 $ 13,631,856 $ 799,523 6%\nNon utility 26,823 28,389 (1,566) (6)%\nTotal operating revenues $ 14,458,202 $ 13,660,245 $ 797,957 6%\nDelivered Volumes\nRegulated natural gas (DTH)\nResidential and commercial 786,221 881,001 (94,780) (11)%\nTransportation and interruptible 996,813 1,007,287 (10,474) (1)%\nTotal delivered volumes 1,783,034 1,888,288 (105,254) (6)%\nHDD 167 272 (105) (39)%\nTotal operating revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year, increased by approximately 6% primarily\ndue to increases in WNA, SAVE and RNG revenues more than offsetting the decrease in delivered natural gas volumes. Total heating degree days\ndecreased by 39% from the same period last year, and were substantially less than the 30-year normal, resulting in an increase of approximately\n$531,000 in WNA revenues. SAVE Plan revenues continued their upward trend as Roanoke Gas continues to invest in qualified SAVE\ninfrastructure projects, resulting in an increase of approximately $127,000 from the same period in the prior year. The decline in volumetric revenues\nslightly offset the overall increase in operating revenues. Natural gas commodity prices during the quarter declined by 25% from the corresponding\nperiod last year. Total gas costs increased by 7% compared to the same period last year, which corresponds to a 13% increase in the gas cost\ncomponent included in total customer billing rate, offset by a decrease in delivered volumes. The decrease in heating degree days as previously\ndiscussed resulted in a 14% decline in the weather-sensitive residential and commercial sales.\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 Increase Percentage\nGross Utility Margin\nGas utility revenues $ 14,431,379 $ 13,631,856 $ 799,523 6%\nCost of gas - utility 5,344,684 5,003,371 341,313 7%\nGross utility margin $ 9,086,695 $ 8,628,485 $ 458,210 5%\nGross utility margin increased over the same period last year primarily as a result of increased SAVE, RNG and WNA revenue, offset by the\nreduction in delivered volumes.

During fiscal 2023, no restricted stock awards were made and were\nreinstated in fiscal 2024. Further, professional services expenses increased approximately $90,000 primarily due to increased external audit fees,\nactuarial services and IT support. Lower capitalized overheads and increased contracted services accounted for much of the remaining cost increase.\nGeneral taxes increased by $43,223, or 7%, primarily due to higher property taxes associated with growth in utility property and increases in payroll\ntaxes related to increased staffing and compensation.\nDepreciation expense increased by $278,166, or 11%, on a commensurate increase in utility property balances.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate decreased by $236,878, or 46%, primarily due to completion of construction activities during the quarter\nresulting in lower AFUDC that was not fully replaced by the Company's portion of operational earnings once the pipeline went into service in mid-\nJune 2024.\nOther income, net decreased by $76,074 from an approximate $7,000 income position to an approximate $69,000 expense position primarily due to\nless interest income and increased postretirement costs.\nInterest expense increased by $143,527, or 10%, as the weighted-average interest rate on total debt increased from 3.98% during the third quarter\nof fiscal 2023 to 4.42% during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in the weighted-average interest rate was primarily associated with\nRoanoke Gas' variable rate line-of-credit and Midstream's credit facilities. Roanoke Gas' borrowing levels also increased from the same period last\nyear, contributing to higher interest expense, while Midstream's total average outstanding debt decreased due to amortization payments under one of\nMidstream's promissory notes.\nIncome tax expense decreased by $167,227, or 78%, primarily due to a corresponding decrease in pre-tax income, coupled with the recognition of\ntax credits associated with the RNG facility that had not been utilized in the prior year due to timing of the RNG facility becoming operational. The\neffective tax rate was 23.1% and 23.8% for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The increase\nin the weighted-average interest rate was primarily associated with Roanoke Gas' variable rate line-of-credit and Midstream's credit\nfacilities. Roanoke Gas' borrowing levels also increased from the same period last year, contributing to higher interest expense, while Midstream's\ntotal average outstanding debt decreased due to amortization payments under two of Midstream's promissory notes.\nIncome tax expense increased by $382,624, or 12%, due to a corresponding increase in pre-tax income. The effective tax rate was 23.5% and\n23.7% for the nine-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate is below the combined statutory state and\nfederal rate due to the amortization of excess deferred taxes and tax credits.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements of Resources are prepared in accordance with GAAP.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThere have been no significant changes to the critical accounting policies as reflected in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended September 30, 2023.\nAsset Management\nRoanoke Gas uses third-party asset managers to oversee its pipeline transportation, storage rights and gas supply inventories and deliveries in order\nto provide a secure and reliable source of natural gas to its customers. In return for utilizing the excess capacities of the transportation and storage\nrights, the asset managers pay Roanoke Gas a monthly utilization fee. In accordance with an SCC order issued in 2018, a portion of the utilization\nfee is retained by the Company with the balance passed through to customers through reduced gas costs. Prior to the MVP being placed in service,\nRoanoke Gas utilized one asset manager. With the MVP now in service, Roanoke Gas entered into a second asset management agreement for the\nutilization of its MVP capacity. Both asset management agreements end March 31, 2025.\nEquity Investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline\nMidstream owns a less than 1% equity investment in the LLC that owns the MVP, which went into service in June 2024. Midstream is also a less\nthan 1% investor, accounted for under the cost method, in Southgate, which is in the design and permitting phase.\nFrom inception through May 2024, earnings from the MVP were primarily attributable to AFUDC income. With the MVP in operation, the\nCompany now recognizes its share of earnings from the MVP, favorably adjusted for a basis difference between the Company's proportional share of\nassets and its carrying value that arose when the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of its investment in 2022. This basis\ndifference will be amortized over the operational life of the MVP. Through the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded\nequity in earnings of consolidated affiliates of $2,979,823 and $523,581, respectively, which included $2,950,054 and $516,675 from AFUDC.\nResources expects cash distributions from the LLC to begin before the end of calendar 2024.\nEarlier in 2024, the Company refinanced two promissory notes related to Midstream. Midstream is considering its long-term capital structure as the\nMVP has entered its operating phase. See Note 7 for a full discussion of all borrowings related to Midstream.\nRegulatory\nIn response to continued inflationary pressures, Roanoke Gas filed a general rate application on February 2, 2024 with the SCC seeking to increase\nits non-gas base rates by $4.33 million and its permitted return on equity from 9.44% to 10.35% reflecting its higher cost of capital, including higher\ninterest expense. The SCC permitted the Company to implement its new rates on an interim basis for customer billings on or after July 1, 2024,\nsubject to refund. The SCC’s review of Roanoke Gas’ filing is underway and a hearing has been set for November 7, 2024.\nThe SCC requires regulated utilities within the state to perform a depreciation study every five years and to submit the study for SCC approval. The\nCompany's current depreciation rates are based on the last depreciation study approved by the SCC in 2019. As part of the general rate application\nfiled in February 2024, the Company submitted its requisite depreciation study and proposed new depreciation rates. In July 2024, the Company\nreceived administrative approval from the SCC staff that authorized the new depreciation rates. The new depreciation rates will result in a small\ndecrease in depreciation expense for fiscal 2024, as the new depreciation rates are effective retroactive to October 1, 2023. This adjustment to\ndepreciation expense will be reflected in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\nOn December 2, 2022, Roanoke Gas filed an expedited rate application with the SCC seeking an $8.55 million annual increase in its non-gas base\nrates, of which $4.05 million was being recovered through the SAVE Rider. The proposed interim rates went into effect January 1, 2023, subject to\nrefund. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company reached a settlement with the SCC staff on all outstanding issues in the case. Under the\nterms of the settlement, the Company agreed to an annual incremental revenue requirement of $7.45 million. The Company began billing the\napproved rates effective October 1, 2023. The SCC issued its Final Order in the matter on December 19, 2023 in which it approved the settlement\nagreement in its entirety. Refunds, which had previously been accrued, were made to customers in February 2024.\n33\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOn August 31, 2023, the SCC approved the Company's new SAVE Plan and Rider with rates effective October 1, 2023. Under this plan, Roanoke\nGas can recover costs associated with an estimated $8.5 million in SAVE eligible investment in fiscal 2024 and an estimated cumulative investment of\n$49.5 million over the proposed five-year plan period ending September 30, 2028. The plan was approved with a revenue requirement of\napproximately $366,000 for fiscal 2024. On June 28, 2024, Roanoke Gas filed for approval of an updated annual SAVE Rider rate to become\neffective October 1, 2024. The proposed SAVE rate is based on an estimated $9.13 million of SAVE eligible investment during fiscal 2025 which\nresults in a revenue requirement of $1.53 million. The Company expects a Final Order from the SCC in September 2024.\nBy Order dated September 1, 2023, the SCC approved the Company’s RNG Rider effective for the period October 1, 2023 through September\n30, 2024. In its Order, the SCC directed the Company to file an application to update the RNG Rider by May 30, 2024. In compliance with the\nSCC’s directive, on May 30, 2024, Roanoke Gas filed for an update to its annual RNG Rider to become effective October 1, 2024. The revenue\nrequirement associated with the proposed RNG Rider is $1.56 million, offset by the sale of environmental credits in the amount of $1.11 million as\nwell as credits for the over-recovery of costs during the prior year of approximately $35,000, resulting in a net revenue requirement of\napproximately $415,000. The Company expects a Final Order from the SCC in September 2024.\nRoanoke Gas is authorized by the SCC to acquire certain natural gas distribution assets from a local housing authority at five separate apartment\ncomplexes, located in the Company’s service territory. The housing authority renews existing natural gas distribution facilities to include mains and\nservices then transfers ownership of these facilities to Roanoke Gas. In turn, Roanoke Gas assumes responsibility for the operation and maintenance\nof these assets and recognizes a gain related to the asset acquisition equal to the cost associated with the renewal.\nThe assets of two complexes were transferred to Roanoke Gas in fiscal 2022. On September 29, 2023, the housing authority transferred the assets\nfrom one additional apartment complex to Roanoke Gas and the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $311,000 during the fourth\nquarter of fiscal 2023. The authority is substantially complete with renewing the fourth complex, which may be transferred to Roanoke Gas before\nthe end of this fiscal year. The timing of funding and the completion of the asset renewals for the final complex is uncertain at this time.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nDue to the capital-intensive nature of the utility business, as well as the impact of weather variability, the Company’s primary capital needs are the\nfunding of its capital projects, the seasonal funding of its natural gas inventories and accounts receivables, debt service and payments of dividends to\nshareholders. The Company anticipates funding these items through its operating cash flows, credit availability under short-term and long-term debt\nagreements and proceeds from the sale of its common stock.\nCash and cash equivalents increased by $1,028,662 for the nine-month period ended June 30, 2024 compared to an increase of $282,192 for the\nnine-month period ended June 30, 2023. The following table summarizes the sources and uses of cash:\nNine Months Ended June 30,\nCash Flow Summary 2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 17,056,186 $ 23,634,279\nNet cash used in investing activities (16,544,262) (21,463,979)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities 516,738 (1,888,108)\nIncrease in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,028,662 $ 282,192\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities:\nThe seasonal nature of the natural gas business causes operating cash flows to fluctuate significantly during the year as well as from year-to-year.\nFactors, including weather, energy prices, natural gas storage levels and customer collections, contribute to working capital levels and related cash\nflows. Generally, operating cash flows are positive during the second and third fiscal quarters as a combination of earnings, declining storage gas\nlevels and collections on customer accounts contribute to higher cash levels. During the first and fourth fiscal quarters, operating cash flows generally\ndecrease due to increases in natural gas storage levels and rising customer receivable balances.\n34\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 decreased by $6,578,093 compared to the same period last year. The\ntable below summarizes the significant components of operating cash flows:\nNine Months Ended June 30, Increase/\nCash Flow From Operating Activities: 2024 2023 (Decrease)\nNet income $ 11,620,074 $ 10,285,107 $ 1,334,967\nNon-cash adjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization 8,285,761 7,431,251 854,510\nEquity in earnings (2,979,823) (523,581) (2,456,242)\nAFUDC — (184,619) 184,619\nChanges in working capital and regulatory assets and liabilities:\nAccounts receivable (1,323,520) 289,188 (1,612,708)\nGas in storage 3,953,984 8,720,497 (4,766,513)\nUnder-recovery of gas cost 1,066,611 1,765,182 (698,571)\nAccounts payable 577,245 (2,441,219) 3,018,464\nWNA (1,503,472) (1,033,653) (469,819)\nRate refund (652,018) 976,108 (1,628,126)\nOther (1,988,656) (1,649,982) (338,674)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 17,056,186 $ 23,634,279 $ (6,578,093)\nThe decline in operating cash flows is primarily due to the reduction in the value of gas withdrawn from storage. The average price of gas in storage\nduring the first nine months of fiscal 2023 was more than $6.50 per DTH compared to approximately $4.25 per DTH during the current fiscal year.\nThe decrease in the unit cost of gas in storage was attributable to much lower commodity prices during last year's summer storage injections.\nAccordingly, as lower-priced gas was withdrawn from storage during the first half of fiscal 2024, cash flow levels were reduced when compared to\nthe same period in fiscal 2023. Additionally, though the SCC issued its final order in December 2023, Roanoke Gas implemented interim billing rates\nin January 2023; therefore, the Company began accruing an estimated rate refund representing the amount due customers for the difference between\ntotal customer billings at interim rates versus total customer billings at final rates. Upon SCC approval of final rates, Roanoke Gas issued refunds in\nFebruary 2024 to all customers that were billed at interim rates since January 2023. When compared to the nine-month period ending June 30,\n2023, the distribution of the rate refund to customers reduced cash available for operations by $1.6 million.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities:\nInvesting activities primarily consist of expenditures related to Roanoke Gas' utility property, which includes replacing aging natural gas pipe with new\nplastic or coated steel pipe, improvements to the LNG plant and gas distribution system facilities and expansion of its natural gas system to meet the\ndemands of customer growth. With the recent approval of its new SAVE Plan and Rider, the Company is continuing its focus on SAVE infrastructure\nreplacement projects, including the replacement of pre-1973 first generation plastic pipe. New customer demand for natural gas continues to be\nstrong and therefore extending the natural gas distribution system within its service territory is also a priority. Roanoke Gas' total capital expenditures\nfor the nine-month period ended June 30, 2024 were approximately $16.6 million compared to $19.4 million during the same period last year. The\n$2.8 million decrease in expenditures is primarily due to higher investment a year ago related to the completion of the RNG project, which was\nplaced in service in March 2023. Total fiscal 2024 capital expenditures are expected to exceed $21 million. Midstream's investment in the LLC\nwas approximately $2.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. However, Midstream ceased future participation in capital calls following its\nMay 2023 funding payment based on an agreement with the LLC's managing partner. Midstream continues to be invested in the LLC; however, its\nparticipation percentage is declining with no additional investment. Now that the MVP is in service, Midstream may incur periodic, future capital\ninvestment related to ongoing MVP operations requirements and system improvements. Midstream has and will continue to make capital investments\nin Southgate. The targeted timing for completion of the Southgate project is 2028.\n35\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCash Flows Provided by Financing Activities:\nFinancing activities generally consist of borrowings and repayments under credit agreements, issuance of common stock and the payment of\ndividends. Net cash flows provided by financing activities were approximately $517,000 for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, compared to\n$1.9 million in net cash flows used in financing activities for the same period last year. The $2.4 million increase in financing cash flows is primarily\nattributable to net borrowings of $3.3 million under Roanoke Gas' line-of-credit during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to no net\nborrowings in the same period last year. Roanoke Gas' increased borrowings were slightly offset by a net decrease in cash of approximately\n$389,000 associated with Midstream's debt. Notes 6 and 7 provide details on the Company's line-of-credit and borrowing activity.\nIn addition, Resources issued a total of 177,906 shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of $3.5 million, including 85,501 shares through\nthe ATM program in which Resources received $1.7 million, net of fees. During the same period last year, Resources issued 177,900 shares for\n$3.6 million, including 127,852 shares through the ATM program for $2.7 million, net of fees.\nThe current interest rate environment is expected to continue to result in higher year-over-year interest expense associated with the Company's\nvariable-rate debt.\nManagement regularly evaluates the Company’s liquidity through a review of its available financing resources and its cash flows. Resources maintains\nthe ability to raise equity capital through its ATM program, private placement or other public offerings. Management believes Roanoke Gas has\naccess to sufficient financing resources to meet its cash requirements for the next year, including the line of credit and the two private shelf facilities.\nRoanoke Gas may also adjust capital spending, as necessary, if such a need would arise.\nWith the MVP now in service, Midstream's future cash requirements will relate to regular monthly operating expenses, debt service and capital\ncontributions. On March 6, 2024, Midstream consolidated the Promissory Notes to one Promissory Note with one lender, increased the capacity of\nits $23 million credit facility to $25 million and extended the maturity date to December 31, 2025. Further, on May 2, 2024, Midstream established\na new $9 million line of credit facility that matures on May 2, 2026. With these proceeds, Midstream paid in full the $9 million balance on its note\npayable that matured on June 1, 2024. With the extension of its original credit facility and the establishment of the new credit facility, Midstream's\ntotal debt service over the succeeding 12 months includes $400,000 to retire maturing debt. Management believes that it will be able to meet\nMidstream's cash requirements over the ensuing 12-month period.\nAs of June 30, 2024, Resources' long-term capitalization ratio was 44% equity and 56% debt.\nITEM 3 – QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot applicable.\nITEM 4 – CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be\ndisclosed in reports under the Exchange Act are identified, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the\nrules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow for timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\nThrough June 30, 2024, the Company has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the chief executive\nofficer and the chief financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon\nthat evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective\nat the reasonable assurance level as of June 30, 2024.\nManagement routinely reviews the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and makes changes, as necessary, to enhance the effectiveness\nof the internal controls. There were no control changes during the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n36\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONDENSED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\n1. Basis of Presentation\nResources is an energy services company primarily engaged in the sale and distribution of natural gas. The condensed consolidated financial\nstatements include the accounts of Resources and its wholly owned subsidiaries: Roanoke Gas, Diversified Energy and Midstream.\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of\nonly normal recurring accruals) necessary to fairly present Resources' financial position as of March 31, 2024, cash flows for the six months\nended March 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations, comprehensive income, and changes in stockholders' equity for the three\nand six months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The results of operations for the three and six months ended March 31, 2024 are not\nindicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024 as quarterly earnings are affected by the highly seasonal\nnature of the business and weather conditions generally result in greater earnings during the winter months.\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and condensed notes are presented under the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nPursuant to those rules, certain information and note disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance\nwith GAAP have been condensed or omitted. Although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate, the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and condensed notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes contained in the\nCompany’s Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023. The September 30, 2023 consolidated balance sheet was included in the\nCompany’s audited financial statements included in Form 10-K.\nRoanoke Gas' line of credit is renewed annually in March, and there was $6.6 million outstanding under the line of credit at March 31, 2024.\nIn March and May 2024, Midstream refinanced nearly $34 million of long-term debt that was maturing in fiscal 2024. See Notes 6 and 7 for a\ndiscussion of these transactions. These actions have resolved the uncertainty that gave rise to the conditions that were disclosed last quarter\nunder ASU 2014-15. In the future, there may again be circumstances where such refinancing is not entirely within the Company's control and\nsuch disclosure is warranted.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results\ncould differ from those estimates.\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in the Company's\nForm 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nCertain amounts previously disclosed have been reclassified to conform to current year presentations.\n7\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRecently Issued or Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) - Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate\nReform on Financial Reporting. In combination with ASU 2021-01 and ASU 2022-06, the ASU provides temporary optional guidance to\nease the potential burden in accounting for and recognizing the effects of reference rate change on financial reporting. The new guidance applies\nspecifically to contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR, or any other referenced rate that is expected to be discontinued due\nto reference rate reform. The new guidance is effective for the Company through December 31, 2024. The Intercontinental Exchange\nBenchmark Administration, the administrator for LIBOR and other inter-bank offered rates, announced that the LIBOR rates for one-day,\none-month, six-month and one-year would cease publication in June 2023 and that no new financial contracts may use LIBOR after December\n31, 2021. Subsequent to June 30, 2023, the one-day, one-month, six-month, and one-year LIBOR settings will continue to be published under\nan unrepresentative synthetic methodology until the end of September 2024 in order to bridge the transition to other reference rates. The\nCompany has transitioned all but one LIBOR-based variable rate note to a new reference rate as of March 31, 2024. Each of the revised\nnotes has a corresponding swap that was also transitioned to align with the related notes. The last LIBOR-based note was refinanced through a\nnew note issued in April 2024. See Note 7 and Note 9 for more information.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures. The new guidance is designed to provide users of financial statements with enhanced disclosures regarding the information\nprovided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and how the CODM uses the information in assessing the performance of each\nsegment. The Company is currently evaluating the new standard and determining the additional disclosure requirements. The new guidance is\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2024.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The new\nguidance requires that on an annual basis public business entities disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation table and provide\nadditional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (items equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed\nby multiplying pretax income or loss by the applicable statutory rate). The required disclosures will provide more granularity regarding the\npayment of income taxes to federal, state and foreign entities. The Company does not expect certain requirements of this ASU to have a\nsignificant impact to its current disclosures as all of its operations are domestic and reside in two states. Changes to the rate reconciliation table\nwill result in additional disclosure. The new guidance is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15,\n2024.\nIn March 2024, the SEC issued its final rule that requires registrants to provide climate disclosures in their annual reports and registration\nstatements. The new guidance requires that registrants provide information about specified financial statement effects of severe weather events\nand other natural conditions, certain carbon offsets and renewable energy certificates, and material impacts on financial estimates and\nassumptions in the footnotes to financial statements. The rule also requires additional disclosures outside of the financial statements including\ngovernance and oversight of material climate-related risks, the material impact of climate risks on the company's strategy, business model and\noutlook, risk management processes for material climate-related risks and material climate targets and goals. The Company is currently\nevaluating the new rule and determining the impact of the additional disclosure requirements, as well as the data needed and the source of that\ndata to comply with required disclosures. The new rule is currently effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2027 for smaller\nreporting companies. The final rule was scheduled to become effective May 28, 2024; however, the SEC has voluntarily stayed the rule's\neffective date pending judicial review. Depending on when the legal challenges are resolved, the mandatory compliance date may be retained\nor delayed.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued by the FASB, SEC or other standard-setting bodies are not currently applicable to the\nCompany or are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n2. Revenue\nThe Company assesses new contracts and identifies related performance obligations for promises to transfer distinct goods or services to the\ncustomer. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations have been satisfied. In the case of Roanoke Gas, the Company contracts with\nits customers for the sale and/or delivery of natural gas.\n8\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC.

Based on its evaluation, the\nCompany has concluded that these tariff-based revenues fall within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Tariff\nrates represent the transaction price. Performance obligations created under these tariff-based sales include the cost of natural gas sold to\ncustomers (commodity) and the cost of transporting natural gas through the Company’s distribution system to customers (delivery). The\ndelivery of natural gas to customers results in the satisfaction of the Company’s respective performance obligations over time.\nAll customers are billed monthly based on consumption as measured by metered usage with payments due 20 days from the rendering of the\nbill. Revenue is recognized as bills are issued for natural gas that has been delivered or transported. In addition, the Company utilizes the\npractical expedient that allows an entity to recognize the invoiced amount as revenue, if that amount corresponds to the value received by the\ncustomer. Since customers are billed tariff rates, there is no variable consideration in the transaction price.\n9\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nUnbilled revenue is included in residential and commercial revenues in the preceding table. Natural gas consumption is estimated for the period\nsubsequent to the last billed date and up through the last day of the month. Estimated volumes and approved tariff rates are utilized to calculate\nunbilled revenue. The following month, the unbilled estimate is reversed, the actual usage is billed and a new unbilled estimate is calculated. The\nCompany obtains metered usage for industrial customers at the end of each month, thereby eliminating any unbilled consideration for these rate\nclasses.\nOther revenues\nOther revenues primarily consist of miscellaneous fees and charges, utility-related revenues not directly billed to utility customers and billings for\nnon-utility activities. Customers are invoiced monthly based on services provided for these activities. The Company utilizes the practical\nexpedient allowing revenue to be recognized based on invoiced amounts. The transaction price is based on a contractually predetermined rate\nschedule; therefore, the transaction price represents total value to the customer and no variable price consideration exists.\nAlternative revenue program revenues\nARPs, which fall outside the scope of ASC 606, are SCC approved mechanisms that allow for the adjustment of revenues for certain broad,\nexternal factors, or for additional billings if the entity achieves certain performance targets. The Company's ARPs include its WNA, which\nadjusts revenues for the effects of weather temperature variations as compared to the 30-year average; the SAVE Plan over/under collection\nmechanism, which adjusts revenues for the differences between SAVE Plan revenues billed to customers and the revenue earned, as calculated\nbased on the timing and extent of infrastructure replacement completed during the period; and the RNG over/under collection mechanism,\nwhich adjusts revenues similar to the SAVE Plan, but is calculated based on the timing and costs associated with owning, operating and\nmaintaining the RNG facility. These amounts are ultimately collected from, or returned to, customers through future rate changes as approved\nby the SCC.\nCustomer accounts receivable and liabilities\nAccounts receivable, as reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, includes both billed and unbilled customer revenues, as well as\namounts that are not related to customers. The balances of customer receivables are provided below:\nCurrent Assets Current Liabilities\nTrade accounts Unbilled Customer Customer\nreceivable(1) revenue(1) credit balances deposits\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ 2,782,025 $ 1,240,097 $ 1,972,132 $ 1,476,321\nBalance at March 31, 2024 6,485,713 2,850,532 947,563 1,697,018\nIncrease (decrease) $ 3,703,688 $ 1,610,435 $ (1,024,569) $ 220,697\n(1) Included in accounts receivable in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Amounts shown net of reserve for credit losses.\nThe Company had no significant contract assets or liabilities during the period. Furthermore, the Company did not incur any significant costs to\nobtain contracts.\n3. Segment Information\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by\nthe Company's executive management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company uses operating income\nand equity in earnings to assess segment performance.\nIntersegment transactions are recorded at cost.\nThe reportable segments disclosed herein are defined as follows:\nGas Utility - The natural gas segment of the Company generates revenue from its tariff rates and other regulatory mechanisms through which it\nprovides the sale and distribution of natural gas to its residential, commercial and industrial customers.\n10\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n4. Rates and Regulatory Matters\nThe SCC exercises regulatory authority over the natural gas operations of Roanoke Gas. Such regulation encompasses terms, conditions and\nrates to be charged to customers for natural gas service, safety standards, service extension and depreciation.\nIn response to continued inflationary pressures, Roanoke Gas filed a general rate application on February 2, 2024 with the SCC seeking to\nincrease its non-gas base rates by $4.33 million and sought to increase its permitted rate of return from 9.44% to 10.35% reflecting its higher\ncost of capital, including continued increases in interest rates. The new rates will go into effect for customer billings on or after July 1, 2024,\nsubject to refund. The SCC’s review of Roanoke Gas’ filing is underway and a hearing has been set for November 7, 2024.\nOn December 2, 2022, Roanoke Gas filed an expedited rate application with the SCC seeking an $8.55 million annual increase in its non-gas\nbase rates, of which $4.05 million was being recovered through the SAVE Rider. The proposed rates went into effect January 1, 2023, subject\nto refund. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company reached a settlement with the SCC staff on all outstanding issues in the case.\nUnder the terms of the settlement, the Company agreed to an incremental revenue requirement of $7.45 million. The Company agreed to begin\nbilling the new rates effective October 1, 2023. The Commission issued its Final Order in the matter on December 19, 2023 in which it\napproved the settlement agreement in its entirety. Refunds, which had previously been accrued, were made to customers in February 2024.\nOn August 31, 2023, the SCC approved the new SAVE Plan and Rider with rates effective October 1, 2023. Under this plan, Roanoke Gas\ncan recover costs associated with an estimated $8.5 million in SAVE eligible investment in fiscal 2024 and an estimated cumulative investment\nof $49.5 million over the proposed five-year plan period ending September 30, 2028. The plan was approved with a revenue requirement of\napproximately $366,000 for fiscal 2024.\nRoanoke Gas is authorized by the SCC to acquire certain natural gas distribution assets from a local housing authority at five separate\napartment complexes, located in the Company’s service territory. The housing authority renews existing natural gas distribution facilities to\ninclude mains and services then transfers ownership of these facilities to Roanoke Gas. In turn, Roanoke Gas assumes responsibility for the\noperation and maintenance of these assets and recognizes a gain related to the asset acquisition equal to the cost associated with the renewal.\nThe assets of two complexes were transferred to Roanoke Gas in fiscal 2022. On September 29, 2023, the housing authority transferred the\nassets from one additional apartment complex to Roanoke Gas and the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $311,000 during\nthe fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The authority is underway with renewing the fourth complex and is awaiting future funding to complete the\nremaining apartment complex. The timing of funding and the completion of the asset renewals for these complexes is uncertain at this time.\n12\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n5. Other Investments\nMidstream owns a less than 1% equity investment in the LLC constructing the MVP. Midstream is also a less than 1% investor, accounted for\nunder the cost method, in Southgate. Since inception, the MVP has encountered various legal and regulatory issues that have substantially\ndelayed the completion of the project. With the passage of the FRA and certain judicial rulings in mid-2023, construction work was restarted.\nWhile under construction, AFUDC has provided the majority of the income recognized by Midstream. The LLC temporarily suspended\naccruing AFUDC on the project for portions of prior periods. AFUDC accruals resumed in June 2023 when construction activities restarted.\nThe amount of AFUDC recognized during the current and prior year is included in the equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate in the tables\nbelow. On April 22, 2024, the LLC filed its in service request for MVP with FERC, with an expectation that gas will begin to flow during the\nsecond calendar quarter and the long-term firm contracts will become effective. As the MVP project nears completion, AFUDC on completed\nsegments will cease and will only be recorded on areas still under construction.\nMidstream reassesses the value of its investment in the LLC on at least a quarterly basis, and no impairment indicators were identified in fiscal\n2023 or during the first half of fiscal 2024. As noted above, developments in 2023 on the legislative and legal fronts were favorable. The\nMVP project is not yet completed and adverse developments, as well as potential macroeconomic factors related to interest rates, cost\nincreases, or other unanticipated events could erode fair value leading to new indicators or impairment.\nFunding for Midstream's investments has been provided through equity contributions from Resources and unsecured promissory notes as\ndetailed in Note 7.\nThe Company will participate in the earnings generated from the transportation of natural gas through both pipelines proportionate to its level of\ninvestment once the pipelines are placed in service.\nInvestment balances of MVP and Southgate, as of March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2023, are reflected in the table below:\nBalance Sheet location: March 31, 2024 September 30, 2023\nOther Assets:\nMVP $ 19,793,695 $ 17,096,476\nSouthgate 93,998 90,617\nInvestment in unconsolidated affiliates $ 19,887,693 $ 17,187,093\nThree Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31,\nIncome Statement location: 2024 2023 2024 2023\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate $ 1,229,384 $ 2,867 $ 2,697,219 $ 4,099\nMarch 31, 2024 September 30, 2023\nUndistributed earnings, net of income taxes, of MVP in retained earnings, excluding\nimpairment $ 11,686,753 $ 9,683,797\nThe undistributed earnings does not include the impairment of the investment in the LLC.\n13\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n6. Short-Term Debt\nOn March 24, 2023, Roanoke Gas entered into an unsecured Revolving Note in the principal amount of $25 million. On March 31, 2024, the\nRevolving Note was amended to extend the maturity date to March 31, 2025. Other key terms and requirements of the Revolving Note were\nretained. The Revolving Note's variable interest rate is based upon Term SOFR plus 110 basis points and provides for multiple tier borrowing\nlimits to accommodate seasonal borrowing demands. The Company's total available borrowing limits during the term of the Revolving Note\ncurrently range from $15 million to $25 million. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had an outstanding balance of $6,582,180 under the\nRevolving Note.\n7. Long-Term Debt\nOn March 6, 2024, Midstream entered into the Sixth Amendment to Credit Agreement and related Promissory Notes on the non-revolving\ncredit facility. The Sixth Amendment revised the interest rate from Term SOFR plus 2.00% to Term SOFR plus 2.00% subject to adjustment\nto Term SOFR plus 1.75% and Term SOFR plus 1.55% upon meeting certain milestones. The Sixth Amendment also consolidated the\nPromissory Notes to one Promissory Note with one lender, increased the available non-revolving credit facility to $25 million, and extended the\nmaturity date to December 31, 2025. All other terms and requirements remain unchanged.\nSubsequent to the end of the quarter, on May 2, 2024, Midstream established a new $9 million line of credit facility. The interest rate on the\nborrowings under the facility is SOFR plus 2.215%; the arrangement includes a 0.40% upfront fee and 0.125% unused line fee. The facility\nmatures on May 2, 2026. With this agreement, Midstream has the ability and intent to refinance the $9 million note payable that will be\nremaining on June 1, 2024; accordingly, it has classified that amount as long-term on the condensed balance sheet as of March 31, 2024.\nOn June 28, 2023, Midstream amended and restated its $14 million and $8 million Term Notes initially entered into on June 12, 2019 and\nNovember 1, 2021, respectively. The amendments revised each of the original Term Note's interest rate from LIBOR plus 115 basis points to\nDaily Simple SOFR plus 126.448 basis points, effective July 1, 2023. On March 6, 2024, Midstream further amended and restated its $8\nmillion Term Note. The amendment suspended quarterly principal payments beginning with April 1, 2024 through January 1, 2025. Principal\npayments will commence again on April 1, 2025. All other terms and requirements of the Term Notes were retained. In conjunction with the\noriginal amendment of the Term Notes in June 2023, Midstream also amended the corresponding interest rate swaps associated with the Term\nNotes. The amendments provided for the floating rates on the interest rate swaps to continue to match the rate of the associated notes as well\nas retain the overall fixed interest rates of 3.24% and 2.443%, respectively. The interest rate swap related to the $8 million Term Note was not\namended on March 6, 2024, but the Company did re-designate its hedge documentation to address the suspension of repayments.\nOn March 24, 2023, Roanoke Gas amended and restated the $10 million Term Note originally entered into on September 24, 2021. The\namendment revised the original Term Note's interest rate from LIBOR plus 100 basis points to Term SOFR plus 100 basis points. All other\nterms and requirements of the original Term Note were retained. The effective date of the Amended Term Note was April 1, 2023. In\naddition, on April 3, 2023, the interest rate swap was amended to align with the Amended Term Note and retained the fixed interest rate of\n2.49%. In connection with the Revolving Note and Amended Term Note, Roanoke Gas also amended and restated the Loan Agreement\ndated September 24, 2021.

All of the debt agreements provide for Priority\nIndebtedness (defined in the debt agreements) to not exceed 15% of consolidated total assets. The $15 million and $10 million notes, as well\nas the line-of-credit, have an interest coverage ratio requirement of not less than 1.5 to 1, which excludes the effect of the non-cash\nimpairments on the LLC investments up to the total investment as of December 31, 2021, as revised by the Seventh Amendment to the Credit\nAgreement. The Company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\n16\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n8. Derivatives and Hedging\nThe Company’s hedging and derivative policy allows management to enter into derivatives for the purpose of managing the commodity and\nfinancial market risks of its business operations, including the price of natural gas and the cost of borrowed funds. This policy specifically\nprohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes.\nThe Company has five interest rate swaps associated with certain of its variable rate debt as of March 31, 2024. Roanoke Gas\nhas two variable-rate term notes in the amounts of $15 million and $10 million, with corresponding swap agreements to convert the variable\ninterest rates into fixed rates of 2.00% and 2.49%, respectively. Midstream has three swap agreements corresponding to the variable rate term\nnotes with original principal amounts of $14 million, $10 million, and $8 million. The swap agreements convert two of these notes into fixed\nrate instruments with effective interest rates of 3.24% and 3.14%, respectively. The swap agreement pertaining to the $8 million note remains\nin place and was concurrently re-designated to hedge an applicable portion of the note taking into account the temporary suspension of\namortization described in Note 7, and converts that portion of the note to a fixed rate of 2.443%. The swaps qualify as cash flow hedges with\nchanges in fair value reported in other comprehensive income. No portion of the swaps were deemed ineffective during the periods presented.\nThe fair value of the current and non-current portions of the interest rate swaps are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets\nunder the caption interest rate swaps. The table in Note 11 reflects the effect on income and other comprehensive income of the Company's\ncash flow hedges.\n9. Fair Value Measurements\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes each input to the valuation method\nused to measure fair value of financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured and reported on a fair value basis into one of the\nfollowing three levels:\nLevel 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the\nmeasurement date.\nLevel 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices in Level 1 that are either for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or\nsimilar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, or inputs\nthat are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\nLevel 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement\ndate, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions.\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to\nunobservable inputs (Level 3).\n17\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as required by\nexisting guidance and the fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy:\nFair Value Measurements - March 31, 2024\nQuoted Significant\nPrices Other Significant\nin Active Observable Unobservable\nFair Markets Inputs Inputs\nValue (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nInterest rate swaps $ 3,504,894 $ — $ 3,504,894 $ —\nTotal $ 3,504,894 $ — $ 3,504,894 $ —\nLiabilities:\nNatural gas purchases $ 1,126,381 $ — $ 1,126,381 $ —\nTotal $ 1,126,381 $ — $ 1,126,381 $ —\nFair Value Measurements - September 30, 2023\nQuoted Significant\nPrices Other Significant\nin Active Observable Unobservable\nFair Markets Inputs Inputs\nValue (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nInterest rate swaps $ 4,617,455 $ — $ 4,617,455 $ —\nTotal $ 4,617,455 $ — $ 4,617,455 $ —\nLiabilities:\nNatural gas purchases $ 1,022,662 $ — $ 1,022,662 $ —\nTotal $ 1,022,662 $ — $ 1,022,662 $ —\nThe fair value of the interest rate swaps are determined by using the counterparty's proprietary models and certain assumptions regarding past,\npresent and future market conditions.\n18\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nUnder the asset management contract, a timing difference can exist between the payment for natural gas purchases and the actual receipt of\nsuch purchases. Payments are made based on a predetermined monthly volume with the price based on weighted average first of the month\nindex prices corresponding to the month of the scheduled payment. At March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had recorded\nin accounts payable the estimated fair value of the liability valued at the corresponding first of month index prices for which the liability is\nexpected to be settled.\nThe Company’s nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis consist of its AROs. The AROs are measured\nat fair value at initial recognition based on expected future cash flows required to settle the obligation.\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, borrowings under line-of-credit, accounts payable (with the exception of\nthe timing difference under the asset management contract), customer credit balances and customer deposits is a reasonable estimate of fair\nvalue due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments. In addition, the carrying amount of the variable rate line-of-credit is a\nreasonable approximation of its fair value.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are not adjusted to fair value in the financial\nstatements:\nFair Value Measurements - March 31, 2024\nQuoted Significant\nPrices Other Significant\nin Active Observable Unobservable\nCarrying Markets Inputs Inputs\nValue (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nLiabilities:\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt $ 125,000 $ — $ — $ 125,000\nNotes payable 136,175,000 — — 133,558,830\nTotal $ 136,300,000 $ — $ — $133,683,830\nFair Value Measurements - September 30, 2023\nQuoted Significant\nPrices Other Significant\nin Active Observable Unobservable\nCarrying Markets Inputs Inputs\nValue (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nLiabilities:\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt $ 10,975,000 $ — $ — $ 10,975,000\nNotes payable 126,100,000 — — 120,298,658\nTotal $ 137,075,000 $ — $ — $131,273,658\nThe fair value of long-term debt is estimated by discounting the future cash flows of the fixed rate debt based on the underlying Treasury rate or\nother Treasury instruments with a corresponding maturity period and estimated credit spread extrapolated based on market conditions since the\nissuance of the debt.\nASC 825, Financial Instruments, requires disclosures regarding concentrations of credit risk from financial instruments. Cash equivalents are\ninvestments in high-grade, short-term securities (original maturity less than three months), placed with financially sound institutions. Accounts\nreceivable are from a diverse group of customers including individuals and small and large companies in various industries. No individual\ncustomer amounted to more than 5% of total accounts receivable at March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The Company maintains\ncertain credit standards with its customers and requires a customer deposit if warranted.\n19\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n10.

Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rates for the three-month and six-month periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 reflected in the table below are less\nthan the combined federal and state statutory rate of 25.74%. The reduction in the effective tax rates for the three-month and six-month\nperiods ended March 31, 2024 is due to additional tax deductions from the amortization of excess deferred taxes and amortization of RNG tax\ncredits deferred as a regulatory liability.

The Company believes its income tax assets and\nliabilities are fairly stated as of March 31, 2024 and 2023; however, these assets and liabilities could be adjusted as a result of this\nexamination. The federal returns prior to September 30, 2017, state returns for Virginia prior to September 30, 2018 and state returns for\nWest Virginia prior to September 30, 2020 are no longer subject to examination.\n13. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company’s regulated operations follow the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC 980, Regulated Operations. A regulated\ncompany may defer costs that have been or are expected to be recovered from customers in a period different from the period in which the\ncosts would ordinarily be charged to expense by an unregulated enterprise. When this situation occurs, costs are deferred as assets in the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheet (regulatory assets) and amortized into expense over periods when such amounts are reflected in\ncustomer rates. Additionally, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and\nfor current collection in customer rates of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future (regulatory liabilities). In the event the provisions\nof ASC 980 no longer apply to any or all regulatory assets or liabilities, the Company would write off such amounts and include the effects in\nthe condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income in the period which ASC 980 no longer applied.\nRegulatory assets included in the Company’s accompanying balance sheets are as follows:\nMarch 31, 2024 September 30, 2023\nAssets:\nCurrent Assets:\nRegulatory assets:\nAccrued WNA revenues $ 3,282,311 $ 414,689\nUnder-recovery of gas costs — 1,383,340\nUnder-recovery of RNG revenues 1,589,211 797,804\nAccrued pension 121,509 243,017\nOther deferred expenses 12,762 15,426\nTotal current 5,005,793 2,854,276\nOther Non-Current Assets:\nRegulatory assets:\nPremium on early retirement of debt 1,198,965 1,256,059\nAccrued pension 3,786,265 3,786,265\nOther deferred expenses 325,707 347,121\nTotal non-current 5,310,937 5,389,445\nTotal regulatory assets $ 10,316,730 $ 8,243,721\n22\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC.

Commitments and Contingencies\nRoanoke Gas currently holds the only franchises and/or CPCNs to distribute natural gas in its service area. These franchises generally extend\nfor multi-year periods and are renewable by the municipalities, including exclusive franchises in the cities of Roanoke and Salem and the Town\nof Vinton, Virginia. All three franchises are set to expire December 31, 2035. In 2019, the SCC issued an order granting a CPCN to furnish\ngas to all of Franklin County. Unlike the CPCNs for the other counties served by Roanoke Gas, the Franklin County CPCN was scheduled to\nterminate within five years of the date of the order if Roanoke Gas did not furnish gas service to the designated service area. In November\n2023, the SCC granted Roanoke Gas a three-year extension on the CPCN. Roanoke Gas plans to serve the Franklin County area with\nnatural gas delivered through the MVP, once MVP is placed into service. See Footnote 5 for further information on the MVP.\nDue to the nature of the natural gas distribution business, the Company has entered into agreements with both suppliers and pipelines for natural\ngas commodity purchases, storage capacity and pipeline delivery capacity. The Company utilizes an asset manager to assist in optimizing the\nuse of its transportation, storage rights and gas supply in order to provide a secure and reliable source of natural gas to its customers. The\nCompany also has storage and pipeline capacity contracts to store and deliver natural gas to the Company’s distribution system. Roanoke Gas\nis currently served directly by two primary pipelines that deliver all of the natural gas supplied to the Company’s distribution system. Depending\non weather conditions and the level of customer demand, failure of one of these transmission pipelines could have a major adverse impact on\nthe Company's ability to deliver natural gas to its customers and its results of operations. The MVP will provide Roanoke Gas with access to\nan additional delivery source to its distribution system, increasing system reliability and the Company's ability to meet future demands for natural\ngas.\n23\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n15. Employee Benefit Plans\nThe Company has both a pension plan and a postretirement plan. The pension plan covers the Company’s employees hired before January 1,\n2017 and provides a retirement benefit based on years of service and employee compensation. The postretirement plan, covering employees\nhired before January 1, 2000, provides certain health care and supplemental life insurance benefits to retired employees who meet specific age\nand service requirements. Net pension plan and postretirement plan expense is detailed as follows:\nThree Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nComponents of net periodic pension cost:\nService cost $ 81,066 $ 91,635 $ 162,132 $ 183,270\nInterest cost 367,206 343,025 734,412 686,050\nExpected return on plan assets (294,958) (308,149) (589,916) (616,298)\nRecognized loss 79,132 79,181 158,264 158,362\nNet periodic pension cost $ 232,446 $ 205,692 $ 464,892 $ 411,384\nThree Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nComponents of postretirement benefit cost:\nService cost $ 7,599 $ 11,475 $ 15,198 $ 22,950\nInterest cost 153,369 155,156 306,738 310,312\nExpected return on plan assets (133,311) (116,012) (266,622) (232,024)\nRecognized gain (10,149) — (20,298) —\nNet postretirement benefit cost $ 17,508 $ 50,619 $ 35,016 $ 101,238\nThe components of net periodic benefit cost, excluding the service cost component, are included in other income, net in the condensed\nconsolidated statements of income. Service cost is included in operations and maintenance expense in the condensed consolidated statements\nof income.\nFor the three-month and six-month periods ended March 31, 2024, no funding contributions were made to the pension plan or postretirement\nplan. The Company is not currently planning to make any funding contributions to either plan for the remainder of fiscal 2024.\n16. Leases\nThe Company leases certain assets including office space and land classified as operating leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is\na lease at inception of the agreement based on the terms and conditions in the contract. The operating lease ROU assets and operating lease\nliabilities are recognized as the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most of the\nleases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an estimate of its secured incremental borrowing rate based on the information\navailable at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The incremental borrowing rate is determined by\nmanagement aided by inquiries of a third party.\nLease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. The Company made an\naccounting policy election that payments under agreements with an initial term of 12 months or less will not be included on the condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet but will be recognized when paid in the consolidated statements of operations.\n24\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company entered into a land lease in conjunction with its RNG facility that has a 20-year term with two five-year\nrenewal options that are not considered part of the ROU asset and liability as the decision to elect said options will be made by the Company in\nthe future. The Company also has three other operating leases with original terms ranging from 3 to 6 years.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe three-month and six-month earnings presented herein should not be considered as reflective of the Company’s consolidated financial results for\nthe fiscal year ending September 30, 2024. The total revenues and margins realized during the first six months reflect higher billings due to the\nweather-sensitive nature of the natural gas business.\nOverview\nResources is an energy services company primarily engaged in the regulated sale and distribution of natural gas to approximately 63,300 residential,\ncommercial and industrial customers in Roanoke, Virginia and surrounding localities through its Roanoke Gas subsidiary. Midstream, a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Resources, is a less than 1% investor in both the MVP and Southgate. The utility operations of Roanoke Gas are regulated by the\nSCC, which oversees the terms, conditions and rates charged to customers for natural gas service, safety standards, extension of service and\ndepreciation. The Company is also subject to regulation from the United States Department of Transportation in regard to the construction,\noperation, maintenance, safety and integrity of its transmission and distribution pipelines. FERC regulates the prices for the transportation and\ndelivery of natural gas to the Company’s distribution system and underground storage services. In addition, the Company is subject to other\nregulations which are not necessarily industry specific.\nNearly all of the Company’s revenues are derived from the sale and delivery of natural gas to Roanoke Gas customers based on rates and fees\nauthorized by the SCC. These rates are designed to provide the Company with the opportunity to recover its gas and non-gas expenses and to earn\na reasonable rate of return for shareholders based on normal weather. These rates are determined based on various rate applications filed with the\nSCC. Generally, investments related to extending service to new customers are recovered through the additional revenues generated by the non-gas\nbase rates in place at that time. The investment in replacing and upgrading existing infrastructure, as well as recovering increases in non-gas expenses\ndue to inflationary pressures, regulatory requirements or operational needs, are generally not recoverable until a formal rate application is filed to\ninclude the additional investment and higher costs, and new non-gas base rates are approved.\nBeginning January 1, 2023, Roanoke Gas implemented interim, non-gas base rates designed to provide $8.55 million in additional annual revenues in\nresponse to higher operating costs and to recover its investment in non-SAVE related projects since the prior non-gas base rate increase in fiscal\n2019. Revenues from the SAVE Plan and Rider were incorporated into the new non-gas base rates. On December 19, 2023, the SCC issued a\nfinal order approving a non-gas base rate increase of $7.45 million. The order also directed Roanoke Gas to refund the excess revenues collected\nduring the time the interim rates were in effect with interest. Refunds to customers, which were accrued in fiscal 2023 and reflected in regulatory\nliabilities, were made in February 2024. On February 2, 2024, primarily in response to continued inflationary pressures, Roanoke Gas filed for a\nnon-gas base rate increase of $4.33 million, which reflected an increase in the Company's authorized rate of return from 9.44% to 10.35%. The new\nnon-gas base rates will go into effect for customer billings on or after July 1, 2024, subject to refund. These additional revenues are subject to refund\npending audit, which is currently underway. A hearing has been set for November 7, 2024. See the Regulatory section for additional information.\nOn April 22, 2024, the LLC filed a request for FERC's approval to place MVP in service no later than May 23, 2024. Transmission of gas is\nexpected to begin soon after approval is received. The LLC will submit separate filings for implementing tariff and transportation agreements. See\nthe Equity Investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline section for additional information on MVP.\nAs the Company’s business is seasonal in nature, volatility in winter weather and the commodity price of natural gas can impact the effectiveness of\nthe Company’s rates in recovering its costs and providing a reasonable return for its shareholders. In order to mitigate the effect of weather variations\nand other factors not provided for in the Company's base rates, Roanoke Gas has certain approved rate mechanisms in place that help provide\nstability in earnings, adjust for volatility in the price of natural gas and provide a return on qualified infrastructure investment. These mechanisms\ninclude the SAVE Rider, WNA, ICC, RNG Rider and PGA.\nThe SAVE Plan and Rider provides the Company with a mechanism through which it recovers costs related to qualified SAVE infrastructure\ninvestments on a prospective basis, until a rate application is filed incorporating these investments in non-gas base rates. SAVE Plan revenues\nincreased by approximately $68,000 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 and decreased by approximately $960,000 for the six-\nmonth period ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same periods last year, reflecting the movement of the SAVE Plan revenues into the new non-\ngas base rates on January 1, 2023. Roanoke Gas filed and received approval from the SCC for a new SAVE Plan and Rider with new rates placed\ninto effect on October 1, 2023 that is expected to result in approximately $366,000 in SAVE-related revenues during fiscal 2024. Additional\ninformation regarding the SAVE Plan and Rider is provided under the Regulatory section below.\n27\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe WNA mechanism reduces the volatility in earnings due to the variability in temperatures during the heating season. The WNA is based on the\nmost recent 30-year temperature average and provides the Company with a level of earnings protection when weather is warmer than normal and\nprovides its customers with price protection when weather is colder than normal. The WNA allows the Company to recover from its customers the\nlost margin (excluding gas costs) from warmer-than-normal weather and correspondingly requires the Company to refund the excess margin earned\nfor colder-than-normal weather. The WNA mechanism used by the Company is based on a linear regression model that determines the value of a\nsingle heating degree day and thereby estimates the revenue adjustment based on weather variance from normal. Any billings or refunds related to\nthe WNA are completed following each WNA year, which extends for the 12-month period from April to March. For the three and six\nmonths ended March 31, 2024, the Company accrued approximately $1,694,000 and $2,868,000 in additional revenues under the WNA model for\nweather that was 18% and 17% warmer than normal, respectively, compared to approximately $2,800,000 and $2,612,000 in additional\nrevenues for weather that was 28% and 15% warmer than normal for the corresponding periods last year. The WNA balance for the 12-month\nperiod ended March 31, 2024 was approximately $3,282,000, which will be collected from customers beginning in May 2024.\nThe Company has an approved rate structure to mitigate the impact of the financing costs of its natural gas inventory. Under this rate structure,\nRoanoke Gas recognizes revenue by applying the ICC factor, based on the Company’s weighted-average cost of capital, including interest rates on\nshort-term and long-term debt, and the Company’s authorized return on equity, to the average cost of natural gas inventory during the period. Total\nICC revenues decreased by approximately $67,000 and $195,000 for the three-month and six-month periods ended March 31, 2024,\nrespectively, compared to the corresponding periods last year, due to lower natural gas commodity prices during the 2023 summer storage injection\nseason resulting in a lower average cost of natural gas in storage. Accordingly, fiscal 2024 and 2025 ICC revenues are expected to continue to\nremain below last year's levels.\nIn March 2023, Roanoke Gas began operating the RNG facility, through a cooperative agreement with the Western Virginia Water Authority, to\nproduce commercial quality RNG for delivery into its distribution system. With SCC approval, Roanoke Gas is allowed to recover the costs\nassociated with the investment in RNG facilities and the related operating costs through an RNG Rider. Customers receive the benefit of\nthe monetization of environmental credits generated through the production of RNG. Roanoke Gas recognized approximately $517,000 and\n$818,000 in revenue for the three and six months ended March 31, 2024, respectively, compared to approximately $83,000 for both the three and\nsix months ended March 31, 2023.\nThe cost of natural gas, which is a pass-through cost, is independent of the Company's non-gas rates. Accordingly, the Company's approved billing\nrates include a component designed to allow for the recovery of the cost of natural gas used by its customers. This rate component, referred to as\nthe PGA, allows the Company to pass along to its customers increases and decreases in natural gas costs through a quarterly filing, or more frequent\nif necessary, with the SCC. Once SCC approval is received, the Company adjusts the gas cost component of its rates. As actual costs will differ\nfrom the projections used in establishing the PGA rate, the Company will either over-recover or under-recover its actual gas costs during the period.\nThe difference between actual costs incurred and costs recovered through the application of the PGA is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability. At\nthe end of the annual deferral period, the balance is amortized over an ensuing 12-month period as amounts are reflected in customer billings.\nResults of Operations\nThe analysis on the results of operations is based on the consolidated operations of the Company, which is primarily associated with the utility\nsegment. Additional segment analysis is provided when Midstream's investment in affiliates represents a significant component of the comparison.\nThe Company's operating revenues are affected by the cost of natural gas, as reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of income under\ncost of gas - utility. The cost of natural gas, which includes commodity price, transportation, storage, injection and withdrawal fees, with any increase\nor decrease offset by a correlating change in revenue through the PGA, is passed through to customers at cost. Accordingly, management believes\nthat gross utility margin, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as utility revenues less cost of gas, is a more useful and relevant measure to analyze\nfinancial performance. The term gross utility margin is not intended to represent or replace operating income, the most comparable GAAP financial\nmeasure, as an indicator of operating performance and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The\nfollowing results of operations analyses will reference gross utility margin.\n28\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC.

Natural gas commodity prices during the quarter declined by 42% from the corresponding period last year. Total gas costs\ndecreased by 28% compared to the same period last year, which corresponds to a 35% decline in the gas cost component included in total customer\nbilling rate, offset by an increase in residential and commercial volumes. Additionally, heating degree days decreased 18% when compared to the\n30-year normal, resulting in a 39% decrease in WNA revenues for the period. While heating degree days compared to normal decreased, heating\ndegree days compared to the same period last year increased by 13%, resulting in a 12% increase in the more weather-sensitive residential and\ncommercial volumes. Transportation and interruptible volumes increased by approximately 3% primarily due to a single, multi-fuel customer that\nincreased its natural gas utilization during the quarter.\nThree Months Ended March 31, Increase /\n2024 2023 (Decrease) Percentage\nGross Utility Margin\nGas utility revenues $ 32,632,331 $ 38,000,977 $ (5,368,646) (14)%\nCost of gas - utility 15,299,390 21,285,057 (5,985,667) (28)%\nGross utility margin $ 17,332,941 $ 16,715,920 $ 617,021 4%\nGGrroossss uuttiilliittyy mmaarrggiinn iinnccrreeaasseedd oovveerr tthhee ssaammee ppeerriioodd llaasstt yyeeaarr pprriimmaarriillyy aass aa rreessuulltt ooff iinnccrreeaasseedd ddeelliivveerreedd vvoolluummeess,, SSAAVVEE aanndd RRNNGG rreevveennuuee,, ooffffsseett bbyy\nthe reductions in WNA and ICC revenues.

Personnel costs increased by approximately\n$702,000 due to increased staffing and the inflationary impact on salaries and benefits as well as amortization of restricted stock awards. During\nfiscal 2023, no restricted stock awards were made and were reinstated in fiscal 2024. Further, costs associated with the RNG facility increased\napproximately $228,000, as the facility began operations in March 2023, as compared to being fully operational for all three months in the current\nquarter. Professional services expenses increased approximately $95,000 primarily due to increased external audit fees and recruiting costs. Lower\ncapitalized overheads and increased corporate insurance premiums accounted for much of the remaining cost increases.\nGeneral taxes increased by $64,982, or 10%, primarily due to higher property taxes associated with growth in utility property and increases in\npayroll taxes related to increased staffing and compensation.\nDepreciation expense increased by $278,166, or 11%, on a commensurate increase in utility property balances.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate increased by $1,226,517 associated with the recognition of AFUDC as a result of MVP construction\nactivities resuming.\nOther income, net decreased by $32,337, or 27%, primarily due to the absence of AFUDC related to the RNG facility, which was placed in service\nin March 2023, and increased postretirement costs, partially offset by an increase in revenue sharing related to the asset management agreement.\nInterest expense increased by $170,751, or 12%, as the weighted-average interest rate on total debt increased from 3.94% during the second\nquarter of fiscal 2023 to 4.31% during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 coupled with a 2% increase in the total daily average debt\noutstanding period-over-period. The increase in the weighted-average interest rate was primarily associated with Roanoke Gas' variable rate line-of-\ncredit and Midstream's credit facility.\nRoanoke Gas' interest expense increased by $101,458 primarily due to a combination of higher borrowing levels and an increase in the interest rate\non the variable rate line-of-credit.\nMidstream's interest expense increased by $69,293 primarily due to rising interest rates on its credit facility. Total average outstanding debt\ndecreased by $2.2 million from the same quarter last year due to amortization payments under two of Midstream's promissory notes.\nIncome tax expense decreased by $39,788, or 2%. Although income before taxes slightly increased, the reduction in income tax expense is primarily\ndue to the recognition of tax credits associated with the RNG facility that had not been utilized in the prior year due to timing of the RNG facility\nbecoming operational. The effective tax rate was 23.1% and 23.8% for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The effective tax rate is below the combined statutory state and federal rate due to the amortization of excess deferred taxes and tax\ncredits.\n30\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC.

Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions.\nThere have been no significant changes to the critical accounting policies as reflected in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended September 30, 2023.\nAsset Management\nRoanoke Gas uses a third-party asset manager to oversee its pipeline transportation, storage rights and gas supply inventories and deliveries. In\nreturn for utilizing the excess capacities of the transportation and storage rights, the asset manager pays Roanoke Gas a monthly utilization fee. In\naccordance with an SCC order issued in 2018, a portion of the utilization fee is retained by the Company with the balance passed through to\ncustomers through reduced gas costs. The current asset management agreement ends March 31, 2025. Upon MVP being placed in service, the\nCompany expects to sign an asset management agreement for the utilization of its MVP capacity.\nEquity Investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline\nThe Company has a less than 1% interest in the MVP, which is accounted for as an equity investment, and a less than 1% interest in Southgate, which\nis contemplated to interconnect with the MVP. As discussed more fully in Note 5, since inception, the MVP has encountered various legal and\nregulatory issues that have substantially delayed the completion of the project. With the passage of the FRA and certain judicial rulings in mid-2023,\nconstruction work was restarted, and the Company believes the MVP will be completed during the second calendar quarter of 2024.\nSince its inception, earnings from MVP have been primarily attributable to AFUDC income. The Company recorded $2,697,219 and $4,099 in the\nfirst half of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, as its share of Midstream’s earnings, primarily associated with AFUDC. On April 22, 2024, the\nLLC filed its in service request for MVP with FERC, with an expectation that during the second calendar quarter gas will begin to flow and the long-\nterm firm contracts will become effective. Once the pipeline is commercially operational, AFUDC will cease and the Company will begin to receive\nits share of LLC earnings from long-term contracts to provide gas. Resources expects cash distributions from the LLC to begin three to six months\nafter commercial operations begin.\nThe Company refinanced two promissory notes related to Midstream in the last 60 days. Additionally, Midstream is considering its long-term capital\nstructure as the MVP evolves from a project phase to an operating phase. See Note 7 for a full discussion of all borrowings related to Midstream.\nRegulatory\nIn response to continued inflationary pressures, Roanoke Gas filed a general rate application on February 2, 2024 with the SCC seeking to increase\nits non-gas base rates by $4.33 million and sought to increase its permitted rate of return from 9.44% to 10.35% reflecting its higher cost of capital,\nincluding continued increases in interest rates. The new rates will go into effect for customer billings on or after July 1, 2024, subject to refund. The\nSCC’s review of Roanoke Gas’ filing is underway and a hearing has been set for November 7, 2024.\nOn December 2, 2022, Roanoke Gas filed an expedited rate application with the SCC seeking an $8.55 million annual increase in its non-gas base\nrates, of which $4.05 million was being recovered through the SAVE Rider. The proposed rates went into effect January 1, 2023, subject to refund.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company reached a settlement with the SCC staff on all outstanding issues in the case. Under the terms of\nthe settlement, the Company agreed to an incremental revenue requirement of $7.45 million. The Company agreed to begin billing the new rates\neffective October 1, 2023. The Commission issued its Final Order in the matter on December 19, 2023 in which it approved the settlement\nagreement in its entirety. Refunds, which had previously been accrued, were made to customers in February 2024.\n33\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOn August 31, 2023, the SCC approved the new SAVE Plan and Rider with rates effective October 1, 2023. Under this plan, Roanoke Gas can\nrecover costs associated with an estimated $8.5 million in SAVE eligible investment in fiscal 2024 and an estimated cumulative investment of $49.5\nmillion over the proposed five-year plan period ending September 30, 2028. The plan was approved with a revenue requirement of approximately\n$366,000 for fiscal 2024.\nRoanoke Gas is authorized by the SCC to acquire certain natural gas distribution assets from a local housing authority at five separate apartment\ncomplexes, located in the Company’s service territory. The housing authority renews existing natural gas distribution facilities to include mains and\nservices then transfers ownership of these facilities to Roanoke Gas. In turn, Roanoke Gas assumes responsibility for the operation and maintenance\nof these assets and recognizes a gain related to the asset acquisition equal to the cost associated with the renewal.\nThe assets of two complexes were transferred to Roanoke Gas in fiscal 2022. On September 29, 2023, the housing authority transferred the assets\nfrom one additional apartment complex to Roanoke Gas and the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $311,000 during the fourth\nquarter of fiscal 2023. The authority is underway with renewing the fourth complex and is awaiting future funding to complete the remaining\napartment complex. The timing of funding and the completion of the asset renewals for these complexes is uncertain at this time.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nDue to the capital-intensive nature of the utility business, as well as the impact of weather variability, the Company’s primary capital needs are the\nfunding of its capital projects, the seasonal funding of its natural gas inventories and accounts receivables, debt service and payments of dividends to\nshareholders. The Company anticipates funding these items through its operating cash flows, credit availability under short-term and long-term debt\nagreements and proceeds from the sale of its common stock.\nCash and cash equivalents increased by $506,752 for the six-month period ended March 31, 2024 compared to an increase of $1,727,059 for the\nsix-month period ended March 31, 2023. The following table summarizes the sources and uses of cash:\nSix Months Ended March 31,\nCash Flow Summary 2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 11,202,002 $ 16,965,342\nNet cash used in investing activities (11,280,748) (14,350,139)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities 585,498 (888,144)\nIncrease in cash and cash equivalents $ 506,752 $ 1,727,059\nCash Flows Used in Operating Activities:\nThe seasonal nature of the natural gas business causes operating cash flows to fluctuate significantly during the year as well as from year-to-year.\nFactors, including weather, energy prices, natural gas storage levels and customer collections, contribute to working capital levels and related cash\nflows. Generally, operating cash flows are positive during the second and third fiscal quarters as a combination of earnings, declining storage gas\nlevels and collections on customer accounts contribute to higher cash levels. During the first and fourth fiscal quarters, operating cash flows generally\ndecrease due to increases in natural gas storage levels and rising customer receivable balances.\n34\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCash flows from operating activities for the six months ended March 31, 2024 decreased by $5,763,340 compared to the same period last year. The\ntable below summarizes the significant components of operating cash flows:\nSix Months Ended March 31, Increase/\nCash Flow From Operating Activities: 2024 2023 (Decrease)\nNet income $ 11,463,382 $ 9,598,291 $ 1,865,091\nNon-cash adjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization 5,523,841 4,954,167 569,674\nEquity in earnings (2,697,219) (4,099) (2,693,120)\nAFUDC — (198,308) 198,308\nChanges in working capital and regulatory assets and liabilities:\nAccounts receivable (5,584,720) (5,155,446) (429,274)\nGas in storage 6,087,562 12,037,790 (5,950,228)\nAccounts payable (133,623) (1,696,080) 1,562,457\nWNA (2,867,622) (2,612,454) (255,168)\nRNG (791,407) (95,290) (696,117)\nRate refund (652,018) 763,283 (1,415,301)\nIncome tax 1,568,699 (15,952) 1,584,651\nOther (714,873) (610,560) (104,313)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 11,202,002 $ 16,965,342 $ (5,763,340)\nThe decline in operating cash flows is primarily due to the reduction in the value of gas withdrawn from storage. The average price of gas in storage\nduring the first six months of fiscal 2023 was more than $7.00 per DTH compared to approximately $4.50 per DTH during the current fiscal year.\nThe decrease in the unit cost of gas in storage was attributable to much lower commodity prices during last year's summer storage injections.\nAccordingly, as lower-priced gas was withdrawn from storage during the first half of fiscal 2024, cash flow levels were reduced when compared to\nthe same period in fiscal 2023. Additionally, though the SCC issued its final order in December 2023, Roanoke Gas implemented interim billing rates\nin January 2023; therefore, the Company began accruing an estimated rate refund representing the amount due customers for the difference between\ntotal customer billings at interim rates versus total customer billings at final rates. Upon SCC approval of final rates, Roanoke Gas issued refunds in\nFebruary 2024 to all customers that were billed at interim rates since January 2023. When compared to the six-month period ending March 31,\n2023, the distribution of the rate refund to customers reduced cash available for operations by $1.4 million. The timing of income tax estimated\npayments during the first six months of fiscal 2023 and the receipt of a tax refund during the first six months of fiscal 2024, net of estimated payments,\nresulted in a $1.6 million increase in operating cash between periods. The increase in non-cash equity in earnings from the Company's investment in\nthe LLC of $2.7 million offset most of the net income cash flow.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities:\nInvesting activities primarily consist of expenditures related to Roanoke Gas' utility property, which includes replacing aging natural gas pipe with new\nplastic or coated steel pipe, improvements to the LNG plant and gas distribution system facilities and expansion of its natural gas system to meet the\ndemands of customer growth. With the recent approval of its new SAVE Plan and Rider, the Company is continuing its focus on SAVE infrastructure\nreplacement projects, including the replacement of pre-1973 first generation plastic pipe. New customer demand for natural gas continues to be\nstrong and therefore extending the natural gas distribution system within its service territory is also a priority. Roanoke Gas' total capital expenditures\nfor the six-month period ended March 31, 2024 were approximately $11.3 million compared to $12.9 million during the same period last year. The\n$1.6 million decrease in expenditures is primarily due to higher investment a year ago related to the completion of the RNG project, which was\nplaced in service in March 2023. Total fiscal 2024 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $21 million. Midstream's investment in the\nLLC was approximately $1.5 million in the first half of fiscal 2023. However, Midstream ceased future participation in capital calls following its May\n2023 funding payment based on an agreement with the LLC's managing partner. Midstream continues to be invested in the LLC; however, its\nparticipation percentage is declining with no additional investment. Once MVP is placed into service, which is expected in the second calendar\nquarter of 2024, Midstream may incur periodic future capital investment related to ongoing operations requirements and system improvements.\nMidstream has and will continue to make capital investments in Southgate. The targeted timing for completion of the Southgate project is 2028.\n35\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCash Flows Provided by Financing Activities:\nFinancing activities generally consist of borrowings and repayments under credit agreements, issuance of common stock and the payment of\ndividends. Net cash flows provided by financing activities were approximately $600,000 for the six months ended March 31, 2024, compared to\n$900,000 in net cash flows used in financing activities for the same period last year. The $1.5 million increase in financing cash flows is primarily\nattributable to net borrowings of $2.2 million under Roanoke Gas' line-of-credit during the first six months of fiscal 2024 compared to no net\nborrowings in the same period last year. Roanoke Gas' increased borrowings were slightly offset by a decrease of approximately $800,000 in\nborrowings under Midstream's credit facility during the first half of fiscal 2024 combined with an additional $800,000 in debt retirements on\namortizing notes during the current year. In addition, Resources issued a total of 164,225 shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of $3.2\nmillion, including 85,501 shares through the ATM program in which Resources received $1.7 million, net of fees. During the same period last year,\nResources issued 102,812 shares for $2.1 million, including 74,566 shares through the ATM program for $1.6 million, net of fees.\nNotes 6 and 7 provide details on the Company's line-of-credit and borrowing activity.\nThe current interest rate environment is expected to continue to result in higher year-over-year interest expense associated with the Company's\nvariable-rate debt or on the issuance of any new debt.\nManagement regularly evaluates the Company’s liquidity through a review of its available financing resources and its cash flows. Resources maintains\nthe ability to raise equity capital through its ATM program, private placement or other public offerings. Management believes Roanoke Gas has\naccess to sufficient financing resources to meet its cash requirements for the next year, including the line of credit and the two private shelf facilities.\nRoanoke Gas may also adjust capital spending, as necessary, if such a need would arise.\nBased on the agreement with the LLC's managing partner to assume future capital contributions related to the MVP, Midstream's future cash\nrequirements are reduced to regular monthly operating expenses, debt service and capital contributions to Southgate. On March 6, 2024, Midstream\nconsolidated the Promissory Notes to one Promissory Note with one lender, increased the capacity of its $23 million credit facility to $25 million\nand extended the maturity date to December 31, 2025. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, on May 2, 2024, Midstream established a new $9\nmillion line of credit facility that matures on May 2, 2026. With this agreement, Midstream has the ability and intent to refinance the $9 million\nbalance on its note payable scheduled to mature on June 1, 2024, and accordingly, it has classified that amount as long-term on the condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2024. After considering the extension of its original credit facility and the establishment of the new credit\nfacility, Midstream's total debt service over the succeeding 12 months includes $125,000 to retire maturing debt. Management believes that it will be\nable to meet Midstream's cash requirements over the ensuing 12-month period.\nAs of March 31, 2024, Resources' long-term capitalization ratio was 45% equity and 55% debt.\nITEM 3 – QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot applicable.\nITEM 4 – CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be\ndisclosed in reports under the Exchange Act are identified, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the\nrules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow for timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\nThrough March 31, 2024, the Company has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the chief executive\nofficer and the chief financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon\nthat evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective\nat the reasonable assurance level as of March 31, 2024.\nManagement routinely reviews the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and makes changes, as necessary, to enhance the effectiveness\nof the internal controls. There were no control changes during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n36\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONDENSED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nUNAUDITED\n1. Basis of Presentation\nResources is an energy services company primarily engaged in the sale and distribution of natural gas. The condensed consolidated financial\nstatements include the accounts of Resources and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: Roanoke Gas, Diversified Energy and Midstream.\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of\nonly normal recurring accruals) necessary to fairly present Resources' financial position as of December 31, 2023, cash flows for the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations, comprehensive income, and changes in stockholders' equity for\nthe three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2023 are not\nindicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024 as quarterly earnings are affected by the highly seasonal\nnature of the business and weather conditions generally result in greater earnings during the winter months.\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and condensed notes are presented under the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nPursuant to those rules, certain information and note disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance\nwith GAAP have been condensed or omitted. Although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate, the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and condensed notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes contained in the\nCompany’s Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023. The September 30, 2023 consolidated balance sheet was included in the\nCompany’s audited financial statements included in Form 10-K.\nRoanoke Gas’ line of credit is renewed annually in March, and there is approximately $6,700,000 outstanding under the line of credit at the\ntime of this filing. Separately, Midstream has $33,850,000 of current maturities of long-term debt due in the next 12 months. These amounts, in\nthe aggregate, exceed the liquidity available to the Company through currently executed agreements and anticipated operating cash flows over\nthis period without taking additional actions involving a third party. As a result, under ASU 2014-15, substantial doubt exists about the\nCompany's ability to continue as a going concern.\nManagement's plans are to refinance these amounts and management's discussions with banks regarding refinancing the amounts have been\npositive. Additionally, the Company has refinanced this debt in the past and the pending completion of the MVP further supports a favorable\nlikelihood of successful refinancing. Since such refinancing is not entirely within the Company's control, there can be no assurances that such\nrefinancing can be completed.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results\ncould differ from those estimates.\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in the Company's\nForm 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nCertain amounts previously disclosed have been reclassified to conform to current year presentations.\n7\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRecently Issued or Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) - Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate\nReform on Financial Reporting. In combination with ASU 2021-01 and ASU 2022-06, the ASU provides temporary optional guidance to\nease the potential burden in accounting for and recognizing the effects of reference rate change on financial reporting. The new guidance applies\nspecifically to contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR, or any other referenced rate that is expected to be discontinued due\nto reference rate reform. The new guidance is effective for the Company through December 31, 2024. The Intercontinental Exchange\nBenchmark Administration, the administrator for LIBOR and other inter-bank offered rates, announced that the LIBOR rates for one-day,\none-month, six-month and one-year would cease publication in June 2023 and that no new financial contracts may use LIBOR after December\n31, 2021. Subsequent to June 30, 2023, the one-day, one-month, six-month, and one-year LIBOR settings will continue to be published under\nan unrepresentative synthetic methodology until the end of September 2024 in order to bridge the transition to other reference rates. The\nCompany has transitioned all but one LIBOR-based variable rate note to a new reference rate as of December 31, 2023. Each of the revised\nnotes has a corresponding swap that was also transitioned to align with the related notes. The last LIBOR-based variable rate note will mature\nin fiscal 2024. See Note 7 and Note 9 for more information.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures. The new guidance is designed to provide users of financial statements with enhanced disclosures regarding the information\nprovided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and how the CODM uses the information in assessing the performance of each\nsegment. The Company is currently evaluating the new standard and determining the additional disclosure requirements. The new guidance is\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2024.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The new\nguidance requires that on an annual basis public business entities disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation table and provide\nadditional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (items equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed\nby multiplying pretax income or loss by the applicable statutory rate). The required disclosures will provide more granularity regarding the\npayment of income taxes to federal, state and foreign entities. The Company does not expect certain requirements of this ASU to have a\nsignificant impact to its current disclosures as all of its operations are domestic and reside in two states. Changes to the rate reconciliation table\nwill result in additional disclosure. The new guidance is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15,\n2024.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued by the FASB or other standard-setting bodies are not currently applicable to the Company\nor are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n8\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n2. Leases\nThe Company leases certain assets including office space and land classified as operating leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is\na lease at inception of the agreement based on the terms and conditions in the contract. The operating lease ROU assets and operating lease\nliabilities are recognized as the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most of the\nleases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an estimate of its secured incremental borrowing rate based on the information\navailable at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The incremental borrowing rate is determined by\nmanagement aided by inquiries of a third party.\nLease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. The Company made an\naccounting policy election that payments under agreements with an initial term of 12 months or less will not be included on the condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet but will be recognized when paid in the consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company entered into a land lease in conjunction with its RNG facility that has a 20-year term with two five-year\nrenewal options that are not considered part of the ROU asset and liability as the decision to elect said options will be made by the Company in\nthe future. The Company also has three other operating leases with original terms ranging from 3 to 6 years. The operating lease ROU assets of\n$354,320 are reflected in other non-current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The current operating lease liabilities of\n$30,657 and non-current lease liabilities of $321,056 are included in other current liabilities and deferred credits and other non-current\nliabilities, respectively, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The cost components of the Company’s operating leases are included\nunder operations and maintenance expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income and were less than $50,000 for each period\npresented.\nOther information related to leases were as follows:\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information:\nCash paid on operating leases $ 6,766 $ 12,600\nRight of use obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations N/A N/A\nWeighted-average remaining term (in years) 17.4 2.8\nWeighted-average discount rate N/A N/A\nOn December 31, 2023, the future minimum rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases by fiscal year were as follows:\n2024 $ 42,300\n2025 43,065\n2026 30,038\n2027 30,038\n2028 26,400\nThereafter 369,600\nTotal minimum lease payments 541,441\nLess imputed interest (189,728)\nTotal $ 351,713\n9\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n3. Revenue\nThe Company assesses new contracts and identifies related performance obligations for promises to transfer distinct goods or services to the\ncustomer. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations have been satisfied. In the case of Roanoke Gas, the Company contracts with\nits customers for the sale and/or delivery of natural gas.\nThe following tables summarize revenue by customer, product and income statement classification:\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2023 Three Months Ended December 31, 2022\nTotal operating Total operating\nGas utility Non utility revenues Gas utility Non utility revenues\nNatural Gas (Billed and\nUnbilled):\nResidential $ 13,824,642 $ — $ 13,824,642 $ 19,365,840 $ — $ 19,365,840\nCommercial 7,841,726 — 7,841,726 12,019,113 — 12,019,113\nTransportation and\ninterruptible 1,370,270 — 1,370,270 1,588,068 — 1,588,068\nOther 293,888 27,498 321,386 421,995 29,568 451,563\nTotal contracts with customers 23,330,526 27,498 23,358,024 33,395,016 29,568 33,424,584\nAlternative revenue programs 1,061,328 — 1,061,328 (142,249) — (142,249)\nTotal operating revenues $ 24,391,854 $ 27,498 $ 24,419,352 $ 33,252,767 $ 29,568 $ 33,282,335\nGas utility revenues\nSubstantially all of Roanoke Gas' revenues are derived from rates authorized by the SCC through its tariffs. Based on its evaluation, the\nCompany has concluded that these tariff-based revenues fall within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Tariff\nrates represent the transaction price. Performance obligations created under these tariff-based sales include the cost of natural gas sold to\ncustomers (commodity) and the cost of transporting natural gas through the Company’s distribution system to customers (delivery). The\ndelivery of natural gas to customers results in the satisfaction of the Company’s respective performance obligations over time.\nAll customers are billed monthly based on consumption as measured by metered usage with payments due 20 days from the rendering of the\nbill. Revenue is recognized as bills are issued for natural gas that has been delivered or transported. In addition, the Company utilizes the\npractical expedient that allows an entity to recognize the invoiced amount as revenue, if that amount corresponds to the value received by the\ncustomer. Since customers are billed tariff rates, there is no variable consideration in the transaction price.\nUnbilled revenue is included in residential and commercial revenues in the preceding table. Natural gas consumption is estimated for the period\nsubsequent to the last billed date and up through the last day of the month. Estimated volumes and approved tariff rates are utilized to calculate\nunbilled revenue. The following month, the unbilled estimate is reversed, the actual usage is billed and a new unbilled estimate is calculated. The\nCompany obtains metered usage for industrial customers at the end of each month, thereby eliminating any unbilled consideration for these rate\nclasses.\n10\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOther revenues\nOther revenues primarily consist of miscellaneous fees and charges, utility-related revenues not directly billed to utility customers and billings for\nnon-utility activities. Customers are invoiced monthly based on services provided for these activities. The Company utilizes the practical\nexpedient allowing revenue to be recognized based on invoiced amounts. The transaction price is based on a contractually predetermined rate\nschedule; therefore, the transaction price represents total value to the customer and no variable price consideration exists.\nAlternative revenue program revenues\nARPs, which fall outside the scope of ASC 606, are SCC approved mechanisms that allow for the adjustment of revenues for certain broad,\nexternal factors, or for additional billings if the entity achieves certain performance targets. The Company's ARPs include its WNA, which\nadjusts revenues for the effects of weather temperature variations as compared to the 30-year average; the SAVE Plan over/under collection\nmechanism, which adjusts revenues for the differences between SAVE Plan revenues billed to customers and the revenue earned, as calculated\nbased on the timing and extent of infrastructure replacement completed during the period; and the RNG over/under collection mechanism,\nwhich adjusts revenues similar to the SAVE Plan, but is calculated based on the timing and costs associated with owning, operating and\nmaintaining the RNG facility. These amounts are ultimately collected from, or returned to, customers through future rate changes as approved\nby the SCC.\nCustomer accounts receivable and liabilities\nAccounts receivable, as reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, includes both billed and unbilled customer revenues, as well as\namounts that are not related to customers. The balances of customer receivables are provided below:\nCurrent Assets Current Liabilities\nTrade accounts Unbilled Customer Customer\nreceivable(1) revenue(1) credit balances deposits\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ 2,782,025 $ 1,240,097 $ 1,972,132 $ 1,476,321\nBalance at December 31, 2023 8,302,330 4,757,101 1,882,100 1,646,267\nIncrease (decrease) $ 5,520,305 $ 3,517,004 $ (90,032) $ 169,946\n(1) Included in accounts receivable in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Amounts shown net of reserve for credit losses.\nThe Company had no significant contract assets or liabilities during the period. Furthermore, the Company did not incur any significant costs to\nobtain contracts.\n4. Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rates for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 reflected in the table below are less than the\ncombined federal and state statutory rate of 25.74%. The reduction in the effective tax rate for the three-month period ended December 31,\n2023 is due to additional tax deductions from the amortization of excess deferred taxes and amortization of RNG tax credits deferred as a\nregulatory liability. The reduction in the effective tax rate for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 is due to additional tax\ndeductions from the amortization of excess deferred taxes and amortization of R&D tax credits deferred as a regulatory liability.\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nEffective tax rate 24.0% 23.4%\nThe Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and state income tax returns in Virginia and West Virginia, and thus subject to\nexaminations by federal and state tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining the Company's 2018 and 2019 federal tax returns and the\nultimate outcome of these examinations is unknown as of the date of this Form 10-Q. The Company believes its income tax assets and\nliabilities are fairly stated as of December 31, 2023 and 2022; however, these assets and liabilities could be adjusted as a result of this\nexamination. The federal returns prior to September 30, 2017, state returns for Virginia prior to September 30, 2018 and state returns for\nWest Virginia prior to September 30, 2020 are no longer subject to examination.\n11\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n5. Rates and Regulatory Matters\nThe SCC exercises regulatory authority over the natural gas operations of Roanoke Gas. Such regulation encompasses terms, conditions and\nrates to be charged to customers for natural gas service, safety standards, service extension and depreciation.\nOn December 2, 2022, Roanoke Gas filed an application with the SCC seeking an $8.55 million annual increase in its non-gas base rates, of\nwhich $4.05 million was being recovered through the SAVE Rider. Since the Company was seeking to recover the costs associated with its\nSAVE Plan through interim non-gas base rates effective January 1, 2023, the Company discontinued its SAVE Plan and Rider for the\nremainder of fiscal 2023.\nOn December 21, 2022, the SCC issued its Order for Notice and Hearing, which authorized the Company to put its proposed rates into\neffect, on an interim basis and subject to refund, on January 1, 2023, and set the matter for hearing. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the\nCompany reached a settlement with the SCC staff on all outstanding issues in the case. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company agreed\nto an incremental revenue requirement of $7.45 million. The Company agreed to begin billing the new rates effective October 1, 2023. The\nCommission issued its Final Order in the matter on December 19, 2023 in which it approved the settlement agreement in its entirety.\nThe Company has recorded a provision for customer refund, including interest, associated with billings for the difference between the interim\nrates and the settlement rates. The Company expects to complete the customer refund process with the February 2024 billing cycle.\nIn December 2023, the Company notified the SCC of its intent to file a general rate case. The Company filed the general rate application on\nFebruary 2, 2024.\nThe Company filed an application with the SCC for a new, five-year SAVE Plan and Rider on March 31, 2023, seeking recovery of costs\nassociated with an estimated $8.5 million in SAVE eligible investment in fiscal 2024 and an estimated cumulative investment of $49.5 million\nover the proposed five-year plan period ending September 30, 2028. On July 7, 2023, the SCC Staff filed its report on the Company’s SAVE\nPlan and Rider in which it recommended approval of the $49.5 million, five-year plan with a revenue requirement of approximately $366,000\nbeginning on October 1, 2023. On August 31, 2023, the SCC approved the new SAVE Plan and Rider with rates effective October 1, 2023.\nOn June 2, 2022, Roanoke Gas filed an application with the SCC to acquire certain natural gas distribution assets from a local housing\nauthority. Under this application, the Company requested the approval to acquire such facilities at five separate apartment complexes, located\nin the Company’s service territory, that were under housing authority management. Under the proposed plan, the housing authority would\nrenew existing natural gas distribution facilities to include mains, services, and meter installations and then transfer ownership of these facilities to\nRoanoke Gas. In turn, Roanoke Gas would assume responsibility for the operation and maintenance of these assets and recognize a gain\nrelated to the asset acquisition equal to the cost associated with the renewal.\nOn July 19, 2022, the SCC approved the application and on August 4, 2022, the housing authority transferred the assets from two apartment\ncomplexes to Roanoke Gas. Roanoke Gas recorded these assets and recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $219,000 during the fourth\nquarter of fiscal 2022. On September 29, 2023, the housing authority transferred the assets from one additional apartment complex to\nRoanoke Gas and the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $311,000 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The authority is\nawaiting future funding to complete the two remaining apartment complexes. The timing of funding and the completion of the asset renewals for\nthese complexes is unknown at this time.\n12\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n6. Other Investments\nMidstream owns a less than 1% equity investment in the LLC constructing the MVP. Midstream is also a less than 1% investor, accounted for\nunder the cost method, in Southgate. Since inception, the MVP has encountered various legal and regulatory issues that have substantially\ndelayed the completion of the project, including a period in 2022 where work on the projected was halted. With the passage of the FRA and\ncertain judicial rulings in mid-2023, construction work was restarted.\nWhile under construction, AFUDC has provided the majority of the income recognized by Midstream. The LLC temporarily suspended\naccruing AFUDC on the project for portions of prior periods. AFUDC accruals resumed in June 2023 when construction activities restarted.\nThe amount of AFUDC recognized during the current and prior year is included in the equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate in the tables\nbelow. As the MVP project nears completion, AFUDC on completed segments will cease and will only be recorded on areas still being\nconstructed.\nMidstream reassesses the value of its investment in the LLC on at least a quarterly basis, and no impairment indicators were identified in fiscal\n2023 or during the first fiscal quarter of 2024. As noted above, developments in 2023 on the legislative and legal fronts were favorable. The\nMVP project is not yet completed and adverse developments, as well as potential macroeconomic factors related to interest rates, cost\nincreases, or other unanticipated events could erode fair value leading to new indicators or impairment.\nFunding for Midstream's investments has been provided through equity contributions from Resources and unsecured promissory notes as\ndetailed in Note 9. Midstream expects to refinance the notes maturing in 2024.\nThe Company will participate in the earnings generated from the transportation of natural gas through both pipelines proportionate to its level of\ninvestment once the pipelines are placed in service.\nInvestment balances of MVP and Southgate, as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, are reflected in the table below:\nBalance Sheet location: December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023\nOther Assets:\nMVP $ 18,564,311 $ 17,096,476\nSouthgate 90,617 90,617\nInvestment in unconsolidated affiliates $ 18,654,928 $ 17,187,093\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nIncome Statement location: 2023 2022\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate $ 1,467,835 $ 1,232\nDecember 31, 2023 September 30, 2023\nUndistributed earnings, net of income taxes, of MVP in retained earnings, excluding\nimpairment $ 10,773,811 $ 9,683,797\nThe undistributed earnings does not include the impairment of the investment in the LLC.\n13\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC.

Derivatives and Hedging\nThe Company’s hedging and derivative policy allows management to enter into derivatives for the purpose of managing the commodity and\nfinancial market risks of its business operations, including the price of natural gas and the cost of borrowed funds. This policy specifically\nprohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes.\nThe Company has five interest rate swaps associated with its variable rate debt as of December 31, 2023. Roanoke Gas has two variable-rate\nterm notes in the amounts of $15 million and $10 million, with corresponding swap agreements to convert the variable interest rates into fixed\nrates of 2.00% and 2.49%, respectively. Midstream has three swap agreements corresponding to the variable rate term notes with original\nprincipal amounts of $14 million, $10 million, and $8 million. The swap agreements convert these three notes into fixed rate instruments with\neffective interest rates of 3.24%, 3.14%, and 2.443%, respectively. The swaps qualify as cash flow hedges with changes in fair value reported\nin other comprehensive income. No portion of the swaps were deemed ineffective during the periods presented.\nThe fair value of the current and non-current portions of the interest rate swaps are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets\nunder the caption interest rate swaps. The table in Note 10 reflects the effect on income and other comprehensive income of the Company's\ncash flow hedges.\n14\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n8. Short-Term Debt\nOn March 24, 2023, Roanoke Gas entered into an unsecured Revolving Note in the principal amount of $25 million, which will mature on\nMarch 31, 2024. The Revolving Note's variable interest rate is based upon Term SOFR plus 110 basis points and provides for multiple tier\nborrowing limits to accommodate seasonal borrowing demands. The Company's total available borrowing limits during the term of the\nRevolving Note range from $4 million to $25 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had an outstanding balance of $13,252,596\nunder the Revolving Note.\n9. Long-Term Debt\nOn June 28, 2023, Midstream amended and restated its $14 million and $8 million Term Notes initially entered into on June 12, 2019 and\nNovember 1, 2021, respectively. The amendments revised each of the original Term Note's interest rate from LIBOR plus 115 basis points to\nDaily Simple SOFR plus 126.448 basis points, effective July 1, 2023. All other terms and requirements of the Term Notes were retained. In\nconjunction with the amendment of the Term Notes, Midstream also amended the corresponding interest rate swaps associated with the Term\nNotes. The amendments provided for the floating rates on the interest rate swaps to continue to match the rate of the associated notes as well\nas retain the overall fixed interest rates of 3.24% and 2.443%, respectively.\nOn March 24, 2023, Roanoke Gas amended and restated the $10 million Term Note originally entered into on September 24, 2021. The\namendment revised the original Term Note's interest rate from LIBOR plus 100 basis points to Term SOFR plus 100 basis points. All other\nterms and requirements of the original Term Note were retained. The effective date of the Amended Term Note was April 1, 2023. In\naddition, on April 3, 2023, the interest rate swap was amended to align with the Amended Term Note and retained the fixed interest rate of\n2.49%. In connection with the Revolving Note and Amended Term Note, Roanoke Gas also amended and restated the Loan Agreement\ndated September 24, 2021. The amendment provides for borrowing limits on the Revolving Note and amends certain financial conditions\nrequired of Roanoke Gas and Resources. All other terms and requirements of the original Loan Agreement were retained. See Note 7 for\nadditional information regarding the interest rate swap and Note 8 for additional information regarding the Revolving Note.\nOn July 28, 2023, Midstream entered into the Fifth Amendment to Credit Agreement and related Promissory Notes on the non-revolving\ncredit facility. The Fifth Amendment revised the interest rate from Term SOFR plus 1.50% to Term SOFR plus 2.00% and extended the\nmaturity date of the Promissory Notes to December 31, 2024. All other terms and requirements remain unchanged.\n15\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n11. Commitments and Contingencies\nRoanoke Gas currently holds the only franchises and/or CPCNs to distribute natural gas in its service area. These franchises generally extend\nfor multi-year periods and are renewable by the municipalities, including exclusive franchises in the cities of Roanoke and Salem and the Town\nof Vinton, Virginia. All three franchises are set to expire December 31, 2035. In 2019, the SCC issued an order granting a CPCN to furnish\ngas to all of Franklin County. Unlike the CPCNs for the other counties served by Roanoke Gas, the Franklin County CPCN was scheduled to\nterminate within five years of the date of the order if Roanoke Gas did not furnish gas service to the designated service area. In November\n2023, the SCC granted Roanoke Gas a three-year extension on the CPCN. Roanoke Gas plans to serve the Franklin County area with\nnatural gas delivered through the MVP, once MVP is placed into service.\nDue to the nature of the natural gas distribution business, the Company has entered into agreements with both suppliers and pipelines for natural\ngas commodity purchases, storage capacity and pipeline delivery capacity. The Company utilizes an asset manager to assist in optimizing the\nuse of its transportation, storage rights and gas supply in order to provide a secure and reliable source of natural gas to its customers. The\nCompany also has storage and pipeline capacity contracts to store and deliver natural gas to the Company’s distribution system. Roanoke Gas\nis currently served directly by two primary pipelines that deliver all of the natural gas supplied to the Company’s distribution system. Depending\non weather conditions and the level of customer demand, failure of one of these transmission pipelines could have a major adverse impact on\nthe Company's ability to deliver natural gas to its customers and its results of operations. The MVP will provide Roanoke Gas with access to\nan additional delivery source to its distribution system, increasing system reliability and the Company's ability to meet future demands for natural\ngas.\n12. Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per common share for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were calculated by dividing net income by the\nweighted average common shares outstanding during the period.

The pension plan covers the Company’s employees hired before January 1,\n2017 and provides a retirement benefit based on years of service and employee compensation. The postretirement plan, covering employees\nhired before January 1, 2000, provides certain health care and supplemental life insurance benefits to retired employees who meet specific age\nand service requirements.

The\nCompany is not currently planning to make any funding contributions to either plan for the remainder of fiscal 2024.\n14. Fair Value Measurements\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes each input to the valuation method\nused to measure fair value of financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured and reported on a fair value basis into one of the\nfollowing three levels:\nLevel 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the\nmeasurement date.\n19\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nLevel 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices in Level 1 that are either for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or\nsimilar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, or inputs\nthat are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\nLevel 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement\ndate, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions.\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to\nunobservable inputs (Level 3).\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as required by\nexisting guidance and the fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy:\nFair Value Measurements - December 31, 2023\nQuoted Significant\nPrices Other Significant\nin Active Observable Unobservable\nFair Markets Inputs Inputs\nValue (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nInterest rate swaps $ 3,236,201 $ — $ 3,236,201 $ —\nTotal $ 3,236,201 $ — $ 3,236,201 $ —\nLiabilities:\nNatural gas purchases $ 1,234,072 $ — $ 1,234,072 $ —\nTotal $ 1,234,072 $ — $ 1,234,072 $ —\nFair Value Measurements - September 30, 2023\nQuoted Significant\nPrices Other Significant\nin Active Observable Unobservable\nFair Markets Inputs Inputs\nValue (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nInterest rate swaps $ 4,617,455 $ — $ 4,617,455 $ —\nTotal $ 4,617,455 $ — $ 4,617,455 $ —\nLiabilities:\nNatural gas purchases $ 1,022,662 $ — $ 1,022,662 $ —\nTotal $ 1,022,662 $ — $ 1,022,662 $ —\nThe fair value of the interest rate swaps are determined by using the counterparty's proprietary models and certain assumptions regarding past,\npresent and future market conditions.\nUnder the asset management contract, a timing difference can exist between the payment for natural gas purchases and the actual receipt of\nsuch purchases. Payments are made based on a predetermined monthly volume with the price based on weighted average first of the month\nindex prices corresponding to the month of the scheduled payment. At December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, the Company had\nrecorded in accounts payable the estimated fair value of the liability valued at the corresponding first of month index prices for which the liability\nis expected to be settled.\n20\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe Company’s nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis consist of its AROs. The AROs are measured\nat fair value at initial recognition based on expected future cash flows required to settle the obligation.\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, borrowings under line-of-credit, accounts payable (with the exception of\nthe timing difference under the asset management contract), customer credit balances and customer deposits is a reasonable estimate of fair\nvalue due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments. In addition, the carrying amount of the variable rate line-of-credit is a\nreasonable approximation of its fair value.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are not adjusted to fair value in the financial\nstatements:\nFair Value Measurements - December 31, 2023\nQuoted Significant\nPrices Other Significant\nin Active Observable Unobservable\nCarrying Markets Inputs Inputs\nValue (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nLiabilities:\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt $ 33,850,000 $ — $ — $ 34,027,761\nNotes payable 102,700,000 — — 99,954,528\nTotal $ 136,550,000 $ — $ — $133,982,289\nFair Value Measurements - September 30, 2023\nQuoted Significant\nPrices Other Significant\nin Active Observable Unobservable\nCarrying Markets Inputs Inputs\nValue (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nLiabilities:\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt $ 10,975,000 $ — $ — $ 10,975,000\nNotes payable 126,100,000 — — 120,298,658\nTotal $ 137,075,000 $ — $ — $131,273,658\nThe fair value of long-term debt is estimated by discounting the future cash flows of the fixed rate debt based on the underlying Treasury rate or\nother Treasury instruments with a corresponding maturity period and estimated credit spread extrapolated based on market conditions since the\nissuance of the debt.\nASC 825, Financial Instruments, requires disclosures regarding concentrations of credit risk from financial instruments.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company’s regulated operations follow the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC 980, Regulated Operations. A regulated\ncompany may defer costs that have been or are expected to be recovered from customers in a period different from the period in which the\ncosts would ordinarily be charged to expense by an unregulated enterprise. When this situation occurs, costs are deferred as assets in the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheet (regulatory assets) and amortized into expense over periods when such amounts are reflected in\ncustomer rates. Additionally, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and\nfor current collection in customer rates of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future (regulatory liabilities). In the event the provisions\nof ASC 980 no longer apply to any or all regulatory assets or liabilities, the Company would write off such amounts and include the effects in\nthe condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income in the period which ASC 980 no longer applied.\nRegulatory assets included in the Company’s accompanying balance sheets are as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 September 30, 2023\nAssets:\nCurrent Assets:\nRegulatory assets:\nAccrued WNA revenues $ 1,587,816 $ 414,689\nUnder-recovery of gas costs — 1,383,340\nUnder-recovery of RNG revenues 1,085,177 797,804\nAccrued pension 182,263 243,017\nOther deferred expenses 12,762 15,426\nTotal current 2,868,018 2,854,276\nOther Non-Current Assets:\nRegulatory assets:\nPremium on early retirement of debt 1,227,512 1,256,059\nAccrued pension 3,786,265 3,786,265\nOther deferred expenses 336,414 347,121\nTotal non-current 5,350,191 5,389,445\nTotal regulatory assets $ 8,218,209 $ 8,243,721\n23\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe three-month earnings presented herein should not be considered as reflective of the Company’s consolidated financial results for the fiscal year\nending September 30, 2024. The total revenues and margins realized during the first three months reflect higher billings due to the weather sensitive\nnature of the natural gas business.\nOverview\nResources is an energy services company primarily engaged in the regulated sale and distribution of natural gas to approximately 63,200 residential,\ncommercial and industrial customers in Roanoke, Virginia and surrounding localities through its Roanoke Gas subsidiary. Midstream, a wholly-\nowned subsidiary of Resources, is a less than 1% investor in both the MVP and Southgate.\nThe utility operations of Roanoke Gas are regulated by the SCC, which oversees the terms, conditions, and rates charged to customers for natural\ngas service, safety standards, extension of service and depreciation. Nearly all of the Company’s revenues are derived from the sale and delivery of\nnatural gas to Roanoke Gas customers based on rates and fees authorized by the SCC. These rates are designed to provide the Company with the\nopportunity to recover its gas and non-gas expenses and to earn a reasonable rate of return for shareholders based on normal weather. These rates\nare determined based on various rate applications filed with the SCC. Generally, investments related to extending service to new customers are\nrecovered through the additional revenues generated by the non-gas base rates in place at that time. The investment in replacing and upgrading\nexisting infrastructure, as well as recovering increases in non-gas expenses due to inflationary pressures, regulatory requirements or operational\nneeds, are generally not recoverable until a formal rate application is filed to include the additional investment and higher costs, and new non-gas base\nrates are approved.\nBeginning January 1, 2023, Roanoke Gas implemented interim, non-gas base rates designed to provide $8.55 million in additional annual revenues in\nresponse to higher operating costs and to recover its investment in non-SAVE related projects since the prior non-gas base rate increase in fiscal\n2019. Revenues from the SAVE Plan and Rider were incorporated into the new non-gas base rates. On December 19, 2023, the SCC issued a\nfinal order approving a non-gas base rate increase of $7.45 million. The order also directed Roanoke Gas to refund the excess revenues collected\nduring the time the interim rates were in effect with interest. The refund to customers, which was accrued in fiscal 2023 and reflected in regulatory\nliabilities, is expected to be completed during the Company's 2024 second fiscal quarter. Roanoke Gas has notified the SCC of its intent to file a\ngeneral rate case and submitted its application on February 2, 2024. See the Regulatory section for additional information.\nThe Company is also subject to regulation from the United States Department of Transportation in regard to the construction, operation,\nmaintenance, safety and integrity of its transmission and distribution pipelines. FERC regulates the prices for the transportation and delivery of natural\ngas to the Company’s distribution system and underground storage services. In addition, the Company is subject to other regulations which are not\nnecessarily industry specific.\nAs the Company’s business is seasonal in nature, volatility in winter weather and the commodity price of natural gas can impact the effectiveness of\nthe Company’s rates in recovering its costs and providing a reasonable return for its shareholders. In order to mitigate the effect of weather variations\nand other factors not provided for in the Company's base rates, Roanoke Gas has certain approved rate mechanisms in place that help provide\nstability in earnings, adjust for volatility in the price of natural gas and provide a return on qualified infrastructure investment. These mechanisms\ninclude the SAVE Rider, WNA, ICC, RNG and PGA.\nThe SAVE Plan and Rider provides the Company with a mechanism through which it recovers costs related to qualified SAVE infrastructure\ninvestments on a prospective basis, until a rate application is filed incorporating these investments in non-gas base rates. SAVE Plan revenues\ndecreased by approximately $1,028,000 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period last year, reflecting the\nmovement of the SAVE Plan revenues into the new non-gas base rates on January 1, 2023. Roanoke Gas filed and received approval from the SCC\nfor a new SAVE Plan and Rider with new rates placed into effect on October 1, 2023 that is expected to result in approximately $366,000 in SAVE\nrelated revenues during fiscal 2024. Additional information regarding the SAVE Plan and Rider is provided under the Regulatory section below.\n26\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe WNA mechanism reduces the volatility in earnings due to the variability in temperatures during the heating season. The WNA is based on the\nmost recent 30-year temperature average and provides the Company with a level of earnings protection when weather is warmer than normal and\nprovides its customers with price protection when weather is colder than normal. The WNA allows the Company to recover from its customers the\nlost margin (excluding gas costs) from warmer than normal weather and correspondingly requires the Company to refund the excess margin earned\nfor colder than normal weather. The WNA mechanism used by the Company is based on a linear regression model that determines the value of a\nsingle heating degree day and thereby estimates the revenue adjustment based on weather variance from normal. Any billings or refunds related to the\nWNA are completed following each WNA year, which extends for the 12-month period from April to March. For the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company accrued approximately $1,173,000 in additional revenues under the WNA model for weather that was 16%\nwarmer than normal compared to an accrued refund of approximately $187,000 for weather that was 3% colder than normal for the corresponding\nperiod last year.\nThe Company has an approved rate structure to mitigate the impact of the financing costs of its natural gas inventory. Under this rate structure,\nRoanoke Gas recognizes revenue by applying the ICC factor, based on the Company’s weighted-average cost of capital, including interest rates on\nshort-term and long-term debt, and the Company’s authorized return on equity, to the average cost of natural gas inventory during the period. Total\nICC revenues decreased by approximately $128,000 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023, compared to the corresponding\nperiod last year, due to lower natural gas commodity prices during the 2023 summer storage injection season resulting in a lower average cost of\nnatural gas in storage. Accordingly, fiscal 2024 ICC revenues are expected to continue to remain below last year's levels.\nIn March 2023, Roanoke Gas began operating the RNG facility, through a cooperative agreement with the Western Virginia Water Authority, to\nproduce commercial quality RNG for delivery into its distribution system. With SCC approval, Roanoke Gas is allowed to recover the costs\nassociated with the investment in RNG facilities and the related operating costs through an RNG Rider added to customer bills. Customers receive\nthe benefit of the monetization of environmental credits generated through the production of RNG. Roanoke Gas recognized approximately $300,000\nin revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2023.\nThe cost of natural gas, which is a pass-through cost, is independent of the Company's non-gas rates. Accordingly, the Company's approved billing\nrates include a component designed to allow for the recovery of the cost of natural gas used by its customers. This rate component, referred to as the\nPGA, allows the Company to pass along to its customers increases and decreases in natural gas costs through a quarterly filing, or more frequent if\nnecessary, with the SCC. Once SCC approval is received, the Company adjusts the gas cost component of its rates. As actual costs will differ from\nthe projections used in establishing the PGA rate, the Company will either over-recover or under-recover its actual gas costs during the period. The\ndifference between actual costs incurred and costs recovered through the application of the PGA is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability. At the\nend of the annual deferral period, the balance is amortized over an ensuing 12-month period as amounts are reflected in customer billings.\nResults of Operations\nThe analysis on the results of operations is based on the consolidated operations of the Company, which is primarily associated with the utility\nsegment. Additional segment analysis is provided when Midstream's investment in affiliates represents a significant component of the comparison.\nThe Company's operating revenues are affected by the cost of natural gas, as reflected in the consolidated income statement under cost of gas -\nutility. The cost of natural gas, which includes commodity price, transportation, storage, injection and withdrawal fees, with any increase or decrease\noffset by a correlating change in revenue through the PGA, is passed through to customers at cost. Accordingly, management believes that gross\nutility margin, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as utility revenues less cost of gas, is a more useful and relevant measure to analyze financial\nperformance. The term gross utility margin is not intended to represent or replace operating income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure,\nas an indicator of operating performance and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The following\nresults of operations analyses will reference gross utility margin.\n27\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2023:\nNet income increased by $1,763,587 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period last year, primarily due to\nAFUDC on MVP and the implementation of new non-gas base rates effective January 1, 2023.\nThe tables below reflect operating revenues, volume activity and heating degree days.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Increase /\n2023 2022 (Decrease) Percentage\nOperating Revenues\nGas utility $ 24,391,854 $ 33,252,767 $ (8,860,913) (27)%\nNon utility 27,498 29,568 (2,070) (7)%\nTotal operating revenues $ 24,419,352 $ 33,282,335 $ (8,862,983) (27)%\nDelivered Volumes\nRegulated natural gas (DTH)\nResidential and commercial 2,094,640 2,433,239 (338,599) (14)%\nTransportation and interruptible 925,995 875,301 50,694 6%\nTotal delivered volumes 3,020,635 3,308,540 (287,905) (9)%\nHDD 1,237 1,523 (286) (19)%\nTotal operating revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period last year, decreased by approximately 27%\nprimarily due to significantly lower natural gas commodity prices, reductions in delivered natural gas volumes and lower SAVE revenues more than\noffsetting the implementation of a non-gas base rate increase. Natural gas commodity prices during the quarter declined by 58% from the\ncorresponding period last year. Total gas costs decreased by 44% compared to the same period last year, which corresponds to the decline in the\ngas cost component included in total customer billing rate. In addition, total heating degree days decreased by 19% from the same period last year\nresulting in a 14% decline in the weather sensitive residential and commercial sales. Transportation and interruptible volumes increased by\napproximately 6% primarily due to a single, multi-fuel customer that increased its natural gas utilization during the quarter. With the reset of the SAVE\nRider as discussed above, SAVE Plan revenues declined by approximately $1,028,000.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Increase /\n2023 2022 (Decrease) Percentage\nGross Utility Margin\nGas utility revenues $ 24,391,854 $ 33,252,767 $ (8,860,913) (27)%\nCost of gas - utility 10,097,016 20,804,153 (10,707,137) (51)%\nGross utility margin $ 14,294,838 $ 12,448,614 $ 1,846,224 15%\nGross utility margin increased over the same period last year primarily as a result of the aforementioned implementation of new non-gas base rates,\nWNA and RNG revenue, offset by the reductions in SAVE and ICC revenues. When adjusted for WNA, the volumetric margin increased by\napproximately $2,260,000 and base charge revenues increased by approximately $442,000 due to the non-gas base rate increase. However, SAVE\nrevenues decreased by approximately $1,028,000 as these revenues are reflected in the increased volumetric and base charge rates. The RNG\nRider contributed an additional $300,000 to margin, and ICC revenue declined by $128,000 due to lower cost of gas in storage.\n28\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC.

Total capitalized construction overheads declined by approximately $230,000 due to a reduction in direct\nconstruction expenditures related to Roanoke Gas capital projects compared to the same period last year and lower overheads capitalized as part of\nLNG due to timing of production. Compensation costs increased by approximately $160,000 due to increased staffing and inflationary impact on\nsalaries. Professional services and corporate insurance premiums accounted for much of the remaining cost increases.\nGeneral taxes increased by $43,195, or 7%, primarily due to increases in payroll taxes related to increased staffing and compensation and higher\nproperty taxes associated with growth in utility property.\nDepreciation expense increased by $278,166, or 11%, on a comparable increase in utility property balances.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate increased by $1,466,603 associated with the recognition of AFUDC as a result of MVP construction\nactivities.\nOther income, net increased by $46,180, or 62%, primarily due to an increase of approximately $69,000 in revenue sharing related to the asset\nmanagement agreement and higher interest income offset by the absence of AFUDC related to the RNG facility, which was placed in service in\nMarch 2023.\nInterest expense increased by $267,109, or 20%, as the weighted-average interest rate on total debt increased from 3.78% during the first quarter of\nfiscal 2023 to 4.28% during the first quarter of fiscal 2024, while total daily average debt outstanding increased by 2%. The increase in the\nweighted-average interest rate was primarily associated with Roanoke Gas' variable rate line-of-credit and Midstream's credit facility.\nRoanoke Gas' interest expense increased by $146,371 primarily due to a combination of higher borrowing levels and an increase in the interest rate\non the variable rate line-of-credit.\nMidstream's interest expense increased by $120,738 primarily due to rising interest rates on its credit facility. Total average outstanding debt\ndecreased by $1.4 million over the same quarter last year due to amortization payments under two of Midstream's promissory notes.\nIncome tax expense increased by $589,639 due to a corresponding increase in pre-tax income. The effective tax rate was 24.0% and 23.4% for the\nthree-month periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate is below the combined statutory state and federal rate\ndue to the amortization of excess deferred taxes and tax credits.\n29\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements of Resources are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses\nreported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are affected by accounting policies, estimates and assumptions that are necessary to\ncomply with generally accepted accounting principles. Estimates used in the financial statements are derived from prior experience, statistical analysis\nand management judgments. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions.\nThere have been no significant changes to the critical accounting policies as reflected in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended September 30, 2023.\nAsset Management\nRoanoke Gas uses a third-party asset manager to oversee its pipeline transportation, storage rights and gas supply inventories and deliveries. In\nreturn for utilizing the excess capacities of the transportation and storage rights, the asset manager pays Roanoke Gas a monthly utilization fee. In\naccordance with an SCC order issued in 2018, a portion of the utilization fee is retained by the Company with the balance passed through to\ncustomers through reduced gas costs. The current asset management agreement ends March 31, 2025.\nEquity Investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline\nThe Company has a less than 1% interest in the MVP, which is accounted for as an equity investment, and a less than 1% interest in Southgate, which\nis contemplated to interconnect with the MVP. As discussed more fully in Note 6, since inception, the MVP has encountered various legal and\nregulatory issues that have substantially delayed the completion of the project, including a period in 2022 where work on the project was halted. With\nthe passage of the FRA and certain judicial rulings in mid-2023, construction work was restarted, and the Company believes the MVP will be\ncompleted relatively soon.\nSince its inception, earnings from MVP have been primarily attributable to AFUDC income. Once the pipeline is commercially operational, AFUDC\nwill cease and the Company will begin to receive its share of LLC earnings from long-term contracts to provide gas. Resources expects cash\ndistributions from the LLC to begin three to six months after commercial operations begin. The Company recorded $1,467,835 and $1,232 in the\nfirst fiscal quarters of 2023 and 2022, respectively, as its share of Midstream’s earnings.\nMidstream fully borrowed $23 million under its non-revolving credit facility, which matures in December 2024. Installment payments have begun on\ntwo of Midstream's promissory notes with one of the notes due in full in June 2024. The Company is actively discussing and anticipates refinancing\nthose obligations in 2024. Additionally, Midstream is considering the long-term structure of its debt as the MVP evolves from a project phase to an\noperating phase. See Note 9 for more information on all borrowings related to Midstream.\nRegulatory\nOn December 2, 2022, Roanoke Gas filed an application with the SCC seeking an $8.55 million annual increase in its non-gas base rates, of which\n$4.05 million was being recovered through the SAVE Rider. Since the Company was seeking to recover the costs associated with its SAVE Plan\nthrough interim non-gas base rates effective January 1, 2023, the Company discontinued its SAVE Plan and Rider for the remainder of fiscal 2023. In\nthe fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company reached a settlement with the SCC staff on all outstanding issues in the case. Under the terms of the\nsettlement, the Company agreed to an incremental revenue requirement of $7.45 million. The Company agreed to begin billing the new rates effective\nOctober 1, 2023. The Commission issued its Final Order on the matter on December 19, 2023 in which it approved the settlement agreement in its\nentirety.\nThe Company has recorded a provision for refund, including interest, associated with customer billings for the difference between the interim rates\nand the settlement rates. The Company expects to complete the customer refund process with the February 2024 billing cycle.\n30\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn December 2023, the Company notified the SCC of its intent to file a general rate case. The Company filed the general rate application on\nFebruary 2, 2024.\nThe Company filed an application with the SCC for a new, five-year SAVE Plan and Rider on March 31, 2023, seeking recovery of costs associated\nwith an estimated $8.5 million in SAVE-eligible investment in fiscal 2024 and an estimated cumulative investment of $49.5 million over the proposed\nfive-year plan period ending September 30, 2028. On July 7, 2023, the SCC Staff filed its report on the Company’s SAVE Plan and Rider in which\nit recommended approval of the $49.5 million, five-year plan with a revenue requirement of approximately $366,000 beginning on October 1, 2023.\nOn August 31, 2023, the SCC approved the new SAVE Plan and Rider with rates effective October 1, 2023.\nOn June 2, 2022, Roanoke Gas filed an application with the SCC to acquire certain natural gas distribution assets from a local housing authority.\nUnder this application, the Company requested the approval to acquire such facilities at five separate apartment complexes, located in the\nCompany’s service territory, that were under housing authority management. Under the proposed plan, the housing authority would renew existing\nnatural gas distribution facilities to include mains, services, and meter installations and then transfer ownership of these facilities to Roanoke Gas. In\nturn, Roanoke Gas would assume responsibility for the operation and maintenance of these assets and recognize a gain related to the asset acquisition\nequal to the cost associated with the renewal.\nOn July 19, 2022, the SCC approved the application and on August 4, 2022, the housing authority transferred the assets from two apartment\ncomplexes to Roanoke Gas. Roanoke Gas recorded these assets and recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $219,000 during the fourth quarter\nof fiscal 2022. On September 29, 2023, the housing authority transferred the assets from one additional apartment complex to Roanoke Gas and the\nCompany recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $311,000 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The authority is awaiting future funding to\ncomplete the two remaining apartment complexes. The timing of funding and the completion of the asset renewals for these complexes is unknown at\nthis time.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nDue to the capital intensive nature of the utility business, as well as the impact of weather variability, the Company’s primary capital needs are the\nfunding of its capital projects, the seasonal funding of its natural gas inventories and accounts receivables, debt service and payments of dividends to\nshareholders. The Company anticipates funding these items through its operating cash flows, credit availability under short-term and long-term debt\nagreements and proceeds from the sale of its common stock.\nCash and cash equivalents increased by $1,352,306 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 compared to a decrease of\n$1,664,722 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022. The following table summarizes the sources and uses of cash:\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nCash Flow Summary 2023 2022\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (564,347) $ (2,424,401)\nNet cash used in investing activities (5,300,295) (8,348,589)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 7,216,948 9,108,268\nIncrease (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,352,306 $ (1,664,722)\nCash Flows Used in Operating Activities:\nThe seasonal nature of the natural gas business causes operating cash flows to fluctuate significantly during the year as well as from year-to-year.\nFactors, including weather, energy prices, natural gas storage levels and customer collections contribute to working capital levels and related cash\nflows. Generally, operating cash flows are positive during the second and third fiscal quarters as a combination of earnings, declining storage gas\nlevels and collections on customer accounts contribute to higher cash levels. During the first and fourth fiscal quarters, operating cash flows generally\ndecrease due to increases in natural gas storage levels and rising customer receivable balances.\n31\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCash flows from operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2023 increased by $1,860,054 compared to the same period last\nyear. The table below summarizes the significant components of operating cash flows:\nThree Months Ended December 31, Increase/\nCash Flow From Operating Activities: 2023 2022 (Decrease)\nNet income $ 5,019,992 $ 3,256,405 $ 1,763,587\nNon-cash adjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization 2,761,920 2,477,084 284,836\nEquity in earnings (1,467,835) (1,232) (1,466,603)\nAFUDC — (103,771) 103,771\nChanges in working capital and regulatory assets and liabilities:\nAccounts receivable (8,963,996) (15,967,191) 7,003,195\nOver-recovery of gas cost 2,046,845 5,763,958 (3,717,113)\nAccounts payable 572,694 3,220,632 (2,647,938)\nWNA (1,173,127) 186,648 (1,359,775)\nIncome tax 2,317,469 (205,393) 2,522,862\nAccrued expenses (1,452,841) (1,005,348) (447,493)\nOther (225,468) (46,193) (179,275)\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (564,347) $ (2,424,401) $ 1,860,054\nSignificantly higher natural gas prices during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 resulted in much higher accounts receivable and accounts payable balances\ncompared to the current fiscal quarter. In anticipation of these higher prices, the Company adjusted the PGA component of its billing rates for the\nfirst quarter of fiscal 2023. However, in December 2022, the commodity prices declined significantly resulting in the Company recognizing a larger\nthan normal over-recovery of gas costs during the period. The Company subsequently reduced the PGA component of it billing rates in January\n2023 to compensate for the lower natural gas prices. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, natural gas prices have remained low and relatively stable\nresulting in lower accounts receivable and accounts payable balances. Warmer weather during the current quarter also contributed to the decline in\naccounts receivable balances. As discussed in the Overview section above, the current fiscal quarter had 19% fewer HDD than the same period last\nyear and 16% fewer HDD than normal resulting in an increase in the WNA receivable of approximately $1.2 million during the quarter. The same\nquarter last year was 3% colder than normal resulting in a decline of approximately $200,000 in the WNA receivable leading to a $1.4 million decline\nin operating cash between periods. The timing of income tax estimated payments in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and the receipt of a tax refund\nduring the first quarter of fiscal 2024 resulted in a $2.5 million increase in operating cash between periods. The increase in non-cash equity in\nearnings from the Company's investment in the LLC offset most of the net income cash flow.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities:\nInvesting activities primarily consist of expenditures related to Roanoke Gas' utility property, which includes replacing aging natural gas pipe with new\nplastic or coated steel pipe, improvements to the LNG plant and gas distribution system facilities and expansion of its natural gas system to meet the\ndemands of customer growth. With the recent approval of its new SAVE Plan and Rider, the Company is continuing its focus on SAVE infrastructure\nreplacement projects, including the replacement of pre-1973 first generation plastic pipe. New customer demand for natural gas continues to be\nstrong and therefore extending the natural gas distribution system within its service territory is also a priority. Roanoke Gas' total capital expenditures\nfor the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 were approximately $5.3 million compared to $7.5 million during the same period last year.\nThe $2.2 million decrease in expenditures is primarily due to the completion of the RNG project, which was placed in service in March 2023. Total\nfiscal 2024 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $20 million. Midstream's investment in the LLC was approximately $800,000 in\nthe first quarter of fiscal 2023. However, Midstream ceased future participation in capital calls following its May 2023 funding payment based on\nan agreement with the LLC's managing partner. Midstream continues to be invested in the LLC; however, its participation percentage is\ndeclining with no additional investment. Once MVP is placed into service, Midstream may incur periodic future capital investment related to ongoing\noperations requirements and system improvements. Midstream will continue to make capital investments in Southgate. The targeted completion\ntiming for the Southgate project is June 2028.\n32\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCash Flows Provided by Financing Activities:\nFinancing activities generally consist of borrowings and repayments under credit agreements, issuance of common stock and the payment of\ndividends. Net cash flows provided by financing activities were approximately $7.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023,\ncompared to $9.1 million for the same period last year. The reduction in financing cash flows is primarily attributable to Midstream's $1.1 million\nborrowing under its credit facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 combined with an additional $400,000 in debt retirement on amortizing notes\nduring the current year. In addition, Resources issued a total of 44,367 shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of approximately\n$821,000, including 26,077 shares through the ATM program in which Resources received approximately $542,000, net of fees. During the same\nperiod last year, Resources issued 31,245 shares for approximately $653,000, including 17,199 shares through the ATM program for approximately\n$377,000, net of fees.\nNotes 8 and 9 provide details on the Company's line-of-credit and borrowing activity.\nThe current interest rate environment is expected to continue to result in higher interest expense associated with the Company's variable-rate debt or\non the issuance of any new debt.\nManagement regularly evaluates the Company’s liquidity through a review of its available financing resources and its cash flows. Resources’ maintains\nthe ability to raise equity capital through its ATM program, private placement or other public offerings. Management believes Roanoke Gas has\naccess to sufficient financing resources to meet its cash requirements for the next year, including the line-of-credit, which it expects to renew, and the\ntwo private shelf facilities. Roanoke Gas may also adjust capital spending as necessary if such a need would arise.\nBased on the agreement with the LLC's managing partner to assume future capital contributions related to the MVP, Midstream's future cash\nrequirements are reduced to regular monthly operating expenses, debt service and capital contributions to Southgate. Midstream's total debt service\nover the succeeding 12 months includes $33.85 million to retire maturing debt. Management believes that they will be able to negotiate extensions on\nthe current debt or obtain other financing options to satisfy the debt servicing requirements and be able to meet Midstream's cash requirements over\nthe ensuing 12 month period.\nAs of December 31, 2023, Resources' long-term capitalization ratio was 43% equity and 57% debt.\nITEM 3 – QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot applicable.\nITEM 4 – CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be\ndisclosed in reports under the Exchange Act are identified, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the\nrules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow for timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\nThrough December 31, 2023, the Company has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the chief\nexecutive officer and the chief financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures.\nBased upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures\nwere effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2023.\nManagement routinely reviews the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and makes changes, as necessary, to enhance the effectiveness\nof the internal controls. There were no control changes during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n33\nTable of Contents\nRGC RESOURCES, INC.

(the “Company”) determines it must prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of\nthe Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in\npreviously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the\nerror were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period, the Company shall reasonably promptly recover any erroneously\nawarded compensation that was received by any current or former covered officer during the applicable lookback period.\nFor purposes of this policy the following definitions apply:\n(i) “covered officer” means any current or former executive officer of the Company as defined under Rule 10D-1 of the Act, and such other\nsenior executives as may be determined by the Committee;\n(ii) “incentive-based compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of\na financial reporting measure;\n(iii)“financial reporting measure” means any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in\npreparing the Company’s financial statements, any measure that is derived wholly or in part from such measure, stock price and total\nshareholder return;\n(iv)“erroneously awarded compensation” means, with respect to each current or former covered officer in connection with an accounting\nrestatement, the amount of incentive-based compensation received that exceeds the amount of incentive-based compensation that\notherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, computed without regard to any taxes paid;\n(v) “lookback period” means, with respect to any accounting restatement, the three completed fiscal years of the Company immediately\npreceding the restatement date, as well as any transition period (that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) within or\nimmediately following those three completed fiscal years (except that a transition period that comprises a period of at least nine months\nshall count as a completed fiscal year);\n(vi)“restatement date” means the earlier to occur of (1) the date the Board, a committee of the Board or officers of the Company authorized\nto take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to\nprepare an accounting restatement, or (2) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an\naccounting restatement; and\n(vii)“received” means with respect to any accounting restatement the Company’s fiscal period during which the financial reporting measure\nspecified in the incentive-based compensation award is attained, even if payment or grant of the incentive-based compensation occurs\nafter the end of that period.\n1\nApplication of this policy will be at the direction of the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors (“Board”) in\naccordance with the final listing standards adopted by the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) pursuant to Section 10D of the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, as amended (the “Act”).\nThe Committee shall have broad discretion to determine the appropriate means and timing (which shall in all circumstances be reasonably\npromptly) of recovery of erroneously awarded compensation based on all applicable facts and circumstances, which may include without limitation:\n(i) requiring repayment or return of prior incentive-based compensation awards;\n(ii) cancelling unvested incentive-based compensation awards;\n(iii)offsetting the amount to be recovered from any compensation owed by the Company to the covered officer; or\n(iv)adjusting future compensation of such covered officer, subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and any\nother applicable laws.\nIn addition, the Committee may, to the extent permitted by law, take other remedial and recovery action, as determined by the Committee. The\nrecovery of erroneously awarded compensation under this policy is in addition to any other right or remedy available to the Company.\nFor any incentive-based compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of erroneously awarded\ncompensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the accounting restatement, (i) the amount of erroneously\nawarded compensation shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement on the stock price or total shareholder\nreturn upon which the incentive-based compensation was received, and (ii) the Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of that\nreasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the Nasdaq.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to seek recovery of erroneously awarded compensation under this policy if\nsuch recovery would be impracticable and/or involve tax-qualified retirement plans, as determined by the Committee in accordance with the Nasdaq\nlisting standards. Any such determination that the recoupment is not required shall be documented in accordance with the Nasdaq listing standards.\n2\nThe Committee shall have full and final authority to make all determinations under this policy, including without limitation, the authority to: (i)\nconstrue all terms, provisions, conditions and limitations of this policy; (ii) correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency that\nmay appear in this policy in such manner and to such extent as the Committee shall determine appropriate; and (iii) make all other determinations or\ntake any actions necessary or advisable for the administration of this policy. All determinations and decisions made by the Committee pursuant to the\nprovisions of this policy shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons. The determination of the Committee need not be uniform with respect to\none or more covered officers. The Company shall take such action as it deems necessary or appropriate to implement this policy, including requiring\nall covered officers to acknowledge the rights and powers of the Company and the Committee hereunder.\nThis policy shall apply to all incentive-based compensation that is received on or after October 1, 2023.\n3"
