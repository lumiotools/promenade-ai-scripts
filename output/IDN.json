Wainwright & Co.\nLogan - Northland Capital\nRudy Kessinger - D.A. Davidson & Co.\nOperator\nGreetings, and welcome to the Intellicheck Q3 2024 Earnings Call.\nAt this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will\nfollow the formal presentation. Should anyone require operator assistance during the\nconference, please press “*”, “0” on your telephone keypad.\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Gar Jackson, Investor Relations. Thank you. You\nmay begin.\nGar Jackson\nThank you, Operator. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for the Intellicheck\nThird Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.

These forward-looking statements are based on management's current\nexpectations and beliefs about future events. As of any projection or forecast, they are\ninherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances, and the company\nInComm Conferencing Page 1 of 16 www.incommconferencing.com\nundertakes no obligation to and expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its\nforward-looking statements, whether resulting from such changes, new information,\nsubsequent events or otherwise.\nAdditional information concerning forward-looking statements is contained under the headings\nof Safe Harbor Statement and Risk Factors listed from time to time in the company's filings with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission. Statements made on today's call are as of today,\nNovember 13, 2024. Management will use the financial term adjusted EBITDA in today's call.\nPlease refer to the company's press release issued this afternoon for further definition,\nreconciliation and context for the use of this term.\nWe will begin today's call with Bryan Lewis, Intellicheck's Chief Executive Officer, and then\nAdam Sragovicz, Intellicheck's Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the Q3 2024 financial\nresults. Following their prepared remarks, we will take questions from our analysts and\ninstitutional investors.\nToday's call will be limited to one hour, and I will now turn the call over to Bryan.\nBryan Lewis\nThanks, Gar, and good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter 2024\nearnings call.\nTotal revenues for the third quarter were $4.71 million, and SaaS revenues increased slightly\ntotaling $4.66 million. Our gross margin remained strong at 91%, in line with last year's results.\nOf note, our new business continued to generate higher prices per transaction values.\nDuring the third quarter, our new business price per transaction increased 25% year-over-year\nand 8%, sequentially, when compared to the second quarter of this year. We believe this\nfurther reiterates our pricing power.\nOn our last call, I began with an update on some recent organizational changes. I told you about\nSandra Bower is joining the team as Vice President of Customer Success and Account\nManagement.\nI'm very pleased to say that she hit the ground running and has already made significant\nprogress in a very short period of time. Sandra has evaluated our customer success program\nand has made changes to the organization that we believe will drive sales growth as we enter\n2025.\nOne of the big opportunities that she saw in an area that we have needed to capitalize on more\neffectively is driving more use cases for customer and increasing incremental revenue. Sandra\nhas done a deep dive on the product pipeline, has been putting plans in motion that we expect\nwill drive additional revenues with many of our customers. She is effectively aligned with the\nInComm Conferencing Page 2 of 16 www.incommconferencing.com\nsales team, gave a fresh look to our customer-facing marketing materials and is providing\nvaluable input into these important areas. We see the customer success program as the key\nmetric to our success.\nOrganizational change is not a new topic on these calls. I have continued to underscore my\ncommitment to organizational review with a focus on our needs and having the right people in\nthe right positions to drive revenue growth. I will not be reticent in calling it as I see it and will\nnot hesitate to continue to make changes if I do not see the progress I expect. My objective is\nto put the best people into operational roles that will position us to drive growth and product\ninnovation.\nWe are continuing to attend trade shows as we leverage opportunities to grow brand\nawareness of our distinctive hardware-agnostic state-of-the-art technology solution and our\nrole as thought leaders in the identity theft and fraud space.\nAt the Identity Week conference in September, I was pleased to participate in a panel\ndiscussion on fighting online fraud. It was great to have our presence with distinguished co-\npanelists that included Scotiabank's Vice President, Global Fraud Management and Capital One\nSenior Counsel for Enterprise Innovation.\nIn addition, Chris Meyer, our VP of Sales, Chaired a roundtable discussion on fighting fraud.\nChris was also active at the Datos Insight Financial Crime Trade Show, where he led an intimate\nroundtable discussion from risk to reward, transforming fraud prevention into customer\nacquisition.\nJust a few weeks ago, we participated in Money 2020 for the second year. This conference is\nconsidered the world's leading premium content, sales and networking platform for the global\nmoney ecosystem. Money 2020 has a distinctive focus on what's next in the world of payments,\nfintech and financial services. This prestigious show allowed us another strong platform to\nincrease brand awareness.\nWe continue to evaluate our attendance at these shows with an eye towards return on\ninvestment and brand building as we also explore other opportunities that may serve us, well.\nWe believe that we have the most accurate and hardware free SaaS solution in the market\ntoday and that these trade shows should drive both market awareness and sales for\nIntellicheck.\nAnd one final note on marketing initiatives. Marketing continues to be a focus for us and is\nanother area where we see additional opportunities to drive more interest in Intellicheck and\nour product offerings targeting multiple verticals. We are in the process of shifting a greater\nfocus to developing support materials for the sales force based on what we have learned over\nthe past six months.\nInComm Conferencing Page 3 of 16 www.incommconferencing.com\nTurning now to sales. In this quarter, we reached an agreement with a retailer located\nthroughout the Southeast region that serves as the umbrella corporation for 287 franchise\nlocations of a well-known retail chain offering a variety of signature home furniture, decor and\naccessories.\nWe also achieved an important milestone with a leading operator in the retail lease-to-own\nspace. We are now live assuring the validity of high-risk applications. This adds to the growth\nwe are seeing with this client, who continues to implement our technology in their brick-and-\nmortar locations. We anticipate this partnership will generate annual revenues in the low 6\nfigures with their initial use case, alone.\nWhile we continue to diversify and see substantial growth in our newer vertical markets, retail\nremains a large and important part of our mix. one of our prominent department stores that\ndoes their credit card processing through one of our leading bank clients is shifting part of their\nprocess to now run their transactions through the bank API.\nThis is good news for us because the bank has a higher transaction value per scan and, as a\nresult, we've seen an uptick in revenue generated from this retail customer. Which leads me\nnow to the banking vertical. We believe this move also further solidifies our relationship with\nthis bank that does credit card transactions for multiple merchants, as well as their retail\nlocations.\nAdditionally, this incremental revenue reinforces our pricing power. As others with inferior\nproducts cut their rates in order to try and gain share and remain relevant, we continue to\nincrease our per transaction pricing with little resistance. We anticipate that the revenue\ngenerated from this bank will have a material increase, as we enter 2025.\nTo give you a little history, this bank's transaction volume has increased far beyond what they\noriginally projected, and they ran through their prepaid bucket much faster than anticipated.\nRight now, we're seeing 30% growth across their combined channels. And as a result, this\nbanking client is reassessing their future transaction volume needs, recognizing they sharply\nunderestimated their usage.\nThis happened faster than either of us anticipated, so we are currently billing them in arrears\nfor usage, and we are working towards a new three year annually prepaid commitment from\nthem that we anticipate will be signed and paid for in the first quarter.\nContinuing with our efforts in the banking market vertical, one of our large regional banks has\nsigned a new multiyear agreement, and they are now fully rolled out in live in 1,200 bank\nbranches with plans to expand to a digital use case in the near future. We anticipate this being\na mid-6-figure revenue-producing agreement annually, over time.\nInComm Conferencing Page 4 of 16 www.incommconferencing.com\nThe powerhouse Southern regional bank with more than 2,700 branches we have previously\npartnered with is in the process of working with us towards finalizing a multiyear deal for their\nin-branch location rollout.\nThis multiyear agreement stands to have significant implications. They are in the process of\nintegrating Intellicheck's technology solution into their teller workstations, and we believe it\nhas the potential to become a multiyear 7-figure contract, beginning in the middle of next year.\nI am pleased to share with you that we have continued our expansion into Canada during the\nthird quarter. A small but growing Canadian online bank completed integration for digital online\nuse cases. Canada has been a growing market for us, and we continue to believe that we will\nsee additional opportunities to drive revenue there. Our real estate market vertical presence\ncontinues to see solid growth.\nOn our last call, I shared with you news of Intellicheck's partnership with the nation's eighth\nlargest title insurance, Doma Title Insurance. You may recall that Doma Title has partnered with\nIntellicheck, providing its agent and attorney customers with access to Intellicheck's web-based\nsolution that validates, analyze, matches and derisks the identification credentials of parties\ninvolved in real estate transactions is being offered to Doma agents who are signing documents\nas part of a Doma-insured transaction.\nDoma Title turned to us to address a rising trend that is costing title insurance companies and\nhomeowners billions of dollars in losses, each year. Seller impersonation fraud is a real estate\nscam in which a fraudster poses as a property owner to illegally sell, without the true property\nowner's knowledge or involvement, residential or commercial property.\nAs incredible as it sounds, it is happening with greater frequency. Sophisticated fraudsters often\nuse the property owners fraudulently obtained social security and driver's license information\nin the transaction. In many cases, fraudsters use e-mail and text messages to communicate with\nthe title agent, allowing them to master true identities and commit crime from a remote\nlocation.\nAlso called Seller ID fraud, the scam is most rampant in the high-volume states of California,\nFlorida and Texas, but schemes have targeted property owners throughout the country from\nrural areas in the south to cities in the Midwest.\nA troubling statistic that demonstrates just how serious the problem is serves to underscore the\nfinancial impact. In 2023, 30% of all claims paid by Doma Title Insurance involved fraud and\nforgery. Early data from the first few months of 2024 is further evidence of the significance of\nthis problem. In those first few months alone, seller impersonation claims surpassed 2023\ndamages.\nInComm Conferencing Page 5 of 16 www.incommconferencing.com\nI hope you had time to read the Doma Title Insurance press release that was issued in August\nbecause I believe you, too, will appreciate hearing about the consequential impact Intellicheck's\ntechnology solutions is having from one of Doma's Title agents. We believe this further sets the\nstage for additional growth in this area, and I am pleased to share with you the fact that we are\nseeing that, already.\nAnd the other title insurance company that is capitalizing on the value of our technology is\nWestcor Land Title Insurance Company. Westcor is the number one independent title insurance\nunderwriter in the nation. Their model is a bit different. They have launched val-ID by Westcor.\nIt's an advanced ID verification tool designed to empower title agents in validating the identities\nof borrowers and sellers.\nThey describe this new tool powered by our technology solution as delivering, and I quote them\nhere, “unparalleled access and speed in ID verification.” The tool features of comprehensive\ndashboard that provides title agents with real-time tracking of ID verification status, enabling\nthem to manage their workflow efficiently with validation methods that include state issued\nIDs, passports and support for foreign transactions.\nVal-ID provides multiple validation options, including mobile texting and live e-mail hyperlinks,\nensuring flexibility and convenience in the verification process. This comprehensive approach to\nidentity validation helps agents enhance their due diligence process, mitigate risk, prevent\nfraud, improve overall transaction integrity.\nWe really appreciated a comment from Scott Chandler, Chief Operating Officer at Westcor Land\nTitle Insurance Company. He said and, again, I'm quoting here, \"We are confident that this tool\nwill be a game changer for our agents, allowing them to perform their duties with greater\nconfidence and efficiency.\" We couldn't agree more.\nOn our last call, I noted that we are seeing growth in our title business and in addition, these\nclients highlights why we believe that trend will continue. In a related development, a wire\ntransfer company that has just completed the integration of our technology solution and are\nnow just starting to ramp up.\nIn this client's recent findings on the state of wire fraud, the data showed that one in 20\nAmericans who bought or sold a home within the past three years has been victim of some type\nof real estate fraud, with a median amount in consumer losses exceeding $70,000 as a result of\nthe stolen buyer’s down payment and the seller's net proceeds.\nThe company's warn that fraudsters have become, increasingly, skilled at leveraging public\nrecords, reaching broker entitled agency systems, so they're able to effectively pretend to be\nsomeone involved in a transaction to steal from unsuspecting consumers. Although there are\nmultiple warnings in place at all parts of a real estate wire transaction, consumers are still\nInComm Conferencing Page 6 of 16 www.incommconferencing.com\ntargeted through communications that convince them to send money to a fraudulent account\nor an entity that they believe to be true.\nFraudsters posing as someone involved in the transaction via e-mail to scan victims that are\ntheir funds have seen dramatic growth. The latest data from the FBI shows that this type of\nprime, which they categorize under business e-mail compromise, cost victims a record $446\nmillion in real estate transactions, during 2022.\nSo now turning to our email, social media accounts, in the domestic and international social\nmedia space, we do have an update. There's been a delay in that rollout, but not for reasons\nthat should be of concern. In fact, we believe it's good news. This American multinational\ncompany operating as one of the largest social media platforms in the world that chose\nIntellicheck for ID validation, has been so impressed by our technology that it is working on a\nlarger use case than originally anticipated.\nIn our discussions, they have told us that their goal is to be live no later than early next year.\nThis marks a second globally recognized social media platform that has implemented\nIntellicheck's technology and has been so impressed with its performance that they are\nexpanding its application.\nYou may recall that the use case for the original social media company we started working with\na few years ago was for identity validation to prevent fraudulent account takeovers.\nIn the stadium operations market vertical, we are looking at finalizing deals with two high-\nprofile food and beverage concession operators that service multiple stadiums and arena\nvenues. In addition, through these two operators, we are in the process of closing an\nagreement with a primary point-of-sale company for sporting venues that would incorporate\nthe Intellicheck validation process directly into their point-of-sale system.\nWhat is important to note here is that these leading operators have more than one objective in\nmind. Of course, they're concerned about preventing underage access to alcohol through fake\nIDs. However, they have an equally important need to address over serving. If an individual is\nover served and leaves their premises drunk, should they be an accident, engage environment\nbehavior or other activity that results in damage and loss, the liability for these operators\nstands to be monumental. Our technology solutions are able to track drinks served per\ncustomer and allow the server to prevent over service.\nWe are also continuing to build our position in the digital space. A software company that\nspecializes in identity management is in the process of incorporating our technology solution in\ntheir platform.\nProgramming is underway for this new client, which describes itself as an identity security\nplatform behind over half of the Fortune 100, 13 of the 15 largest U.S. banks and seven of the\nInComm Conferencing Page 7 of 16 www.incommconferencing.com\nnine largest global health care companies. We believe this agreement underscores the\nsuperiority of our technology solution.\nIn the Automobile market, we are seeing solid growth in the vertical. Automotive is up 28%\nover Q3 2023, underscoring why we believe this is a great vertical for us to continue to pursue.\nOn our last call, we introduced another new vertical in employment verification. Employment\nverification is a multifaceted market vertical where we are starting to see our expansion efforts\npay off.\nIn our previous call, we discussed the use case in the cargo transportation area. It is a growing\nuse case and one that we effectively tackled with a major consumer food company we had\ntalked about. You may recall that in this use case, the company has been experienced fraud at\nall of its shipping distribution locations.\nFraudsters with fake identification documents are showing up at the warehouse posing as\nlegitimate transportation personnel and are driving away with an 18-wheeler loaded with\nproduct. Losses have been dramatic for the company. In the latest development, our proof-of-\nconcept pilot was so successful that this company is in the process of rolling out our technology\nsolution to all of their fleet locations, and they have introduced us to a large coffee retailer who\nis having similar problems in their distribution centers.\nIt is important to understand how consequential the issue of employment fraud is related to\ncargo transportation fraud. Recent study data shows that cargo freight theft has increased\n430%, year-over-year, in Q3 of 2023. Further findings revealed that there were 38% more cargo\nthefts in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same time frame, last year.\nNearly half of those incidents occurs in warehouses and distribution centers with an average\nloss of more than $210,000 per theft. While cargo thefts used to be largely centered around\nSouthern California, the hotspots for truckload thefts have started to proliferate around the\ncountry. With the rollout of our solution to all locations underway, we look forward to sharing\nmore news on this new partnership.\nIn a related development, we expect to make an announcement, shortly, about our new\npartnership that is allowing a nationally recognized company to effectively validate job seekers\napplicants identity documents. This is another facet of the employment verification market\nvertical that we believe holds opportunities for further expansion.\nWe believe that the channel program remains a great platform to propel volume with our\npartners. Sandra is working closely with the team to drive revenues through this program. We\nanticipate that this program will be an important contributor to our revenue growth in 2025.\nInComm Conferencing Page 8 of 16 www.incommconferencing.com\nYou may recall that I shared a quick peek at our technological advances. We are now migrating\nclients to our new Intellicheck hub, which allows our customers to access their transaction data\nand perform self-administrative tax. We believe that this is an extremely important\nenhancement for a number of reasons.\nFirst, it allows clients to be able to gain additional insight into transaction activity. It allows\nthem to gain keen insight into how they can improve their own internal processes. In a\nlightning-fast digital world, this is a crucial need. At the same time, the clients realize important\nprocedural gains we benefit, as well.\nOur support staff is freed from the time-consuming and costly administrative burdens, allowing\nthem to provide more value-added service benefits. I'm pausing here to remind you that the\nhub reflects a critical facet of our client relations. It demonstrates the ongoing dialogue we\nhave with our clients that we seek their input on their evolving needs and respond to them.\nThis is a win-win situation.\nAnd product development is not a nice to have; it's a must. As fraudsters continue to evolve\ntheir tactics to undermine identity verification solutions, so must we, and we are doing that\nwith ongoing enhancements to our ID verification platform. We are moving forward with the\nenhancements we mentioned that are part of our strategic focus that include new machine\nlearning and statistical calculations to foil the latest printed physical fake IDs and the onslaught\nof generative AI attacks.\nI am pleased to report that we're seeing the benefits from our new proprietary statistical\nmodels. And as previously discussed, we stand to deliver a significant impact on OCR match\nprocessing while, at the same time, it gives customers another feature enhancement for their\nown models, another valuable step forward in product development from Intellicheck.\nWith the enhancement to document liveness that is enabling physical ID documents we\npresented during an electronic validation process that uses the end user's phone, we like what\nwe're seeing. We're seeing that the accuracy that we are known for in this enhancement that\ncan affirm if documents presented in the electronic validation procedure are physical versus\nprinted images or simulated by pointing the camera at another screen.\nGiven the issues that are involved as fraudsters utilize generative AI, we cannot underscore\nenough the significance of being able to recognize any edits to the user's picture that appears\non the front of the ID. It's a cat and mouse game, and we remain diligent on staying one step\nahead.\nWe continue to invest in product and enhancements, understanding that it's critical to me in\nour position as an industry leader in identity verification.\nInComm Conferencing Page 9 of 16 www.incommconferencing.com\nOver the course of the past two years, we have invested approximately $8.8 million on R&D\nrelated to product development. Additionally, we have invested approximately $2.2 million in\nthe transition from Azure to AWS. This has been a capitalized expense with a big lift largely\ncompleted.\nAs a reminder, we've utilized outside consultants to get the work done quickly and efficiently,\nand anticipate the cash outlay for the work is largely behind us. Our 90-plus percent gross\nmargins position us well going forward, and we anticipate generating cash next year, driven by\naccelerated top line sales growth. As you can see, we believe we are making substantial\nprogress on a number of fronts. It is our sense that these developments were served to\naccelerate our revenue growth, as we enter 2025.\nI will now turn the call over to Adam.\nAdam Sragovicz\nThank you, Bryan. I'm excited to be here at Intellicheck and to join such a dedicated and\ntalented team under Bryan's leadership. As this is my first earnings call, I'm eager to share our\nprogress and outlook for the future. Let's dive into the key points for this quarter.\nYou have heard us in the past discuss our cloud migration from Azure to AWS. And as a result,\nwe anticipate seeing less R&D spend in Q4 and going forward. We believe that this migration,\nas well as other systems initiatives, such as how that Bryan just discussed, will improve\ncustomer satisfaction, retention and accelerate new customer onboarding. They should also\nprovide customers with analytics that will help them monitor and improve their own\nbusinesses.\nWe are proud that we have maintained our gross profit and gross margins, even while running a\ndual cloud infrastructure, during this period of transition. We've also made a few targeted\nchanges within Intellicheck's marketing channel sales and customer success teams, which\nshould result in better operating efficiency without increasing spending.\nTurning now to our third quarter results. Revenue for the third quarter of 2024, decreased 1%\nto $4,709,000, compared to $4,760,000 in the same period of 2023. Our SaaS revenue for the\nthird quarter of 2024 increased 1% to $4,661,000 from $4,635,000 during the same period of\n2023 and represented 99% of our third quarter revenue.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues was at the higher end of our expectations at 91% for\nboth the third quarter of 2024 and the same period in 2023, and is reflective of the architecture\nefforts, even though we incurred transitional overlap on cloud expenses. Our product team and\ntemporary contractors have worked efficiently, and they have been able to maintain recurring\nmargins of over 90%, through the architectural process.\nInComm Conferencing Page 10 of 16 www.incommconferencing.com\nWe anticipate that this project will conclude with the temporary contractors by the year end.\nThat being said, we will continue to closely monitor our spending with the goal to maintain or\nimprove upon these margin levels.\nOperating expenses, which consist of selling, general and administrative, marketing and\nresearch and development expenses, decreased $32,000 or 1%, to $5,195,000 for the third\nquarter of 2024 compared to $5,227,000 for the same period of 2023.\nThe third quarter of 2024 and 2023 included $236,000 and $342,000, respectively, of noncash\nequity compensation expense and non-severance expense. Within the third quarter, we\nrecognized $443,000 in software capitalization, tied to our re-architecture efforts. Our\noperating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased 51 basis points against the same\nperiod of 2023.\nYear-to-date, we have capitalized approximately $1.8 million for software development.\nTurning to net income and adjusted EBITDA, the company's net income was lower by $113,000\nto a net loss of $837,000 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a net loss of $724,000 for\nthe same period of 2023.\nNet loss per diluted share for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.04 per diluted share compared\nto the same loss of $0.04 per diluted share for the same period of 2023. The weighted average\ndiluted common shares were $19.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $19.3\nmillion for the same period of 2023.\nAdjusted EBITDA, which is earnings before interest and other income, provision for income\ntaxes, sales tax accruals, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense and\ncertain nonrecurring charges improved by $103,000, resulting in a loss of $168,000 compared\nto a loss of $271,000, through the same period of 2023. Our balance sheet remains strong, and\nwe finished the third quarter with $5.7 million in cash. We also continue to ensure we are\nproperly managing our cash reserves, which generated $73,000 in interest income, during the\nthird quarter.\nTurning now to the progress on internal initiatives, and looking at our sales pipeline, I'm struck\non nearly all of the significant opportunities are in the financial services, social media,\nhospitality and entertainment spaces. The long-term sales, marketing and product efforts of\ndiversifying the company's revenue mix can be seen in the pipeline, itself. It is a real testament\nto these efforts, that Intellicheck revenue is roughly flat, while retail saw the largest number of\nbankruptcies that scoped in 2022, an increase in bankruptcies of over 30%, compared to 2023.\nUnfortunately, these bankruptcies included three of our customers.\nCustomer experience has also been mentioned, the company has made recent investments and\nhas already seen significant progress in a short period of time. We believe that the focus on\nInComm Conferencing Page 11 of 16 www.incommconferencing.com\nmarketing (inaudible), the role of sales engineers and the realigning customer experience skill\nsets are all coming together to improve customer satisfaction and drive additional revenues.\nIn consideration of our end of 2024 outlook, we expect to see continued gross margins of\napproximately 90% to 91%, while we improve our architecture and data intelligence\ncapabilities. With the expected winding down of R&D contractors spend in Q4, we believe that\nwe will continue to maintain strong gross profit and gross margin costs. This also means that we\nmay see somewhat higher noncash depreciation costs going forward, due to the amortization\nof these completed projects.\nIn closing, I joined Intellicheck because I believe that Intellicheck will soon see real benefits\nfrom its re-architecture, sales and marketing efforts. The company has been successfully\npivoting to financial services and other verticals to diversify its revenue streams. Although this\nprocess has long lead times, I believe that it can pay off, meaningfully. I look forward to sharing\nthe story of the fruits of these labors, and discussing our Q4 and full year 2024 results with all of\nyou in March.\nI'll now turn the call over to the operator to take your questions.\nOperator\nThank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a\nquestion, please press “*”, “1” on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate\nyour line is in the question queue. You may press “*”, “2” if you would like to remove your\nquestion from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick\nup your handset, before pressing the star keys. One moment please while we poll for questions.\nThe first question is from Scott Buck from H.C. Wainwright. Please go ahead.\nScott Buck\nHi, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Bryan, I guess the first one, I was\ncurious, when do you guys start to anniversary some of those more difficult retail comps?\nTrying to understand when we might see some better growth on the optic side.\nBryan Lewis\nHey, Scott, so, happy to answer your question. Are you saying, when do we expect retail to\ncome back or I'm not quite sure I understand.\nScott Buck\nWhen do you anniversary when the softer trend started. So the year-over-year comparables\nstart to look a little bit better because that weakness is already kind of baked in at that point?\nBryan Lewis\nInComm Conferencing Page 12 of 16 www.incommconferencing.com\nYeah, look, I think the weakness--I'm looking at the numbers, the weakness certainly didn't\nstart, in my mind, until about halfway through last year. So that's why I'm looking at, I should\nsay, actually, even in the third quarter, things have started been going down as soon as inflation\nwent up.\nAnd if you're looking at now the amount of credit a lot of people are carrying, there's issues\nthere. Even something came out today that retail hiring in October was the lowest it's been in I\nthink it was 10 years.\nSo, I think retail certainly is hurting. I'm hoping that as we see inflation dropping and other\nthings happening that it comes back, I'm looking at it—hopefully, I look at it is if I'm flying to the\nWest Coast, it takes longer because I'm going into the wind and flying to the East Coast because\nI'm going with the wind.\nSo I'm looking at something that’s a headwind that could become a tailwind. But what I'm\nhappy to say is we look at the other verticals we're going into and even in some of the\ncustomers in those verticals haven't fully implemented and we know what they're going to do.\nI'm happy that well over a year ago, we decided to make sure that we were looking at other\nplaces that need to know that you are who you say you are.\nScott Buck\nYeah. No, that makes sense. I appreciate that. And then the second thing, just curious on cash\nlevels, where your kind of comfort is and if you have some room, whether it makes sense to put\na little more money into sales and marketing to try to drive that top line, if the opportunities\nare there.\nBryan Lewis\nI'm still comfortable that we do not need to raise cash to run the business. And currently, what\nwe're doing is assessing where did we spend money last year on marketing that we're not going\nto, this year.\nLooking at ROI, some of these conferences have become kind of ridiculously expensive. And if\nwe're not seeing the ROI, we're not going back. How do we tighten up our messaging, how do\nwe get out there and do things differently than we did? And certainly, reminding everybody\nthat the partnerships that we have with them and the DMVs is what makes us unique.\nI was talking to a woman who runs partnerships for a company that does software for issuing\ncredit and explained to her what she--to her what we do. She thought everybody was the same.\nAnd I've said this many times. One of the hardest things is getting people to realize, we don't\ntemplate. We don't need that picture. And that picture doesn't work anymore because AI and\nmachine learning has made it so the bad guys have really, really good fakes. We've got\nsomething unique. And that's still what we're getting--need to get across, and we will, that you\nInComm Conferencing Page 13 of 16 www.incommconferencing.com\nneed to talk to us because we do it different than everybody else who might have a much,\nmuch larger marketing budget.\nScott Buck\nThat makes sense. I appreciate it, guys, that’s it for me. Thanks, again.\nBryan Lewis\nThanks, Scott.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Mike Grondahl from Northland. Please go ahead. Please go ahead.\nLogan\nHey guys, this is Logan on for Mike. Could you provide some color around how retail volumes\ntrended in 3Q? And then also what you guys are seeing in 4Q so far in terms of seasonality?\nBryan Lewis\nLook, I haven't looked at, yet, seasonality because it really picks up really right about now.\nOctober is usually kind of like October. It really is what it is. But certainly, across department\nstores, apparel stores, jewelry stores, those types of things, we saw a double-digit decline in\ntransaction volume there. Which, again, I'm going to point to and say, I'm happy we decided to\ngo get other markets that aren't tied to the economy.\nLogan\nYeah, so with those new ones, too, should we expect possible year-over-year growth in 4Q?\nBryan Lewis\nLook, that's my hope. That's my anticipation. I think it depends on when some of these big guys\nthat we've been working on go live. I still think there's going to be, in my mind, some seasonal\ngrowth because you always--people will be shopping. There are some people that are earning,\nand there are some people that aren't. But hopefully, the goal is a few of the folks that we get\nlive do help fuel growth.\nLogan\nThat’s all from us. Thank you, guys. Congrats on the quarter.\nBryan Lewis\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question is from Rudy Kessinger from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nRudy Kessinger\nInComm Conferencing Page 14 of 16 www.incommconferencing.com\nHey guys, thank you for taking my questions. I guess, first, I just want to clarify on the price per\ntransaction. You set up 25% year-over-year, 8% quarter-over-quarter. You said on new\nbusiness, though, so just to be clear, that wasn't a--was that across the board for all scan\nvolumes, or that was pricing for scan volumes from new logos that you signed in Q3 versus Q2\nand Q3, last year?\nBryan Lewis\nYes. Good question. We haven't had any of our largest clients, they're not up for renewal yet,\nright? It’ll be year-end and beginning of next year. One of the things I just wanted to make clear\nto everybody because I think there was some confusion that people thought our growth is\nbeing driven only by charging existing customers more, right? So that is new business versus\nnew business. So comparing customers that were brand new to us a year ago versus customers\nthat were brand new to us, Q3. And a customer is brand-new Q2 to brand new in Q3. Just to\nshow that people are willing to pay for the accuracy that we bring to the table.\nRudy Kessinger\nOkay. That's helpful. And I know you guys called out several banks, social media, a few\ncustomers that have low, mid 6-figure revenue potential, it sounds like starting at some point\nnext year. I guess just as you evaluate the pipeline today, what is the size of the pipe versus, I\ndon't know, one, two, three quarters ago? And are there any other large needle-moving type of\ndeals in there that could repel you back to year-over-year growth, over the next one or two\nquarters?\nBryan Lewis\nI'm much happier with the pipeline today than I was three quarters ago. We are certainly\ntalking to and in proof of concept with some client prospects that I would consider to be needle\nmoving. I just don't want to like--I'm a more under promise and over deliver. I would rather that\nwe get--I'll talk to you all next call, and there's more substantive things to say about it that we\ncertainly have people coming to, us large clients, and telling us what they have and what\nthey're using, that templating system that just about everybody else on the planet tries to do to\nsee if an ID is real, isn't working.\nAnd when we get to them and get them to understand we are way different than what they're\ndoing, they want to talk, and they want to get into a proof of concept. But the thing is with very\nlarge customers, sometimes it takes a while to get to the proof of concept and then to get\nthrough the security audit that they always put you through. So hopefully, more to talk about\nthat on the next call.\nRudy Kessinger\nOkay, great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator\nInComm Conferencing Page 15 of 16 www.incommconferencing.com\nThis concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to\nBryan Lewis for closing comments.\nBryan Lewis\nSo thanks, everybody, for joining us. As we look back on this quarter, I believe we've made\nprogress in a number of ways. The reality is that retail bankruptcies, consumer pullback on\nspending and certainly credit tightening reflects the state of the economy and has hurt part of\nour business, but we've stayed the course and implemented what I believe to be a successful\nstrategic plan, and that is getting into other markets.\nIn the face of--as I said earlier, double-digit drops in the retail sectors, we're flat to slightly\ngrowing. So those new verticals are paying off, right? And our strategic vision and pursuing new\ndirections has allowed us to achieve growth and offset this economic weakness. We believe\nthese new verticals will continue to show significant growth opportunities in 2025.\nSo in closing, we remain committed to revenue growth and will continue to work in concert\nwith the executive team and staff to achieve our revenue goals for our shareholders and\nstakeholders, alike. Thank you all, and have a great evening.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference,\nplease press “*”, “0” on your telephone keypad.\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Gar Jackson of Investor Relations.\nPlease go ahead.\nGar Jackson\nThank you, Operator.

Following their prepared remarks, we will take questions from\nour analysts and institutional investors.\nToday's call will be limited to one hour, and I will now turn the call over to Bryan.\nBryan Lewis\nThanks, Gar, and thank you, all, for joining us for our Q2 earnings call. As we begin today, it is\nimportant to look at a milestone that highlights what I continue to emphasize. Fraud and\nidentity theft isn't going away, and a look at the latest data underscores the significance and\npervasiveness of the problem.\nAccording to the Identity Theft Resource Center, the number of data-breach victims has\nexceeded 1 billion people for the first half of 2024, compared to 183 million people who were\ndata-breach victims in the first half of 2023. That represents more than a 400% increase in both\nour staggering numbers.\nIt's worth pausing a moment to digest the impact. Each of these data-breach victims are now\nprime candidates for identity theft and fraud. To underscore that data breaches equal identity\ntheft, remember that in 2023, there was a 13% increase in traditional identity theft losses\nwhere a stolen identity was used to commit a crime. Losses rose to $23 billion, impacting 15\nmillion victims in the U.S.\nWith that as a backdrop, our mission remains clear. We continue to believe that our technology\nis the most effective at stopping fraud and identity theft and that Intellicheck is the best first\nstep in identifying that a person is who they say they are. It's that simple.\nThe Intellicheck identity platform allows our customers to confirm that the person they are\nentering into a transaction with is who they say they are and that they can and want to do\nbusiness with them. And our customers are able to do it so quickly, easily and seamlessly,\nwithout the need for new hardware.\nInComm Conferencing Page 2 of 17 www.incommconferencing.com\nBecause of our proven technologies, high degree of accuracy, the simple first step allows the\ntransaction to go forward with confidence facilitating the onboarding of new good customers,\nwhile assuring bad actors will not be successful.\nIn looking at Q2, you will see the value of the strategic moves we have made. You're probably\nwell aware that we are currently heavily dependent on our retailers to drive revenue.\nWe have been successfully expanding our presence in additional market verticals in line with\nour strategic plan to remain agile, as we look to continue to fuel growth. Understand that we\nare still building on a relatively small base, but one that is growing. This diversification will take\ntime, but we believe we are well underway.\nTurning now to a brief overview of our Q2 results that Jeff will go over in more detail, shortly.\nQ2 SaaS revenues were $4.6 million, down $36,000 versus a year ago period. We maintained\nrobust expense disciplines showcased by our operating expenses that were down $770,000, or\n17% versus the same period, last year. The company's net income improved by $726,000 to a\nnet loss of $127,000 for the second quarter of 2024, compared to a net loss of $853,000 for the\nsame period in 2023.\nA snapshot of market realities gives you an important frame of reference. As it stands today,\nretail continues to be largely bifurcated with the luxury segment benefiting from high-income\npurchasers, so it's doing relatively well.\nHowever, our clients include many apparel retailers who continue to see headwinds from\nconsumer pullback, and this also impacts department and home improvement stores, channels\nthat continue to struggle, for the most part. While we continue to stop fraud effectively for our\ncustomers in these verticals, our retail concentration had an impact on our second quarter\nresults.\nAdditionally, we are seeing more news of activity around bankruptcies and store closures,\nincluding one of our customers that entered Chapter 11 towards the end of July and another\nthat is a home discount retailer closing down a significant number of stores.\nThis reinforces why we believe that it is becoming ever more important to continue to expand\nour reach outside of traditional retailers into the new verticals we have been focusing on.\nWhen comparing Q1 to Q2 of this year, we saw an 11% sequential increase in our new\ncustomer average price per scan. This increase speaks to our diversification strategy and newer\nverticals having a higher price per scan. However, scan volumes and revenues in our legacy\nverticals continue to be pressured.\nYear-over-year, we saw double-digit negative comps amongst our department store, apparel\nand cosmetic retailers with more significant headwinds from our furnishing and home\nInComm Conferencing Page 3 of 17 www.incommconferencing.com\nimprovement verticals. This scan volume was partially offset by our electronics vertical and in\nnew categories, we have begun focusing on, including auto, title insurance and the e-mail,\nsocial media verticals.\nWe continue to believe that expanding our presence in market verticals like e-mail and social\nmedia authentication, as well as title insurance and automotive that are complemented by our\nnew channel partner program, will result in significant drivers of increased volume in the\nfuture, as we continue to build momentum in these new categories that continue to suffer from\nsignificant fraud.\nDespite these headwinds, as you can see, we have and will continue to move forward with a\nlaser focus on signing new customers and expanding our use cases amongst existing customers\nthat continue to seek out additional ways to keep the bad guys at bay and protect their\nbusinesses from the growing fraud landscape.\nAt the same time, I've moved forward with staffing changes that speak to what I've long told\nyou. I'm continually evaluating our needs and our performance to make changes where we\nneed to strengthen the organization.\nOn Friday, we will be welcoming Sandra Bauer, who will serve as our Vice President of\nCustomer Experience and Account Management. Sandra brings significant relevant experience\nto this new position in Intellicheck. She is an innovative client experience executive who has a\ntrack record of driving success through recurring revenue growth and client retention for\ncompanies such as Juniper, Auto, Apta, Salesforce and more.\nHer SaaS company experience is reflected throughout her more than two decades of high-tech\nexperience, which also include developing customer experience strategies and high-performing\naccount management teams, in addition to sales operation expertise that aligns the customer\nexperience, across the organizational spectrum.\nSandra will have lead responsibility for the implementation process, customer revenues and\naccount management services. Sandra comes to us from Entrust and as Head of Account\nManagement there, she overhauled the customer management programs, resulting in\nincreases in retention, revenue and satisfaction scores. We are excited to have her on board\nand fill this new important role.\nJust as importantly, this change will allow Chris Meyer to focus his attention solely on his team,\nbringing on board named accounts and prominent logos that we believe will really drive growth\ngoing forward. Chris has demonstrated his strength in this regard. Over his past nine years with\nIntellicheck, Chris has been responsible for bringing on board many of our largest customers\nthat generate a significant portion of our revenues.\nInComm Conferencing Page 4 of 17 www.incommconferencing.com\nWe are very excited to allow Chris to focus exclusively on generating sales, while Sandra\nfocuses on the customer experience and account management, along with working in\nconjunction with the IT team to drive rapid and successful implementations.\nTurning now to our Q2 wins. Doma Title Insurance is one of our newest clients, and we were\nvery excited to see their press release on August 6, highlighting the partnership in which Doma\nindependent title agents and approved Attorneys are now able to use Intellicheck to detect\nseller impersonation fraud.\nDoma Title Insurance is the nation's eighth largest title insurer, and they understand the\nimportance of Intellicheck's industry-leading identity validation technology.\nIn 2023, 30% of all claims played by Doma Title Insurance involved fraud and forgery, which\nincludes seller ID fraud claims. According to Doma's Chief Claims Council, Chris McChesney,\n\"Only a few months into 2024, claims involving seller impersonation have already surpassed full\nyear 2023 levels.\"\nIn their press release, their claims council noted, “Most of these claims result in a full loss of\ntitle, meaning one claim can easily cause a loss of $500,000 or more.” The vast majority of\nthese claims are preventable using our seller verification tool. I appreciated the opportunity to\ncomment in the Doma press release. And as I stated there, \"The nationwide surge in real estate\nscans are a serious threat to transaction security and consumer confidence.\"\nOur partnership allows Doma to deliver the highest level of security that assures peace of mind\nfor title agents and their customers within Intellicheck's rapid, accurate identity verification\ntechnology. Now they can engage good customers with a seamless onboarding experience,\nwhile preventing fraudulent transactions from occurring.\nOur lease-to-own retail client with over 1,700 locations that operates as an omnichannel\nplatform company committed to elevating financial opportunity for all through innovative,\ninclusive and technology-driven financial solutions, completed their proof of concept with\nIntellicheck. The plan was very successful, and they are now looking to expand beyond their\noriginal U.K. for brick-and-mortar locations with a focus on their LTO product, and we are\ncurrently putting the master service agreement in place to do so.\nThe real estate transaction platform we had previously told you was coming on board is now\nlive. They are in the process of rolling out Intellicheck's technology to all of their customers.\nThis company is a leading comprehensive digital closing platform used by title, Escrow, real\nestate and mortgage lending professionals to transform home buying and selling into a simple,\nsecure, enjoyable experience for millions of homeowners, each year.\nThe platform provides a system of record for real estate settlement ecosystems through our\nsuite of workflow, accounting reporting and collaboration products, as well as its expansive\nInComm Conferencing Page 5 of 17 www.incommconferencing.com\nproduct and service integrations. While they only went live near the end of June, their agents\nare excited and volumes are increasing.\nWe also realized great progress with the company we signed, which is dedicated to wire service\ntransfer fraud prevention. We are now live with the completion of the integration of\nIntellicheck's state-of-the-art identity platform into their agent platform for wire transfers and\nnow, other KYC needs.\nWe are also now live with the ID and credential verification app company that is designed,\nspecifically, for transport and logistics. Given that so many truck drivers are hired remotely, this\ncompany is using Intellicheck to verify drivers' credentials to be sure the drivers are who they\nsay they are.\nWe also signed and went live in record time with a top five title insurance company that has\nintegrated our platform into their portal for title agents to improve overall transaction integrity.\nThe integration enhances agents due diligent process, mitigates risk and prevents fraud. They\nare rolling out to their clients, this month.\nWe also, in the quarter, signed and brought live for a proof of concept a very large food and\nbeverage company to stop fraudulent trailer pickups. They've been dealing with skyrocketing\nincidents of fraudsters showing up with fake IDs and driving off with trailers loaded with\nvaluable merchandise. They are also concerned about keeping drivers with expired licenses\nfrom getting behind the wheel.\nThe company has been using Intellicheck's verification technology to authenticate delivery\ndrivers and prove that their license are not expired, when making a warehouse trailer pickup.\nSo far, the proof of concept is going extremely well, and they are introducing us to other\ncompanies that have the same issues.\nIn Q2, we expanded into a new vertical that we believe has large potential. This new client\nprovides employment screening software solutions, within the background screening industry.\nThis is another example of our channel strategy.\nThere are an estimated 1,268 background check companies in the U.S. We don't want to knock\non every door, so we believe that partnering with the people who provide them the tools to run\ntheir business makes the most sense.\nHere is yet another example where the critical focus is on knowing that the person our clients\nare working with is who they say they are. This is an obvious fit for our product in which our\ntechnology solution will be used, when conducting background checks.\nAnd since we're talking about background checks, this is yet another way we can work with the\nuniversities. As I've spoken about before, the Intellicheck identity platform first lets you know\nInComm Conferencing Page 6 of 17 www.incommconferencing.com\nthat the person is who they say they are and second, gives user the information they need to\nknow, whether they can or want to do business with this person.\nUniversities have the same issue, especially for temporary employees on athletic game days.\nWe just signed a prominent school in Utah that will be using our platform for ID verification and\ncriminal background checks for this use case. We are currently in discussions with several other\nuniversities to do the same thing.\nThis represents the third use case we have with universities, alcohol sales at stadiums, stopping\nfinancial aid theft and now, employment.\nWe believe that this progress illustrates that we continue to diversify into new industries that\nare not dependent on consumer credit, but are dependent on stopping fraud.\nRegarding the large social media company, additional engineering and development resources\nhave been allocated on the social media company side. As we said before, we can only move as\nfast as the clients move on their side. They've informed us that the additional engineering\nresources have been allocated to project, and we continue to believe that we will be up and\nrunning by year-end.\nThe other large client opportunity, the top three bank that we were anticipating going live by\nyear-end for online authentication, has made some internal changes. They have built out an\ninternal team that has taken them in another direction in their organization. And fortunately, it\nlooks like they will be doing something different online, but we still continue to talk to them\nabout in-person.\nTurning now to our IT initiatives. I'm very pleased to share a quick peek at our exciting new\ntechnology advances that will be released, later this year. Scheduled for Q3, we will be\nreleasing our new Intellicheck hub for our customers to access their transaction data and\nperform self-administration tasks.\nThis provides two important things: valuable insights to our clients about how transactions are\nhappening and how they can improve their process, especially in the digital world; and second,\nit removes a lot of administrative burden from Intellicheck support staff, freeing them up to\nprovide more value-added services to our clients.\nThis product release reflects our responsiveness to input from clients. We are constantly\ncommunicating with our clients to understand their evolving needs and to respond to them. I'm\nproud to say that we delivered.\nFraudsters are relentless and their ever-changing tactics are designed to try and defeat the\nsafeguards in place. We are continuously enhancing our ID verification platform to deal with\nthe latest fraud attacks. We are implementing and expanding capabilities to include new\nInComm Conferencing Page 7 of 17 www.incommconferencing.com\nmachine learning and statistical calculations to support the latest printed physical fake IDs and\ngenerative AI attacks.\nOur data science team has released new proprietary statistical models that dramatically\nimproved the OCR match processing. These features also allow our customers to weight these\nfactors in their own models, something we had not done before.\nIn addition, we continue to enhance document liveness techniques to enable physical ID\ndocuments to be presented during an electronic validation flow that uses the end user's phone.\nThese checks can confirm if the documents presented in this session are physical versus printed\nimages or simulated by pointing the camera at another screen or they can spot edits to the\nuser's picture printed on the front of ID, which is common with generative AI attacks.\nYou may recall, we introduced a product called Capture to simplify our clients' remote captured\ndocuments. Instead of doing a lot of programming with two simple web hooks to Intellicheck,\nwe did it for them. It was completely white labeled and their clients never knew it was us.\nWe are now providing a similar tool for clients that want to embed us in their proprietary\nmobile app. With this new tool, our clients can make one call from their mobile app to launch\nthe Intellicheck identity validation process. Again, this is completely white labeled within their\napp, and their customer never even knew it was us.\nAs we like to say, the best identity experience for your customer that they never knew they\nhad.\nSo before turning the call over to Jeff to discuss our Q2 financial results, I have mixed feelings,\nas I turn to Jeff one last time to discuss our quarterly results. Jeff, everyone at Intellicheck is\ngrateful to you for all your contributions over the past two years. At the same time, it's hard to\nsay goodbye to someone I think so much of, personally and professionally. And I'm also\ndelighted to introduce our listeners today to Adam Sragovicz, who will be taking over the role\nof CFO on September 1.\nJeff and Adam have already been working together on a seamless transition. Jeff has built a\nsolid finance team and under Adam's leadership, we believe that we are well positioned going\nforward. With that, I thank Jeff and I turn the call over to him to discuss our Q2 results.\nJeff Ishmael\nThank you, Bryan. I very much appreciate those kind comments. I'm pleased with the continued\nprogress that we've been making throughout the organization, as we continue our efforts to\nrecalibrate our spend and redistribute investment into the areas that we believe will fuel our\ngrowth and profitability, as well as continued improvement in both our net income and\nearnings per share and results for the second quarter.\nInComm Conferencing Page 8 of 17 www.incommconferencing.com\nWe are continuing our focus on the metrics of SaaS revenue. As we had previously discussed,\nwe have completed the rightsizing of pricing for our legacy accounts. We continue enforcing\ninternal disciplines on CPI increases, and we have continued signing on new customers at\nhigher rates than we have traditionally executed.\nWe remain encouraged by the improvement in our price per scan metric, as it continues to\nspeak to the testimony of the value realized by our new and existing customers. We are also\ncontinuing to maintain our focus on operating expenses to ensure that we achieve the expected\nreturn on investments in this area.\nWithin the second quarter period, we realized additional benefits of our 2023 restructuring\nefforts, which contributed to the subsequent improvement in our year-over-year net income\nresults.\nTurning now to our second quarter results. Revenue for the second quarter of 2024 decreased\n1% to $4,672,000, compared to $4,716,000 in the same period of 2023. Our SaaS revenue for\nthe second quarter of 2024 decreased 0.8% to $4,627,000, and $4,663,000 during the same\nperiod of 2023 and represented 99% of our second quarter revenue.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues was in line with our expectations at 90.5% for the\nsecond quarter of 2024, compared to 92.5% in the same period of 2023. The result is within our\npreviously discussed range of 90% to 91% and is reflective of our rearchitecture efforts, as we\nincurred planned overlap in our cloud expense fees.\nOur product team has demonstrated that they have been able to maintain reoccurring margins\nof over 90%, throughout the rearchitecture process. That being said, we will continue to\nscrutinize our cost structure with the goal to maintain or improve upon that level.\nOperating expenses, which consist of selling, general and administrative, marketing and\nresearch and development expenses decreased $770,000, or 17.3%, to $4,443,000 for the\nsecond quarter of 2024, compared to $5,213,000 for the same period of 2023. Included within\noperating expenses for the second quarter of 2024 and 2023 were $72,000 and $323,000,\nrespectively, of noncash equity compensation expense.\nWithin the second quarter, we recognized $781,000 in software capitalization tied to our\nrearchitecture efforts. While this is higher than our prior guidance, the product team was able\nto accelerate their rearchitecture efforts in the second quarter and complete the process they\nkicked off in the fourth quarter of 2023. The product team, which was supporting multiple\nimplementation projects, lean heavier on external consultants to complete the rearchitecture\nefforts, within their originally committed second quarter time frame.\nInComm Conferencing Page 9 of 17 www.incommconferencing.com\nOn a constant basis, adding back in our capitalized software expense, our operating expenses as\na percentage of revenues increased 128 basis points against the same period of 2023.\nTurning to net income and adjusted EBITDA. The company's net income improved by $726,000,\nor 83%, to a net loss of $127,000 for the second quarter of 2024, compared to a net loss of\n$853,000 for the same period of 2023.\nNet loss per diluted share for the second quarter of 2024 improved by $0.03 to a net loss of\n$0.01 per diluted share, compared to the net loss of $0.04 per diluted share for the same\nperiod of 2023. The weighted average diluted common shares were 19.5 million for the second\nquarter of 2024, compared to 19.1 million for the same period of 2023.\nAdjusted EBITDA, earnings before interest and other income, provision for income taxes, sales\ntax accruals, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense and certain\nnonrecurring charges decreased by $106,000, resulting in a loss of $70,000, compared to a gain\nof $36,000 for the same period of 2023.\nOur balance sheet remains strong. We finished the second quarter with $7.3 million in cash and\nshort-term investments. We also continue to ensure we are properly managing our cash\nreserves, which generated $88,000 in interest income during the second quarter versus an\nabsence of interest income in the same period of 2023.\nTurning now to the progress on our internal initiatives, 2024 continues to represent a year of\nexecution, as we will continue to pivot off our 2023 restructuring effort and deploy our spend\ninto meaningful marketing and brand initiatives that we believe will drive top line revenue.\nAs we have previously discussed, we have successfully executed on a material shift in our\nexpenses that we have taken previously allocated G&A spend and move that into support for\ntrade shows, regional conferences and other brand initiatives.\nAs Bryan discussed on our last call, quick strike efforts across the team have resulted in the\nattendance of six trade shows in the first half of 2024, with additional shows planned in the\nsecond half of the year.\nThis is a key call out as the company, outside of targeted meetings, did not have a physical\npresence at any trade show, since prior to COVID. While we have historically not segregated our\nsales and marketing expenses, this portion of our operating expenses are up 21% versus the\nprior year and comprised 34% of our total operating expenses versus 24% in the prior year.\nTurning to our R&D expenses, and as we have previously communicated, our R&D spend\ncontinued to decrease year-over-year during the second quarter, as we completed our\nrearchitecture efforts within the targeted second quarter time frame. As previously guided for\n2024, we expect our R&D will comprise no more than 18% to 20% of our operating expenses\nInComm Conferencing Page 10 of 17 www.incommconferencing.com\nmoving forward, which compares to approximately 30% during the 2020 to 2022 period, which\nwe then subsequently reduced to approximately 22% in 2023.\nThis change in spend composition has supported the rearchitecture of the product platform,\nwhich has been a 3-quarter focus of Jonathan and the product team, along with the bolstering\nof our data science efforts, which we expect will result in a higher level of service and reporting\nfor our customers.\nOverall, we expect to continue to see leverage increases in our OpEx spend against our\nanticipated growth in the latter half of 2024 and into 2025. While we have been significantly\nincreasing program spend on the sales and marketing side of the business to drive top line\nrevenues, we believe we are still properly structured in our headcount and expect a 2024 year-\nend headcount that will be approximately equal to the head count we finished with in 2022.\nWe believe that we now have a significantly higher caliber team that has the financial support\nand data analytics to drive the growth that we expect this brand should be able to achieve.\nAs mentioned in earlier remarks, we continue to stay focused on our cost structure, which\nwhen adjusted for previously mentioned software capitalization, continues to show improved\nleverage versus prior years. The result is consistent with our focus on bringing down our\noperating expenses as a percentage of revenues, which averaged 135% of our SaaS revenues\nduring the 2020 and 2022 period.\nWe remain committed to improving our adjusted EBITDA results for the year, a commitment\nwhich we exceeded last year and now puts us on a position to start moving our results into a\nmore positive position for 2024.\nAs discussed in our last call, improved adjusted EBITDA results for 2024 will be the combined\ndisciplines of executing on our revenue plans, ensuring consistency in our gross margins and\nholding all the team accountable to their FY '24 operating budgets.\nDuring the prior quarter, we also discussed the continued cultivation of partnerships and the\ndevelopment that was being done with recognized hardware companies, and I'm encouraged\nby the foundation that has been getting laid over the last three quarters, since the program was\ninitiated.\nSince the proper launch of the program in the fourth quarter, we have finalized agreements\nwith 21 partners and have another 10 scheduled to sign by the end of Q3.\nThis partner count is higher than we were originally targeting. So the key focus in the second\nhalf of the year will be fully activating these new partners and generating meaningful bookings\nand revenues to fuel growth in 2025. We have been actively cultivating new partners across\nInComm Conferencing Page 11 of 17 www.incommconferencing.com\nidentity access management platforms, hardware OEMs, as well as an expansion of our real\nestate and automotive partnerships, which Chris had originally started cultivating.\nIn consideration of our second half 2024 outlook, we expect to see continued gross margins of\napproximately 90% to 91%, while we continue to improve our architecture and data\nintelligence capabilities.\nWe also expect to see continued leverage in our operating expenses as a result of the expense\ninitiatives we implemented in 2023. As previously discussed, we expect the noncash\ncomponent of our spend to decrease by 400 to 500 basis points versus 2023 with 90% of that\nbeing total stock-based compensation.\nIn closing, I want to thank everyone on the Intellicheck team for allowing me the opportunity to\njoin them and providing the necessary support to make the meaningful changes we have over\nthe last two years, plus. I'm pleased that we've been able to leave Bryan and Adam a solid\nfinancial reporting and forecasting platform, an improved and healthy auditor relationship and\na remediation of open historical accounting issues that existed prior to my arrival.\nI'm confident that all the necessary support mechanisms are in place for Bryan and Adam to\nfocus on accelerating the growth opportunities that are available to this company. I look\nforward to listening to our Q3 results with all of you in November, hosted by Bryan and Adam.\nOperator\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If\nyou would like to ask a question, please press “*”, “1” on your telephone keypad, and a\nconfirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press “*”, “2” if you\nwould like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment,\nit may be necessary to pick up your handset, before pressing the star keys.\nThe first question comes from the line of Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please\nproceed.\nDaniel\nHey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. This is Daniel on for Jeff. Just on the retail, if we\ncould double-click on that and the headwinds there. Are you seeing the retail customers\ncoming back on actually use cases, a number of locations that they're deploying a solution? Or\nis this more just them seeing less volume and naturally having less account openings, less card-\nnot-present uses, etc.?\nBryan Lewis\nStops using the product or stop using it in any form that they used to use it before and\nunfortunately, the only time we're seeing that they're using it in less stores is because they're\nInComm Conferencing Page 12 of 17 www.incommconferencing.com\nclosing them. So we've got one of our--one of the retailers that comes to us through a bank is\ntalking about shutting down 300 stores.\nWe had one retailer, as we discussed, that comes directly to us, declared bankruptcy and is\nshutting down all of their stores. So there's a combination of that. And then I think just we're\nseeing less traffic in a way. Certainly, credit card debt is up huge. Delinquencies are up. So I\nthink part of it is just consumers are having problem with credit, and I don't think they're\nshopping as much, which shows in some of the retailers their earnings.\nSo no, nobody is not using it in any way that they used it before. Nobody is not using it in stores\nthat are open. It is really some economic factors, bankruptcies and downsizing of the retailers.\nDaniel\nMakes sense. And then just last quarter, you quantified that the retail volumes as being down, I\nbelieve, 10% year-over-year. Do you have that number this quarter?\nBryan Lewis\nYeah, overall, they're down about 16%, year-over-year. And it's a variation. Some--like I said,\nelectronics, electronics and sporting goods are up. And then everything else is down at varying\nlevels, depending on which particular vertical we're talking about. Apparel in department stores\nand home improvement are all slightly different but, for the most part, down.\nDaniel\nOkay. The quantification is super helpful. And then just last of all, how would you advise us\nthinking through modeling this going forward in terms of the retail decline and how you would\nthink about that playing into the next few quarters, relative to this one? Thanks.\nBryan Lewis\nLook, I think it's--in a way, it's hard to say because I think a lot of it is tied to however the\neconomy does. So I'm kind of looking at this is--what I'm excited about is if you think about it,\nour largest revenue sector is down 16%. But we're flat which, in my mind, shows that\ndiversifying into other sectors that aren't as dependent upon consumer credit really matters.\nAnd then again, the way I look at it is when the economy does turn around, thank you very\nmuch for the tailwind of retail picking up in addition to all of the new verticals that we're\ngetting into. And there's a lot of good verticals out there that we're getting into.\nI just--right before the call because we're starting to get in--we have some property\nmanagement and getting more, into more of it. But 93.3% of all residential property operators\nsaid that they had experienced fraud, and the National Apartment Association recommends\nstricter ID checks. This is probably why we're seeing inbound leads from that stuff.\nInComm Conferencing Page 13 of 17 www.incommconferencing.com\nSo, I think that the diversification is working. The economy is probably certainly a headwind\nwhen it comes to our big sector of retail. The economy turns around, I'm going to love that\ntailwind.\nDaniel\nThanks for taking my questions and best wishes for any future endeavors, Jeff.\nJeff Ishmael\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from the line of Rudy Kessinger with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed.\nAndres\nHey, this is Andres for Rudy. I guess, following up from the previous question, excluding the\nseasonal strength that we saw in Q4, stat revenue has been effectively flat since Q2 of last year.\nIf you could put a finer point of why is that. Is it primarily because of this kind of volume\ndeclines or the retailers? If you could break it down a little bit more, that would be helpful.\nBryan Lewis\nI mean, again, when we have our largest sector, right, and I'm going to go back to it that if we\nhadn't about a year ago, really started working with channel partners and getting into other\nsectors, we would have been down because retail was down so much. When again, the sector\nthat represents probably about 95% of our revenues, down 16%, that would not be good.\nBut we're flat basically because of the other sectors that we have been selling into that aren't\nso dependent upon consumer credit or somebody going into a store and doing an account\nlookup when buying merchandise on credit. So that is the story. It's that retail is off, our other\nsectors are a combination of up and also up at higher prices.\nAgain, new business sales are at significantly higher rates than our traditional long-term clients\nthat are--represent most of this retail. So understanding pricing power, understanding new\nmarkets is what's helping us drive growth.\nAnd then, quite frankly, when we get some of these large clients that we've been waiting for to\nget their resources available so that they can complete the implementation on their side for\nwhatever it is they need, internal compliance systems or other things like that.\nOnce they go, that’s sort of the hard part of, in a way, hunting whales. We've got a lot of singles\nand doubles that keep us growing, quarter-to-quarter, or filling in the hole sort of created by\nretail being off. But we're almost, with our whales, we're very much a step function kind of\nrevenue company. So that when a whale turns on, there's an immediate large lift. And we've\ngot some whales that have been waiting on their own internal resources to go live.\nInComm Conferencing Page 14 of 17 www.incommconferencing.com\nAnd now that some of these whales have told us that they've got the resources in place, I'm\nvery much looking forward to it, but it's just a matter of when, and we can't control that. As we\nsaid in the prepared remarks, we are, in a way, at the mercy of our clients running through their\nwhole QA processes and all that kind of stuff.\nSo, that's what I think the story is; diversification is working, pricing is working. New verticals\nare filling in for the retail vertical being off.\nJeff Ishmael\nBryan, if I can pop in for a second, I just want to clarify, unless I misheard that comment about\nSaaS revenues being flat over the last 4 quarters, that's actually not the case. When you take a\nlook going back at least to Q2 of last year, I mean, we had an average of 14% growth.\nI mean, this is the first quarter where we've actually shown a flat quarter, year-over-year. And\nas Bryan mentioned, primarily attributed to what's happening in the retail channel. But we\nwere in the teens in the mid of '23 and then getting into like 9% on Q1. But over those last four\nquarters, it was 14%. This is the first quarter that we've really seen the effect of what's\nhappening out in the retail.\nBryan Lewis\nYeah, thanks, Jeff.\nAndres\nYes. Just one more, if I may. Could you give us any sense of the SaaS revenue going forward for\nthe next two quarters? Any color that will help our models here, that will also be helpful.\nBryan Lewis\nWe’ve never given revenue guidance, if that's what you're looking for.\nAndres Miranda Lopez\nWell, yeah, I know, but I'm just looking for some color, given that you said before that SaaS\nrevenue will reaccelerate for the second half. Are you still expecting that reacceleration to\nhappen?\nBryan Lewis\nHere's what I said. I can't predict the economy, right? If we are in the same economic place with\nretail as we were last year, I'd say that things certainly would be accelerating. What I am saying\nis other market verticals, other than retail, are accelerating. It is now just a matter of can they\noffset what is going on in the retail world? And I'm far from an economist, so I can't say that.\nWhat I will say is, I know what we're doing in other verticals, I'm happy with it. I like the pricing\nbeing higher. We're new business, right, which I think is important to denote. Our new business\nInComm Conferencing Page 15 of 17 www.incommconferencing.com\nhigh prices continues to rise. We're selling more into different verticals that are--aren't as\ndependent on the consumer going in and buying a shirt, or whatever it is. I think the things that\nwe're looking at, background checks have to happen. Who are you when you're renting your\napartment? Has to happen. How do we protect your e-mail account? Has to happen, no matter\nwhat happens with the economy.\nSo, we're going to continue to focus on--certainly, we're not giving up on retail. That's going to\nbe--it's a great business for us, will continue to be. And we want to get as many retailers as we\ncan because we solve a good problem there.. But we're also going to be focusing on the rest of\nthe market so that we're not a one-trick pony when it comes to revenue.\nSo honestly, a lot depends on the economy. We are executing well on our strategy of going\nafter other verticals and, hopefully, it not only offsets but increases any loss of--increases the\nrevenue, even though we're losing some on retail.\nAndres\nSounds good. One quick, you said pricing was 11% up year-over-year. Is that right?\nBryan Lewis\nNo, the 11% number that was given out, I think Jeff talked about 10% year-over-year. The 11%\nwas new business average price per transaction from Q1 to Q2 of this year.\nAndres\nGot it. thank you.\nJeff Ishmael\nYeah, while we always look at the price activity within new business, existing business, what's\nhappening channel that--I'm always presenting at the number that I've always referenced over\nthe prior quarters has always been from a macro perspective. So we've never gone into the\ndetails of any one particular channel and price increases.\nAndres\nGot it. Thanks.\nOperator\nThank you. There are no further questions, at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Bryan\nLewis for closing remarks.\nBryan Lewis\nSo thanks, everybody, for joining us on the call, today. I hope you could tell from just the last\nquestion about the new verticals and everything about how excited I am about the new\nopportunities that we have for growth, I think diversification is an important part of our\nstrategy, and I think it shows that it's working.\nInComm Conferencing Page 16 of 17 www.incommconferencing.com\nThere are plenty of market verticals that we can get into because people do need to know who\nyou are. I always say that if I get your e-mail account, I can steal every account you have. Now\nagain, this whole thing with apartments. It's probably why we keep seeing inbound leads in that\narea. The market, I think, continues to grow for us.\nWe continue to enrich our products and our staff and all their capabilities, and I believe we'll\nremain an industry leader.

Following their prepared remarks, we will take questions from our\nanalysts and institutional investors.\nToday's call will be limited to one hour, and I will now turn the call over to Bryan.\nBryan Lewis\nThanks, Gar, and thank you all for joining us, today, for the Intellicheck Q1 2024 Earnings Call.\nOne of the areas Jeff and I have been emphasizing in previous calls and meetings is improved\nEBITDA, and we delivered on that objective with adjusted EBITDA positive results. last year.\nWe also continue to deliver on our trailing 12-month growth progression in SaaS revenues. each\nmonth. that saw improvement in both our Q1 adjusted EBITDA results and our net income and\nearnings per share results versus the prior year. Given our growth expectations and our margin\nstructure, we anticipate that we will end 2024 both net income and adjusted EBITDA positive.\nBefore I get into some of the wins and recap some highlights from the first quarter, I'm going to\nbegin with the evolving market for ID authentication.\nThe landscape of the market for identity verification is evolving against the backdrop of a\ngrowing sense of urgency that is being fueled by across the board incidents of identity theft and\nfraud. This has led to a significant new focus on security and the consumers' users experience\nas businesses in every market vertical are feeling the effect of identity theft and fraud.\nConsumers are sending a clear message to businesses of every size in every market vertical.\nThey want better protection. They do not want to be burdened with time-consuming, arduous\nprocesses to get that protection. and they will take their business elsewhere if they do not get\nwhat they want in a user-friendly process.\nInComm Conferencing Page 2 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nThis heightened concern across market sectors is being driven by the dramatic growth of\nincidents of identity fraud. The data is compelling. According to Javelin Research, identity thefts\nincreased 13% in 2023 with losses of $23 billion, impacting 15 million people.\nAccount takeover increased 15% to $13 billion and losses to businesses where this happens are\nlong term; 26% of people avoid merchants where their identity has been stolen and 20% close\ntheir account. We see this in every sector of the market.\nWhy is it so prevalent and increasing? because it's so easy to steal someone's identity. Data\nbreaches have led to more than 353 million people in the U.S. seeing their personally\nidentifiable information compromised.\nThe recent United Healthcare breach has brought up an estimated one third of all Americans.\nThe recent AT&T breach exposed 73 million people. This data does not cost much to buy on the\ndark web. The price tag is about $20. Fake ID is so good that even law enforcement officers say\nare virtually impossible to visually detect cost only $40 in bulk. So for about $60, someone can\nbecome you and can easily steal your identity. Again, we see it in every sector-loans, bank\naccounts, housing and social media.\nLooking at two of the market sectors where we are active should give you a good picture of why\nour products are so valuable.\nA significant number of real estate professionals in the U.S. reported they were faced with\nseller impersonation fraud challenges, and a number of these fraudulent efforts skyrocketed in\n2023. Seller impersonation fraud involves bad actors using publicly available records and\ninformation to pose as the legitimate owner of a property in an attempt to, illegally, sell it. Our\nclients in this space tell us incidence of this nature have emerged as the foremost cause for\nalarm in the industry.\nIn the automobile industry, concern over identity fraud, as well, due to surging incidents that\nhave had a direct bearing on dealership revenues and profits. An eLEND study based on\ninterviews with more than 700 dealerships found 79% of automotive dealerships had an\nidentity fraud related loss, last year. Sixty percent of those participating in the study reported\nthey had costly losses of at least three vehicles to identity fraud.\nI can continue, at length, given the pervasive nature of identity theft and fraud and the ever-\nincreasing reported incidence of credit card fraud, bank fraud, loan or lease fraud, employment\nfraud and phone and other utility fraud that further defines this spiraling problem, but these\ntwo examples highlight the increasing need for rapid, frictionless and accurate identity\nverification.\nInComm Conferencing Page 3 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nAs you will see from our efforts on several fronts, we intend to continue to capitalize on the\nneed for consumer engaging solutions with our distinctive affordable technology solutions that\ndefine and differentiate Intellicheck from other would-be solution providers.\nAs we have been discussing with you, an important part of our effort to build awareness of our\ntechnology solutions is our growing slate of marketing initiatives.\nOur new VP of Marketing, Christine Elson, is moving forward in collaboration with our SVP of\nSales, Chris Meyer, to develop new tools to support our sales team. In February, a new sales\npresentation rolled out that clarifies our messaging and highlights the Intellicheck difference.\nWe have also relaunched our website to further refine the messaging of our consumer-focused\napproach to identity validation.\nTogether, Chris and Christine are also working on a lead generation plan that emphasizes\nsecuring new accounts and expanding the relationship with existing clients. These initiatives will\nbuild on our foundation of sales support materials and initiatives, as Chris continues his efforts\nto enhance the sales team with seasoned sales professionals.\nAs we have said previously, we expect to continue to concentrate on recruiting new talent, as\nwe execute our plan for growth and market penetration, across key verticals.\nSales and marketing are also continuing to assess trans field opportunities that allow us to\nfurther invest our marketing funds to expand market awareness and our important market\nverticals.\nNext up is our participation at Innovate Spring. This annual trade show focuses on fintech\ninnovators, bringing together senior attendees that include representatives from more than\n600 banks. Our participation also includes a speaking presentation from me on May 21, as well\nas a 10-minute interview video, which will allow further reach into this meaningful market\nvertical demographic.\nGenevate will promote the video on their blog page, social media channels and stream link. We\nwill also be using our social media channels to promote Intellicheck's presence at the trade\nshow and a Genevate video. As we continue to expand our marketing investment and trade\nshow opportunities, we will be keeping you updated on our progress.\nAnother sales focused effort is our public private partnership program. As you saw in our recent\nannouncement of our partnership with the City of Clemson, South Carolina, we are continuing\nto replicate our successes in partnering with municipalities to address the problems that\nnegatively influence the economic health, quality of life and individual safety stemming from\nsophisticated fake IDs.\nInComm Conferencing Page 4 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nWe issued a press release and held a press conference with the Mayor, Chief of Police, the\nState Law Enforcement Division, Clemson University and members of the Economic Advisory\nCommittee and City Council member, as well as some of the participating business owners, to\nlaunch the latest new pilot program aimed at tackling the problem of underage drinking.\nWe are very pleased that every media outlet in the market attended the press conference on\nthe launch of the 12-month pilot program that is initially being underwritten by the city of\nClemson. Participating area businesses are now using the same Intellicheck technology solution\nthat is already being used by the city of Clemson Police Department and some area of\nbusinesses that are early adopters of our technology solutions.\nThe pilot program will allow 15 area bars, convenience stores, liquor stores and a local hotel to\nuse Intellicheck's identity verification mobile technology solution. I want to point out that the\npolice chief, Jorge Campos, appeared before the city council on more than one occasion and\nwas a leading proponent of the program because of the police department's overwhelmingly\npositive experience in using our technology.\nDuring the press conference, we also highlighted the often overlooked problem that also\nendangers young people when they purchase fake IDs, that goes beyond giving young people\naccess to alcohol. The personal information that photos young people provide to purchase\nthese high-tech fake IDs set them up for identity theft and fraud.\nFar too often, these young people suffer financial devastation, as fraudsters use that personally\nidentifiable information to open credit accounts, take out loans, purchase automobiles and real\nestate. The resulting defaults on payments victimize these unsuspecting kids who find out the\nhard way that their credit has been compromised and destroyed.\nSo far, the numbers demonstrate the seriousness of this problem. Just over 1% of ID scanned in\nClemson by participating businesses have been expired, often in older sibling giving their old ID\nto their younger sibling. Thirteen percent have been outright fakes. Think about that; about\n14% of the IDs checked were fake IDs to underage kids for using looking to purchase alcohol.\nAnd a final note on the press conference. Clemson police chief Campos pointed out what we\nknow to be true. It's not just a local problem, it's a statewide problem, and that problem is not\njust a South Carolina problem. This is why we are continuing our efforts to educate states as to\nthe scope of the problem and the need to support the adoption of effective solutions.\nAs you may remember, our first program of this nature was the pilot project with the City of\nCharleston, South Carolina. The pilot was supported by the city and Explore Charleston, the\nCharleston Area Convention and Visitors Bureau, allowing more than 30 downtown businesses\nto use Intellicheck's ID verification program in an effort to eliminate underage drinking and\nmake the central business district a safer place for students, residents and visitors.\nInComm Conferencing Page 5 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nWhat started the pilot program has proven to be so successful that the city has made this public\nprivate partnership with Intellicheck and downtown businesses a permanent program.\nGiven the success of both of these initiatives, we've been approached by foundations, lawyers\nand lobbyists to see what can be done to expand this program across the state of South\nCarolina. We've also been receiving inquiries from other cities in other states with similar\nissues.\nAnother important development represents a new client and with them a new opportunity to\nreach educational institutions with an application for our technology that goes beyond\npreventing young people from using fake IDs to access age-restricted products like alcohol.\nWe have just signed a university that will be using Intellicheck's technology to tackle financial\naid fraud.\nAs we discussed last call, we're beginning to move to a model that has customers commit to a\nset monthly minimum versus buying a bucket of transactions. And again, as we said, this will\nhelp us to be able to give you more concrete numbers, including ACV signed. This is one of the\nfirst new clients signed under this new pricing model. As we sign more clients under this model,\nour plan is to begin to provide those stats.\nIn this use case, bad actors present themselves as would be students in need of student loans\nto be able to obtain their education. Once the funds are awarded, these sponsors disappear\nand with them, precious financial resources. This is what we intend to stop.\nRecent data from California community colleges underscores the magnitude of the problem for\nfederal Pell Grants, alone. A California Community College Chancellor's office study stated that\nan alarming 25% of applications were fraudulent. This problem, they reported, also extends to\nstate and local aid. This is a developing market opportunity that we look forward to continuing\nto explore to drive adoption of our technology.\nWe have a pilot program that is starting, this month, with a technology-enabled consumer\ncredit program that services underserved customers for its clients, both in-store and online.\nThis flexible technology platform provides a loan decision to consumers within seconds across\nmultiple market and verticals, including automotive, health care and credit card applications.\nOur ID verification solutions fit well into this decisioning platform.\nWe're also looking to gain share in the lease-to-own space. In Q1, we signed a top three lease-\nto-own provider who is starting a pilot, this month. This omnichannel platform company is\ncommitted to elevating financial opportunities for customers through innovative, inclusive and\ntechnology-driven financial solutions that address the evolving needs and aspirations of\nconsumers.\nInComm Conferencing Page 6 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nAs we turn to our updates on other programs, I'm pleased to report that Financial Services\nCompany #2, one of our largest clients in the retail credit card space, is bringing live a retailer\nthey just brought on board. The retail is a prominent luxury department store chain with\napproximately 100 locations. It is reassuring to see one of our top accounts continue to bring us\nnew clients. This is yet one more validation of the strength of this partnership and their\nunderstanding of the value we contribute.\nFinancial services company #3, to whom we sold the hardware for their teller workstations a\nfew years ago, remains on target for new branch use cases. We expect they will start generating\nincremental revenue within the next 100 days. Additionally, their 2,200 location home, garden\nand farm chain is still anticipated to go live, by the end of the year.\nAnother new use case is one that we believe could hold strong promise, going forward. The\nfocus on this use case is for unintended liquor sales in hotels. A growing number of hotels have\nexpanded the availability of liquor sales to include key card controlled entry into an area where\nalcoholic beverages are made available to hotel guests.\nYoung people are using the room key card to gain access to the alcoholic beverages in what\nhotels thought would be secure rooms. In this third-party application, a hotel group received\ntheir production keys last week and will be starting a pilot program, shortly.\nWe are also seeing progress with the international social media company that we signed, a few\nyears ago. This client is now doing ID verification in multiple countries, and they are soon\nlaunching a project that have all of their U.S. e-mail users re-authenticate themselves, over the\ncourse of two to three months. Although e-mail is not their primary business, we believe this\nonetime project serves to further our partnership and demonstrate the many ways Intellicheck\ncan provide valuable solutions to their needs.\nIn another use case, we are eagerly anticipating next week's go live to the wire fraud company\nwe spoke of on the last call. Wire fraud continues to be a significant concern amongst\nconsumers with devastating consequences to those who become victims of this rapidly growing\ncrime. This client will be using our technology to authenticate users in a wire transfer.\nWe are also seeing growth trajectory for our regional banks, as they continue to grow with a\n1,200 location bank customer looking to negotiate a longer-term contract that we anticipate\nwill close in the third quarter. In addition, the larger of our regional bank customers has\nlaunched the second of several use cases that now allows customers to start an application\nfrom their web browser. Previously it had to be started from a mobile device. The web browser\nuse case has significantly higher volumes than the mobile use case.\nLater this month, we will look to be up and running with the first ID and credential verification\napp that is designed, specifically, for transport and logistics drivers. This is yet another exciting\nInComm Conferencing Page 7 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nnew application and fits into our vision of confirming that a person you are dealing with is, in\nfact, who they say they are.\nThings are also going well with our real estate platform clients. The software provider we spoke\nabout earlier is beginning their rollout later this week, and they intend to have us fully\nintegrated into their new infrastructure, later this month. As I spoke about earlier, the real\nestate industry had significant issues with fraud, and we want to be there to help prevent it\nwith this very important vertical.\nIn closing, on this partial pipeline update, the top three bank we have spoken of in the past\ncontinues to indicate they will be up and running with their digital use cases in the fourth\nquarter of this year. As you have seen, we remain alert to how long these things tend to take\nwhen working with a very large institution, and we've continued to keep you posted. We\nbelieve this would be a significant revenue generator for 2025 and beyond and upon full\nimplementation, will be a top five customer.\nI will now turn the call over to Jeff for further discussion about our Q1 results.\nJeff Ishmael\nThank you, Bryan. I'm pleased with the continued progress we've been making throughout the\norganization as we continue our efforts to recalibrate our spend and redistribute investment\ninto the areas that we believe will fuel our growth and profitability.\nOur first quarter revenues were 10% higher versus the prior year. We continue to report a\nhigher average price per scan versus the prior year, and we continue to improve both our\nadjusted EBITDA results for the first quarter and our net income and earnings per share versus\nthe prior year.\nAs Bryan mentioned earlier, we're pleased to see the continued trailing 12-month growth\nprogression in SaaS revenues each month, which we have achieved since we introduced this\nmetric in January of 2020.\nContinuing to cast a critical eye to the metrics of our SaaS revenue, it's encouraging to see an\n18% increase in our average price per scan versus the prior year, as we have largely completed\nrightsizing the pricing of our legacy accounts and force internal disciplines on CPI increases and\nsign new customers at higher rates than we have traditionally executed. We continue to be\nencouraged by the improvement in this metric, as it continues to speak to the testament of\nvalue realized by our new and existing customers.\nWe are also continuing to maintain our focus on our operating expenses to ensure that we\nachieve the expected return on our investments in this area.\nInComm Conferencing Page 8 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nWithin the Q1 period, we continued to realize the benefits of our 2023 restructuring efforts and\nthe subsequent improvement in our year-over-year adjusted EBITDA results.\nTurning now to our first quarter results. Revenue for the first quarter of 2024 increased 10% to\n$4,680,000, compared to $4,254,000 in the same period of 2022. Our SaaS revenue for the first\nquarter of 2024 grew 9% to $4,608,000 from $4,228,000 during the same period of 2023 and\nrepresented 98% of our first quarter revenue.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues was in line with our expectations at 90.7% for the first\nquarter of 2024, compared to 92.2% for the same period of 2023. The nominal decrease is\nwithin our previously discussed range of 90% to 91% and is reflective of our continued\nrearchitecture efforts, as we incur planned overlap in our cloud expense fees.\nOur product team has demonstrated that we can maintain reoccurring margins of over 90%, as\nthe rearchitecture progresses. That being said, we'll continue to scrutinize our cost structure\nwith the goal to maintain or improve upon that level.\nOperating expenses, which consist of selling, general and administrative, marketing and\nresearch and development expenses decreased $531,000, or 10% to $4,770,000 for the first\nquarter of 2024 compared to $5,301,000 for the same period of 2023. We included within\noperating expenses for the first quarter of 2024 and 2023 with $334,000 and $682,000,\nrespectively, of noncash equity compensation expense.\nWithin the first quarter, we recognized $609,000 in software capitalization tied to our\nrearchitecture efforts. While this was higher than our prior guidance, we still showed\ntremendous progress. Leveraging our operating expenses against revenues, driven by the\nproduct team supporting multiple implementation projects, as well as tight expense controls,\nwe leaned heavier on external consultants to accelerate our rearchitecture efforts.\nOn a constant basis, adding back in our capitalized software expenses, our operating expenses\nas a percentage of revenues decreased a full 810 basis points against the same period of 2023,\nresulting in $379,000 in leverage improvement.\nAs discussed on our last call, we expect our total noncash expenses will continue to decrease\nand comprise approximately 10% of our operating expenses with stock-based compensation\ncomprising 90% of that figure. This compares to our prior historical trend of 13% to 15%.\nTurning to net income and adjusted EBITDA. The company's net income improved by $945,000\nto a net loss of $442,000 for the first quarter of 2024, compared to a net loss of $1,387,000 for\nthe same period of 2023. Net loss per diluted share for the first quarter of 2024 improved by\n$0.05 to a net loss of $0.02 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $0.07 per diluted share\nfor the same period of 2023.\nInComm Conferencing Page 9 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nThe weighted average diluted common shares were 19.4 million for the first quarter of 2024,\ncompared to 19.2 million for the same period of 2023.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2024 increased by $441,000, or 79%, resulting in a net\nloss of $117,000, compared to a net loss of $558,000 for the same period of 2023.\nOur balance sheet remains strong, and we finished the first quarter with $9.2 million in cash\nand short-term investments. We also continue to ensure we are properly managing our cash\nreserves, which generated $69,000 in interest income during the first quarter versus $3,000 in\nthe same period of 2023.\nTurning now to the progress on our internal initiatives, 2024 represents a year of execution, as\nwe will continue to pivot off our 2023 restructuring effort and deploy our spend into\nmeaningful marketing and brand initiatives that we believe will drive top line revenue.\nAs we have previously discussed, we are executing on a material shift in our expenses where we\nhave taken previously allocated G&A spend and moved that into support for trade shows,\nregional conferences and other brand initiatives.\nWith the hire of Christine Nelson as our VP of Marketing in January, it took her only a handful of\nweeks to start implementing a 2024 blueprint for targeted trade shows. As Bryan discussed,\nthrough quick strike efforts across the team, we managed to attend two trade shows in the first\nquarter, and we have four more trade shows in the calendar for the second quarter.\nThis is a key call out as a company, outside of targeted meetings, did not have a physical\npresence at any trade show since prior to COVID. Planning efforts by the team have our sales\ndepartment attending a number of key events in the second half of the year, as well.\nTurning to our R&D expenses. We are expecting our R&D expense to continue to decrease,\nyear-over-year, during the second quarter, as we continue the capitalization of our\nrearchitecture efforts. For 2024, we expect our R&D will comprise no more than 18% to 20% of\nour operating expenses moving forward, which compares to approximately 30%, during the\n2020 and 2022 period which then, subsequently, reduced to approximately 22% in 2023.\nThis change in spend composition is not resulting in a compromised product platform, the one\nthat is stronger through the rearchitecture efforts of Jonathan and the product team, as well as\nthe bolstering of our data science efforts, which we believe will result in a higher level of service\nand reporting for our customers.\nOverall, we expect to continue seeing significant leverage increases in our OpEx spend against\nour anticipated growth in 2024, while we are significantly increasing program spend on the\nsales and marketing side of the business to drive top line revenues.\nInComm Conferencing Page 10 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nWe believe we are properly structured in our head count and expect a 2024 year-end head\ncount that will be approximately equal to the head count we finished with in 2022. We believe\nthat we now have a significantly higher caliber team that has the financial support and data\nanalytics to drive the growth that we expect this brand should be able to achieve.\nAs mentioned in the earlier remarks, we continue to improve our cost structure which, when\nadjusted for the previously mentioned software capitalization, decreased by 810 basis points as\na percentage of revenues versus the same period of 2023, while revenue increased 10%. This\nresult is consistent with our focus on bringing down our operating expenses as a percentage of\nrevenues, which averaged 135% of our SaaS revenues during the 2020 to 2022 period.\nWe remain committed to improving our adjusted EBITDA results for the year, a commitment\nwhich we exceeded last year and now puts us in a position to start moving our results into a\nmore positive position for 2024. As discussed on our last call, improved adjusted EBITDA results\nfor 2024 will be combined--will be the combined discipline of executing on our revenue plans,\nensuring consistency in our gross margins and holding all the team accountable to their 2024\noperating budgets.\nDuring the prior quarter, we also discussed the early efforts regarding the formalization of our\nchannel partner program, and I'm happy with the results that we are seeing. Since the\nbeginning of the year, we have finalized agreements with eight partners and are close to signing\non the ninth. In parallel with bringing these new partners on board, we are walking our first\ndeals through the portal registration process and working through deal registration acceptance.\nThese new partners include identity access management platforms, hardware OEMs, as well as\nan expansion of our real estate and automotive partnerships, which Chris had originally started\ncultivating.\nDavid is aggressively working for the partnerships with recognized hardware companies to\nincrease our technology partner ecosystem. With a little tailwind, it's not unreasonable to think\nthat our current partner count can double, by fall. Once the channel partner foundation is built,\nDavid will fully focus his efforts on deal registration, pipeline growth and achieving its bookings\nquota for 2024 that will drive future growth.\nIn consideration to our 2024 outlook, we expect to see gross margins of approximately 90% to\n91%, while we continue to improve our architecture and data intelligence capabilities. We also\nexpect to see continued leverage in our operating expenses as a result of the expense initiatives\nwe implemented in 2023.\nAs previously discussed, we expect the noncash component of our spend to decrease by 400 to\n500 basis points versus 2023, with 90% of that being total stock-based compensation.\nInComm Conferencing Page 11 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nIn closing, we remain committed to the continued improvement of our corporate performance,\nmaintaining our strong balance sheet and driving shareholder value. We look forward to\nsharing our Q2 results with you in August.\nI'll now turn the call back to Bryan for closing remarks.\nBryan Lewis\nAs we approach the midway point of 2024, we believe there is opportunity for growth on\nmultiple fronts, including existing customers, new customers and with additional use cases.\nWhat we anticipate will prove to be one of our largest customers who had expected to go live\nin April has pushed back on their timing. The delay is for good reason. We have made the\ndecision to integrate Intellicheck's technology into other internal systems as well, before going\nlive with us. We anticipate having additional color on this large opportunity over the next few\nmonths.\nIn closing, I would like to point out what continues to distinguish Intellicheck from other would-\nbe identity verification solution providers.\nWe believe our easy-to-use, accurate and consumer-focused identity platform provides quick\nand easy onboarding and the immediate elimination of fraud better than any other. As new\nverticals and new use cases seem to sprout up each quarter, they may be new verticals, but the\nclients come to us for the same reason.\nThey need to stop someone from using another person’s stolen personally identifiable\ninformation, whether that be for financial gain or to gain access to something they shouldn't.\nOur products are easy to integrate, easy to use and stop all of the above.\nOperator, you can open up the call for questions.\nOperator\nThank you.

This is Daniel on for Jeff Van Rhee. Just on the\nretailer behavior during the quarter, the last quarter, there has been significant discussion to\nsome of your larger retailers had volumes down, I think about year-over-year, some of them.\nAnd for some of them, you were seeing some declines steepening into Q1. What do you think\norder here in Q1? And what are you, so far, leading into Q2?\nBryan Lewis\nSo, I'd say they're coming back a little. Again, just like last time, there are some retailers,\ndepends on, I think, who they are, what their strategy is and how they're executing. We've got\nsome retailers who are up and then some who are down. I tend to look at the same group of\nlarge retailers each quarter, so I know that I'm looking at the same numbers. And they're off\nabout 10% in Q1, compared to Q1 of last year. But again, that's because I think some of the\nretailers who you'll read about it, right, they're having their own internal issues, having\nmanagement changes, moving things around or off more than some of the other retailers who I\nthink are doing quite well and are up, significantly. It's just--it depends on the size of the\nretailer.\nSo overall, about 10% off. Again, one of the reasons that we are looking to move into other\nverticals. But I also said the other thing is I'm not so worried about retail because it will come\nback; it always does. And the other thing is it allows us--as we start to think about where we\nwant to go as a company and think about the amount of data that we see and the relying parts\nthat we have, where we are located, I think that we're probably in more locations with more\ndata than anybody else who’s really trying to get into the identity space in North America.\nSo to me, having those retailers gives us access to the data that our customers find value and\nwe think will provide lots of value as, hopefully, we can create the consortium that we've been\ntalking about with our current customers to pool data and provide more information back to\nthose customers .\nDaniel Hibshman\nAnd then just on the price per scan, that was quite strong this quarter. I think you said 18% up\nyear-over-year this quarter, I think it was 16% last quarter. So an uptick there. I think we've\nbeen talking for a long time now about nearing the completion of the migration from legacy\npricing. And it seems to be continue to see--even though that's been discussed for a long time,\nhow do you expect pricing to ramp through the year?\nDo you think you can see similar levels of appreciation through the year? Should we be\nexpecting deceleration there? And just maybe a little bit of color on why the transition has gone\non so long, and if there's--if there's any more customers to move on that.\nBryan Lewis\nWell, I think the mistake that people are thinking is that the change in price is purely a change\nin price at renewal and price increases there, right? You can look at it two ways. There's, at\nInComm Conferencing Page 13 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nrenewal, we raise your price. There's also new clients coming on board at higher prices than\nprevious. So that is something that will make those part of the increase, right, 18% up.\nPart of that is we are bringing on all new clients at higher rates than the historical average. So I\nthink we've got--we're learning more. We're getting into different markets where the stakes are\nmuch higher and people are willing to pay more for the product. So while I can’t guarantee it’ll\ncontinue running at 18%, I do believe that we will continue to see prices higher than the\nhistorical average.\nDaniel Hibshman\nThanks for that, that's helpful. And then just last for me, just real quick on the modeling. On the\nR&D, up a decent chunk this quarter in the 600K of cloud migrations, or 600K of software\ncapitalization. I take it that's all in relation to the cloud migration, and we should model that\nticking back down, or is that investment in other areas?\nJeff Ishmael\nNo. That's all, Daniel. That's all tied to the rearchitecture of the platform, which part of that\ndoes involve going cloud agnostic, but there's a much broader rearchitecture play in place. I\nthink what you can probably model going into Q2 is mid-range between what we saw in Q4 and\nthen in Q1.\nSo you're probably going to be in the range of about 500. We saw a lot of customer interaction\nwith the product team during the Q1 period. So that drove the loss up a little higher; it’s related\nto outside contractors. But we should be close to substantially done by the end of Q2, but we'll\nhave more info on the Q2 call.\nDaniel Hibshman\nThat’s it, thanks for taking my questions.\nBryan Lewis\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next questions comes from the line of Scott Buck with H.C. Wainwright. Please\nproceed with your questions.\nScott Buck\nHey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm curious on the channel partner\nagreements. What do you guys anticipate being the ramp there in terms of educating those\npartners and then getting them up to speed on the product? I mean should we expect kind of a\n6-month maturity schedule, or how do you think about it?\nBryan Lewis\nInComm Conferencing Page 14 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nYeah, I think it takes a while to get them up and running. If you think about it, it's like training\nnew salespeople, but it also depends on the vertical. So, I'd say, somebody who is a hardware\nprovider who understands that we'd be a great add on, that's going to be much longer than,\nsay, somebody who is in, say, the automotive space who understands they know that you need\nto figure out who people are. They already have things that--part of what you need to do is get\na photo copy of a driver's license.\nSo, it's a simpler change for them to understand how to do it and what to do, and of course, the\nowner of the dealership not wanting to lose money. I think that's a simpler ramp. So I would\nsay, honestly, it depends on the vertical, but we had always anticipated that starting this\nchannel program would be something that would be a late 2024, but really a 2025 revenue\ninitiative.\nScott Buck\nGreat. I appreciate that, Bryan. And then I wanted to ask you about the private-public\npartnerships. The pricing the same there versus your kind of legacy commercial customers, or\nare you giving the public a bit of a break?\nBryan Lewis\nI'd say age restricted, in general, is at a different price point than other things where losses are\nhuge. But we do work with the municipalities and things in the cities because it's basically a\nbulk order, if you will.\nSo to make that work, we will work with the town to get the pricing right for what they want to\ndo. So, part of what we look at is we think we're doing a public good. I'd say that the cities\nagree, and we think that's a just and right thing to do. So the pricing is a little bit lower than if\nwe were just selling things one-off.\nScott Buck\nGreat. And the sales cycle on those, I mean, similar to what you see in the other industries\nyou're working with or slower, given that there's a government component of it?\nBryan Lewis\nI'd say that once you get the right people on board, it happens very quickly. You get a few of the\nbusinesses, you get one of the local legislators involved. And generally, the police department is\nall over it; they see the benefit. Once you get that going, it usually goes pretty quick.\nScott Buck\nYeah-no, that makes sense. Appreciate the time, guys, thank you.\nBryan Lewis\nThank you.\nInComm Conferencing Page 15 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rudy Kessinger with D.A. Davidson. Please\nproceed with your questions.\nRudy Kessinger\nHey, thanks for taking my questions, guys. I believe, last quarter, you said you were planning on\ngiving annual guidance, this quarter. And you gave--I mean, Jeff, you--a ton of modeling points,\nexcept for on revenue. And so, I know you also said last quarter you expected SaaS revenue\ngrowth to accelerate throughout the year. I guess, just what kind of color can you give us for Q2\nor the full year revenue. Should we still be thinking SaaS revenue growth accelerates on a year-\nover-year basis in Q2 versus Q1? I know, Bryan, you talked about a large customer delaying\nfrom an April launch. But what color can you give us on the revenue side?\nBryan Lewis\nWe still expect SaaS revenue to accelerate throughout the year. As I said, if that customer had\nstarted, I think it would have been easier to give more color, which we expect to do next time\naround. Absolutely no reason to think that that customer is not going to go live, but that would\nbe a substantial customer.\nSo again, nothing really changed in our mindset of SaaS revenue accelerating throughout the\nyear. It's just the timing of it a little bit delayed. But still, we're very confident that we will be\nnet income and EBITDA positive at year-end.\nRudy Kessinger\nOkay. And on the customer who's delayed, you said what you anticipate will prove to be one of\nyour largest customers. What vertical is that? Is that--I know you called out the new top three\ncustomer last quarter, but you said they weren't going to go live until Q4 this year, so it doesn't\nsound like it's them. But is that a large bank? Is it a customer in another vertical, can you share\nsome more about who that is?\nBryan Lewis\nYeah, it’s a nonfinancial vertical that needs to be able to--very important that they authenticate\npeople and know who they are. There is also very, very strong NDA in place that we can't really\ntalk about who they are and what they are.\nRudy Kessinger\nOkay. Fair enough. And I guess, if you just look at Q1, you gave the guidance range of $4.3\nmillion to $4.4 million, pretty late in the quarter. Just what drove the couple of hundred\nthousand of upside in revenue. Was it better than expected scan volumes with some of those\nretailers who are struggling? It sounds like the year-over-year compare improve there. Or was it\nnew projects that came that went live at the end of the quarter?\nInComm Conferencing Page 16 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nJeff Ishmael\nYeah, Rudy, at the time we tabled our Q1 guidance, we were anticipating some headwind on\nsome credit memos. Then they simply didn't materialize and impact the quarter, as I\nanticipated. That expected impact is also not just being pushed into next quarter, it just didn't\nmaterialize. So hence, coming in higher than our prior guidance.\nRudy Kessinger\nYeah, okay, got it. Great, that’s it for me. Thank you, guys.\nBryan Lewis\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Grondahl with Northland Securities.\nPlease proceed with your questions.\nLuke\nYeah, hey, guys. This is Luke on for Mike. Just want to touch on--you guys mentioned a bunch of\nnew wins, some new use cases. It seems like every quarter, there seems to be another one\npopping up. Just wanted to kind of see where the sort of main focus is by vertical, if there's one\nor two or three where you guys are really looking to pour some gas on.\nBryan Lewis\nI guess what we focus on is where is there real pain, and that generally ties into either\nmonetary or reputational loss. So those are the verticals we look at. So that's everything from\nanything that has to do with banking, credit, social media, those types of things are where\npeople really care.\nThe others are things that where people come to us. And if that's the case, and it's easy and it\nworks, obviously, we're going to take the sale. But I think that we win where people want to\nmake sure that you are who you say you are.\nCertainly, you've seen plenty enough of potential customers who I don't think really want to\nknow because it costs them revenue. We are targeting the sectors where not using a very\naccurate tool will cause you to have massive, again, financial or reputational loss. So, that's\nreally our focus.\nLuke\nOkay, got it. And then are new sales hires that are coming in, are these guys vertical specific,\nlike when they get hired, as they're tied to a specific vertical? Or are they kind of covering a\ncouple different, or how is their focus?\nInComm Conferencing Page 17 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com\nBryan Lewis\nIt kind of depends. We're definitely hiring people who know the identity space. So that means\nthey've been working for our competitors or something. So oftentimes, they come in knowing a\nsector, so that makes sense to put them on that. We hired two new salespeople; we exited one.\nThe two people that we hired, again, come from this space. So obviously, they want to be able\nto jump on areas that they know well and know how to sell into.\nBut again, given that it seems like every time we turn around, we're finding another one of\nthose sectors that's again, financial loss or reputational loss, it's really important. They see what\nwe do, know how we are different than where they used to work, and they're eager to go hit\nwherever they can.\nLuke\nOkay, got it. Well, thanks for taking the questions, guys, and congrats on the quarter.\nBryan Lewis\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the\ncall back over to Bryan Lewis for closing remarks.\nBryan Lewis\nSo I just want to thank you all for attending the call. We are still super confident about what we\ndo, happy with the trajectory that we are on. And I very much look forward to speaking to you\nall again in August. So thank you all, and have a great night.\nOperator\nAnd this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank\nyou for your participation.\nInComm Conferencing Page 18 of 18 www.incommconferencing.com"
