(NASDAQ: ARWR) today announced financial results for its 2024 fiscal year ended September 30, 2024. The Company is hosting a conference call today, November 26, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss the results. \n\n“Arrowhead is well positioned, both individually and with partners, to advance and ultimately commercialize important new medicines using our proprietary TRiM™ technology. We have the potential to impact the lives of millions of patients in need. We believe we now have all the necessary pieces in place to drive significant value for shareholders in the short-term, mid-term, and, more importantly, over the long-term as we seek to build a sustainable, financially sound business,” said Christopher Anzalone, Ph.D., President and CEO at Arrowhead. “Key events have occurred during the recent period that we see as potentially transformational for Arrowhead. Earlier this month, we submitted our first NDA to the U.S. FDA for investigational plozasiran, paving the way for Arrowhead to potentially launch our first commercial product in 2025, subject to FDA review and approval. We also took steps to meaningfully strengthen our balance sheet, including entering into a large licensing and collaboration agreement with Sarepta Therapeutics, which was announced today. Sarepta is an important new partner with extensive clinical, regulatory, and commercial expertise and this collaboration will help us advance and commercialize multiple promising Arrowhead-discovered drug candidates that fall outside of our current commercial focus on the cardiometabolic therapeutic area.” \n\n**Selected Recent Financial Events**\n\n  * Strengthened the balance sheet through a strategic financing agreement and licensing and collaboration agreement. We estimate that together, these transactions extend Arrowhead’s cash runway into 2028 and potentially through multiple new drug launches, including wholly owned and partnered programs. These two events were: \n    * Signed a licensing and collaboration agreement with Sarepta Therapeutics. Upon closing, Arrowhead will receive $825 million, consisting of $500 million cash and $325 million as an equity investment priced at $27.2507, representing a 35% premium to the 30-day volume weighted average price. Arrowhead also receives $250 million to be paid over five years and is eligible to receive an additional $300 million in near-term payments. Arrowhead is also eligible to receive royalties on commercial sales and approximately $10 billion in potential milestone payments. \n    * Closed a strategic financing agreement with Sixth Street for significant, long-term, non-dilutive capital. The $500 million senior secured credit facility includes $400 million funded at close with an additional $100 million available at Arrowhead’s option, subject to mutual agreement between Sixth Street and Arrowhead, during the seven-year term of the agreement. \n\n\n\n**Selected Recent R &D Events**\n\n  * Submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for investigational plozasiran for the treatment of familial chylomicronemia syndrome, a severe and rare genetic disease which currently has no FDA approved treatments. \n  * Received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for investigational plozasiran as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglycerides in adults with familial chylomicronemia syndrome. \n  * Announced new results from the Phase 3 PALISADE study and the open-label extension from the Phase 2 MUIR and SHASTA-2 studies of investigational plozasiran. These data were presented in two oral presentations at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2024 (AHA24) and PALISADE data was simultaneously published in the AHA journal, [_Circulation_](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ahajournals.org%2Fdoi%2F10.1161%2FCIRCULATIONAHA.124.072860&esheet=54158592&newsitemid=20241126683832&lan=en-US&anchor=Circulation&index=1&md5=b5311c72bf2bae3c83c4abc504b6a9f6). Key results include the following: \n    * Plozasiran induced deep and sustained reductions in triglycerides and impacted a wide spectrum of lipoproteins that may be involved with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease \n    * Similar responses were observed in patients with genetically confirmed and clinically diagnosed familial chylomicronemia syndrome \n    * Mean reductions in triglycerides of up to -73% in patients from MUIR and -86% in patients from SHASTA-2 with favorable reductions in remnant cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol were observed through 15 months follow up in the open-label extension \n    * Overall, plozasiran has been generally well-tolerated to date. In the PALISADE study, the most frequently reported treatment emergent adverse events for the 25 mg dose were abdominal pain, COVID-19, nasopharyngitis, and nausea. Across clinical studies and study populations, the most frequently reported treatment emergent adverse events for the 25 mg dose were COVID-19, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and abdominal pain. \n  * Initiated pivotal Phase 3 SHASTA-3 and SHASTA-4 studies of plozasiran in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. \n  * Launched a new disease awareness campaign, ‘We’ll Get There Soon,’ to inspire hope for the rare disease community affected by familial chylomicronemia syndrome. \n  * Presented data from the Phase 3 PALISADE study of plozasiran in a late-breaking oral presentation at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress 2024 and simultaneously published in [The New England Journal of Medicine](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fstoken%2Fdefault%2Bdomain%2FREPRINTS_36489%2Ffull%3FredirectUri%3D%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa2409368&esheet=54158592&newsitemid=20241126683832&lan=en-US&anchor=The+New+England+Journal+of+Medicine&index=2&md5=296e2cb13bed3733575e13f698f8ab74). \n  * Arrowhead’s Verona, WI manufacturing and testing facility successfully completed requirements to manufacture GMP drug substance to support clinical trials conducted in the United States and many other countries abroad, and recently successfully completed a Qualified Person (QP) audit, which allows for internally produced drug substance to be used in support of clinical programs in EU countries and the United Kingdom. \n  * Filed for regulatory clearance in New Zealand to initiate a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of ARO-INHBE, the company’s investigational RNAi therapeutic being developed as a potential treatment for obesity. \n    * In preclinical studies ARO-INHBE reduced body weight and fat mass with a novel mechanism of action that may preserve lean muscle mass compared to currently approved obesity therapies. \n  * Completed the 2024 Summer Series of R&D webinars, each highlighting a specific therapeutic area in Arrowhead’s pipeline, including the following events: \n    * May 23, 2024 – Muscular \n    * June 25, 2024 – Cardiometabolic \n    * July 16, 2024 – Pulmonary \n    * August 14, 2024 – Obesity/Metabolic \n    * September 25, 2024 – Central Nervous System \n\n\n\n**Selected Fiscal 2024 Year End Financial Results**\n\n**ARROWHEAD PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

APOC3 increases triglyceride levels in the blood by inhibiting breakdown of TRLs by lipoprotein lipase and uptake of TRL remnants by hepatic receptors in the liver. The goal of treatment with plozasiran is to reduce the level of APOC3, thereby reducing triglycerides and restoring lipids to more normal levels. \n\nIn multiple clinical studies, investigational plozasiran has demonstrated reductions in triglycerides and multiple atherogenic lipoproteins in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), severe hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG), and mixed hyperlipidemia. Plozasiran has been generally well tolerated to date with treatment emergent adverse events reported that generally reflect the comorbidities and underlying conditions of the study populations. Across clinical studies and study populations, the most frequently reported treatment emergent adverse events for the 25 mg dose were COVID-19, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and abdominal pain. \n\nPlozasiran is being investigated in the SUMMIT program of clinical studies, including the PALISADE Phase 3 study in patients with FCS, the SHASTA studies in patients with SHTG, and the MUIR and CAPITAN studies in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia. \n\nPlozasiran in the treatment of patients with FCS has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation, Orphan Drug Designation, and Fast Track Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Orphan Drug Designation by the European Medicines Agency. Investigational plozasiran has not been reviewed or approved to treat any disease. \n\n**About Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals**\n\nArrowhead Pharmaceuticals develops medicines that treat intractable diseases by silencing the genes that cause them. Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, Arrowhead therapies trigger the RNA interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep, and durable knockdown of target genes. RNA interference, or RNAi, is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. Arrowhead’s RNAi-based therapeutics leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing. \n\nFor more information, please visit [www.arrowheadpharma.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.arrowheadpharma.com%2F&esheet=54158592&newsitemid=20241126683832&lan=en-US&anchor=www.arrowheadpharma.com&index=5&md5=86bd36fa0b169445c3c5ca24c5888e09), or follow us on X (formerly Twitter) at [@ArrowheadPharma](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.twitter.com%2Farrowheadpharma&esheet=54158592&newsitemid=20241126683832&lan=en-US&anchor=%40ArrowheadPharma&index=6&md5=3cb5440554b0db1fed121786eb19b203), [LinkedIn](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Farrowhead-pharmaceuticals%2F&esheet=54158592&newsitemid=20241126683832&lan=en-US&anchor=LinkedIn&index=7&md5=8c29d8f71a7f5384f27efb9d0cd82ad0), [Facebook](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FArrowheadPharma%2F&esheet=54158592&newsitemid=20241126683832&lan=en-US&anchor=Facebook&index=8&md5=9acef0aac908f0a62f40d7b61c67149a), and [Instagram](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Farrowheadpharma%2F&esheet=54158592&newsitemid=20241126683832&lan=en-US&anchor=Instagram&index=9&md5=742b3a89a21171e14230bb9cd423a2bf).

(NASDAQ: ARWR) today announced a global licensing and collaboration agreement with Sarepta Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SRPT). Upon closing, Arrowhead will receive $825 million, consisting of $500 million cash and $325 million as an equity investment priced at a 35% premium. Arrowhead also receives $250 million to be paid in equal installments over five years and is eligible to receive an additional $300 million in near-term payments, which Arrowhead is on track to achieve during the next 12 months. Additionally, Arrowhead is eligible to receive royalties on commercial sales and up to approximately $10 billion in future potential milestone payments. \n\nThe agreement covers multiple clinical and preclinical programs in rare, genetic diseases of the muscle, central nervous system (CNS), and the lungs, as well as allows Sarepta to select up to six new targets for Arrowhead to conduct discovery and preclinical development activities in areas complementary to Sarepta’s leadership in precision genetic medicine for rare diseases, which can utilize Arrowhead’s proprietary and differentiated Targeted RNAi Molecule (TRiM™) platform. \n\n“For Arrowhead, this strategic transaction accomplishes several important goals that we see as critical to our success as we move from a development stage company operating in several therapeutic areas to a more focused commercial stage company over the coming years. It provides us with a transformational amount of capital immediately and the potential for significant non-dilutive cash throughout the duration of the collaboration. We estimate that this transaction extends Arrowhead’s cash runway into 2028 and potentially through multiple new drug launches, including wholly owned and partnered programs. We now turn our focus as a company to launching investigational plozasiran for the treatment of familial chylomicronemia syndrome potentially in 2025, pending FDA review and approval, which would be our first commercial product. We are also prioritizing further development of additional pipeline programs which would be complementary to plozasiran from a clinical, regulatory, and commercial perspective,” said Christopher Anzalone, Ph.D., president and CEO at Arrowhead. “With this agreement we also welcome the Sarepta team as new Arrowhead collaboration partners who bring a wealth of clinical, regulatory, and commercial expertise in key areas outside of our cardiometabolic focus. We have a very efficient drug discovery engine that continues to generate many promising programs and we have great confidence in Sarepta’s ability to take the next steps to advance and commercialize multiple Arrowhead-discovered drug candidates, which we believe have the potential to be best-in-class.” \n\nAt the close of the agreement, Doug Ingram, president and CEO of Sarepta, will be appointed to the Arrowhead Board of Directors. He is an experienced biotech and pharma executive and has led Sarepta as they advanced multiple investigational medicines through the clinical and regulatory process, built a commercial organization from the ground up, launched multiple drugs, and moved the company toward profitability. His experience and guidance will be valuable to Arrowhead as the Company seeks the same transition. \n\nMr. Ingram added, “The agreement marks the start of a synergistic relationship with Arrowhead’s leading siRNA technology and Sarepta’s proven success in bringing rare disease treatments to patients. Together, we will expedite the development of Arrowhead’s promising scientific approach and bring best-in-class treatments to patients with devastating rare diseases where treatment options are limited or do not exist.

(NASDAQ: ARWR) today announced that it submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for investigational plozasiran for the treatment of familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), a severe and rare genetic disease which currently has no FDA approved treatments. Arrowhead also intends to submit applications for approval of investigational plozasiran for the treatment of patients with FCS to additional regulatory authorities in 2025. \n\n“The NDA submission for investigational plozasiran represents an important milestone for Arrowhead as we advance multiple potential new medicines developed using our proprietary Targeted RNAi Molecule (TRiMTM) platform for patients in diverse therapeutic areas including cardiometabolic, pulmonary, neuromuscular, and liver diseases,” said Chris Anzalone, Ph.D., President and CEO at Arrowhead. “We believe in the potential of RNAi to make a meaningful impact on patients and this first NDA submission is the culmination of over 15 years of innovation and commitment by so many talented Arrowhead employees and the investigators, patients, and caregivers that helped make our vision a reality.” \n\nBruce Given, M.D., chief medical scientist at Arrowhead, added, “The SUMMIT program of clinical studies of plozasiran has achieved promising and consistent results in various patient populations representing multiple points on the spectrum of elevated triglycerides. FCS represents the most severe end of the spectrum in which many patients have a very poor quality of life and are at high risk of developing acute pancreatitis, which can be life threatening. There are currently no approved therapies in the U.S. to treat FCS, so we are working tirelessly to get plozasiran to patients as quickly as possible, pending FDA review and approval.” \n\nThe NDA submission is supported by the SUMMIT program of clinical studies of plozasiran and positive findings in the Phase 3 PALISADE study. PALISADE successfully met its primary endpoint and all multiplicity-controlled key secondary endpoints, including statistically significant reductions in triglycerides (TGs), apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3), and the incidence of acute pancreatitis (AP). \n\nIn PALISADE, plozasiran achieved deep and durable reductions in triglycerides with a median change from baseline of 80% in the plozasiran 25 mg group and a statistically significant 83% reduction in the risk of developing acute pancreatitis compared to placebo in the pooled plozasiran 25 mg and 50 mg group. Overall, plozasiran has been generally well-tolerated to date. In the PALISADE study, the most frequently reported treatment emergent adverse events for the 25 mg dose that is proposed for marketing approval were abdominal pain, COVID-19, nasopharyngitis, and nausea. \n\nThe efficacy and safety results from the PALISADE study were presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2024 (AHA24) and simultaneously published in [Circulation](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ahajournals.org%2Fdoi%2F10.1161%2FCIRCULATIONAHA.124.072860&esheet=54153950&newsitemid=20241118743198&lan=en-US&anchor=Circulation&index=1&md5=7e0e4ab667a16985e410906e316f361b) and presented at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress 2024 and simultaneously published in [The New England Journal of Medicine](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fstoken%2Fdefault%2Bdomain%2FREPRINTS_36489%2Ffull%3FredirectUri%3D%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa2409368&esheet=54153950&newsitemid=20241118743198&lan=en-US&anchor=The+New+England+Journal+of+Medicine&index=2&md5=62f97ffafda68fd5655f3f8ff291d8c6).

FCS leads to extremely high triglyceride (TG) levels, typically over 880 mg/dL. Such severe elevations can lead to various serious signs and symptoms including acute and potentially fatal pancreatitis, chronic abdominal pain, diabetes, hepatic steatosis, and cognitive issues. Currently, there are no therapeutic options that can adequately treat FCS in the US. \n\n**About Plozasiran**\n\nPlozasiran, previously called ARO-APOC3, is a first-in-class investigational RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic designed to reduce production of apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3) which is a component of triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and a key regulator of triglyceride metabolism. APOC3 increases triglyceride levels in the blood by inhibiting breakdown of TRLs by lipoprotein lipase and uptake of TRL remnants by hepatic receptors in the liver. The goal of treatment with plozasiran is to reduce the level of APOC3, thereby reducing triglycerides and restoring lipids to more normal levels. \n\nIn multiple clinical studies, investigational plozasiran has demonstrated reductions in triglycerides and multiple atherogenic lipoproteins in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), severe hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG), and mixed hyperlipidemia. Plozasiran has been generally well tolerated to date with treatment emergent adverse events reported that generally reflect the comorbidities and underlying conditions of the study populations. Across clinical studies and study populations, the most frequently reported treatment emergent adverse events for the 25 mg dose that is proposed for marketing approval were COVID-19, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and abdominal pain. \n\nPlozasiran is being investigated in the SUMMIT program of clinical studies, including the PALISADE Phase 3 study in patients with FCS, the SHASTA studies in patients with SHTG, and the MUIR and CAPITAN studies in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia. \n\nPlozasiran in the treatment of patients with FCS has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation, Orphan Drug Designation, and Fast Track Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Orphan Drug Designation by the European Medicines Agency. Investigational plozasiran has not been reviewed or approved to treat any disease. \n\n**About PALISADE Phase 3 Study**\n\nThe PALISADE study ([NCT05089084](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT05089084%3Fterm%3DNCT05089084%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D1&esheet=54153950&newsitemid=20241118743198&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT05089084&index=4&md5=abd8644b2aa3b1ca0898b0dbacab40ef)) is a Phase 3 placebo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of plozasiran in adults with genetically confirmed or clinically diagnosed FCS. The primary endpoint of the study is percent change from baseline in fasting TG versus placebo at Month 10. A total of 75 subjects distributed across 39 different sites in 18 countries were randomized to receive 25 mg plozasiran, 50 mg plozasiran, or matching placebo once every three months. Participants who completed the randomized period were eligible to continue in a 2-part extension period, where all participants receive plozasiran. \n\n**About Plozasiran EAP**\n\nArrowhead is committed to bringing new investigational medicines to patients with serious diseases as quickly and efficiently as possible. The company has established an expanded access program (EAP) for some individuals living with FCS. As with any investigational medicine that has not been approved by regulatory authorities, investigational plozasiran may or may not be effective in treating your diagnosis or condition, and there may be risks associated with its use. If you are a patient or caregiver wishing to know more about this plozasiran EAP for FCS, please discuss this EAP and all treatment options with your treating physician. If you are a treating physician and are seeking information about the plozasiran EAP or would like to request access for a patient, please contact EAP@arrowheadpharma.com. \n\n**About Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals**\n\nArrowhead Pharmaceuticals develops medicines that treat intractable diseases by silencing the genes that cause them.
