          "content": "MARTEN TRANSPORT, LTD.\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE STANDARDS\nThe Board of Directors, or the Board, of Marten Transport, Ltd., or the Company, has\nestablished the following guidelines for the conduct and operation of meetings and deliberations\nof the Board. These guidelines will be reviewed periodically by the Board and may be amended\nor modified from time to time.\n❖ Director Responsibilities: The fundamental role of the directors is to exercise their business\njudgment to act in what they reasonably believe to be in the best interests of the Company\nand its shareholders. Directors are expected to attend Board meetings and meetings of\ncommittees on which they serve, and to spend the time needed and to meet as frequently as\nnecessary to properly discharge their responsibilities. In addition, all directors are expected\nto attend the Company’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Board’s general practice\nshall be to schedule a meeting of the Board on the same day as the Annual Meeting in order\nto facilitate attendance of all directors at the Company’s Annual Meeting.\n❖ Conduct of Board Meetings: The conduct of meetings of the Board will be\ngoverned as follows:\n➢ Selection of Agenda Items for Board Meeting. The Chairman of the Board, in\nconsultation with other executive officers, will establish the agenda for each Board\nmeeting. Each Board member shall be free to suggest the inclusion of items on the\nagenda. Additionally, each Board member is free to raise at any Board meeting subjects\nthat are not on the agenda for that meeting. The Board is expected to review the\nCompany’s long-term strategic plans and the principal issues that the Company will face\nin the future during at least one Board meeting each year.\n➢ Board Materials Distributed in Advance. Information and data concerning the\nCompany’s operations and its financial affairs is important to the Board’s understanding\nand decision-making process. Accordingly, there will be distributed in advance of each\nmeeting of the Board appropriate written material relating to substantive agenda items.\nManagement will make every attempt to see that this material is as concise as possible\nwhile still providing the desired information. Highly sensitive subjects may be discussed\nat the meeting without advance distribution of written materials.\n➢ Management and Advisor Presentations. The Board encourages the participation of\nthe Company’s executive officers in a portion of each Board meeting. The Board\nbelieves they can provide additional insight into certain of the items being discussed\nbecause of personal involvement in these areas, as well as being given exposure to the\nBoard members. Board meetings may also be attended from time to time by outside\nadvisors, to the extent such advisors’ participation is deemed necessary and appropriate\nby the Company’s management, to assist the Board in understanding the material\npresented to the Board.\n❖ Executive sessions of Independent Directors: The independent directors of the Board will\nmeet separately as a group on a regular basis, and at least two times each year. A director\n(the “Lead Independent Director”) will be selected by the independent directors (in\naccordance with paragraph entitled “Selection of Lead Independent Director” below) and\nwill assume the responsibility of chairing the regularly scheduled meetings of independent\ndirectors and bear such further responsibilities that the independent directors as a whole\nmight designate from time to time. The identity of the Lead Independent Director will be\ndisclosed in the annual Proxy Statement.\n❖ Director Access to Executive Officers and Employees: Each member of the Board shall\nhave full and free access to officers and employees of the Company. Board members will\nuse their judgment to be sure that any such contact is not distracting to the operation of the\nCompany and that such contact be coordinated, to the extent reasonably practicable, with the\nChief Executive Officer or President.\n❖ Composition of the Board:\n➢ Size of the Board. It is the sense of the Board to have a minimum of five (5) and a\nmaximum of eight (8) members. Should outstanding candidate(s) become available, the\nBoard will evaluate its size.\n➢ Mix of Inside and Outside Directors. There must be a majority of independent\ndirectors on the Board.\n➢ Board Definition of What Constitutes Independence for Outside Directors. An\nindependent director is one who is independent of management and who meets the\nindependence requirements set forth in the federal securities laws and under the rules and\nregulations established by the Securities Exchange Commission and the Nasdaq Stock\nMarket, as may be amended from time to time. The Board will affirmatively make and\ndisclose in the annual Proxy Statement its determination that each Board member whom\nit has identified as independent has no material relationship, directly or indirectly, with\nthe Company.\n➢ Board Membership Criteria. The Nominating (Corporate Governance) Committee is\nresponsible for reviewing with the Board on a periodic basis, as necessary, the\nappropriate skills and characteristics required of Board members in the context of the\ncurrent make-up of the Board.\n➢ Selection of New Director Candidates. The Board itself should be responsible, in fact\nas well as procedure, for selecting its own members, determining and reviewing their\nqualifications. The Board delegates the screening process involved to the\nNominating/Corporate Governance Committee. The Committee shall provide new\ndirectors with access to internal and external orientation programs to ensure that they\nhave sufficient information about the Company and their duties.\n2\n❖ Director Compensation: The Compensation Committee should report once a year to the\nBoard any suggested changes in Board compensation, but with full discussion and\nconcurrence by the full Board.\n❖ Annual Performance Evaluation: The Board of Directors will conduct an annual self-\nevaluation to determine whether it and its committees are functioning effectively. The\nChairman of the Board, or the Lead Independent Director if designated by the Board, will\nreceive comments from all directors and report annually to the Board with an assessment of\nthe Board’s performance. This will be discussed with the full Board following the end of the\nfiscal year. The assessment will focus on the Board’s and the committees’ contributions to\nthe Company and specifically focus on areas in which the Board or management believes the\nBoard could improve.\n❖ Committees of the Board: The committee structure of the Board shall at least consist of an\nAudit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating (Corporate Governance)\nCommittee. The Board shall convene other committees, such as a Special Committee, as it\ndeems appropriate.\n➢ Frequency and Length of Committee Meetings. The committee chairperson, in\nconsultation with the committee members, will determine the frequency and length of the\nmeetings of the committee in adherence to the committee charter.\n➢ Committee Agenda. The chairperson of the committee, in consultation with the\nappropriate members of management and staff and outside advisors (independent\nauditors, legal counsel etc.), if appropriate, will develop the committee’s agenda.\n➢ Committee Charter. Each committee, unless otherwise directed by the Board, shall\ndevelop a charter for approval by the full Board. The charter will set forth the purpose,\npolicies, organization and responsibilities of the committees. The charters of the Audit\nCommittee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating (Corporate Governance)\nCommittee shall be subject to periodic review by the Board.\n➢ Committee Membership. The Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the\nNominating (Corporate Governance) Committee shall each consist of three or more\ndirectors, each of whom shall satisfy the independence requirements set forth in the\nfederal securities laws and under the rules and regulations established by the Securities\nExchange Commission and the Nasdaq Stock Market, as may be amended from time to\ntime. In addition, at least one member of the Audit Committee shall be an “audit\ncommittee financial expert” for purposes of the regulations promulgated pursuant to the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Committee members will be appointed by the Board of\nDirectors.\n❖ Selection of Lead Director: If the Chairman of the Board is the Chief Executive Officer or\nPresident, and/or not an independent Board member, the Board will consider the election of\nan independent Board member as the Lead Independent Director.\n3\n❖ Directors Who Change Their Present Job Responsibility: It is the sense of the Board that\nindividual directors who materially change the responsibility they held when they were\nelected to the Board should volunteer to resign from the Board. It is not the sense of the\nBoard that in every instance the directors who retire or change from the position they held\nwhen they came on the Board should necessarily leave the Board. There should, however, be\nan opportunity for the Board to review the continued appropriateness of Board membership\nunder these circumstances.\n❖ Succession Planning: There should be available, on a continuing basis, the Chairman of the\nBoard, Chief Executive Officer and President’s recommendation as to his successor should\nhe be unexpectedly disabled or otherwise unable for any reason to perform his duties. There\nshould be an annual report by the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and\nPresident to the Board on succession planning.\n❖ Board Interaction with Investors, the Press, Customers Etc.: The Board believes that\nmanagement speaks for the Company. Individual Board members may, from time to time,\nmeet or otherwise communicate with various constituencies that are involved with the\nCompany. However, it is expected that Board members would do so only with the\nknowledge of management, and in most instances, at the request of management. In\nparticular, any discussions with the media (e.g., press, TV, etc.) concerning the Company\nshould be first channeled through one of the following individuals: Chairman of the Board,\nChief Executive Officer, President, or Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,\nwhenever practicable. The Company’s directors should not accept any gift of value that\nindicates an intent to influence improperly the normal business relationship between the\nCompany and any supplier, customer or competitor.\n❖ Evaluation of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: The\nCompensation Committee will conduct an annual review of the Chairman of the Board and\nChief Executive Officer’s performance, as set forth in its charter and provide a report of such\nreview to the full Board of Directors.\n❖ Communication with Directors:\nIn order to facilitate communication by a shareholder with a member of the Board, a\nshareholder may send communications to the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, 129\nMarten Street, Mondovi, WI 54755, with an instruction to forward the communication to the\nparticular director. The Company’s Chief Financial Officer shall promptly forward all such\nshareholder communications to the particular director.\nApproved by Marten Transport, Ltd.\nBoard of Directors\nMay 3, 2022\n4\n34327873.8"

          "content": "MARTEN TRANSPORT, LTD.\nPOLICY REGARDING RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nIntroduction\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Marten Transport, Ltd. (the “Company”) recognizes that\nRelated Party Transactions (as defined below) can present potential or actual conflicts of interest, and may\nappear to be motivated by interests other than the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.\nNasdaq rules require that all Related Party Transactions be reviewed on an ongoing basis and be\napproved by the Audit Committee of the Board (or another independent body of the Board) and that Related\nParty Transactions involving directors of the Company may adversely impact the director’s independence\nunder Nasdaq standards. Related Party Transactions also raise disclosure issues under the federal securities\nlaws and applicable accounting rules, including Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K and SFAS 57, Related\nParty Disclosures.\nNotwithstanding these considerations, the Board recognizes that there are situations where Related\nParty Transactions may be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Accordingly, the\nBoard has adopted this Policy to set forth the policies and procedures for the review, approval or ratification\nof Related Person Transactions.\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Policy, a “Related Person” is:\n• any person who is or was an executive officer or director of the Company at any time since\nthe beginning of the Company’s last fiscal year, or any current director nominee;\n• a person who is or was an Immediate Family Member of a person serving as an executive\nofficer or director at any time since the beginning of the Company’s last fiscal year, or any\nImmediate Family Member of any current director nominee;\n• any person who, at the time of the occurrence or existence of the transaction, is the\nbeneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of the Company’s voting securities (a\n“Significant Shareholder”); or\n• any person who, at the time of the occurrence or existence of the transaction, is an\nImmediate Family Member of a Significant Shareholder of the Company.\nAn “Immediate Family Member” of a person is any child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, spouse,\nsibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law of such\nperson, or any other person sharing the household of such person, other than a tenant or employee.\nA “Related Person Transaction” is any transaction, arrangement or relationship, or any series of\nsimilar transactions, arrangements or relationships in which the Company was or is to be a participant, the\namount involved exceeds $25,000, and a Related Person had or will have a direct or indirect material\ninterest. Except as otherwise set forth in this Policy, “Related Person Transaction” specifically includes,\nwithout limitation, purchases of goods or services by or from the Related Person or entities in which the\nRelated Person has a material interest, indebtedness, guarantees of indebtedness, and employment by the\nCompany of a Related Person. However, the Board of Directors has determined that the following do not\ncreate a material direct or indirect interest on behalf of the Related Person, and are, therefore, not “Related\nPerson Transactions” for purposes of this Policy:\n1. Interests arising only from (a) the Related Person’s position as a director of another\ncorporation or organization that is a party to the transaction, and / or (b) from the direct or\nindirect ownership by the Related Person and all other Related Persons in the aggregate of less\nthan a 10% equity interest (other than a general partnership interest) in another entity which is\na party to the transaction.\n2. Interests arising solely from the ownership of a class of the Company’s equity securities if all\nholders of that class of equity securities receive the same benefit on a pro rata basis.\n3. A transaction that involves compensation to an executive officer if (a) the compensation is\nrequired to be reported in the Company’s proxy statement under the SEC’s compensation\ndisclosure requirements in Item 402 of the SEC Regulation S-K (generally applicable to\n“named executive officers”); or (b) the executive officer is not an immediate family member\nof another executive officer or director of the Company, the related compensation would be\nreported in the Company’s proxy statement under Item 402 of SEC Regulation S-K if the\nexecutive officer was a “named executive officer,” and the Compensation Committee of the\nBoard approved (or recommended that the Board approved) such compensation.\n5. A transaction that involves compensation to a director for services as a director of the Company\nif such compensation will be reported pursuant to Item 402(k) of Regulation S-K.\n6. Interests arising solely from indebtedness of a Significant Shareholder or an Immediate\nFamily Member of a Significant Shareholder to the Company.\n7. A transaction where the rates or charges involved in the transaction are determined by\ncompetitive bids.\n8. A transaction that involves services as a common or contract carrier or public utility at rates or\ncharges fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority.\n9. A transaction that involves services as a bank depositary of funds, transfer agent, registrar,\ntrustee under a trust indenture, or similar services.\nPolicies and Procedures for Review, Approval or Ratification of Related Person\nTransactions\nAny Related Person Transaction proposed to be entered into by the Company must be reported to the\nCompany’s Chief Financial Officer and shall be reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee of the\nBoard of Directors pursuant to this Policy, prior to effectiveness or consummation of the transaction,\nwhenever practicable. If the Chief Financial Officer determines that advance approval of a Related Person\nTransaction is not practicable under the circumstances, the Committee shall review and, in its discretion,\nmay ratify the Related Person Transaction at the next meeting of the Committee, or at the next meeting\nfollowing the date that the Related Person Transaction comes to the attention of the Chief Financial Officer;\nprovided, however, that the Chief Financial Officer may present a Related Person Transaction arising in the\ntime period between meetings of the Committee to the Chair of the Committee, who shall review and may\napprove the Related Person Transaction, subject to ratification by the Committee at the next meeting of the\nCommittee.\nIn addition, any Related Person Transaction previously approved by the Committee or otherwise\n2\nalready existing that is ongoing in nature shall be reviewed by the Committee annually to ensure that such\nRelated Person Transaction has been conducted in accordance with the previous approval granted by the\nCommittee, if any, and that all required disclosures regarding the Related Person Transaction are made.\nTransactions involving executive officer compensation shall be reviewed and approved by the\nCompensation Committee in the manner specified in that committee’s charter.\nStandards for Review, Approval or Ratification of Related Person Transactions\nA Related Person Transaction reviewed under this Policy will be considered approved or ratified if\nit is authorized by the Committee in accordance with the standards set forth in this Policy after full\ndisclosure of the Related Person’s interests in the transaction. As appropriate for the circumstances, the\nCommittee shall review and consider:\n• the Related Person’s relationship to the Company and interest in the Related Person Transaction\n(as an approximate dollar value, without regard to profit or loss);\n• the approximate total dollar value involved in the Related Person Transaction;\n• whether the transaction was undertaken in the ordinary course of business of the Company;\n• whether the transaction with the Related Person is proposed to be, or was, entered into on terms\nno less favorable to the Company than terms that could have been reached with an unrelated\nthird party;\n• whether the related person transaction would impair the independence of an outside director;\n• whether the transaction with the related person would require a waiver of the Company’s Code\nof Ethics;\n• the terms on which the Related Person offers the products or services involved in the Related\nPerson Transaction to unrelated parties;\n• the purpose of, and the potential benefits to the Company of, the transaction; and\n• any other information regarding the Related Person Transaction or the Related Person in the\ncontext of the proposed transaction that would be material to investors in light of the\ncircumstances of the particular transaction.\nThe Committee will review all relevant information available to it about the Related Person\nTransaction. The Committee may approve or ratify the Related Person Transaction only if the Committee\ndetermines that, under all of the circumstances, the transaction is in the best interests of the Company and its\nshareholders. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, impose such conditions as it deems appropriate on\nthe Company or the Related Person in connection with approval of the Related Person Transaction.\nThe review, approval or ratification of a transaction, arrangement or relationship pursuant to this\nPolicy does not necessarily imply that such transaction, arrangement or relationship is required to be\ndisclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.\n3\nControls and Procedures\nThe Company’s management will design, document, implement and test the specific internal\ncontrols and procedures and disclosure controls necessary to ensure that all Related Person Transactions are\nidentified and reviewed under this policy on a timely basis and, to the extent required under applicable laws,\nrules and regulations, are disclosed on a timely basis.\n* * * * *\nApproved by the Board of Directors of\nMarten Transport, Ltd.\nFebruary 12, 2007\n4"

This includes the\nCompany’s commitment to comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the\npresentation of the Company’s financial information to the public and to the recovery of\nerroneously awarded incentive-based compensation.\nAs a result, the Committee has adopted this Policy to provide that, in the event the Company is\nrequired to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company\nwith any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required\naccounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is\nmaterial to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material\nmisstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current\nperiod (each, as applicable, a “Restatement”), the Company will recover reasonably promptly\nthe amount of any “erroneously awarded compensation” “received” by an “executive officer,” in\neach case as such terms are defined in this Policy, if and to the extent required by any federal or\nstate law, rule or regulation, or rule, regulation, policy or listing standard of the Securities and\nExchange Commission (“SEC”) or any securities exchange on which the Company’s securities\nare listed, including without limitation, Nasdaq Rule 5608 (Recovery of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation).\nIn the event of any change in any federal or state law, rule or regulation, or rule, regulation,\npolicy or listing standard of the SEC or any securities exchange on which the Company’s\nsecurities are listed after the Effective Date, which requires the Company to recover\ncompensation from an executive officer, the Company will seek recovery under this Policy to the\nextent required by such laws, rules, regulations or listing standards.\n1\nAdministration\nThe Committee has full power, authority, and sole and exclusive discretion to reasonably\nconstrue, interpret and administer this Policy. The Committee will interpret this Policy consistent\nwith Nasdaq Rule 5608 (Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation) and any guidance\nissued thereunder, the rules and regulations of the SEC, and any other applicable laws, rules or\nregulations governing the mandatory recovery of compensation, as such laws, rules or regulations\nmay change, be interpreted or evolve from time to time. All determinations and decisions made\nby the Committee will be made in its reasonable discretion and will be final, conclusive and\nbinding on all affected individuals.\nThe term “Committee” as used in this Policy means the Compensation Committee of the Board,\nor in the absence of such a committee, a majority of the “independent directors” (as defined under\nNasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2)) serving on the Board.\nApplicability\nThis Policy applies to all “incentive-based compensation” “received” by a person, in each case as\nsuch terms are defined in this Policy:\n• After beginning service as an “executive officer,” as such term is defined in this Policy,\nand who served as an executive officer at any time during the performance period for that\nincentive-based compensation;\n• While the Company has a class of securities listed on Nasdaq or another national\nsecurities exchange or a national securities association; and\n• During the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Company\nis required to prepare the Restatement, plus any transition period (that results from a\nchange in the Company’s fiscal year) within or immediately following those three\ncompleted fiscal years; provided, however, that a transition period between the last day of\nthe Company’s previous fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year that\ncomprises a period of nine to 12 months would be deemed a completed fiscal year; and\nprovided, further, that the Company’s obligation to recover erroneously awarded\ncompensation is not dependent on if or when the restated financial statements are filed.\nFor purpose of determining the relevant recovery period, the date that the Company is required to\nprepare a Restatement is the earlier to occur of: (i) the date the Company’s Board, a committee of\nthe Board or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action\nis not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to\nprepare a Restatement; or (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs\nthe Company to prepare a Restatement.\n2\nExecutive Officers Covered by Policy\nThis Policy covers the Company’s current and former executive officers who received\nerroneously awarded compensation regardless of whether the executive officer committed\nmisconduct or contributed to the error.\nThe term “executive officer” as used in this Policy means the Company’s:\n• president;\n• principal financial officer;\n• principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller);\n• any vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division or\nfunction (such as sales, administration or finance);\n• any other officer who performs a policy-making function; or\n• any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company and\nexecutive officers of the Company’s parents or subsidiaries if such individuals perform\nsuch policy-making functions for the Company.\nPolicy-making function is not intended to include policy-making functions that are not significant.\nIdentification of an executive officer for purposes of this Policy would include at a minimum\nexecutive officers identified by the Company pursuant to Item 401(b) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nAuthority and Obligation to Recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation; Exceptions\nIn the event of a Restatement, the Company must reasonably promptly recover any “erroneously\nawarded compensation,” as such term is defined in this Policy, in compliance with this Policy,\nexcept to the extent one of the three conditions below is met and the Committee has made a\ndetermination that recovery would be impracticable.\n1. The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the\namount to be recovered and the Company has made a reasonable attempt to recover any\namount of erroneously awarded compensation, has documented such reasonable\nattempt(s) to recover and provided that documentation to Nasdaq.\n2. Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to\nNovember 28, 2022 and the Company has obtained an opinion of home country counsel,\nacceptable to Nasdaq, that recovery would result in such a violation and has provided\nsuch opinion to Nasdaq.\n3. Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which\nbenefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the\nrequirements of Section 401(a)(13) or 411(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and\nregulations thereunder.\n3\nErroneously Awarded Compensation\nThe term “erroneously awarded compensation” as used in this Policy means that amount of\n“incentive-based compensation” received that exceeds the amount of “incentive-based\ncompensation” that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the\nrestated amounts, and must be computed without regard to any taxes paid.\nFor incentive-based compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the\namount of erroneously awarded compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation\ndirectly from the information in a Restatement,\n• the amount must be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Restatement on the\nstock price or total shareholder return upon which the incentive-based compensation was\nreceived; and\n• the Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable\nestimate and provide such documentation to Nasdaq.\nThe term “incentive-based compensation” as used in this Policy means any compensation that is\ngranted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a financial reporting\nmeasure.\nThe term “financial reporting measures” as used in this Policy means measures that are\ndetermined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the\nCompany’s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such\nmeasures. Financial reporting measures include, without limitation, stock price and total\nshareholder return, and may include non-GAAP financial measures. A financial reporting\nmeasure need not be presented within the Company’s financial statements or included in an SEC\nfiling to constitute a financial reporting measure for this purpose.\nIncentive-based compensation is deemed “received” as such term is used in this Policy by an\nexecutive officer in the Company’s fiscal period during which the financial reporting measure\nspecified in the incentive-based compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of\nthe incentive-based compensation occurs after the end of that period.\nNotwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, “incentive-based compensation” is intended to\nbe interpreted and construed broadly and includes with respect to any plan that takes into account\nincentive-based compensation (other than a tax-qualified plan) any amount contributed to a\nnotional account based on erroneously awarded compensation and any earnings accrued to date\non that notional account. Such plans include without limitation long-term disability plans, life\ninsurance plans, supplemental executive retirement plans and other compensation, if it is based on\nincentive-based compensation.\nFor clarity and the avoidance of doubt, “incentive-based compensation” does not include the\nfollowing:\n• base salary (other than any base salary increase earned wholly or in part based on the\nattainment of a financial reporting measure, which increase is subject to recovery as\nincentive-based compensation hereunder);\n4\n• bonuses paid solely at the discretion of the Committee or Board that are not paid from a\n“bonus pool” that is determined by satisfying a financial reporting measure performance\ngoal;\n• bonuses paid solely upon satisfying one or more subjective standards (e.g., demonstrated\nleadership) and/or completion of a specified employment period;\n• non-equity incentive plan awards earned solely upon satisfying one or more strategic\nmeasures (e.g., consummating a merger or divestiture), or operational measures (e.g.,\ncompletion of a project); and\n• equity awards for which the grant is not contingent upon achieving any financial\nreporting measure performance goal, and vesting is contingent solely upon completion of\na specified employment period and/or attaining one or more non-financial reporting\nmeasures.\nMethod of Recovery\nThe Committee will determine, in its reasonable discretion, the method for recovering incentive-\nbased compensation hereunder, which may include, without limitation, any one or more of the\nfollowing:\n• requiring reimbursement of cash incentive-based compensation previously paid;\n• seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer or\nother disposition of any equity-based awards;\n• cancelling or rescinding some or all outstanding vested or unvested equity-based awards;\n• adjusting or withholding from unpaid compensation, deferred compensation or other set-\noff;\n• cancelling or setting-off against planned future grants of equity-based awards; and/or\n• any other method required or authorized by applicable law or contract.\nEnforceability\nIn addition to the adoption of this Policy, the Company will take steps to implement an agreement\nto this Policy by all current and future executive officers. In furtherance of the foregoing, each\nexecutive officer subject to this Policy is required to sign and return to the Company the\nAcknowledgement Form attached hereto as Exhibit A pursuant to which such executive officer\nwill agree to be bound by the terms and comply with this Policy.\nPolicy Not Exclusive\nAny recovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of\nrecovery that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any other clawback or\nrecovery policy or any similar policy in any employment agreement, incentive or equity\ncompensation plan or award or other agreement and any other legal rights or remedies available\nto the Company.\n5\nNotwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, to the extent that the requirements under the\nprovisions of Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are broader than the provisions in\nthis Policy, the provisions of such law will apply to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer.\nNo Indemnification\nThe Company will not indemnify or agree to indemnify any executive officer or former executive\nofficer against the loss of erroneously awarded compensation nor will the Company pay or agree\nto pay any insurance premium to cover the loss of erroneously awarded compensation.\nEffective Date\nThis Policy is effective as of the Effective Date and applies to all incentive-based compensation\nreceived by the Company’s current and former executive officers on or after the Effective Date.\nRequired Disclosures\nThe Company will file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the\nrequirements of the federal securities laws, including the disclosure required by the applicable\nSEC filings and will provide all required SEC and other disclosures regarding this Policy and in\nthe event of a Restatement.\nAmendment and Termination\nThe Committee may amend, modify or terminate this Policy in whole or in part at any time in its\nsole discretion and may adopt such rules and procedures that it deems necessary or appropriate to\nimplement this Policy or to comply with Nasdaq Rule 5608 (Recovery of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation) and any other applicable laws, rules and regulations.\nSuccessors\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all current and former executive officers of\nthe Company and their respective beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators, or other legal\nrepresentatives.\n* * * * * *\nAdopted by the Compensation Committee\nof the Board of Directors of Marten Transport, Ltd.\non August 15, 2023.\n6\nExhibit A\nMARTEN TRANSPORT, LTD.\nCLAWBACK POLICY\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORM\nBy signing below, the undersigned acknowledges and confirms that the undersigned has\nreceived and reviewed a copy of the Marten Transport, Ltd.
