Scheduled for Today at 4:30 p.m. ET_\n\nRAMSEY, N.J. and BOCA RATON, Fla., Aug. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ADMA Biologics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ADMA) (“ADMA” or the “Company”), an end-to-end commercial biopharmaceutical company dedicated to manufacturing, marketing and developing specialty biologics, today announced its second quarter 2024 financial results and provided a business update.\n\n\"ADMA’s excellent second quarter results showcased the strength of our operations, innovative business and product offerings, enabling the Company to significantly increase both 2024 and 2025 financial guidance,” said Adam Grossman, President and Chief Executive Officer of ADMA. “We believe the Company is well-positioned to further strengthen its balance sheet, reduce the cost of capital and sustain ADMA’s position as one of the fastest growing and profitable companies in the biotech and pharma sector.”\n\nMr. Grossman continued, “ADMA’s commitment to serving immunodeficient patients, particularly those with complex comorbidities, remains the cornerstone of our mission. We see additional opportunities for ADMA to continue to grow substantially in the underserved, immune compromised and co-morbid patient population despite the availability of standard of care therapy. We are confident that incremental additional penetration with ASCENIV will accelerate near-term revenue growth and create a substantial peak revenue opportunity beyond our 2025 guided baseline. Looking to the remainder of 2024, we expect continued revenue and earnings growth, advancement of regulatory processes for manufacturing yield enhancement, favorable product mix shifts, and progress in our R&D programs.”\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Milestones and Objectives:**\n\n  * **Compounding Growth.** Driven by 78% year-over-year revenue growth, ADMA grew Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income to $44.5 million and $32.1 million, respectively, during the second quarter. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, Adjusted EBITDA grew 69% and Net Income grew 80% compared to the first quarter of 2024. The Company anticipates building on this momentum throughout the remainder of 2024 and beyond.\n  * **Favorably Evolving Mix Shift.** ADMA’s higher margin product portfolio now accounts for over 50% of the Company’s total revenue. ADMA is actively implementing measures to increase ASCENIV supply. If successful, these initiatives could enable ASCENIV to contribute a significant majority of ADMA's total revenue over time, further advancing the Company's potential margin expansion and earnings growth.\n  * **Strengthened Balance Sheet.** Based on ADMA’s second quarter operating cash flow of $45.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA growth, the Company’s current net leverage ratio has organically improved to approximately 0.26x. The Company anticipates continued strengthening of the balance sheet driven by forecasted Adjusted EBITDA growth and ongoing cash generation in the second half of 2024 and beyond.\n  * **Updated Marketing Materials.** During the second quarter, ADMA revamped its corporate website, product websites and certain marketing materials, including those for Healthcare Providers (HCP). Additionally, the Company released a new video testimonial on the ASCENIV product website, highlighting the treatment journey of a co-morbid and refractive immunodeficient patient.\n  * **Expanded ADMAlytics™ Implementation.** ADMA successfully expanded implementation of ADMAlytics to the commercial arm of the organization during the second quarter. When fully implemented, ADMAlytics is expected to further optimize the Company’s commercial growth strategy. Initiated in February 2024, the staggered implementation of ADMAlytics continues to yield impressive results across multiple areas of ADMA’s operations. These benefits include increased production efficiency, enhanced visibility into the 7–12-month manufacturing process, optimized commercial planning, streamlined plasma pooling, and reduced variability and FTE hours. These efficiencies are expected to further solidify ADMA’s rapid earnings growth outlook.\n\n\n\n**Upwardly Revised 2024-2025 Financial Guidance:**\n\n  * FY 2024 and 2025 total revenue is now expected to be more than $400 million and $445 million, respectively, increased from prior guidance of more than $355 million and $410 million, respectively.\n  * FY 2024 and 2025 net income is now expected to exceed $105 million and $155 million, respectively, increased from prior guidance of $85 million and $135 million, respectively.\n  * FY 2024 and 2025 Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to exceed $150 million and $200 million, respectively, increased from prior guidance of $110 million and $160 million, respectively.\n\n\n\n**Advancing Innovative Growth Opportunities:** Below are the Company’s ongoing initiatives which, if successful, we believe represent the potential for upside to our current forecasted guidance:\n\n  * **Biologic Production Yield Enhancement:** During the second quarter and recent periods, commercial-scale production of ADMA's innovative biologics manufacturing process demonstrated a potential enhancement of yields by approximately 20% from the same starting plasma. If successful, we believe these yield improvements could significantly boost the Company’s future peak financial targets, potentially as early as the fourth quarter of 2025.\n  * **R &D Program - ****_S. pneumonia_****Hyperimmune Globulin:** Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia in the U.S., with about one million adults developing pneumococcal pneumonia annually, resulting in 400,000 hospitalizations and a 5-7% mortality rate. Despite vaccines, vaccine-naive and immune-compromised individuals remain at risk. A hyperimmune globulin could provide immediate antibodies, potentially generating $300-500 million annually if approved. ADMA holds various U.S. and foreign patents which cover its proprietary pneumococcal hyperimmune technology, including hyperimmune anti-pneumococcal immune globulin, preparation methods, and its use in treating S. pneumonia infections.\n  * **ASCENIV Label Expansion:** The ongoing post-marketing pediatric clinical study for ASCENIV may provide label expansion opportunities, further strengthening ADMA’s product portfolio, if successful.\n\n\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results:**\n\nTotal revenues were $107.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $60.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, an increase of $47.1 million, or approximately 78%. The increase is primarily related to increased sales of ASCENIV. During the second quarter, the Company recognized a non-recurring, $12.6 million increase to net revenues and a corresponding reduction of an accrual related to a change in estimate for U.S. Medicaid rebates.\n\nGross profits were $57.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $16.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, an increase of $40.8 million. As a result, ADMA achieved a corporate gross margin of 53.6% in the second quarter of 2024 as compared to 27.8% in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $44.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $6.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, an increase of $38.1 million, or approximately 592%.\n\nGAAP Net income was $32.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to a GAAP Net Loss of $6.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. \n\nAs of June 30, 2024, ADMA had working capital of approximately $259.5 million, primarily consisting of $179.8 million of inventory, $88.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $30.1 million of net accounts receivable, partially offset by current liabilities of $44.2 million. \n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nTo access the conference call seamlessly, participants are required to register for the call [** _here_**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jilsAgGN7_ZfI5le3IHl5QWhNZmkfaY8bruY4WAN5oji_U8lPMoymvbUfkoJ7fzdrVXsnD6Jo9Ty_GmJEIYNDNRHKrssogJjSewaP7zHRNS3q5ZdcmGT2hjPMseM2hR3gKm6HIeFim8IMg1t4DTwhfTkwwrGcU-8aYC3s1SyRrll9Wc3VbRSIHcQLCz0cQwlOoCB6ZUHY8RVtJeaACPbmwd2fHM7me_N_IuCqWSQIs2RN1Plm_4dzoFFwH3Dt0kTO21fYIkvKcttuVm-dbU168O9NYuOmNnkU3PyECEFS-1hwOCrBoiCJHpRwLVdddCY3Zz9wmWTIMYZWBBo9skg9knysaVbiGpeAjRClSQB9E69Kqx6J-KInyP_9d3xisCTd08J0Pb_DN3UxY0bYg5JMm1keQ2Be8GmxRkfOlOU8WrqrkDgHY6farwD4FByiD10URzO9Zl3qBu9TuzbZ08lzEjahbKStGp97gnRY10mJ0eSN7ssBTU4jLTwJmwbkAEUZwo0G5hQGFSxwUlMGpnEiFaU_q0VroiyUZsQBVCumB5pv9pR9ni8lp8_l6gmbg-d1YkjiImBnVFUb42h9zbEkseg8kamf9CSO5E4MtLtGI49RM7yxDtxD_JShYy3HUwj) to receive the dial-in numbers and unique PIN.

ASCENIV was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2019 and is indicated for the treatment of primary humoral immunodeficiency (PI), also known as primary immune deficiency disease (PIDD), in adults and adolescents (12 to 17 years of age). ASCENIV is manufactured using ADMA’s unique, patented plasma donor screening methodology and tailored plasma pooling design, which blends normal source plasma and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) plasma obtained from donors tested using the Company’s proprietary microneutralization assay. ASCENIV contains naturally occurring polyclonal antibodies, which are proteins that are used by the body’s immune system to neutralize microbes such as bacteria and viruses that safeguard against infection and disease. ASCENIV is protected by numerous issued patents in the United States and internationally and a wide range of patent applications worldwide. Certain data and other information about ASCENIV can be found by visiting www.asceniv.com. Information about ADMA and its products can be found on the Company’s website at www.admabiologics.com.\n\n**Additional Important Safety Information About ASCENIV™**\n\nWARNING: THROMBOSIS, RENAL DYSFUNCTION AND ACUTE RENAL FAILURE  \n---  \nThrombosis may occur with immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) products, including ASCENIV. Risk factors may include: advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous or arterial thrombosis, use of estrogens, indwelling vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, and cardiovascular risk factors.Renal dysfunction, acute renal failure, osmotic nephrosis, and death may occur with the administration of IGIV products in predisposed patients.Renal dysfunction and acute renal failure occur more commonly in patients receiving IGIV products containing sucrose. ASCENIV does not contain sucrose.For patients at risk of thrombosis, renal dysfunction or renal failure, administer ASCENIV at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable. Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity.  \n  \n**ASCENIV™ Contraindications:**\n\nHistory of anaphylactic or severe systemic reactions to human immunoglobulin.\n\nIgA deficient patients with antibodies to IgA and a history of hypersensitivity.\n\n**ASCENIV™ Warnings and Precautions:**\n\nIgA-deficient patients with antibodies against IgA are at greater risk of developing severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. Have medications such as epinephrine available to treat any acute severe hypersensitivity reactions. [4, 5.1]\n\nThrombotic events have occurred in patients receiving IGIV treatments. Monitor patients with known risk factors for thrombotic events; consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity for patients at risk of hyperviscosity. [5.2, 5.4]\n\nIn patients at risk of developing acute renal failure. monitor renal function, including blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, and urine output. [5.3, 5.9]\n\nHyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity, and hyponatremia or pseudohyponatremia can occur in patients receiving IGIV treatment.\n\nAseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) has been reported with IGIV treatments, especially with high doses or rapid infusion. [5.5]\n\nHemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to IGIV treatment. Monitor patients for hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. [5.6]\n\nMonitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions (Transfusion-related acute lung injury [TRALI]). If transfusion related acute lung injury is suspected, test the product and patient for antineutrophil antibodies. [5.7]\n\nBecause this product is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent.\n\n**ASCENIV™ Adverse Reactions:**\n\nThe most common adverse reactions to ASCENIV (≥5% of study subjects) were headache, sinusitis, diarrhea, gastroenteritis viral, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, and nausea\n\nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ADMA Biologics at (800) 458-4244 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or [www.fda.gov/medwatch](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=lDUpbreF7b6O8Ht5Eg4ZoYoIwXPsi2pnE5yH6K1GoBJ4CT4NpaqHk9Jwon4x311dEybn6eIfJ79FpxV-WO4OdFPkxOGTelEcDPIbSubCZrM=).\n\n**About ADMA Biologics, Inc. (ADMA)**\n\nADMA Biologics is an end-to-end commercial biopharmaceutical company dedicated to manufacturing, marketing and developing specialty biologics for the treatment of immunodeficient patients at risk for infection and others at risk for certain infectious diseases.

The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance measure because we believe that it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period that exclude potential differences driven by the impact of variations of non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, as well as stock-based compensation or certain non-recurring items. The Company believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools used by our management and board of directors to assess our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company’s financial performance. Accordingly, this key business metric has limitations as an analytical tool. It should not be considered as an alternative to net income/loss or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Please refer to the tables below for the reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures for applicable periods.\n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\n_This press release contains “forward-looking statements” pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, about ADMA Biologics, Inc.

Respectively_\n\n_Conference Call Scheduled for Today at 4:30 p.m. ET_\n\nRAMSEY, N.J. and BOCA RATON, Fla., Nov. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ADMA Biologics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ADMA) (“ADMA,” the “Company,” or “we”), an end-to-end commercial biopharmaceutical company dedicated to manufacturing, marketing and developing specialty biologics, today announced its third quarter 2024 financial results and provided a business update.\n\n“ADMA delivered an outstanding third quarter, building on the momentum from the prior period with realized growth on both the top and bottom lines,” said Adam Grossman, President and Chief Executive Officer of ADMA. “As we enter the fourth quarter of 2024, we anticipate increasing gross margins, driven by a continued revenue mix shift toward ASCENIV. With increasing clarity around a potential billion-dollar revenue opportunity, ADMA’s growth prospects over both the near- and longer-term periods continues to strengthen. As a result of our ongoing operational success, we have yet again raised our top and bottom-line guidance for both 2024 and 2025.”\n\nMr. Grossman continued, “With this forecasted growth, we anticipate organically achieving a net leverage-neutral position in the fourth quarter of 2024, which would provide substantial balance sheet flexibility as we focus on maximizing stockholder value and lowering ADMA’s cost of capital. Throughout the third quarter, we advanced our intermediate-term growth initiatives, including enhancements to production yield processes and the successful production of a pilot-scale batch of our _S. pneumoniae_ hyperimmune globulin pipeline program, SG-001. Additionally, we are pleased to announce the appointment of KPMG LLP (KPMG) as our new independent auditor effective as of today. We thank CohnReznick for their 17 years of service and look forward to this next chapter with KPMG. We believe ADMA is well-positioned to close 2024 on a high note and to sustain our rapid growth trajectory into 2025 and beyond.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Milestones and Objectives:**\n\n  * **Compounding Growth.** Total revenue grew to $119.8 million, or 78% year-over-year. As a result, GAAP Net Income grew by 1,300% to $35.9 million and Adjusted EBITDA grew by 256% year-over-year to $45.4 million. The Company anticipates building on this momentum throughout the remainder of 2024 and into 2025.\n  * **Favorably Evolving Mix Shift.** The higher-margin product portfolio is expanding as a percentage of ADMA’s total revenue, with ASCENIV accounting for over 50% of the Company’s revenue. ADMA is actively taking steps to increase ASCENIV supply availability, which, if successful, could allow ASCENIV to become a significant majority of ADMA's total revenue in the future, driving further margin expansion and earnings growth.\n  * **Strengthened Balance Sheet.** Based on ADMA’s third quarter operating cash flow of $25.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA growth, the Company’s current net leverage ratio has organically improved to approximately 0.1x. The Company anticipates continued strengthening of the balance sheet driven by forecasted Adjusted EBITDA growth and ongoing cash generation in the fourth quarter of 2024 and beyond.\n  * **Strengthened Governance.** ADMA has successfully engaged and onboarded KPMG as its new independent registered public accounting firm. This auditor transition to a “Big 4” firm is a testament to the Company’s rapidly improving financial profile and market cap valuation.\n  * **Added to the S &P SmallCap 600 Index. **During the third quarter, ADMA joined the S&P SmallCap 600 Index. The Company expects this inclusion will increase its visibility within the investment community and the liquidity of its shares as it continues to execute on its top-tier growth strategy. The S&P SmallCap 600 Index is a stock market index established by Standard & Poor's that is designed to measure the performance of the small-cap segment of the market and is composed of 600 constituent companies in the U.S. equities market. The index is designed to track companies that meet specific inclusion criteria to ensure that they are liquid and financially viable. For more information on the S&P SmallCap 600 and S&P Dow Jones Indices, please visit www.spdji.com.\n  * **Expanded ADMAlytics™ Implementation.** ADMA successfully expanded implementation of ADMAlytics, the Company’s artificial intelligence and machine learning platform, to the commercial arm of the organization during the third quarter. When fully implemented, ADMAlytics is expected to further optimize the Company’s commercial growth strategy. Initiated in February 2024, the staggered implementation of ADMAlytics continues to yield impressive results across multiple areas of ADMA’s operations. These benefits include increased production efficiency, enhanced visibility into the 7–12-month manufacturing process, optimized commercial planning, streamlined plasma pooling, and reduced variability and FTE hours. These efficiencies are expected to further benefit ADMA’s rapid earnings growth outlook.\n\n\n\n**Upwardly Revised 2024-2025 Financial Guidance:**\n\n  * FY 2024 and 2025 total revenue is now expected to be more than $415 million and $465 million, respectively, increased from prior guidance of more than $400 million and $445 million, respectively.\n  * FY 2024 and 2025 GAAP net income is now expected to exceed $120 million and $165 million, respectively, increased from prior guidance of $105 million and $155 million, respectively.\n  * FY 2024 and 2025 Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to exceed $160 million and $215 million, respectively, increased from prior guidance of $150 million and $200 million, respectively.\n\n\n\n**Advancing Innovative Growth Opportunities:** Below are the Company’s ongoing R&D initiatives which, if successful, we believe represent the potential for upside to our current forecasted guidance:\n\n  * **Biologic Production Yield Enhancement.** During the third quarter and recent periods, commercial-scale production of ADMA's innovative biologics manufacturing process demonstrated a potential enhancement of yields by approximately 20% from the same starting plasma. If successful, we believe these yield improvements could significantly increase the Company’s peak financial targets, with potential revenue and earnings accretion expected to commence in the second half of 2025 and further inflect into 2026 and beyond.\n  * **R &D Program - ****_S. pneumoniae_****Hyperimmune Globulin, SG-001.** ADMA has successfully completed production of a pilot-scale batch, and we have identified a prospective laboratory partner and are engaged in discussions for their services conducting animal model studies for our _S. pneumoniae_ hyperimmune globulin program, SG-001. We expect to establish research protocols for forthcoming animal studies, with a focus on capital efficiency. Streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia in the United States, affects one million adults annually, leading to 400,000 hospitalizations and a 5-7% mortality rate. Despite existing vaccines, vaccine-naive and immunocompromised individuals remain vulnerable. SG-001, if approved, could offer immediate antibody protection, potentially generating $300-500 million or more in high margin revenue annually. ADMA holds several U.S. and foreign patents covering its proprietary pneumococcal hyperimmune technology, including product preparation and usage for _S. pneumoniae_ infections.\n\n\n  * **ASCENIV Label Expansion:** All pediatric patients in ASCENIV’s post-marketing pediatric study have now successfully completed their treatment schedule and the clinical trial database is on track to be locked in the fourth quarter of 2024. ADMA now anticipates filing its supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) over the coming quarters, with potential label-expanding approval in the first half of 2026. ASCENIV’s pediatric label expansion, if approved, may further strengthen ADMA’s product portfolio.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results:**\n\nTotal revenues were $119.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $67.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $52.6 million, or approximately 78%. The increase is due to increased sales of ADMA’s immunoglobulin products, primarily ASCENIV, as well as an increase in third-party plasma sales by ADMA’s BioCenters business segment.\n\nGross profits were $59.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $24.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $35.0 million. As a result, ADMA achieved a corporate gross margin of 50% in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 37% in the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2024 corporate gross margins were adversely impacted due to an outsized sale of normal source plasma on the secondary spot market, which was recorded at a negative gross margin contribution.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $45.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $12.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $32.6 million, or approximately 256%.\n\nGAAP net income was $35.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to GAAP net Income of $2.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1,300%.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, ADMA had working capital of approximately $273.3 million, primarily consisting of $171.8 million of inventory, $86.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $50.1 million of net accounts receivable, partially offset by current liabilities of $44.9 million.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nTo access the conference call, please dial (888) 596-4144 and refer to conference ID 2959956.

ASCENIV was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2019 and is indicated for the treatment of primary humoral immunodeficiency (PI), also known as primary immune deficiency disease (PIDD), in adults and adolescents (12 to 17 years of age). ASCENIV is manufactured using ADMA’s unique, patented plasma donor screening methodology and tailored plasma pooling design, which blends normal source plasma and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) plasma obtained from donors tested using the Company’s proprietary microneutralization assay. ASCENIV contains naturally occurring polyclonal antibodies, which are proteins that are used by the body’s immune system to neutralize microbes such as bacteria and viruses that safeguard against infection and disease. ASCENIV is protected by numerous issued patents in the United States and internationally and a wide range of patent applications worldwide. Certain data and other information about ASCENIV can be found by visiting www.asceniv.com. Information about ADMA and its products can be found on the Company’s website at www.admabiologics.com.\n\n**Additional Important Safety Information About ASCENIV™**\n\nWARNING: THROMBOSIS, RENAL DYSFUNCTION AND ACUTE RENAL FAILUREThrombosis may occur with immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) products, including ASCENIV. Risk factors may include: advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous or arterial thrombosis, use of estrogens, indwelling vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, and cardiovascular risk factors.Renal dysfunction, acute renal failure, osmotic nephrosis, and death may occur with the administration of IGIV products in predisposed patients.Renal dysfunction and acute renal failure occur more commonly in patients receiving IGIV products containing sucrose. ASCENIV does not contain sucrose.For patients at risk of thrombosis, renal dysfunction or renal failure, administer ASCENIV at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable. Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity.  \n---  \n  \n**ASCENIV™ Contraindications:**\n\nHistory of anaphylactic or severe systemic reactions to human immunoglobulin.\n\nIgA deficient patients with antibodies to IgA and a history of hypersensitivity.\n\n**ASCENIV™ Warnings and Precautions:**\n\nIgA-deficient patients with antibodies against IgA are at greater risk of developing severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. Have medications such as epinephrine available to treat any acute severe hypersensitivity reactions. [4, 5.1]\n\nThrombotic events have occurred in patients receiving IGIV treatments. Monitor patients with known risk factors for thrombotic events; consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity for patients at risk of hyperviscosity. [5.2, 5.4]\n\nIn patients at risk of developing acute renal failure. monitor renal function, including blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, and urine output. [5.3, 5.9]\n\nHyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity, and hyponatremia or pseudohyponatremia can occur in patients receiving IGIV treatment.\n\nAseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) has been reported with IGIV treatments, especially with high doses or rapid infusion. [5.5]\n\nHemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to IGIV treatment. Monitor patients for hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. [5.6]\n\nMonitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions (Transfusion-related acute lung injury [TRALI]). If transfusion related acute lung injury is suspected, test the product and patient for antineutrophil antibodies. [5.7]\n\nBecause this product is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent.\n\n**ASCENIV™ Adverse Reactions:**\n\nThe most common adverse reactions to ASCENIV (≥5% of study subjects) were headache, sinusitis, diarrhea, gastroenteritis viral, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, and nausea\n\nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ADMA Biologics at (800) 458-4244 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or [www.fda.gov/medwatch](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=hihilSH1p4m59lWTVGcsRBiOzdvd49_aAhXldc5zIJtVDii9IeW3nAr0D4i7huyOZTMPhJZAw9bEw3YF1iYtlDIHN7xeBPdEuzDc7izNUK0=).\n\n**About ADMA Biologics, Inc. (ADMA)**\n\nADMA Biologics is an end-to-end commercial biopharmaceutical company dedicated to manufacturing, marketing and developing specialty biologics for the treatment of immunodeficient patients at risk for infection and others at risk for certain infectious diseases.

The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance measure because we believe that it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period that exclude potential differences driven by the impact of variations of non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, as well as stock-based compensation or certain non-recurring items. The Company believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools used by our management and board of directors to assess our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company’s financial performance. Accordingly, this key business metric has limitations as an analytical tool. It should not be considered as an alternative to net income/loss or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Please refer to the tables below for the reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures for applicable periods.\n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\n_This press release contains “forward-looking statements” pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, about ADMA Biologics, Inc.

Scheduled for Today at 4:30 p.m. ET_\n\nRAMSEY, N.J. and BOCA RATON, Fla., Aug. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ADMA Biologics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ADMA) (“ADMA” or the “Company”), an end-to-end commercial biopharmaceutical company dedicated to manufacturing, marketing and developing specialty biologics, today announced its second quarter 2024 financial results and provided a business update.\n\n\"ADMA’s excellent second quarter results showcased the strength of our operations, innovative business and product offerings, enabling the Company to significantly increase both 2024 and 2025 financial guidance,” said Adam Grossman, President and Chief Executive Officer of ADMA. “We believe the Company is well-positioned to further strengthen its balance sheet, reduce the cost of capital and sustain ADMA’s position as one of the fastest growing and profitable companies in the biotech and pharma sector.”\n\nMr. Grossman continued, “ADMA’s commitment to serving immunodeficient patients, particularly those with complex comorbidities, remains the cornerstone of our mission. We see additional opportunities for ADMA to continue to grow substantially in the underserved, immune compromised and co-morbid patient population despite the availability of standard of care therapy. We are confident that incremental additional penetration with ASCENIV will accelerate near-term revenue growth and create a substantial peak revenue opportunity beyond our 2025 guided baseline. Looking to the remainder of 2024, we expect continued revenue and earnings growth, advancement of regulatory processes for manufacturing yield enhancement, favorable product mix shifts, and progress in our R&D programs.”\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Milestones and Objectives:**\n\n  * **Compounding Growth.** Driven by 78% year-over-year revenue growth, ADMA grew Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income to $44.5 million and $32.1 million, respectively, during the second quarter. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, Adjusted EBITDA grew 69% and Net Income grew 80% compared to the first quarter of 2024. The Company anticipates building on this momentum throughout the remainder of 2024 and beyond.\n  * **Favorably Evolving Mix Shift.** ADMA’s higher margin product portfolio now accounts for over 50% of the Company’s total revenue. ADMA is actively implementing measures to increase ASCENIV supply. If successful, these initiatives could enable ASCENIV to contribute a significant majority of ADMA's total revenue over time, further advancing the Company's potential margin expansion and earnings growth.\n  * **Strengthened Balance Sheet.** Based on ADMA’s second quarter operating cash flow of $45.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA growth, the Company’s current net leverage ratio has organically improved to approximately 0.26x. The Company anticipates continued strengthening of the balance sheet driven by forecasted Adjusted EBITDA growth and ongoing cash generation in the second half of 2024 and beyond.\n  * **Updated Marketing Materials.** During the second quarter, ADMA revamped its corporate website, product websites and certain marketing materials, including those for Healthcare Providers (HCP). Additionally, the Company released a new video testimonial on the ASCENIV product website, highlighting the treatment journey of a co-morbid and refractive immunodeficient patient.\n  * **Expanded ADMAlytics™ Implementation.** ADMA successfully expanded implementation of ADMAlytics to the commercial arm of the organization during the second quarter. When fully implemented, ADMAlytics is expected to further optimize the Company’s commercial growth strategy. Initiated in February 2024, the staggered implementation of ADMAlytics continues to yield impressive results across multiple areas of ADMA’s operations. These benefits include increased production efficiency, enhanced visibility into the 7–12-month manufacturing process, optimized commercial planning, streamlined plasma pooling, and reduced variability and FTE hours. These efficiencies are expected to further solidify ADMA’s rapid earnings growth outlook.\n\n\n\n**Upwardly Revised 2024-2025 Financial Guidance:**\n\n  * FY 2024 and 2025 total revenue is now expected to be more than $400 million and $445 million, respectively, increased from prior guidance of more than $355 million and $410 million, respectively.\n  * FY 2024 and 2025 net income is now expected to exceed $105 million and $155 million, respectively, increased from prior guidance of $85 million and $135 million, respectively.\n  * FY 2024 and 2025 Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to exceed $150 million and $200 million, respectively, increased from prior guidance of $110 million and $160 million, respectively.\n\n\n\n**Advancing Innovative Growth Opportunities:** Below are the Company’s ongoing initiatives which, if successful, we believe represent the potential for upside to our current forecasted guidance:\n\n  * **Biologic Production Yield Enhancement:** During the second quarter and recent periods, commercial-scale production of ADMA's innovative biologics manufacturing process demonstrated a potential enhancement of yields by approximately 20% from the same starting plasma. If successful, we believe these yield improvements could significantly boost the Company’s future peak financial targets, potentially as early as the fourth quarter of 2025.\n  * **R &D Program - ****_S. pneumonia_****Hyperimmune Globulin:** Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia in the U.S., with about one million adults developing pneumococcal pneumonia annually, resulting in 400,000 hospitalizations and a 5-7% mortality rate. Despite vaccines, vaccine-naive and immune-compromised individuals remain at risk. A hyperimmune globulin could provide immediate antibodies, potentially generating $300-500 million annually if approved. ADMA holds various U.S. and foreign patents which cover its proprietary pneumococcal hyperimmune technology, including hyperimmune anti-pneumococcal immune globulin, preparation methods, and its use in treating S. pneumonia infections.\n  * **ASCENIV Label Expansion:** The ongoing post-marketing pediatric clinical study for ASCENIV may provide label expansion opportunities, further strengthening ADMA’s product portfolio, if successful.\n\n\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results:**\n\nTotal revenues were $107.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $60.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, an increase of $47.1 million, or approximately 78%. The increase is primarily related to increased sales of ASCENIV. During the second quarter, the Company recognized a non-recurring, $12.6 million increase to net revenues and a corresponding reduction of an accrual related to a change in estimate for U.S. Medicaid rebates.\n\nGross profits were $57.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $16.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, an increase of $40.8 million. As a result, ADMA achieved a corporate gross margin of 53.6% in the second quarter of 2024 as compared to 27.8% in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $44.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $6.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, an increase of $38.1 million, or approximately 592%.\n\nGAAP Net income was $32.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to a GAAP Net Loss of $6.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. \n\nAs of June 30, 2024, ADMA had working capital of approximately $259.5 million, primarily consisting of $179.8 million of inventory, $88.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $30.1 million of net accounts receivable, partially offset by current liabilities of $44.2 million. \n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nTo access the conference call seamlessly, participants are required to register for the call [** _here_**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jilsAgGN7_ZfI5le3IHl5QWhNZmkfaY8bruY4WAN5oji_U8lPMoymvbUfkoJ7fzdrVXsnD6Jo9Ty_GmJEIYNDNRHKrssogJjSewaP7zHRNS3q5ZdcmGT2hjPMseM2hR3gKm6HIeFim8IMg1t4DTwhfTkwwrGcU-8aYC3s1SyRrll9Wc3VbRSIHcQLCz0cQwlOoCB6ZUHY8RVtJeaACPbmwd2fHM7me_N_IuCqWSQIs2RN1Plm_4dzoFFwH3Dt0kTO21fYIkvKcttuVm-dbU168O9NYuOmNnkU3PyECEFS-1hwOCrBoiCJHpRwLVdddCY3Zz9wmWTIMYZWBBo9skg9knysaVbiGpeAjRClSQB9E69Kqx6J-KInyP_9d3xisCTd08J0Pb_DN3UxY0bYg5JMm1keQ2Be8GmxRkfOlOU8WrqrkDgHY6farwD4FByiD10URzO9Zl3qBu9TuzbZ08lzEjahbKStGp97gnRY10mJ0eSN7ssBTU4jLTwJmwbkAEUZwo0G5hQGFSxwUlMGpnEiFaU_q0VroiyUZsQBVCumB5pv9pR9ni8lp8_l6gmbg-d1YkjiImBnVFUb42h9zbEkseg8kamf9CSO5E4MtLtGI49RM7yxDtxD_JShYy3HUwj) to receive the dial-in numbers and unique PIN.

ASCENIV was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2019 and is indicated for the treatment of primary humoral immunodeficiency (PI), also known as primary immune deficiency disease (PIDD), in adults and adolescents (12 to 17 years of age). ASCENIV is manufactured using ADMA’s unique, patented plasma donor screening methodology and tailored plasma pooling design, which blends normal source plasma and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) plasma obtained from donors tested using the Company’s proprietary microneutralization assay. ASCENIV contains naturally occurring polyclonal antibodies, which are proteins that are used by the body’s immune system to neutralize microbes such as bacteria and viruses that safeguard against infection and disease. ASCENIV is protected by numerous issued patents in the United States and internationally and a wide range of patent applications worldwide. Certain data and other information about ASCENIV can be found by visiting www.asceniv.com. Information about ADMA and its products can be found on the Company’s website at www.admabiologics.com.\n\n**Additional Important Safety Information About ASCENIV™**\n\nWARNING: THROMBOSIS, RENAL DYSFUNCTION AND ACUTE RENAL FAILURE  \n---  \nThrombosis may occur with immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) products, including ASCENIV. Risk factors may include: advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous or arterial thrombosis, use of estrogens, indwelling vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, and cardiovascular risk factors.Renal dysfunction, acute renal failure, osmotic nephrosis, and death may occur with the administration of IGIV products in predisposed patients.Renal dysfunction and acute renal failure occur more commonly in patients receiving IGIV products containing sucrose. ASCENIV does not contain sucrose.For patients at risk of thrombosis, renal dysfunction or renal failure, administer ASCENIV at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable. Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity.  \n  \n**ASCENIV™ Contraindications:**\n\nHistory of anaphylactic or severe systemic reactions to human immunoglobulin.\n\nIgA deficient patients with antibodies to IgA and a history of hypersensitivity.\n\n**ASCENIV™ Warnings and Precautions:**\n\nIgA-deficient patients with antibodies against IgA are at greater risk of developing severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. Have medications such as epinephrine available to treat any acute severe hypersensitivity reactions. [4, 5.1]\n\nThrombotic events have occurred in patients receiving IGIV treatments. Monitor patients with known risk factors for thrombotic events; consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity for patients at risk of hyperviscosity. [5.2, 5.4]\n\nIn patients at risk of developing acute renal failure. monitor renal function, including blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, and urine output. [5.3, 5.9]\n\nHyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity, and hyponatremia or pseudohyponatremia can occur in patients receiving IGIV treatment.\n\nAseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) has been reported with IGIV treatments, especially with high doses or rapid infusion. [5.5]\n\nHemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to IGIV treatment. Monitor patients for hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. [5.6]\n\nMonitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions (Transfusion-related acute lung injury [TRALI]). If transfusion related acute lung injury is suspected, test the product and patient for antineutrophil antibodies. [5.7]\n\nBecause this product is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent.\n\n**ASCENIV™ Adverse Reactions:**\n\nThe most common adverse reactions to ASCENIV (≥5% of study subjects) were headache, sinusitis, diarrhea, gastroenteritis viral, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, and nausea\n\nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ADMA Biologics at (800) 458-4244 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or [www.fda.gov/medwatch](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=lDUpbreF7b6O8Ht5Eg4ZoYoIwXPsi2pnE5yH6K1GoBJ4CT4NpaqHk9Jwon4x311dEybn6eIfJ79FpxV-WO4OdFPkxOGTelEcDPIbSubCZrM=).\n\n**About ADMA Biologics, Inc.

The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance measure because we believe that it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period that exclude potential differences driven by the impact of variations of non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, as well as stock-based compensation or certain non-recurring items. The Company believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools used by our management and board of directors to assess our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company’s financial performance. Accordingly, this key business metric has limitations as an analytical tool. It should not be considered as an alternative to net income/loss or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Please refer to the tables below for the reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures for applicable periods.\n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\n_This press release contains “forward-looking statements” pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, about ADMA Biologics, Inc.
