(NASDAQ: AUPH) (Aurinia or the Company) commends the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) for their 2024 evidence-based guidelines for the screening, treatment, and management of lupus nephritis (LN), which prioritize the urgent need to use efficacious treatments to avoid nephron loss and preserve kidney function. \n\nThe guidelines call for a triple immunosuppression treatment regimen for LN, with first line use of advanced therapies like LUPKYNIS for three to five years. Importantly, the guidelines suggest that steroids should be rapidly tapered to <5 mg/day by six months as the highest acceptable maintenance dose of steroids. The guidelines also call for achieving a proteinuria target of <0.5g/g urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) by 12 months of treatment. \n\nThe recommendations included within the guidelines for use of LUPKYNIS to treat LN were based on the AURORA Clinical Program, including the Phase 3 AURORA 1 clinical study. In AURORA 1, patients were 81% more likely to achieve a complete renal response1 at 52 weeks (40.8 vs 22.5 – OR 2.7) with LUPKYNIS in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and low-dose glucocorticoids, compared to MMF and low-dose glucocorticoids alone. Additionally, > 80% of patients were tapered to a steroid dose of <2.5mg / day by 16 weeks per the AURORA protocol, making LUPKYNIS the only therapy to meet and exceed the new guideline steroid target of <5mg /day by 6 months in randomized clinical trials. \n\nLUPKYNIS, the only FDA-approved CNI therapy for the treatment of adult patients with active LN in combination with other immunosuppressive therapies​, has demonstrated broad clinical utility across biopsy class, baseline eGFR, proteinuria range, race, ethnicity, age, and gender. Please see Indication and Important Safey Information, including Boxed Warning, below. \n\nThe guidelines recommend routine urine screening for proteinuria at least every six to 12 months in patients with SLE without known kidney disease, or when experiencing extra-renal flares. They also conditionally recommend performing a kidney biopsy in patients with SLE who have high levels of protein in the urine (> 0.5 g/g) and/or impaired kidney function not otherwise explained. \n\n“We applaud ACR’s critical and timely guidelines to improve the management of lupus nephritis for this underserved patient population. They provide clear guidance for the importance of early diagnosis and starting with triple immunosuppression therapy with CNIs like LUPKYNIS to help achieve a complete renal response and aid in preserving kidney function for adults living with lupus nephritis,” said Dr. Greg Keenan, Chief Medical Officer at Aurinia. \n\nThe updated ACR guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of LN are based on systematic evidence reviews, feedback from a panel of people living with LN, and input from rheumatologists and nephrologists. \n\n**About LUPKYNIS**\n\nLUPKYNIS is a novel, structurally modified calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) with a dual mechanism of action, acting as an immunosuppressant through inhibition of T-cell activation and cytokine production and promoting podocyte stability in the kidney. The AURORA Clinical Program, comprised of the AURORA 1 pivotal trial and AURORA 2 extension trial, demonstrated the importance of LUPKYNIS plus standard of care to preserve kidney health in patients with active LN without reliance on chronic high-dose glucocorticoids. It is the only clinical program to include three years of LN treatment and follow-up with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and steroids. \n\n**About Aurinia**\n\nAurinia Pharmaceuticals is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering therapies to people living with autoimmune diseases with high unmet medical needs. In January 2021, the Company introduced LUPKYNIS® (voclosporin), the first FDA-approved oral therapy dedicated to the treatment of adult patients with active lupus nephritis. Aurinia is also developing AUR200, a differentiated, potential best-in-class therapy for autoimmune diseases that targets both BAFF (B-cell Activating Factor) and APRIL (A Proliferation-Inducing Ligand). \n\n**INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**INDICATION**\n\nLUPKYNIS is indicated in combination with a background immunosuppressive therapy regimen for the treatment of adult patients with active lupus nephritis (LN). \n\nLimitations of Use: Safety and efficacy of LUPKYNIS have not been established in combination with cyclophosphamide. Use of LUPKYNIS is not recommended in this situation. \n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**BOXED WARNINGS: MALIGNANCIES AND SERIOUS INFECTIONS**\n\n**Increased risk for developing malignancies and serious infections with LUPKYNIS or other immunosuppressants that may lead to hospitalization or death.**\n\n**CONTRAINDICATIONS:** LUPKYNIS is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors because of the increased risk of acute and/or chronic nephrotoxicity, and in patients who have had a serious/severe hypersensitivity reaction to LUPKYNIS or its excipients. \n\n**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS**\n\n**Lymphoma and Other Malignancies:** Immunosuppressants, including LUPKYNIS, increase the risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin. The risk appears to be related to increasing doses and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. \n\n**Serious Infections:** Immunosuppressants, including LUPKYNIS, increase the risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections which lead to serious, including fatal outcomes. \n\n**Nephrotoxicity:** LUPKYNIS, like other calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), may cause acute and/or chronic nephrotoxicity. The risk is increased when CNIs are concomitantly administered with drugs associated with nephrotoxicity. Monitor eGFR regularly. \n\n**Hypertension:** Hypertension is a common adverse reaction of LUPKYNIS therapy and may require antihypertensive therapy. Monitor blood pressure regularly. \n\n**Neurotoxicity:** LUPKYNIS, like other CNIs, may cause a spectrum of neurotoxicities: severe include posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), delirium, seizure, and coma; others include tremor, paresthesia, headache, and changes in mental status and/or motor and sensory functions. Monitor for neurologic symptoms. \n\n**Hyperkalemia:** Hyperkalemia, which may be serious and require treatment, has been reported with CNIs, including LUPKYNIS. Concomitant use of agents associated with hyperkalemia may increase the risk for hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium levels periodically. \n\n**QTc Prolongation:** LUPKYNIS prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-dependent manner when dosed higher than the recommended lupus nephritis therapeutic dose. The use of LUPKYNIS in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc may result in clinically significant QT prolongation. \n\n**Immunizations:** Avoid the use of live attenuated vaccines during treatment with LUPKYNIS. Inactivated vaccines noted to be safe for administration may not be sufficiently immunogenic during treatment with LUPKYNIS. \n\n**Pure Red Cell Aplasia:** Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with another CNI immunosuppressant. If PRCA is diagnosed, consider discontinuation of LUPKYNIS. \n\n**Drug-Drug Interactions:** Avoid co-administration of LUPKYNIS and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers. Co-administration of LUPKYNIS with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated. Reduce LUPKYNIS dosage when co-administered with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Avoid use of LUPKYNIS with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers. \n\n**ADVERSE REACTIONS**\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (≥3%) were glomerular filtration rate decreased, hypertension, diarrhea, headache, anemia, cough, urinary tract infection, abdominal pain upper, dyspepsia, alopecia, renal impairment, abdominal pain, mouth ulceration, fatigue, tremor, acute kidney injury, and decreased appetite. \n\n**SPECIFIC POPULATIONS**\n\n**Pregnancy:** Avoid use of LUPKYNIS. \n\n**Lactation:** Consider the mother’s clinical need for LUPKYNIS and any potential adverse effects to the breastfed infant when prescribing LUPKYNIS to a lactating woman. \n\n**Renal Impairment:** LUPKYNIS is not recommended in patients with baseline eGFR ≤45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 unless benefit exceeds risk. If used in this population, reduce LUPKYNIS dose. \n\n**Hepatic Impairment:** For mild or moderate hepatic impairment, reduce LUPKYNIS dose. Avoid use with severe hepatic impairment. \n\nPlease see [Prescribing Information](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_b4ffa8fe4f06307db83aaab31aa39fb6/auriniapharma/files/pages/auriniapharma/db/416/description/LUPKYNIS_PRESCRIBING_INFORMATION_FINAL.pdf), including Boxed Warning, and [Medication Guide](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_b4ffa8fe4f06307db83aaab31aa39fb6/auriniapharma/files/pages/auriniapharma/db/416/description/LUPKYNIS_MEDICATION_GUIDE_FINAL.pdf) for LUPKYNIS. \n\n**References**\n\n  1. 2024 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guideline for the Screening, Treatment, and Management of Lupus Nephritis.

(NASDAQ: AUPH) (Aurinia or the Company), announced today the acceptance of four poster presentations at the annual American College of Rheumatology Convergence (ACR) 2024 taking place in Washington, D.C., November 14-19. The data highlight the need for additional screening for lupus nephritis (LN), a serious manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and reinforce the clinical importance of LUPKYNIS® (voclosporin), a second generation calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), for the treatment of adults with active LN. \n\n“The data we are presenting at ACR highlight the pivotal role the rheumatology community must play in diagnosing and managing lupus nephritis. Rheumatologists are on the frontlines of ensuring early detection through routine screenings and of managing LN appropriately with LUPKYNIS, which is backed by robust clinical and real-world evidence,” said Dr. Greg Keenan, Chief Medical Officer of Aurinia. \n\n**New real-world demographic data highlight high prevalence of LN among people with SLE**\n\nUsing the American Rheumatology Network (ARN) electronic medical records database to understand potential renal involvement and possible signs of LN, the study included 8,631 SLE patients receiving care from community rheumatologists over a five-year time period. The analysis found that 62% of these SLE patients had ICD-10 coding or clinical laboratory measurements suggestive of LN. Of the patients with suspected LN, 97% had an eGFR assessment, compared to 66% and 62% of patients who had a protein assessment by urine test strip or urine protein, respectively. Additionally, 40% of the patients with suspected LN had an ICD-10 code specifically for LN, compared to 60% with ICD-10 codes indicating kidney conditions, eGFR decrease, or proteinuria. \n\n“The overwhelming majority of people living with SLE show signs of potential kidney involvement. However, our analysis suggests that many SLE patients are not receiving proper kidney screenings, and that LN is under-recognized and under-coded. A more proactive approach, including regular screening for proteinuria, is crucial for earlier detection and treatment of LN to minimize irreversible kidney damage,” said Dr. Nehad Soloman, lead study author and board-certified rheumatologist. \n\n**Rates of Sustained, Complete Renal Response with Long-Term Use of LUPKYNIS in LN**\n\nAn analysis from the Phase 3 AURORA 1 and 2 studies highlighted the long-term efficacy of LUPKYNIS in people with LN. This study focused on a new efficacy endpoint, sustained complete renal response (SCRR), defined by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as achieving a complete renal response (CRR) at 12 months in AURORA 1 and at all study visits in the 2-year AURORA 2 continuation study. Significantly more LUPKYNIS patients achieved SCRR compared to patients receiving placebo. The SCRR endpoint was included in an FDA-approved label update for LUPKYNIS earlier this year. \n\nAdditional studies to be presented at ACR assessed the effectiveness of tools aimed at measuring patient-reported outcomes using data from the AURORA clinical program. \n\n**Following is the complete guide to Aurinia’s accepted abstracts at ACR 2024:**\n\n**Title:**_Validity, Reliability and Responsiveness of Lupus Impact Tracker and LupusPRO: AURORA Trial_**Authors:** Meenakshi Jolly, Matt Truman, Ronald Flauto, Kathryn Dao **Date:** Saturday, November 16, 2024 **Time:** 10:30 a.m. – 12:30 p.m. ET **Abstract Number:** 0661 \n\n**Title:**_Rates of Sustained Complete Renal Response with Long-term Use of Voclosporin in AURORA 2_**Authors:** Ernie Yap, Matt Truman, Cynthia Auguste, Vanessa Birardi, Greg Keenan **Date:** Sunday, November 17, 2024 **Time:** 10:30 a.m. – 12:30 p.m. ET **Abstract Number:** 1545 \n\n**Title:**_Patient Reported Outcomes Analyses from AURORA 1 Clinical Trial: Lupus Impact Tracker and LupusPRO_**Authors:** Meenakshi Jolly, Matt Truman, Ronald Flauto, Kathryn Dao **Date:** Sunday, November 17, 2024 **Time:** 10:30 a.m. – 12:30 p.m. ET **Abstract Number:** 1538 \n\n**Title:**_Characterizing the Population with Suspected Lupus Nephritis in Care of a Community Rheumatology Network_**Authors:** Nehad Soloman, Jawad Bilal, Romy Cabacungan, Scott Milligan, Andrew Sharobeem, John Tesser, Henry Leher **Date:** Monday, November 18, 2024 **Time:** 10:30 a.m. – 12:30 p.m. ET **Abstract Number:** 2415 \n\n**About Lupus Nephritis** Lupus nephritis (LN) is a serious manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a chronic and complex autoimmune disease. LN affects approximately 120,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affects women and people of color. People living with LN have high unmet needs and often face significant barriers to optimal care. If poorly controlled, LN can lead to permanent and irreversible tissue damage within the kidney. \n\nMedical guidelines recommend that all SLE patients receive routine LN screenings at every visit. Guidelines also note that delaying LN diagnosis has profound prognostic repercussions. Yet, research shows that approximately 50% of SLE patients are not screened for LN and 77% of people with LN go untreated. Aurinia is committed to improving health outcomes for people living with LN by educating patients and providers on the critical need for routine screening and transformative therapies that can help improve health outcomes. \n\n**About LUPKYNIS** LUPKYNIS is a second generation calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) with a dual mechanism of action, acting as an immunosuppressant through inhibition of T-cell activation and cytokine production and promoting podocyte stability in the kidney. The AURORA Clinical Program, comprised of the AURORA 1 pivotal trial and AURORA 2 extension trial, demonstrated the importance of LUPKYNIS plus standard of care to preserve kidney health in patients with active LN without reliance on chronic high-dose glucocorticoids. It is the only clinical program to include three years of LN treatment and follow-up with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and steroids. \n\n**About Aurinia** Aurinia Pharmaceuticals is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering therapies to people living with autoimmune diseases with high unmet medical needs. In January 2021, the Company introduced LUPKYNIS® (voclosporin), the first FDA-approved oral therapy dedicated to the treatment of adult patients with active lupus nephritis. Aurinia is also developing AUR200, a differentiated, potential best-in-class therapy for autoimmune diseases that targets both BAFF (B-cell Activating Factor) and APRIL (A Proliferation-Inducing Ligand). \n\n**INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**INDICATION**\n\nLUPKYNIS is indicated in combination with a background immunosuppressive therapy regimen for the treatment of adult patients with active lupus nephritis (LN). \n\nLimitations of Use: Safety and efficacy of LUPKYNIS have not been established in combination with cyclophosphamide. Use of LUPKYNIS is not recommended in this situation. \n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**BOXED WARNINGS: MALIGNANCIES AND SERIOUS INFECTIONS**\n\n**Increased risk for developing malignancies and serious infections with LUPKYNIS or other immunosuppressants that may lead to hospitalization or death.**\n\n**CONTRAINDICATIONS:** LUPKYNIS is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors because of the increased risk of acute and/or chronic nephrotoxicity, and in patients who have had a serious/severe hypersensitivity reaction to LUPKYNIS or its excipients. \n\n**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS**\n\n**Lymphoma and Other Malignancies:** Immunosuppressants, including LUPKYNIS, increase the risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin. The risk appears to be related to increasing doses and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. \n\n**Serious Infections:** Immunosuppressants, including LUPKYNIS, increase the risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections which lead to serious, including fatal outcomes. \n\n**Nephrotoxicity:** LUPKYNIS, like other calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), may cause acute and/or chronic nephrotoxicity. The risk is increased when CNIs are concomitantly administered with drugs associated with nephrotoxicity. Monitor eGFR regularly. \n\n**Hypertension:** Hypertension is a common adverse reaction of LUPKYNIS therapy and may require antihypertensive therapy. Monitor blood pressure regularly. \n\n**Neurotoxicity:** LUPKYNIS, like other CNIs, may cause a spectrum of neurotoxicities: severe include posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), delirium, seizure, and coma; others include tremor, paresthesia, headache, and changes in mental status and/or motor and sensory functions. Monitor for neurologic symptoms. \n\n**Hyperkalemia:** Hyperkalemia, which may be serious and require treatment, has been reported with CNIs, including LUPKYNIS. Concomitant use of agents associated with hyperkalemia may increase the risk for hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium levels periodically. \n\n**QTc Prolongation:** LUPKYNIS prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-dependent manner when dosed higher than the recommended lupus nephritis therapeutic dose. The use of LUPKYNIS in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc may result in clinically significant QT prolongation. \n\n**Immunizations:** Avoid the use of live attenuated vaccines during treatment with LUPKYNIS. Inactivated vaccines noted to be safe for administration may not be sufficiently immunogenic during treatment with LUPKYNIS. \n\n**Pure Red Cell Aplasia:** Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with another CNI immunosuppressant. If PRCA is diagnosed, consider discontinuation of LUPKYNIS. \n\n**Drug-Drug Interactions:** Avoid co-administration of LUPKYNIS and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers. Co-administration of LUPKYNIS with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated. Reduce LUPKYNIS dosage when co-administered with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Avoid use of LUPKYNIS with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers. \n\n**ADVERSE REACTIONS**\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (≥3%) were glomerular filtration rate decreased, hypertension, diarrhea, headache, anemia, cough, urinary tract infection, abdominal pain upper, dyspepsia, alopecia, renal impairment, abdominal pain, mouth ulceration, fatigue, tremor, acute kidney injury, and decreased appetite. \n\n**SPECIFIC POPULATIONS**\n\n**Pregnancy:** Avoid use of LUPKYNIS. \n\n**Lactation:** Consider the mother’s clinical need for LUPKYNIS and any potential adverse effects to the breastfed infant when prescribing LUPKYNIS to a lactating woman. \n\n**Renal Impairment:** LUPKYNIS is not recommended in patients with baseline eGFR ≤45 mL/min/1.73 m2 unless benefit exceeds risk. If used in this population, reduce LUPKYNIS dose. \n\n**Hepatic Impairment:** For mild or moderate hepatic impairment, reduce LUPKYNIS dose. Avoid use with severe hepatic impairment. \n\nPlease see [Prescribing Information](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_b4ffa8fe4f06307db83aaab31aa39fb6/auriniapharma/files/pages/auriniapharma/db/416/description/LUPKYNIS_PRESCRIBING_INFORMATION_FINAL.pdf), including Boxed Warning, and [Medication Guide](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_b4ffa8fe4f06307db83aaab31aa39fb6/auriniapharma/files/pages/auriniapharma/db/416/description/LUPKYNIS_MEDICATION_GUIDE_FINAL.pdf) for LUPKYNIS. \n\nView source version on businesswire.com: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241115824168/en/>\n\n**Media & Investor Inquiries: **Andrea Christopher Corporate Communications & Investor Relations Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc. achristopher@auriniapharma.com  **General Investor Inquiries:**ir@auriniapharma.com\n\nSource: Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc.\n\nReleased November 15, 2024\n\n  * [ Email Alerts ](/investors-and-media/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [ Company Profile ](/investors-and-media/company-information)\n  * [ Contacts ](/investors-and-media/company-information/contacts)\n  * [ RSS News Feed ](https://www.auriniapharma.com/investors-and-media/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n\n©2024 Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc.

(NASDAQ: AUPH) (Aurinia or the Company) today issued its financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. With continued strong commercial execution, the Company achieved significant year-over-year growth in total net revenue and net product revenue and $17.0 million in cash flow from operations in the third quarter. Having achieved $158.6 million in net product revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company is reiterating its net product revenue guidance range of $210 to $220 million for fiscal year 2024. \n\nAurinia is implementing a strategic restructuring to sharpen the Company’s focus on continued LUPKYNIS® growth and the rapid development of AUR200. This restructuring will result in a workforce reduction of approximately 45% and will focus the Company’s LUPKYNIS commercial strategy on the highest growth drivers. The restructuring will also improve operational efficiency, with anticipated post-restructuring annualized cash-based operating expense savings of more than $40 million. \n\n“We are pleased to report continued strong momentum through the first nine months of the year,” stated Peter Greenleaf, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aurinia. “Going forward, our streamlined organization will enable us to lean further into key areas of the commercial LUPKYNIS business that have historically delivered optimal returns, while at the same time accelerating the development of our important pipeline product, AUR200.” \n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the Company added 364 PSFs and 146 new patients who were either restarting LUPKYNIS or receiving it through a hospital pharmacy. Together, these total 510, which is 17% higher than the 436 PSFs in the third quarter of 2023. Conversion rates (PSFs converted to patients on therapy), time to conversion, and adherence rates remained consistent with the prior quarter. \n\n**Recent Milestones Achieved**\n\n  * In September 2024, the first participant was dosed in a Phase 1 study of AUR200, a differentiated, potential best-in-class therapy for autoimmune diseases that targets both BAFF (B-cell Activating Factor) and APRIL (A Proliferation-Inducing Ligand). The Company continues to expect to report initial results from this study in the first half of 2025. \n  * In September 2024, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare approved LUPKYNIS, triggering the recognition of an additional $10 million milestone payment from Aurinia’s collaboration partner, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. \n\n\n\n**Financial Results for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nTotal net revenue was $67.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and $54.5 million for the same period in 2023, representing growth of 24%. Year to date total net revenue was $175.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $130.4 million for the same period in 2023, representing growth of 34%. \n\nNet product revenue was $55.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and $40.8 million for the same period in 2023, representing growth of 36%. Net product revenue was $158.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and $116.2 million for the same period in 2023, representing growth of 36%. The increase in both periods is primarily due to increased LUPKYNIS sales to the Company’s two main specialty pharmacies, driven predominantly by further penetration of the lupus nephritis (LN) market. Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Aurinia had sales of semi-finished product to Otsuka to support continued commercialization in its territories. \n\nU.S. market penetration grew 25% year-over-year, with 2,422 patients on LUPKYNIS therapy as of September 30, 2024, compared to 1,939 as of September 30, 2023. \n\nLicense, collaboration, and royalty revenues were $12.3 million and $13.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively, and $16.7 million and $14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The revenue is primarily due to a $10.0 million milestone recognized in the third quarter of 2024 for the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare approval of LUPKYNIS and a $10.0 million milestone recognized in the third quarter of 2023 for pricing and reimbursement approval, coupled with manufacturing services revenue from Otsuka related to shared capacity services that commenced in late June 2023. \n\nCost of sales were $6.0 million and $6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively, and $22.7 million and $8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is primarily due to the amortization of the monoplant finance right of use asset, which was placed into service in late June 2023 and therefore only partially impacted prior year results. \n\nGross margin was 91% and 88% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively, and 87% and 93% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. \n\nSG&A expenses, inclusive of share-based compensation, were $42.4 million and $47.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively, and $135.0 million and $145.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in both periods is primarily due to lower employee related costs, including share-based compensation and overhead costs, as a result of a reduction in general and administrative headcount, which occurred late in the first quarter of 2024. \n\nR&D expenses, inclusive of share-based compensation expense, were $3.0 million and $13.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively, and $12.7 million and $39.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The primary drivers in both periods were lower employee costs due to a reduction in headcount late in the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of expenses related to ceasing Aurinia’s AUR300 development program, and timing of expenses related to developing AUR200. \n\nRestructuring expenses were nil and $7.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and nil for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Restructuring expenses primarily included employee severance, one-time benefit payments, and contract termination expenses related to the restructuring, which occurred late in the first quarter of 2024. \n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, Aurinia recorded net income of $14.4 million or $0.10 net income per common share, as compared to a net loss of $(13.4) million or $(0.09) net loss per common share for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Aurinia recorded a net income of $4.3 million or $0.03 net income per common share, as compared to a net loss of $(51.1) million or $(0.36) net loss per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. \n\n**Financial Liquidity at September 30, 2024**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Aurinia had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments of $348.7 million, compared to $350.7 million at December 31, 2023. \n\nCash flow from operations was $17.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $(13.3) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cash flow from operations was $14.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $(47.8) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. \n\nAll amounts in this press release are expressed in U.S. dollars.

In January 2021, the Company introduced LUPKYNIS® (voclosporin), the first FDA-approved oral therapy dedicated to the treatment of adult patients with active lupus nephritis. Aurinia is also developing AUR200, a differentiated, potential best-in-class therapy for autoimmune diseases that targets both BAFF (B-cell Activating Factor) and APRIL (A Proliferation-Inducing Ligand). \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nCertain statements made in this press release may constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities law and forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable United States securities law. These forward-looking statements or information include but are not limited to statements or information with respect to: Aurinia’s anticipation of a one-time restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2024 of $15 to $19 million, with post-restructuring annualized cash-based operating expense savings of more than $40 million; Aurinia’s estimates as to annual net product revenue from sales of LUPKYNIS in the range of $210 to $220 million in fiscal year 2024; Aurinia’s estimate that it will reduce its workforce by approximately 45%; and Aurinia’s expectation that its restructuring will further improve operational efficiency. It is possible that such results or conclusions may change. Words such as “anticipate”, “will”, “believe”, “estimate”, “expect”, “intend”, “target”, “plan”, “goals”, “objectives”, “may” and other similar words and expressions, identify forward-looking statements. The Company has made numerous assumptions about the forward-looking statements and information contained herein, including among other things, assumptions about: the accuracy of reported data from third party studies and reports; the expected number of patient start forms, patients restarting therapy, and hospital fills, conversion rates and time to convert for patients; pricing for LUPKYNIS and patient persistency on the product; that Aurinia’s intellectual property rights are valid and do not infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties; the clinical development opportunities for its pipeline products; Aurinia’s assumptions relating to the capital required to fund operations; the timing and ability to execute on Aurinia’s restructuring plans; the costs, benefits and scope of Aurinia’s restructuring plans; that Aurinia’s current good relationships with its suppliers, service providers and other third parties will be maintained; assumptions relating to the burn rate of Aurinia’s cash for operations; and that Aurinia’s third party service providers will comply with their contractual obligations. \n\nForward-looking information by their nature are based on assumptions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance, or achievements of Aurinia to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking information. Should one or more of these risks and uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in forward-looking statements or information. Such risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others, the following: Aurinia’s actual future financial and operational results may differ from its expectations; difficulties Aurinia may experience in completing the commercialization of LUPKYNIS; difficulties Aurinia may experience executing its restructuring program; challenges in the conduct of clinical studies; the market for the LN business may not be as estimated; Aurinia may have to pay unanticipated expenses; Aurinia may not be able to obtain sufficient supply to meet commercial demand for LUPKYNIS in a timely fashion; unknown impact and difficulties imposed by the widespread health concerns on Aurinia’s business operations including nonclinical, clinical, regulatory and commercial activities; the results from Aurinia’s clinical studies and from third party studies and reports may not be accurate; Aurinia’s third party service providers may not, or may not be able to, comply with their obligations under their agreements with Aurinia; and Aurinia’s assets or business activities may be subject to disputes that may result in litigation or other legal claims. Although Aurinia has attempted to identify factors that would cause actual actions, events, or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements and information, there may be other factors that cause actual results, performances, achievements, or events to not be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that forward-looking statements or information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.

As a result, we cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will materialize and, accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these\nforward-looking statements; and\n◦ forward-looking statements do not take into account the effect that transactions or non-recurring or other special items announced or occurring after the statements are\nmade may have on our business. For example, they do not include the effect of mergers, acquisitions, other business combinations or transactions, dispositions, sales of\nassets, asset write-downs or other charges announced or occurring after the forward-looking statements are made. The financial impact of such transactions and non-\nrecurring and other special items can be complex and necessarily depend on the facts particular to each of them. Accordingly, the expected impact cannot be\nmeaningfully described in the abstract or presented in the same manner as known risks affecting our business.\nForward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of presenting information about management’s current expectations and plans relating to the future and readers are\ncautioned that such statements may not be appropriate for other purposes.

Business\nOVERVIEW\nAurinia is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering therapies to people living with autoimmune diseases with high unmet medical needs. In January\n2021, we introduced LUPKYNIS (voclosporin), the first FDA-approved oral therapy for the treatment of adult patients with active LN. We continue to conduct clinical and\nregulatory activities to support the LUPKYNIS development program. We contracted with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka) as a collaboration partner for the\ndevelopment and commercialization of LUPKYNIS in the European Union (EU), Japan, as well as the United Kingdom, Russia, Switzerland, Norway, Belarus, Iceland,\nLiechtenstein and Ukraine (collectively, the Otsuka Territories).\nLUPKYNIS is an orally administered CNI immunosuppressant that has been demonstrated to improve near and long-term outcomes in LN when used in combination with\nmycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (although MMF is not currently approved as such) and steroids. By inhibiting calcineurin, LUPKYNIS reduces cytokine activation and blocks\ninterleukin IL-2 expression and T-cell mediated immune responses. LUPKYNIS also potentially stabilizes podocytes, which can protect against proteinuria.\nVoclosporin, the active ingredient in LUPKYNIS, is made by a modification of a single amino acid of the cyclosporine molecule. The mechanism of action of LUPKYNIS has\nbeen validated with certain earlier generation CNIs for the prevention of\nrejection in patients undergoing solid organ transplants and in several autoimmune indications, including uveitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and\nfor LN in Japan. We believe that LUPKYNIS possesses pharmacologic properties with the potential to demonstrate best-in-class differentiation.\nOn September 15, 2022, the EC granted marketing authorization of LUPKYNIS. The centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU member states as well as in Iceland,\nLiechtenstein, Norway and Northern Ireland. The approval triggered a $30.0 million milestone payment to us, which was recognized as collaboration revenue for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. On November 29, 2022 the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had granted marketing authorization of LUPKYNIS in Great\nBritain. On April 24, 2023, LUPKYNIS received regulatory approval in Switzerland. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company received notification that the pricing and\nreimbursement milestone was secured. As a result, this triggered a $10.0 million milestone which was recognized as collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31,\n2023. On November 10, 2023, Otsuka filed a new drug application (NDA) for voclosporin for the treatment of LN with the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare\nfor the manufacture and sale in Japan of voclosporin.\nSTRATEGY\nOur business strategy is to optimize the clinical and commercial value of LUPKYNIS and evolve as a commercial biopharmaceutical company with a global product portfolio\nfocused on autoimmune, kidney and rare diseases with high unmet medical needs.\nWe have developed a strategic plan to execute on our commercialization of LUPKYNIS as a treatment of adult patients with active LN. The key tactics to achieve our corporate\nstrategy are:\n• focusing on educating physicians, patients and payers to increase their awareness of the risks and impacts of LN as a disease (including that elevated proteineuria levels\ncan have significant impact on kidneys and the disease needs to be diagnosed and addressed quickly), and the benefits of LUPKYNIS (as demonstrated in our clinical\ntrials) as a treatment option;\n• engaging Otsuka as a collaboration partner for the development and commercialization of LUPKYNIS in the Otsuka Territories;\n• conducting post-marketing studies to satisfy regulatory requirements and better understand LUPKYNIS' characteristics in real-world usage;\n• ensuring adequate supply of LUPKYNIS by entering into strategic long term supply agreements with our key suppliers; and\n• evaluating external assets with the potential to be synergistic and complementary to our clinical, regulatory and therapeutic areas of expertise.\n5\nDEVELOPMENTS\nConclusion and Overview of Strategic Review Process\nEffective February 14, 2024, the Board of Directors (the Board) elected to conclude its strategic review process.\nEffective immediately, we are discontinuing our future development of AUR200 and AUR300 research and development programs and prioritizing resource allocation. This\nwill result in a one-time charge in the first quarter of 2024 of approximately $11 - $15 million and expected operational cost savings of approximately $50 - $55 million\nannually, with approximately 75% of the savings being recognized in 2024 excluding the one-time restructuring charge in the first quarter of 2024. The Board also approved a\nshare repurchase program of up to $150 million worth of our common shares, affirming its confidence in the Company's growth prospects. The maximum value of the share\nrepurchase program is subject to receipt of regulatory approval in Canada.\nThe Board initiated a robust strategic review at the end of June 2023 to review all strategic options for Aurinia. Together with management, JP Morgan, our financial advisor in\nthe strategic review process, engaged with more than 60 parties, receiving only one non-binding expression of interest, which included a due diligence process, but did not\nresult in a formal offer.\nAurinia also explored potentially acquiring or licensing other entities or assets during this time. After assessing a range of alternatives over the last seven months, the Board\nelected to conclude Aurinia’s strategic review process. The Board ultimately determined that none of the explored opportunities that were available to it to pursue were in the\nbest near-term interests of the Company to execute on and that the best path forward is for management to streamline its operations and focus on our commercial execution.\nAdditionally, in 2018, the Company under previous management and at the Board’s discretion, engaged a leading investment bank to conduct a confidential strategic review\nprocess. During the 2018 process, we received only one non-binding expression of interest to acquire the Company, which included a due diligence process, but did not result in\na formal offer.\nOutside of these two expressions of interest, we have never received an offer of any kind to acquire the Company. The Board and management remain open to exploring\nopportunities that are in the best interests of the Company and are open to considering any bona fide offers that we may receive.\nWe are reaffirming our commitment to enhancing value by driving LUPKYNIS growth, while maintaining a sharp focus on operating efficiencies and maximizing cash flows.\nAs a result, we are ceasing future development efforts on AUR200 and AUR300. Correspondingly, we expect to take a restructuring charge of approximately $11 - $15 million\nin the first quarter of 2024. The Company anticipates reducing employee headcount by at least 25% by the end of the first quarter of 2024. There is no planned reduction in\nheadcount in commercial or commercial supporting roles.\nThe charge will primarily be made up of severance costs, contract termination costs and other costs associated with terminating the programs. We expect to recognize annual\ncost savings of approximately $50 - $55 million,with approximately 75% of the savings being recognized in 2024 excluding the one-time restructuring charge in the first quarter\nof 2024, with no impact on commercial investment.\nIn addition, the Board has approved a share repurchase program of up to $150 million of Common Shares, reflecting confidence in Aurinia’s growth prospects and a continued\ncommitment to creating long-term value to shareholders and other stakeholders. We have submitted an exemptive relief application to applicable Canadian securities regulators\nwhich, if granted, would permit us to purchase up to 15% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares of the Company in any 12 month period for 36 months (the Exemptive\nRelief). There is no assurance the Exemptive Relief will be granted on the terms applied for or at all. If the Exemptive Relief is not granted, the maximum we may purchase\nunder this share repurchase program in reliance on the normal course issuer bid exemption under applicable Canadian securities regulation is 5% of our current issued and\noutstanding Common Shares (being 7,230,888 Common Shares).\nPurchases under the share repurchase program will commence on or around February 21, 2024. The expiry date of the share repurchase program is not currently known. This\nprogram may be implemented through open market or privately negotiated purchases, including under a plan intended to benefit from the affirmative defense under Rule 10b5-\n1, Rule 10b-18 or an automatic securities purchase plan, an accelerated share repurchase program, or other mechanisms. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions will\nbe determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions, share price, legal requirements, including applicable blackout period restrictions, and other factors.\nThe purchase price of any Common Shares will be determined in accordance with applicable U.S. securities laws and subject to receiving the Exemptive Relief, the value\n6\nof the consideration offered per Common Share will not exceed the market price of the Common Shares calculated pursuant to applicable Canadian securities regulation.\nRegulatory/Commercial\nOn April 11, 2023, we announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) had issued a new and refined method of use patent titled IMPROVED\nPROTOCOL FOR TREATMENT OF LUPUS NEPHRITIS. Our newly issued U.S. Patent (No. 11,622,991) reflects the unique and proprietary dosing regimen of its currently\nmarketed product, LUPKYNIS. Specifically, this patent further refines the method of using LUPKYNIS in combination with MMF and corticosteroids using eGFR as a method\nof pharmacodynamically dosing the product in patients with LN. The newly issued patent provides coverage that supplements Aurinia’s existing U.S. Patent No. 10,286,036,\nwhich is listed in the Orange Book and claims an FDA-approved method of using LUPKYNIS. The claims in this additional patent add further specificity on dosing consistent\nwith the FDA approved product label. This patent has the potential to provide an additional layer of patent protection for LUPKYNIS up to 2037. U.S. Patent No. 11,622,991 is\nlisted in the Orange Book.\nOn December 20, 2023, we announced the submission of our Investigational New Drug application (IND) to the FDA for AUR200, a potential next generation therapy for B-\ncell mediated autoimmune diseases. The IND was made effective on January 18, 2024. On February 15, 2024, we announced that we are ceasing future development of\nAUR200 and AUR300 research and development programs and prioritizing resource allocation.\nRefreshment of Board of Directors\nOn August 18, 2023, we appointed Dr. Karen Smith and Jeffrey A. Bailey to our Board of Directors. Dr. Smith and Mr. Bailey both have deep experience in biopharma\nleadership, commercial strategy, mergers and acquisitions and advancing therapeutic pipelines. We also appointed Dr. Daniel G. Billen as Chair of the Board of Directors. He\nhas been a member of the Board since 2019.\nOn September 21, 2023, pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement dated as of September 21, 2023, by and among Aurinia, MKT\nCapital Ltd., MKT Tactical Fund, SP and Antoine Khalife, we appointed Dr. Robert T. Foster to our Board of Directors. Dr. Foster founded Isotechnika Pharma Inc. (the former\nname of Aurinia) in 1993 and was its Chairman and CEO for approximately 21 years. During his tenure at Isotechnika, Dr. Foster invented voclosporin. For further discussion,\nrefer to Note 19, “Related Party”.\nStudy Updates\nOn April 5, 2023, we announced promising results from the AURORA Renal Biopsy Sub-Study. The addition of LUPKYNIS on top of the then current standard of care MMF\nand low-dose steroids in our Phase 3 AURORA 1 and AURORA 2 studies led to significantly earlier and greater reductions in proteinuria while maintaining stable renal\nfunction, as evidenced by a stable eGFR slope over time. To further characterize the long-term impact of LUPKYNIS on the kidney at the histologic level, repeat biopsies were\ncollected from selected patients in both treatment arms (the active control arm with patients treated with only MMF and steroids, and the study arm of voclosporin in\ncombination with MMF and steroids). The patients in the voclosporin treatment arm demonstrated histologic activity improvement with stable chronicity scores similar to the\nactive control arm of MMF and low dose steroids alone over the 18-months average treatment period at the time of repeat biopsy.\nMarket Potential and Commercial Considerations\nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases estimates that up to 50% of adults with SLE are diagnosed with LN at some point in their journey with\nlupus. Using the research and publication analyses, we estimate the number of SLE patients diagnosed with LN to be about 80,000 to 120,000 in the United States.\nSimilar to other autoimmune disorders, LN is a flaring and remitting disease. The disease can cycle from being in remission to being in an active flare, to achieving partial\nresponse and potentially to achieving a complete response and therefore back in remission. Treatment objectives between LN and other autoimmune diseases are remarkably\nsimilar. In other autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Crohn’s, rheumatoid arthritis and SLE, physicians’ goals are to induce and maintain a remission of disease,\ndecrease frequency of hospital or ambulatory care visits and limit long term disability. In LN specifically, physicians are trying to avoid further kidney damage, kidney failure,\ndialysis, kidney transplantation, and death. The ability to get patients into remission quickly correlates with better long-term kidney outcomes as noted above. Achieving a\ncomplete response, and most importantly, rapidly reducing the level of protein in urine, is also believed to be an important factor in\n7\ndelaying and/or reducing the rate of progression to kidney failure and need for replacement therapy. Kidney failure is associated with extremely poor health outcomes as a life-\nlong, costly state in which patients are dependent upon dialysis or the availability of a kidney transplant.\nThe population of people with LN will be in different cycles of their disease at any one time. Prior to the approval of LUPKYNIS, physicians would generally use a\ncombination of MMF and steroids to treat people with LN throughout the disease cycles. The clinical data generated in our Phase 2 AURA-LV and our Phase 3 AURORA\nstudies has demonstrated that LUPKYNIS can achieve an almost three times higher rate of complete response than when given in combination with MMF and steroids. The\nclinical data generated in our AURORA 2 continuation study demonstrated a continuation of these results over an aggregate of a three year period for the patients that enrolled,\nwith no severe unexpected safety signals and evidence of better preservation of kidney function in the LUPKYNIS-treated group.\nThe price of LUPKYNIS is based on one unit of 60 capsules we refer to as a “wallet”. As of January 1, 2024, the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of a LUPKYNIS wallet is\n$4,898. Based on our patient-specific eGFR dosing regimens, the average utilization in our clinical trials, and accounting for factors including mandatory rebates, channel\ndiscounts, and anticipated patient adherence, duration of therapy and compliance, we expect the average annualized net revenue per patient for us to be approximately $65,000.\nWhen determining the price of LUPKYNIS, we considered the burden of LN disease in the context of value that LUPKYNIS offers to patients and the U.S. healthcare system.\nVoclosporin Mechanism of Action\nVoclosporin reversibly inhibits immunocompetent lymphocytes, particularly T-Lymphocytes in the G0 and G1 phase of the cell-cycle, and also reversibly inhibits the\nproduction and release of lymphokines. Through a number of processes voclosporin inhibits and prevents the activation of various transcription factors necessary for the\ninduction of cytokine genes during T-cell activation. It is believed that the inhibition of activation of T-cells will have a positive modulatory effect in the treatment of LN. In\naddition to these immunologic impacts, recent data suggests that CNIs have another subtle but important impact on the structural integrity of the podocytes. This data suggests\nthat inhibition of calcineurin in patients with autoimmune kidney diseases helps stabilize the cellular actin-cytoskeleton of the podocytes thus having a structural impact on the\npodocyte and the subsequent leakage of protein into the urine, which is a key marker of patients suffering from LN.\nScientific Rationale for Treatment of LN with LUPKYNIS\nWhile SLE is a highly heterogeneous autoimmune disease (often with multiple organ and immune system involvement), LN has straightforward disease outcomes. T-cell\nmediated immune response is an important feature of the pathogenesis of LN while the\n8\npodocyte injury that occurs in conjunction with the ongoing immune insult in the kidney is an important factor in the clinical presentation of the disease. An early response in\nLN correlates with long-term outcomes and is clearly measured by proteinuria.\nThe use of LUPKYNIS, for the treatment of adult patients with active LN, provides a novel approach to treating this disease. LUPKYNIS has shown to have potent effects on\nT-cell activation leading to its immunomodulatory effects. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that inhibition of calcineurin has direct physical impacts on the podocytes\nwithin the kidney. Inhibition of calcineurin within the podocytes can prevent the dephosphorylation of synaptopodin which in turn inhibits the degradation of the actin\ncytoskeleton within the podocyte. This process is known to directly impact on the levels of protein in the urine which is a key marker of LN disease activity.\nFDA Approval and Commercial Launch of LUPKYNIS\nOn January 22, 2021, the FDA approved LUPKYNIS in combination with a background immunosuppressive therapy regimen to treat adult patients with active LN. As a\ncondition of approval, we were required to conduct four Post Marketing Studies (PMRs) and one Post Marketing Commitment (PMC). We submitted the final study report for\nAURORA-2 continuation study (PMR) in March 2022, a drug-drug interaction study (PMC) was submitted in October 2022 and a milk only lactation study was submitted in\nJune 2023. The remaining PMRs are all progressing within the expected timelines. We expect to complete two pediatric studies due in 2025 and 2031.\nCompletion of AURORA 2 Continuation Study\nOn December 9, 2021, we announced positive topline results from the AURORA 2 two-year continuation study evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of LUPKYNIS.\nAURORA 2 (NCT03597464) was a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of voclosporin, in addition\nto MMF and steroids. Patients who completed 12 months of treatment in the Phase 3 AURORA 1 study were eligible to enroll in the AURORA 2 continuation study with the\nsame randomized treatment of voclosporin at 23.7 mg twice daily or placebo, in combination with MMF at 1 g twice daily with low-dose oral steroids, for up to an additional 24\nmonths. A total of 216 LN patients out of 357 who were enrolled in the AURORA 1 study continued into AURORA 2, with 116 patients in the voclosporin group and 100\npatients in the control group. 90 and 78 patients, respectively, received 36 months of total treatment at the completion of the study. Compared to the active control group, the\nvoclosporin-treated group showed an increase from baseline eGFR at the end of the studies of +2.7 mL/min. The study demonstrated a favorable risk/benefit profile over a\nthree-year period, with safety comparable to AURORA 1, and sustained efficacy.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nPatents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our policy has been to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to our\ninventions that are considered important to the development of our business.\nWe have been granted patent portfolio covering voclosporin, including granted United States patents, for composition of matter, methods of use, formulations and synthesis,\nand the rights to certain corresponding Canadian, South African and Israeli patents are owned by Paladin Labs Inc. Patent protection for patents related to the composition of\nmatter of voclosporin are expected to be extended in the United States and certain other major markets, including Europe and Japan, until at least October 2027 under the\nHatch-Waxman Act in the United States and comparable patent extension laws in other countries (including the Supplementary Protection Certificate program in Europe). We\nhave applied for a patent term extension, and are awaiting confirmation from the USPTO. As the patent term extension was not granted prior to the expiry of the patent term for\nour composition of matter patent for voclosporin, we applied for, and have received, an interim patent term extension until October 17, 2024. If the patent term extension is not\ngranted prior to the expiration of the interim patent term extension that was granted, we intend to file future interim patent term extensions until the USPTO completes its\nreview of the patent term extension application. In addition to patent rights, we have received \"new chemical entity\" exclusivity for LUPKYNIS in the United States, which\nprovides for exclusivity until January 22, 2026, and “new chemical entity” equivalent exclusivity for voclosporin in certain European countries, which provides exclusivity for\nup to ten years in Europe.\nIn May 2019, we were granted U.S. Patent No. 10,286,036 (the '036 patent) with a term extending to December 2037, with claims directed at our LUPKYNIS dosing protocol\nfor LN used in our clinical trials. This dosing protocol is reflected on the prescribing information approved by the FDA for LUPKYNIS. Notably, the allowed claims cover a\nmethod of modifying the dose of LUPKYNIS in patients with LN based on patient specific pharmacodynamic parameters. We have also filed for protection of this subject\nmatter under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and are applying for similar protection in the member countries thereof. This may lead to the granting of similar claims in\nother major global pharmaceutical markets.\n9\nIn April 2023, the USPTO issued a new and refined method of use patent. Our newly issued U.S. Patent (No. 11,622,991) reflects the unique and proprietary dosing regimen of\nLUPKYNIS. Specifically, this patent further refines the method of using LUPKYNIS in combination with MMF and corticosteroids using eGFR as a method of\npharmacodynamically dosing the product in patients with LN. The newly issued patent provides coverage that supplements the '036 patent. The claims in this additional patent\nadd further specificity on dosing consistent with the FDA approved product label. This patent has the potential to provide an additional layer of patent protection for\nLUPKYNIS up to 2037, and is listed in the Orange Book.\nCOMPETITION\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Many companies, including major pharmaceutical\nas well as specialized biotechnology companies, are engaged in activities focused on medical conditions that are the same as, or similar to, those targeted by us. For example,\nanother treatment was approved by the FDA for LN approximately one month before we received approval for LUPKYNIS, and physicians have treated and continue to treat\nLN in the United States using other drugs with off-label prescribing, such as a combination of MMF and steroids or first generation CNIs such as tacrolimus. Many of the\nbiotechnology, pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical companies that could or do compete with LUPKYNIS have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger\nresearch and development staff, and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organization than we do. Many of these companies have significant experience in pre-clinical\ntesting, human clinical trials, product manufacturing, commercialization, marketing and distribution, and other regulatory approval procedures. In addition, colleges,\nuniversities, government agencies, and other public and private research organizations conduct research and may market commercial products on their own or through\ncollaborative agreements and these institutions are becoming more active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements to collect royalties for use of technology that\nthey have developed. These companies, institutions, and organizations also compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel, as well as other\npersonnel needed for our business. Certain products may also be available at prices that are substantially lower than the cost of LUPKYNIS, whether or not studied in or\nreceiving approval for use by the FDA for LN.\nWe believe key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of LUPKYNIS include, but are not limited to, diagnosis, market development,\nefficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, pricing, the level and timing of generic competition and reimbursement. As our competitors introduce\nnew products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect that we may become subject to additional competition.\nREGULATORY\nWe worked with our collaboration partner Otsuka to prepare an MAA filing with the EMA that was filed during the first half of 2021; an MAA filing with Swissmedic that was\nfiled during the second half of 2021, and an MAA filing submitted to the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products (MHRA) for approval in Great Britain. These ultimately led\nto the European Commission (EC) and MHRA approvals received in the second half of 2022 and the Swissmedic approval was received in the first half of 2023. In February\n2022, Swissmedic also granted orphan drug designation to voclosporin. Otsuka is required under the Otsuka License Agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to\nprepare and submit filings for regulatory approvals in the other territories in which we have granted them rights, including Japan, (in which the Japanese New Drug Application\n(J-NDA) was submitted on November 10, 2023) and selected other European countries.\nRegulatory Requirements\nThe development, manufacturing and marketing of LUPKYNIS is subject to regulations relating to the demonstration of safety and efficacy of the products as established by the\ngovernment or regulatory authorities in those jurisdictions where this product is to be marketed. We, or our licensees, are required to seek and obtain regulatory approvals in the\nUnited States, Europe and Japan in order to commercialize LUPKYNIS in these jurisdictions. Depending upon the circumstances surrounding the clinical evaluation of\nLUPKYNIS, we may undertake clinical trials, contract clinical trial activities to contract research organizations, or rely upon corporate partners for such development. As noted\nabove, we have obtained the requisite approvals for LUPKYNIS to treat active LN in adult patients in the United States and have received marketing approvals from the EC,\nSwissmedic and MHRA. We believe this will allow us to make cost effective developmental decisions in a timely fashion. We cannot predict or give any assurances as to\nwhether regulatory approvals will be received or how long the process of seeking regulatory approvals will take.\nAlthough only the jurisdictions of the United States, Europe and Japan are discussed in this section, we may also seek regulatory approval in other jurisdictions in the future and\nmay initiate other clinical studies if and where appropriate.\n10\nGovernment Regulation\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Compliance with these laws, rules,\nand regulations has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position, and we do not currently anticipate material capital\nexpenditures for environmental control facilities. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to\nproduct development and approval, business acquisitions, healthcare, consumer and data protection, employee health and safety, and taxes, could have a material impact on our\nbusiness in subsequent periods. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts.\nUnited States—FDA Process\nThe research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of drug products are extensively regulated by\ngovernmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and\nits implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve\npending New Drug Applications (NDAs), warning letters, fines, civil penalties, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution,\ninjunctions and/or criminal prosecution.\nDrug Approval Process. No drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States until the drug has received FDA approval. The steps required before a drug may be\nmarketed in the United States generally include the following:\n• completion of extensive pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA’s GLP requirements and other applicable\nregulations;\n• submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;\n• approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;\n• performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with GCP requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each\nproposed indication;\n• submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;\n• satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;\n• satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug substance and finished drug product are produced\nand tested to assess compliance with current GMPs; and\n• FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.\nPre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests and formulation of\nthe compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical\ndata, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days\nafter receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial, such as whether human research subjects will be exposed to\nan unreasonable health risk. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot\nbe sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin.\nClinical trials involve administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols\ndetailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be provided to the FDA as\npart of a separate submission to the IND. Further, an IRB for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the study protocol and\ninformed consent information for study subjects for any clinical trial before it commences at that center, and the IRB must monitor the study until it is completed. There are also\nrequirements governing reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. Study subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating\nin a clinical trial.\nClinical trials necessary for product approval typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Phase 1 usually involves the initial introduction of\nthe investigational drug into a limited population, typically healthy humans, to evaluate its short-term safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and\npharmacologic actions, and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population impacted by the disease to\n(i) evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; (ii) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks; and (iii)\n11\nevaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to\nbeginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 3 trials, commonly referred to as pivotal studies, are undertaken in an expanded patient population at\nmultiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial centers to further evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety by using the drug in its final form. Post-approval trials,\nsometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in\nthe intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.\nFurthermore, the sponsor, the FDA or an IRB may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an\nunacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, such as in the circumstances where the clinical trial is not being\nconducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an\nindependent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine\nwhether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial.\nDuring the development of a new drug, sponsors are given an opportunity to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end\nof Phase 2 clinical testing, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share\ninformation about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach consensus on the next phase of development. Sponsors\ntypically use the end of Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support\nsubmission of an NDA.\nConcurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical\ncharacteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with GMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of\nconsistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final drugs.\nAdditionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable\ndeterioration over its shelf life.\nAssuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of pre-clinical studies and of clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including\ninformation on the manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more\nindications. An NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee.\nThe FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is GMP-compliant to\nassure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has\na goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months\nfrom the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted. The FDA\nconducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to\npermit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional\ninformation. The resubmitted application also is subject to a filing review before the FDA accepts it for filing and substantive review.\nThe FDA also may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other\nscientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound\nby the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.\nBefore approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug and/or its drug substance is manufactured and may withhold approval of the\nproduct if the manufacturing is not in compliance with GMPs and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before\napproving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process\nor manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the\nsubmission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.\n12\nAfter the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for specific\nindications. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A complete\nresponse letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data and/or additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical\ntrial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information\nis submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.\nIf regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product\nmay be marketed. For example, the FDA could approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy to mitigate risks of the drug, which could include medication\nguides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. Once the FDA\napproves a drug, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In\naddition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety effects of approved products that have been\ncommercialized. The FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs or other information. In\naddition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline\nfor regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.\nExpedited Review and Approval. The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation,\nwhich are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing certain drugs and in the case of accelerated approval, provide for approval on the basis of surrogate or\nintermediate endpoints. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or\nthat the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening diseases\nor conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. Fast track designation, breakthrough\ntherapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.\nFor example, fast track designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and which\ndemonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need for such diseases or conditions. With regard to a fast track-designated product, the FDA may consider for review\nsections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA\nagrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the\nNDA. Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to\nexpedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective\ntherapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The\nFDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA\nendeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs\nunder its current PDUFA review goals.\nDrug products intended for serious or life threatening conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate\nendpoint, which is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome, or an effect on a\nclinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or\nother clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the\nFDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of\npromotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval.\nThe Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category of drugs referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be eligible to receive\nbreakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination\nwith one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial\nimprovement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs\ndesignated as breakthrough therapies receive all the benefits of a fast\n13\ntrack designation, as well as intensive guidance on efficient drug development and organizational commitment involving senior managers in the FDA.\nPost-Approval Requirements. After a drug has been approved by the FDA for sale, the FDA may require that certain post-approval requirements be satisfied, including the\nconduct of additional clinical studies. In addition, certain changes to an approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes, or making\ncertain additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Before a company can market products for additional indications, it must obtain additional\napprovals from the FDA. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical studies be conducted. A company cannot be sure that any additional\napproval for new indications for any product candidate will be approved on a timely basis, or at all.\nIf post-approval conditions are not satisfied, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. In addition, holders of an approved NDA are required to (i) report certain adverse\nreactions to the FDA and maintain pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events; (ii) comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and\npromotional labeling for their products; and (iii) continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures that conform to GMPs after approval. The FDA periodically\ninspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing facilities; this latter effort includes assessment of ongoing compliance with GMPs. Accordingly,\nmanufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. We use third-party manufacturers to\nproduce our products in clinical and commercial quantities, and future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may\ndisrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a\nproduct, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things:\n• restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;\n• fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;\n• refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;\n• product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or\n• injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nPatent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may\nbe eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The\nHatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory\nreview process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term\nrestoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an\nNDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the extension must be requested prior to expiration of\nthe patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. We have filed for a patent term\nextension for one of our U.S. patents, which is being considered by the USPTO. Only one U.S. patent is permitted to be extended for the currently approved drug product and its\nuses.\nData and market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five year period of non-\npatent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not\npreviously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity\nperiod, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or an NDA submitted under section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA by another company for\nanother version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted\nafter four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA\nor supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be\nessential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions\nassociated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the original active agent or from\naccepting and reviewing an application referencing the approved drug’s application. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full\nNDA;\n14\nhowever, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct, or obtain a right of reference to all of the pre-clinical studies and clinical trials necessary to\ndemonstrate safety and effectiveness.\nForeign Regulation\nIn addition to regulations in the United States, we may become subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of\nLUPKYNIS or other potential future products. In many cases, we must obtain approval of the country’s regulatory authorities in order to conduct clinical trials or market\nproducts, although in selected countries there are regulations that permit marketing a product on the basis of an approval that has been received in the U.S., EU, or elsewhere.\nThe approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may\nbe longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.\nAs an example, in the European Economic Area (EEA), which is comprised of the member states of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can\nonly be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (MA). There are two types of MAs:\n• Community MAs – These are issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for\nHuman Use (CHMP) of the EMA, and are valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as\nbiotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes,\nautoimmune and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA; for products that\nconstitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation; or for products that are in the interest of public health in the EU.\n• National MAs – These are issued by the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA and only cover their respective territory and are available for products\nnot falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a member state of the EEA, this\nnational MA can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any member state at\nthe time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure, an identical\ndossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the member states in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference\nmember state. The competent authority of the reference member state prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (SmPC) and a\ndraft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other member states (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States\nConcerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the reference member\nstate, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the member states, i.e., in the reference member state and the Member States Concerned.\nUnder the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA assess the risk benefit balance of the\nproduct on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.\nAs in the United States, it may be possible in foreign countries to obtain a period of market and/or data exclusivity that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the\nmarketplace of a competitor’s generic product. For example, now that LUPKYNIS has received marketing approval in the EEA, we expect that we and Otsuka will benefit from\neight years of data exclusivity and 10 years of marketing exclusivity from approval. An additional non-cumulative one-year period of marketing exclusivity is possible if during\nthe data exclusivity period (the first eight years of the 10-year marketing exclusivity period), we (or our licensee or partner) obtain an authorization for one or more new\ntherapeutic indications that are deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies. The data exclusivity period begins on the date of the product’s first\nmarketing authorization in the EEA and prevents generics from relying on the marketing authorization holder’s pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data for a period of\neight years. After eight years, a generic product application may be submitted, and generic companies may rely on the marketing authorization holder’s data. However, a\ngeneric cannot launch until two years later (or a total of 10 years after the first marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product), or three years later (or a total of 11\nyears after the first marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product) if the marketing authorization holder obtains marketing authorization for a new indication with\nsignificant clinical benefit within the eight-year data exclusivity period.\n15\nWhen conducting clinical trials in the EU, we must adhere to the provisions of the European Union Clinical Trials Directive (Directive 2001/20/EC) and the laws and\nregulations of the EU member states implementing them. These provisions require, among other things, that the prior authorization of an Ethics Committee and the competent\nMember State authority is obtained before commencing the clinical trial. In April 2014, the EU passed the Clinical Trials Regulation (Regulation 536/2014), which will replace\nthe current Clinical Trials Directive. To ensure that the rules for clinical trials are identical throughout the European Union, the EU Clinical Trials Regulation was passed as a\nregulation that is directly applicable in all EU member states. All clinical trials performed in the European Union are required to be conducted in accordance with the Clinical\nTrials Directive until the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The Clinical Trials Regulation became applicable January 31, 2023.\nJapan Regulatory Process\nIn Japan, the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) is the main regulatory agency that oversees the review and approval of the drugs in Japan. There is the\npotential for PMDA to require additional clinical trials to be conducted to generate data in a Japanese population.\nJapan’s regulatory system requires the J-NDA documents to be prepared in the common technical document format. Once the applicant files the J-NDA, PMDA reviews the\napplication and may carry out a GMP investigation of manufacturing sites. If there are any major issues, PMDA reviewer will prepare a summary of the main issues, discuss\nwith the applicant and may organize an expert discussion, which involves a discussion between the PMDA reviewer and external expert on the proposed major issue(s).\nFollowing this review meeting, PMDA may again hold another expert discussion (if necessary) and prepares a review report for final approval within the Japanese government.\nThe standard time for approval of a J-NDA is approximately 12 months. In Japan, LUPKYNIS may be eligible for eight years of data exclusivity. There can be no assurance\nthat we will qualify for such regulatory exclusivity, or that such exclusivity will prevent competitors from seeking approval solely on the basis of their own studies.\nCoverage and Reimbursement\nIn the United States and internationally, sales of LUPKYNIS, and our ability to generate revenues on such sales, are dependent, in significant part, on the availability of\nadequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, such as state and federal governments, managed care providers and private insurance plans. These organizations\nroutinely implement cost-cutting and reimbursement initiatives that have the ability, or potential, to impact a patient’s overall access to our product. Examples of these\ninitiatives include, but are not limited to, establishing formularies that govern the drugs and biologics that are eligible for reimbursement and the out-of-pocket obligations of\nmember patients for such products.\nIn addition, particularly in the United States and increasingly in other countries, we could be required to provide discounts, rebates and/or other price concessions to state and\nfederal governments and agencies in connection with purchases of LUPKYNIS that are reimbursed by such entities. It is possible that future legislation in the United States and\nother jurisdictions could be enacted to potentially impact reimbursement rates or rebates for LUPKYNIS and could further impact the levels of discounts and rebates paid to\nfederal and state government entities. Any legislation that impacts these areas could impact, in a significant way, our ability to generate revenues from sales of LUPKYNIS.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will\ncontinue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could significantly affect our future business. For example, the Patient\nProtection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the ACA) enacted in March 2010, substantially changed the\nway healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the ACA established:\n• an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;\n• a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which pharmaceutical manufacturers who wish to have their drugs covered under Part D must offer discounts for\neligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, often referred to as the donut hole; and\n• a formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.\nAdditionally, in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was passed by the U.S. Congress which, among other things, includes policies that are designed to\nhave a direct impact on drug prices and reduce drug spending by the federal\n16\ngovernment, which took effect in 2023. This legislation contains substantial drug pricing reforms, including the establishment of a drug price negotiation program within the\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services that would require manufacturers to charge a negotiated “maximum fair price” for certain selected drugs covered by Medicare\nor pay an excise tax for noncompliance, the establishment of rebate payment requirements on manufacturers of certain drugs payable under Medicare Parts B and D to penalize\nprice increases that outpace inflation, and requires manufacturers to provide discounts on Part D drugs. Legislative, administrative, and private payor efforts to control drug\ncosts span a range of proposals, including drug price negotiation, Medicare Part D redesign, drug price inflation rebates, international mechanisms, generic drug promotion and\nanticompetitive behavior, manufacturer reporting, and reforms that could impact therapies utilizing the accelerated approval pathway.\nIndividual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product\npricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in\nsome cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Recently, there has also been heightened governmental (federal and state) scrutiny\nover the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to,\namong other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program\nreimbursement methodologies for drug products.\nSimilar political, economic and regulatory developments are occurring in the EU and may affect the ability of pharmaceutical companies to profitably commercialize their\nproducts. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the EU or member state level may result in significant\nadditional requirements or obstacles. The delivery of healthcare in the EU, including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of\nmedicines, is almost exclusively a matter for national, rather than EU, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and\napproaches to the delivery of health care and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. In general, however, the healthcare budgetary constraints in most EU\nmember states have resulted in restrictions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines by relevant health service providers. Coupled with ever-increasing EU and national\nregulatory burdens on those wishing to develop and market products, this could restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect the ability of pharmaceutical companies to\ncommercialize their products. In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price\nceilings on specific products and therapies.\nIn the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system and international healthcare systems. Future legislation, or\nregulatory actions implementing recent or future legislation may have a significant effect on our business. Our ability to successfully commercialize products depends in part on\nthe extent to which reimbursement for the costs of our products and related treatments will be available in the United States and worldwide from government health\nadministration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. The adoption of certain proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products, the\namounts of reimbursement available for our products, and limit the acceptance and availability of our products. Therefore, substantial uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement\nstatus of newly approved health care products by third-party payors.\nMANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY CHAIN\nIn order to supply commercial inventory for LUPKYNIS and semi-finished products, we have established relationships with contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs)\ncoupled with supply agreements, for the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredient or drug substance, encapsulation of voclosporin 7.9 mg capsules as well as\npackaging of LUPKYNIS commercial cartons.\nManufacturing of Drug Substance\nVoclosporin requires a specialized drug substance manufacturing process and is manufactured by Lonza, our sole supplier for drug substance. Pricing for supply is determined\nthrough supply agreements between us and Lonza and is based on the kilograms produced and the cost of the raw materials used in the drug substance manufacturing process.\nAs at the date of this Annual Report, we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining the raw materials required with respect to the manufacturing of voclosporin. We\nbelieve we have enough inventory on hand and manufacturing capacity to meet forecasted demand.\nWe have entered into a collaborative agreement with Lonza to use a dedicated manufacturing capacity within Lonza’s existing small molecule facility in Visp, Switzerland. The\ndedicated facility (also referred to as monoplant) is equipped with state-of-\n17\nthe-art manufacturing equipment to provide cost and production efficiencies for the manufacture of voclosporin, while expanding existing capacity and providing supply\nsecurity to meet future commercial demand. We maintain sole dedicated use of the monoplant by paying a required quarterly fixed facility fee. We anticipate regulatory\napprovals of the monoplant for use for commercial products in 2025.\nEncapsulation\nCatalent Pharma Solutions (Catalent) is currently the sole supplier for the preparation of our voclosporin 7.9 mg capsules. Pricing for these services is determined by a supply\nagreement between Catalent and us. We expect that Catalent will continue to provide contract manufacturing services with respect to encapsulating voclosporin in order to\nmanufacture voclosporin 7.9 mg capsules that are required for our future commercial and clinical supply needs. We have entered into an agreement for a backup manufacturing\nencapsulation site in Beinheim, France expected to obtain regulatory approval in 2025.\nPackaging\nWe currently use a sole supplier for the blistering and packaging of LUPKYNIS commercial cartons for sale in the United States and for the blistering of semi finished products.\nPricing for these services is determined by a supply agreement between us and our supplier. We expect that our supplier will continue to provide contract manufacturing\nservices with respect to the packaging of LUPKYNIS commercial cartons for the U.S. market.\nMarketing, Sales and Distribution\nWe have built a commercial organization with deep expertise and a focus on rheumatology and nephrology to support the commercialization of LUPKYNIS. The commercial\nteam consists of sales, marketing, commercial operations, commercial supply chain, patient services and market access.\nMaterial Licensing Contracts\nFor terms of material licensing contracts, refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 10 – License and Collaboration Agreements.\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed approximately 300 employees in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, all of whom are expected to support our vision,\nmission and values, and adhere to our Code of Ethics and Conduct.\nThe Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors has the primary responsibility for overseeing our human capital management activities, including assessing the\neffectiveness of employee programs and advising management on strategic goals and overall human resource strategies. Other committees may also have responsibilities that\nimpact our human capital management.\nTalent Management and Retention\nRecruiting and retaining top talent is key to advancing our mission of changing the trajectory of autoimmune diseases. We strive to engage and retain our employees throughout\nthe employment life cycle. Within management, our human resources function has global responsibility for advising and assisting the overall business on human resource\nmatters and executing our overall human capital management strategies.\nEffective performance management is key to goal attainment. All our employees are provided with routine performance feedback aligned with our pay for performance\nphilosophy, which ties compensation to performance.\nAs part of our annual review of compensation, we include the most current industry market compensation data compiled by Radford to assess whether our employee pay is fair\nand competitive. We take proactive measures to ensure there are no pay gaps related to race, age, gender and ethnicity across the organization, functions, and levels. We offer a\ncompetitive benefit plan as part of our total rewards package.\n18\nHealth and Safety\nOur employees’ health, safety, and overall well-being is a priority for us. We track this in a variety of ways, including measuring the number of employees participating in our\nhealth and wellness webinars, working to ensure all of our employees are covered by an occupational health and safety management system, and minimizing work-related\ninjuries annually.\nWe are committed to providing safe and healthy working conditions and an atmosphere of open communication for all our employees. We have also established periodic mental\nhealth sessions to help our employees manage stress and anxiety.\nUnder the oversight of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, we have established a Whistleblower Policy, which includes that we maintain a whistleblower hotline\nthat is available to all our employees to report any concerns. The hotline is facilitated by an independent third party and all communications are routed to our General Counsel\nfor investigation and resolution. The single exception to this routing is if a complaint implicates the General Counsel, in which case it will go to the Chair of the Audit\nCommittee. We also have defined a Bullying and Harassment Policy, which is available to our employees on our internal website.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) sustainability is an approach that looks beyond the traditional environmental aspect of sustainability. ESG also includes Social\nand Governance aspects, such as employee well being, talent development and retention, cybersecurity, fair remuneration, employee recognition, and many others. ESG helps\nbreak down how an organization is managing risks and opportunities for its stakeholders. A company’s stakeholders have a vested interest in the business, and includes\nmembers such as employees, customers, investors, and the Board.\nFor us, by disclosing key aspects of ESG, our stakeholders can better understand our values, and what we are undertaking to address the long-term financial risks and impacts\nthat affect us.\nIn line with our mission to change the trajectory of autoimmune, kidney and rare diseases, we believe that we must take a holistic approach to address/improve our impact on\nthe communities we serve. Therefore, we have established environmental, social, and governance priorities. The Governance & Nomination Committee of our Board of\nDirectors is responsible for ensuring our ESG goals are pursued and assessed periodically. Progress on these goals will be disclosed in future sustainability reports.\nCorporate Values and Ethics\nWe understand that adhering to established best practices of corporate governance is critical to earning and maintaining the trust of our shareholders, customers, employees, and\nother stakeholders, and is essential to building long-term value. Our Governance and Nomination Committee is responsible for developing our approach to ESG issues and\nimplementing high\n19\nstandards of corporate governance practices. Our CEO and CFO are also responsible for leading and managing our approach to corporate social responsibility.\nOur Board of Directors adopted and regularly reviews the Code of Conduct, which applies to all of our employees, officers and directors. Adherence to the Code of Conduct\nhelps ensure that all employees can feel a part of an organization that emphasizes adherence to laws and policies covering the industry in which we work. Our Code of Conduct\nalso emphasizes each employee’s accountability for making decisions and taking actions in a highly ethical manner with a focus on honesty, fairness and integrity and treating\nall fellow employees in a respectful and inclusive manner. We have established a reporting hotline that enables employees to file anonymous reports of any suspected violations\nof the Code of Conduct. We believe that providing an ethical environment in which to work is vital to our efforts to attract, retain and develop our employees.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe seek to build and maintain a diverse team of employees that are passionate about and committed to having a positive impact on the lives of patients and their families. We\nvalue and celebrate the unique talents, backgrounds and perspectives each employee contributes to achieving our mission and corporate objectives. Our diverse and inclusive\nculture is key to attract, develop and retain our talent pool.\nAs an equal opportunity employer, we strive to attract and connect with diverse talent who best match our core values and who will be successful and thrive at Aurinia. Our\nrecruiting team partners with hiring managers and we select diverse interview panels to help provide insight at every stage of the process to identify the best possible candidate\n– whether internal or external – to fill open roles in the company.\nProfessional Development for Employees at All Levels\nWe are firmly committed to employee development as an essential driver of our future growth and overall success of Aurinia. Developing employees’ skills and capabilities\nalign with our commitment to investing in our people, as well as our commitment to quality and safety. It also ensures we have the right talent in the right places across the\norganization to be successful.\nIn 2023 we conducted a needs analysis, based on our competency model. As a result, we offered new training to all employees on topics such as collaboration, communication,\nand listening. We also offered programs on engagement, performance management, and launched a popular “Talk About’ series where employees learn about different groups\nat Aurinia and how they contribute to our Vision and Mission.\nDeveloping our managers continues to be an important priority for the Company. In 2023 we piloted a program dedicated to that population,D ynamic Leadership @ Aurinia.\nThe focus of this interactive, multi-week program is to develop an authentic leadership style grounded in Aurinia’s values. Participant feedback about the program was\noutstanding and the program will continue to be offered in 2024.\nWe provide our employees with developmental training in accordance with their specific role and career path, paying considerable attention to any new upcoming regulations\nand procedures. All employees also attend or participate in compliance, harassment prevention, and safety training and we offer education assistance for college and university\ncourses, training seminars and educational conference attendance opportunities to our employees. To monitor progress, we review our succession plan for key senior\nmanagement positions as part of our annual talent review and identify development opportunities to help ensure potential successor readiness.\nEmployee Engagement\nBuilding trust and a high performing culture is a top priority for Aurinia. We achieve this by providing a platform for employees to give feedback, collaborate on solutions, and\ndiscuss how to make changes to help improve our experience at work.\nDuring 2023, Aurinia partnered with Gallup to conduct its first employee Engagement & Inclusion survey designed to assess overall employee engagement and illuminate\nwhere engagement can be enhanced. The anonymous survey evaluated four key factors – Basic Needs, Individual Contribution, Teamwork, Growth, and Inclusion. The survey\ndata is being used to start an ongoing internal dialogue, action planning and measurement that will enable leadership to understand and improve company-wide engagement\nlevels, seek employee ideas to sustain areas of strength and improve gaps, turn ideas into actionable strategies\n20\nthat align with Aurinia’s values, prioritize purpose, ownership, and accountability and continue building a culture of engagement, inclusion, and performance excellence.\nWe hold frequent all-employee meetings that serve as an open forum to share progress on strategy and corporate goals as well as potential at-risk areas, celebrate achievements,\nand share best practices and learnings.\nCompensation & Benefits\nOur compensation and benefits programs, with oversight from the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, are designed to attract, retain and reward employees\nthrough competitive salaries, annual bonus eligibility, long-term incentive awards, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health\nsavings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and employee assistance programs. Each year we conduct surveys to benchmark our salaries and benefits\nand confirm we are satisfied with the competitiveness of our total compensation offering. We also provide a variety of peer-to-peer and corporate recognition programs to\ncelebrate and recognize our employees for their hard work and contributions.\nOur Commitment to Safety\nOur employees’ health, safety, and overall well-being is a top priority for us. We track this in a variety of ways, including providing all of our employees access to healthcare\nbenefits, measuring the number of employees participating in our health and wellness events, ensuring 100% of our employees are covered by an occupational health and safety\nmanagement system, and minimizing work-related injuries.\nWe are committed to maintaining compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate.\nWe are also deeply committed to the safety and well-being of the communities we serve. With support from patients, family members, caregivers and healthcare providers, we\nprovide up-to-date safety information on our medicines, and ensure the highest quality.\nEmpowering the Lupus Nephritis Community\nThrough our various educational and disease management programs, we encourage people living with LN to take charge of their health through early diagnosis, routine\nmanagement, and treatment, with a focus on Access, Education, Advocacy, Science and Safety.\nDoing Our Part to Help the Environment\nWe seek to improve the health and sustainability of our planet, as the well-being of our planet directly impacts the health of humanity. We recognize that energy, water,\nmaterials use, greenhouse gas emissions, material and hazardous waste, and transportation are among the largest contributors to our environmental footprint. Many of our\nimpacts on the planet are indirect – for instance, we do not manufacture the drug product, the capsules, or the packaging for LUPKYNIS ourselves, but instead do so through\nour manufacturing partners located across the globe. Similarly, we use a third-party logistics firm to transport LUPKYNIS to specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors\ndirectly, who then in turn dispenses LUPKYNIS to patients and hospitals. These contribute to our Scope 3 emissions as a result.\nHowever, although our direct impact on the environment may be small, we take our direct and indirect role in environmental protection matters very seriously. As a first step to\nassess our impact, our facilities, manufacturing, supply chain and procurement teams began a process of collecting data across these areas. Our next steps will be to establish\nbetter tracking and measurement tools, refine strategies, and determine targets to drive our, and our partners’ environmental performance. This process will enable us to increase\nour internal and external transparency and report progress against specific goals.\nCorporate Citizenship\nWe believe in supporting the community in which we work and providing our employees multiple opportunities to contribute to the community, including providing company-\nwide community service days/volunteerism supporting:\n• Patient advocacy/healthcare;\n• Health disparities;\n21\n• Charitable giving;\n• Community services (e.g., food, clothing and school supply drives); and\n• Participate in company -wide walks for various diseases.\nCORPORATE INFORMATION\nAurinia is organized under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta). We have two wholly-owned subsidiaries: Aurinia Pharma US, Inc., (Delaware incorporated) and Aurinia\nPharma Limited (United Kingdom incorporated). Our head and registered office is #140, 14315 - 118 Avenue, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T5L 4S6 and our phone number is\n+1 (250) 744-2487. Our U.S. commercial office is located at 77 Upper Rock Circle, Suite 700, Rockville, Maryland 20850.\nOur website address is www.auriniapharma.com and our investor relations website is located at https://ir.auriniapharma.com. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly\nreports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act are filed with the\nSEC and are available at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Such reports and other information are also available free of charge on our investor relations website as soon as\nreasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. The information posted on, or that can be accessed through, our website and\ninvestor relations website is not incorporated into this Annual Report and the contents of these websites are not intended to be incorporated by reference into any report or\ndocument we file with, or furnish to, the SEC. Certain documents are also filed with securities regulators in Canada and are available under our profile at the website\nwww.sedarplus.ca.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Annual\nReport, as well as general economic and business risks, together with any other documents we file with the SEC. The risks set out below are not the only risks we face; risks and\nuncertainties not currently known to use or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also harm our business, operating results and financial condition. If any of the\nfollowing events occur or risks materialize, it could harm our business, operating results and financial condition and cause the trading price of our common shares to decline.\nRisks Related to Commercialization\nOur success depends on our ability to commercialize LUPKYNIS. We are currently a single approved product company with commercial sales experience since January\n2021 and if we are not able to achieve our financial targets related to commercializing LUPKYNIS, then we may need to curtail or cease operations.\nOur business strategy is to optimize the clinical and commercial value of LUPKYNIS. We have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the\ndevelopment and commercialization of LUPKYNIS, and we expect LUPKYNIS to constitute our only product revenue for the foreseeable future. Our success depends on our\nability to commercialize LUPKYNIS successfully. Successful commercialization of LUPKYNIS is subject to many risks. There are numerous examples of unsuccessful product\nlaunches and failures to meet high expectations of market potential, including by pharmaceutical companies with more experience and resources than we have.\nWe have limited experience commercializing pharmaceutical products as an organization, having received marketing approval for LUPKYNIS, our sole commercial product, in\nJanuary 2021. In order to market LUPKYNIS successfully, we must continue to build our sales, marketing, managerial, compliance, and related capabilities or make\narrangements with third parties to perform these services. If we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, whether\nindependently or with third parties, we may not be able to commercialize LUPKYNIS appropriately and may not become profitable.\nPart of our strategy to commercialize LUPKYNIS in the United States is to maintain a direct field work force. These efforts have been and will continue to be expensive and\ntime-consuming, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully develop and maintain this capability. LUPKYNIS has only been a marketed product since\nJanuary 2021. In addition, prior to December 2020, there were no FDA approved treatments for LN. If we are unable to effectively train our field work force and equip them\nwith effective materials, including medical and sales literature to help them inform and educate potential customers, our efforts to commercialize successfully could be harmed,\nwhich would negatively impact our ability to generate product revenue.\n22\nOur ability to successfully commercialize LUPKYNIS will depend on effectively deploying the field work force we have established and maintaining marketing,\nmanufacturing, and distribution capabilities or relationships.\nOur ability to generate revenues and meet expectations is contingent on the successful commercialization of LUPKYNIS. A successful commercialization depends on our\nability to, amongst other things:\n• achieve and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements;\n• create and sustain market demand for and achieve market acceptance of LUPKYNIS, grow the market through our marketing and sales activities and other arrangements\nestablished for the promotion of LUPKYNIS, on a timeline that aligns with our regulatory or intellectual property protection periods;\n• educate physicians and patients about the importance of screening, routine monitoring along with treating to guidelines, benefits, administration and use of LUPKYNIS;\n• train, deploy, and support a qualified field work force;\n• ensure that our third-party manufacturers manufacture LUPKYNIS in sufficient quantities, in compliance with requirements of the FDA, and at acceptable quality and\npricing levels in order to meet commercial demand;\n• ensure that our third-party manufacturers develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are compliant with GMP regulations;\n• implement and maintain agreements with wholesalers, special pharmacy partners, distributors, and group purchasing organizations on commercially reasonable terms;\n• ensure that our entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers LUPKYNIS to our customers;\n• receive adequate levels of coverage and reimbursement for LUPKYNIS from commercial health plans and governmental health programs;\n• provide co-pay assistance to help qualified patients with out-of-pocket costs associated with their LUPKYNIS prescription and/or other programs to ensure patient access\nto our product;\n• obtain acceptance of LUPKYNIS as safe and effective by patients and the medical community;\n• influence the nature of publicity related to LUPKYNIS relative to the publicity related to our competitors’ products; and\n• maintain and defend our patent protection and regulatory exclusivity for LUPKYNIS.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control and if we are not successful in commercializing LUPKYNIS, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be harmed,\nand we may need to curtail or cease operations.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers and an estimated number of patients for a significant amount of our product revenue, and if we lose any of our significant\ncustomers, or if our estimates as to the number of potential patients is wrong, our business could be harmed.\nThe bulk of our product revenue is generated in the United States from a limited number of direct customers and most of our product revenue comes from two specialty\npharmacies. Revenues from our two main customers in the U.S. accounted for approximately 51% and 40%, respectively, of our total revenues for the year ended December 31,\n2023. Our third main customer is our collaboration partner, Otsuka. When combined, revenues from our two specialty pharmacy customers and Otsuka account for\napproximately 99% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023. The loss by us of any of these customers, or a material reduction in their purchases, could harm\nour business and prospects. In addition, if any of these customers were to fail to pay us in a timely manner, it could negatively impact our cash flow from operations.\nSales of our product can be greatly affected by the customer inventory levels that our customers carry. We monitor customer inventory of our product using a combination of\nmethods, including reports from our customers, and our own internal estimates. Our estimates of customer inventory may differ significantly from actual customer inventory\nlevels. Significant differences between actual and estimated customer inventory levels may result in excessive or insufficient stocking, which could result in substantial\nquantities of unsold customer inventory, or inadequate supplies of products in the distribution channels. Our customers make the ultimate determination of the amount of\ninventory to hold. Changes in customer inventory may cause our revenues to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may cause our operating results for a particular\nquarter to be below or above our expectations, the expectations of securities analysts, or the expectations of investors.\nOur estimates of the number of patients who have received or might have been candidates to use LUPKYNIS may not accurately reflect the true market for LUPKYNIS or the\nextent to which it will actually be used by patients. Our failure to develop the market for, forecast or successfully market LUPKYNIS could harm our business, as it could reduce\nour market potential.\n23\nLUPKYNIS may not achieve or maintain expected levels of market acceptance among physicians, patients, the medical community, and third-party payors, which could\nharm our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.\nThe commercial success of LUPKYNIS is dependent upon achieving and maintaining market acceptance among physicians, patients, and the medical community. Levels of\nmarket acceptance for LUPKYNIS could be impacted by several factors, many of which are not within our control, including but not limited to:\n• limitations or warnings contained in the approved labeling;\n• changes in the standard of care for the targeted indication;\n• limitations in the approved clinical indication;\n• demonstrated clinical safety and efficacy compared to other products;\n• potential for significant adverse side effects;\n• sales, marketing, and distribution support;\n• availability and extent of reimbursement from managed care plans and other third-party payors;\n• timing of market introduction;\n• the degree of cost-effectiveness;\n• widespread health concerns, such as pandemics;\n• availability of alternative therapies at similar or lower cost, including generic and over-the-counter products;\n• whether the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a first-line therapy or as a second- or third-line therapy;\n• adverse publicity about our product or favorable publicity about competitive products;\n• convenience and ease of administration of LUPKYNIS; and\n• potential product liability claims.\nIf LUPKYNIS does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients, and the medical community, we may not generate sufficient revenue, and we may not\nbecome or remain profitable. Efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of LUPKYNIS may require significant resources and may never\nbe successful.\nLUPKYNIS may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations or third-party coverage and reimbursement policies, which would harm our business.\nPrice controls and price pressure may be imposed in foreign and U.S. markets, which may adversely affect our future profitability. LUPKYNIS may become subject to\nunfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could harm our business. In addition, reimbursement may be limited\nor unavailable in certain market segments which could make it difficult for us or our partners to sell LUPKYNIS profitably. Adverse pricing limitations might hinder our ability\nto recoup our investment in LUPKYNIS.\nOur ability to commercialize LUPKYNIS successfully will also depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for LUPKYNIS will be available from\ngovernment authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on third-party reimbursement\nfor all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and\ncommercial payors is critical to market acceptance of LUPKYNIS. Our ability to successfully commercialize LUPKYNIS will depend in part on the extent to which coverage\nand adequate reimbursement of LUPKYNIS will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government\nauthorities and other third-party payors such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medication they will pay for and establish\nreimbursement levels, which for the product, is beyond our control.\nA primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting\ncoverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular products. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined\ndiscounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for products. We cannot be certain that coverage will be available for LUPKYNIS and, if available, the level of\nreimbursement. Reimbursement will impact the demand for, or the price of, our approved product. If reimbursement is limited or not available, we might not be able to\nsuccessfully commercialize LUPKYNIS.\nThere may be delays in obtaining reimbursement for recently approved products and eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any product will be paid for in all cases or\nat a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, patient services, sale, and distribution. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory\ndiscounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors. Private third-party payors often rely on Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations\nin setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and\n24\nprofitable payment rates from both government funded and private payors for our approved product could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to\nraise capital needed to commercialize LUPKYNIS and on our overall financial condition.\nIf we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program or other governmental pricing programs in the United States, we\ncould be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations\nand financial condition.\nWe participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, as administered by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and other federal and state government pricing programs\nin the United States, and we may participate in additional government pricing programs in the future. These programs generally require us to pay rebates or otherwise provide\ndiscounts to government payors in connection with products, including LUPKYNIS, that are dispensed to beneficiaries of these programs. In some cases, such as with the\nMedicaid Drug Rebate Program, the rebates are based on pricing and rebate calculations that we report on a monthly and quarterly basis to the government agencies that\nadminister the programs.\nPricing and rebate calculations are complex, vary among products and programs, and are often subject to interpretation by governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts.\nThe terms, scope and complexity of these government pricing programs change frequently. Responding to current and future changes may increase our costs and the complexity\nof compliance will be time consuming. In addition, there is increased focus by the Office of Inspector General on the methodologies used by manufacturers to calculate Average\nManufacturer Price (AMP), and best price (BP), to assess our compliance with reporting requirements under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. We are liable for errors\nassociated with our submission of pricing data and for any overcharging of government payors. For example, failure to submit monthly/quarterly AMP and BP data on a timely\nbasis could result in a civil monetary penalty per day for each day the submission is late beyond the due date. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify\noverpayments could result in allegations against us under the Federal False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. Any required refunds to the U.S. government or\nresponding to a government investigation or enforcement action would be expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition. If Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were to terminate our rebate agreement, no federal payments would be available under\nMedicaid or Medicare for our covered outpatient products, which would harm our business.\nWe report on various metrics relating to LUPKYNIS activity, and no single metric is indicative of, or directly correlated to, our current or future financial performance.\nWe report on various metrics relating to LUPKYNIS activity, including the number of prescriptions/PSFs, conversion rates (being the proportion of PSFs that convert into\npatients on therapy), persistency rates (being how long patients on therapy remain on therapy), adherence (being the degree to which patients take their prescribed dose of\nLUPKYNIS in the manner and at the times prescribed by their doctor), numbers of patients on therapy and as of the fourth quarter of 2023, we also include patient restarts and\npatients resulting from hospital fills (which are estimated based on shipping patterns). None of these metrics, in and of themselves, is indicative of current or future financial\nperformance. There is no guarantee that a patient for whom we receive a PSF will become a patient on therapy, or that the number of patients estimated from hospital fills are\naccurate. Converting a patient from a PSF into a patient on therapy includes multiple steps, many of which are outside of our control, such as patients and doctors needing to\ncoordinate applications relating to insurance coverage for LUPKYNIS, and potentially one or more appeals if coverage is denied initially. We refer to patients for whom we\nreceive a PSF but that never convert into a patient on therapy as a cancellation. Cancellations result in zero revenue. Even when a patient becomes a patient on therapy, there is\nno guarantee that they will be a patient for which we receive revenue (as certain patients are eligible for our free drug program), or that they will remain on drug for any period\nof time (whether due to a reduction in LN activity, an actual (or perceived) drug-related adverse event, or from a lack of taking medication, or otherwise). Patients on therapy\nmay also not take their prescribed dose of LUPKYNIS in the manner and at the times prescribed by their doctor, which could result in reduced orders of LUPKYNIS in respect\nof that patient on therapy versus a patient that is prescribed a higher dose of LUPKYNIS and follows their prescription exactly as prescribed. We refer to patients who have\nconverted from a PSF into a patient on therapy, but who subsequently cease treatment (for any reason), as discontinuations. A patient on therapy who discontinues treatment\ngenerally results in zero future revenue, and discontinuations can occur at any time once a patient commences therapy. Accordingly, our PSF activity, and related metrics, are\nnot in and of themselves directly indicative of our current or future financial performance.\nOur net product revenue to date is primarily the result of our two main customers in the United States (our two specialty pharmacies) who order LUPKYNIS for dispensing to\npatients, and from our collaboration partner, Otsuka (see further under \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition\" later in this Report for further\ndiscussion). The orders for\n25\nproduct from our two main customers do not necessarily correlate to our PSF numbers. Our revenue received from Otsuka has no relevance to any of the above noted metrics.\nOur revenue could therefore fluctuate in a manner contrary to our PSF trends, both where revenue could be greater than a PSF trend would indicate, or where revenue could be\nlesser than a PSF trend would indicate. Therefore, while we report on PSFs and related figures to provide an indication of potential prescription activity for LUPKYNIS, there is\nno single metric that is directly correlated to, or indicative of, our future financial performance.\nRisks Related to Patents and Proprietary Technology\nOur proprietary rights may not adequately protect our intellectual property and product, and if we cannot obtain adequate protection of our intellectual property and\nproduct, we may not be able to successfully market our product.\nPatents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our practice has been to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions, and improvements to our\ninventions that are considered important to the development of our business.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents, defend patents, maintain trade secret protection, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of\nothers. Interpretation and evaluation of pharmaceutical patent claims present complex and often novel legal and factual questions. Accordingly, there is some question as to the\nextent to which pharmaceutical discoveries and related products and processes can be effectively protected by patents. As a result, there can be no assurance that:\n• patent applications will result in the issuance of patents;\n• patents issued will provide adequate protection or any competitive advantages;\n• patents issued will not be successfully challenged and invalidated by third parties;\n• LUPKYNIS does not infringe the patents or intellectual property of others;\n• that our patents or regulatory protections will provide sufficient duration for LUPKYNIS to reach a level of profitability; or\n• that we will be able to obtain any extensions of the applicable patent terms.\nEven if issued, patents provide finite terms of protection and, in general, those time periods are not able to be extended. Under law, we have been granted new chemical entity\nexclusivity for the marketing of LUPKYNIS to January 2026 in the United States. Our original composition of matter patent for voclosporin expired in the United States in\nOctober 2022. We have sought a patent term extension to extend the term of that United States patent to October 2027, which remains in process. To date, we have been able to\nobtain interim patent term extensions for that patent that currently extend its term to October 2024. Our other existing Orange Book listed patents for LUPKYNIS have a term to\n2037. Those are the maximum terms for those patents, which are our main protection against generic entrants into the LN market. It is possible that one or more of our patents\ncould be subject to a challenge (such as an inter partes review) which, if successful, could limit the protection offered by that patent even further or eliminate it entirely, which\nwould have a negative impact on our ability to continue our business in its current form.\nSeveral pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device companies and research and academic institutions have developed technologies, filed patent applications, or\nreceived patents on various technologies that may be related to our business. Some of these technologies, applications or patents may conflict with or adversely affect our\ntechnologies or intellectual property rights. Any conflicts with the intellectual property of others could limit the scope of the patents, if any, that we may be able to obtain or\nresult in the denial of patent applications altogether. Obtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee\npayment, and other imposed by government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nWe may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nAn unfavorable outcome in an interference or opposition proceeding or a conflict with the intellectual property of others could preclude us or our collaborators or licensees from\nmaking, using or selling product using the technology, or require us to obtain license rights from third parties. It is not known whether any prevailing party would offer a license\non commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Further, any such license could require the expenditure of substantial time and resources and could harm our business. If such\nlicenses are not available, we could encounter delays or prohibition of the development or introduction of LUPKYNIS.\nWe may need to enter into license agreements in the future. As part of discovery and development activities, we routinely evaluate in-licenses from academic and research\norganizations. Future license agreements might impose various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, and other obligations on us. If there is any conflict, dispute, disagreement\nor issue of non-\n26\nperformance between us and our licensing partners (such as Otsuka) regarding our rights or obligations under the licensing agreement, we may owe damages, our licensor may\nhave a right to terminate the affected license, and our and our partner’s ability to utilize the affected intellectual property in our drug discovery and development efforts, and our\nability to ensure into collaboration or marketing agreements for an affected product, may be adversely affected.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time-consuming, and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors or commercial supply companies or others may infringe our patents and other intellectual property rights. To counter such infringement, we may advise such\ncompanies of our intellectual property rights, including, in some cases, intellectual property rights that provide protection for our product, and demand that they stop infringing\nthose rights. Such demand may provide such companies the opportunity to challenge the validity of certain of our intellectual property rights, or the opportunity to seek a\nfinding that their activities do not infringe our intellectual property rights. We may also be required to file infringement actions, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In\nan infringement proceeding, a defendant may assert, and a court may agree with a defendant, that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other\nparty from using the intellectual property at issue. An adverse result in any litigation could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information\ncould be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our\npersonnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments\nand if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could impact the price of our common shares. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially\nincrease our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient\nfinancial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more\neffectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could\nharm our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, and defending our intellectual property rights in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, time consuming, distract our personnel\nfrom their normal responsibilities and might be unsuccessful.\nOur intellectual property rights in some countries outside of the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign\ncountries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Further, licensing partners may not prosecute patents in\ncertain jurisdictions in which we may obtain commercial rights, thereby precluding the possibility of later obtaining patent protection in these countries. Consequently, we may\nnot be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing product made using our inventions in\nand into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own\nproducts and may also export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products\nmay compete with LUPKYNIS, and our intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries,\nparticularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to\nbiotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our intellectual property rights or marketing of competing products in violation of our\nproprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our\nefforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our proprietary rights at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at\nrisk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded,\nif any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant\ncommercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\n27\nChanges in patent law in the United States and other jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect LUPKYNIS.\nAs is the case with other pharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the\npharmaceutical industry involve both technological and legal complexity and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. Patent reform legislation in the\nUnited States and other countries could increase those uncertainties and costs.\nThe first-to-file provisions of the current United States patent system only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not yet clear what, if any, impact those\nprovisions will have on the operation of our business. The implementation and interpretation of new patent laws could make it more difficult to obtain patent protection for our\ninventions and increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which\ncould harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the\nrights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition, there have been recent proposals for additional changes to the patent laws of the U.S. and other countries that, if\nadopted, could impact our ability to obtain patent protection for our proprietary technology or our ability to enforce our proprietary technology. Depending on future actions by\nthe U.S. Congress, the United States courts, the USPTO and the relevant law-making bodies in other countries, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in\nunpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nNot all of our trademarks are registered. Failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business.\nIf we do not secure registrations for our trademarks, we may encounter more difficulty in enforcing them against third parties than we otherwise would, which could adversely\naffect our business. During trademark registration proceedings in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, we may receive rejections. We will be given an opportunity to\nrespond to those rejections, but we may not be able to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third\nparties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed\nagainst our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed. Confidentiality agreements with employees and\nthird parties may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets or other proprietary information.\nThere may be an unauthorized disclosure of the significant amount of confidential information under our control. We maintain and manage confidential information relating to\nour technology, research and development, production, marketing, and business operations and those of our collaborators, in various forms. Although we have implemented\ncontrols to protect the confidentiality of such information, there can be no assurance that such controls will be effective. Unauthorized disclosures of such information could\nsubject us to complaints or lawsuits for damages, in Canada, the United States or other jurisdictions, or could otherwise have a negative impact on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, reputation and credibility.\nRisks Related to Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe may continue to have negative cash flow and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe had negative operating cash flow for multiple years, including the year ended December 31, 2023. To the extent that we have negative operating cash flow in future periods,\nwe will likely need to allocate a portion of our cash reserves to fund such negative cash flow. We may also be required to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or\ndebt securities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate a positive cash flow from our operations, that additional capital or other types of financing will be\navailable when needed or that these financings will be on terms favorable or acceptable to us if available at all.\nWe have incurred losses and anticipate that our losses may increase as we continue to expand and develop our business and commercialize LUPKYNIS. As of December 31,\n2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $942.3 million. Although we received FDA approval and commenced commercialization of LUPKYNIS in the United States in January\n2021, we have and may continue to incur losses and there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient product revenue to become profitable at all or on a\nsustained basis.\n28\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below\nexpectations or cause any guidance we may provide to be inaccurate.\nOur operating results are difficult to predict and will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year. As we only received FDA approval for LUPKYNIS in 2021, there\nis an absence of historical sales data. This has resulted in our revenue from product sales being, and we expect will continue to be, difficult to predict. We also expect to have\nquarter-to-quarter fluctuations in expenses, some of which could be significant, due to clinical trial activities, regulatory activities, commercialization activities and business\ndevelopment.\nThe cumulative effects of these factors could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. Therefore, comparing our operating\nresults on a period to period basis may not be meaningful. Our past results will not be a reliable indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could\nalso result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of\nanalysts or investors, or below any forecast we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts and investors, the\nprice of our common shares could decline significantly. Such decline could occur even when we meet any previously publicly stated revenue or earnings guidance we may\nprovide.\nLegislative actions, potential new accounting pronouncements, and higher insurance costs are likely to impact our future financial position or results of operations.\nFuture changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse, unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our financial position or results of operations. New\npronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred with greater frequency and are expected to occur in the future. Compliance with changing\nregulations of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses. All these uncertainties are leading generally toward increasing insurance costs,\nwhich may harm our business, results of operations, and our ability to purchase any such insurance, at acceptable rates or at all, in the future.\nWe are exposed to inflation risk, credit risk and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange, each of which could affect the value of our\ncurrent assets and liabilities.\nWe invest our cash reserves in U.S. dollar denominated, fixed rate, highly liquid and highly rated financial instruments such as corporate bonds, commercial paper, treasury\nbills and bonds. We do not believe that the results of operations or cash flows would be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates relative to\nour investment portfolio, due to the short-term nature of the investments and our current ability to hold these investments to maturity.\nWe are exposed to financial risk related to the fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates which could harm our future operating results or cash flows. Foreign currency risk\nis the risk that variations in exchange rates between the United States dollar and foreign currencies, primarily with the Canadian dollar, Swiss Franc and Great British Pound\nwhich could affect our operating and financial results. We hold the majority of our cash reserves in U.S. dollars and the majority of our revenues and expenses, including clinical\ntrial costs are also denominated in U.S. dollars, which mitigates the risk of material foreign exchange fluctuations.\nOur restructuring program and associated organizational changes may not adequately reduce our operating costs or improve operating margins, may lead to additional\nworkforce attrition, and may cause operational disruptions, and there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of the restructuring program.\nOn February 15, 2024, we announced that we were implementing a restructuring program. The restructuring program includes ceasing future development activities on\nAUR200 and AUR300. This will result in a one-time charge in the first quarter of 2024 of approximately $11 - $15 million. The charge will primarily be made up of severance\ncosts, contract termination costs and other costs associated with terminating the programs. We expect to recognize annual cost savings of approximately $50 - $55 million, with\napproximately 75% of the savings being recognized in 2024 excluding the one-time restructuring charge in the first quarter of 2024, with no impact on commercial investment.\nThe Company anticipates reducing employee headcount by at least 25% by the end of the first quarter of 2024. There is no planned reduction in headcount in commercial or\ncommercial supporting roles.\nThe estimates of charges and expenditures, and the associated annual cost savings, we expect to incur in connection with the restructuring program, and timing thereof, are\nsubject to a number of assumptions, including local law requirements in various\n29\njurisdictions, and we may incur costs that are greater, or recognize lower annual cost savings, than we currently anticipate in connection with the restructuring program.\nThe restructuring program may yield unintended consequences, such as the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, employee attrition beyond our intended reduction in\nforce, a reduction in morale among our remaining employees, greater than anticipated costs incurred in connection with implementing the restructuring program, and the risks\nthat we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the restructuring program to the extent or as quickly as we anticipate, if at all, all of which may materially adversely affect\nour results of operations or financial condition. These restructuring initiatives could place substantial demands on our management and employees, which could lead to the\ndiversion of our management’s and employees’ attention from other business priorities. In addition, while certain positions are being eliminated in connection with the\nrestructuring program, many functions necessary to our reduced operations remain, and we may be unsuccessful in distributing the duties and obligations of departed employees\namong our remaining employees or to external service providers, which could result in disruptions to our operations. We may also discover that the workforce reduction and\nother restructuring efforts will make it difficult for us to pursue new opportunities and initiatives and require us to hire qualified replacement personnel, which may require us to\nincur additional and unanticipated costs and expenses. We may further discover that, despite the implementation of our restructuring program, we may require additional capital\nto continue expanding our business, and we may not be able to obtain such capital on acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure to successfully accomplish any of the above\nactivities and goals may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nOur activities to date have been limited to, among other things, organizing and staffing our Company, business planning, business development, raising capital, developing,\nmanufacturing, and, marketing and commercializing LUPKYNIS, in addition to undertaking nonclinical studies, and conducting clinical trials and business development. We\nhave limited history demonstrating our ability to manufacture a product at commercial scale or conduct sales, marketing, and distribution activities necessary for successful\nproduct commercialization. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as reliable as they could be if we had a longer and more\nestablished operating history.\nIn addition, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other known and unknown factors. We may need to expand our capabilities to\nsupport future activities related to the commercialization of LUPKYNIS. We may be unsuccessful in adding such capabilities.\nAnticipated revenues may not be derived from licensing activities.\nOur future performance may be impacted by our ability to generate royalty or other revenues (such as commercial and regulatory milestones and product revenue) from licenses\n(such as the license granted to Otsuka) and the successful commercialization of LUPKYNIS. We anticipate that some of our revenues in the future may be derived from\nproducts licensed to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Accordingly, these revenues will depend, in large part, upon the success of these companies, and our\noperating results may fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in their research, development, and marketing expenditures. These reductions and delays may result\nfrom factors that are not within our control, including:\na. changes in economic conditions;\nb. changes in the regulatory environment, including governmental pricing controls affecting health care and health care providers;\nc. pricing pressures;\nd. other factors affecting research and development spending; and\ne. change in strategy of our business partners.\nThe failure of Otsuka or future licensing partners could harm our business or results of operations and the global reputation of LUPKYNIS.\nOur portfolio of investments is subject to market, interest and credit risk that may reduce its value.\nWe maintain a portfolio of investments. Changes in the value of our portfolio of investments could adversely affect our earnings. In particular, the value of our investments may\ndecline due to increases in interest rates, downgrades of the bonds and other securities included in our portfolio, instability in the global financial markets that reduces the\nliquidity of securities included in our portfolio, declines in the value of collateral underlying the securities included in our portfolio and other factors. Each of these events may\ncause us to record charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio or sell investments\n30\nfor less than our acquisition cost. Although we attempt to mitigate these risks through diversification of our investments and continuous monitoring of our portfolio's overall risk\nprofile, the value of our investments may nevertheless decline.\nWe may require additional financing to achieve our goals, and failure to obtain such when required could force us to delay, reduce or terminate our commercialization\nefforts.\nWe may require additional capital resources to expand and develop our business. Advancing LUPKYNIS inside and outside the United States, marketing for LUPKYNIS, or\nacquisition and development of any other products will require considerable resources and additional access to capital markets. In addition, our future cash requirements may\nvary materially from those now expected. Our future capital requirements may increase if for example:\na. we experience unexpected or increased costs relating to preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, or other lawsuits, brought by\neither us or our competition;\nb. we elect to develop, acquire or license new technologies, products or businesses;\nc. we are required to perform additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials; or\nd. we have a change in commercial strategy which could result in increase in headcount, direct to consumer marketing campaigns, and advertising.\nWe could potentially seek additional funding through corporate collaborations and licensing arrangements or through public or private equity or debt financing. However, if\ncapital market conditions in general, or with respect to life sciences companies such as ours, are unfavorable, our ability to obtain significant additional funding on acceptable\nterms, if at all, will be negatively affected. Additional financing that we may pursue may involve the sale of common shares which could result in significant dilution to our\nshareholders. If sufficient capital is not available, we may be required to delay our research and development projects, halt commercialization, relinquish rights to our\ntechnologies or products on terms unfavorable to us, which could harm our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or product licenses and integration of these acquisitions and any products acquired or licensed may disrupt our\nbusiness and management.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may acquire additional companies, products or technologies principally related to, or complementary to, our current operations. At any\ngiven time, we may be evaluating acquisitions of companies, products or technologies or may be exploring licensing opportunities, and may have entered into confidentiality\nagreements, non-binding letters of intent or may be in the process of conducting due diligence with respect to such opportunities. Any such acquisitions will be accompanied by\ncertain risks including, but not limited to:\n• exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the unknown issues with any associated technologies or research;\n• inability to recognize expected benefit of synergies and fully recognize return on investment;\n• higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses;\n• the difficulty and expense of integrating operations, systems, and personnel of acquired companies;\n• disruption of our ongoing business;\n• inability to retain key customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the acquired company;\n• diversion of management’s time and attention; and\n• possible dilution to shareholders.\nWe may never be able to efficiently execute on business development activities, properly integrate acquired assets (including any human capital associated with the acquired\nassets), or bring management's expectation of benefit from the acquired assets to fruition. We may not be able to successfully overcome these risks and other problems\nassociated with acquisitions and this may harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Drug Development and Regulatory Approval\nEnrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials is an expensive and time-consuming process and could be made more difficult or rendered impossible by multiple\nfactors outside of our control.\nWe may encounter delays in enrolling, or be unable to enroll, a sufficient number of patients to complete any of our clinical trials, and even once enrolled we may be unable to\nretain a sufficient number of patients to complete any of our clinical trials. Patient enrollment and retention in clinical trials depends on many factors, including the size of the\npatient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the existing body of safety and efficacy data with respect to the studied product, the number and nature of competing\ntreatments and ongoing clinical trials of competing products for the same indication, the proximity of\n31\npatients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial. Furthermore, any negative results we may report in clinical trials of our product may make it difficult or\nimpossible to recruit and retain patients in other clinical trials of the same product. Delays or failures in planned patient enrollment and/or retention may result in increased costs,\nprogram delays or both, which could make us subject to regulatory penalties or fines due to non-fulfillment of our post-marketing requirements and post-marketing\ncommitments with the FDA.\nEven though the FDA has approved LUPKYNIS, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional\nexpense. Additionally, LUPKYNIS could be subject to restrictions and market withdrawal and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory\nrequirements or experience unanticipated problems with LUPKYNIS.\nThe FDA and other agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure that\nthey are marketed and distributed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA and DOJ impose stringent\nrestrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use. If we market LUPKYNIS in a manner inconsistent with our approved labeling and indication, we may be\nsubject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of the federal FDCA and other statutes, including the False Claims Act (FCA), relating to the promotion and\nadvertising of prescription drugs may lead to investigations and enforcement actions alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state\nconsumer protection laws, which violations may result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties.\nThe manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, and recordkeeping for LUPKYNIS will be subject to\nextensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as\ncontinued compliance with GMP and GCP for clinical trials that we conduct post-approval.\nDiscovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or\nmanufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n• restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of our product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n• fines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials;\n• product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n• injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt to changes in existing requirements, adopt new requirements or policies, or maintain regulatory compliance. If we fail to\nmaintain compliance, we may lose marketing approval, which would harm our business, prospects, and ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nLUPKYNIS may have undesirable side effects which may require it to be taken off the market, include additional safety warnings or otherwise limit sales.\nLUPKYNIS has undergone safety testing, however, not all adverse effects can be predicted or anticipated. Unforeseen side effects from LUPKYNIS could arise after the\napproved product has been marketed. Ongoing or future trials of our product may not support the conclusion that LUPKYNIS has an acceptable safety profile or the FDA may\ndisagree with our clinical trial investigators’ interpretation of data from clinical trials or post marketing surveillance in determining if adverse or unacceptable side effects are\nrelated to LUPKYNIS. There can be no assurance that discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with LUPKYNIS, manufacturers or manufacturing\nprocesses, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, will not occur at any time during commercial and future use of LUPKYNIS. Furthermore, there can be no\nassurance that disease resistance or other unforeseen factors will not limit the effectiveness of LUPKYNIS. The most common adverse reactions to LUPKYNIS demonstrated in\nour Phase 3 AURORA study were glomerular filtration rate decrease, hypertension, diarrhea, headache, anemia, cough, urinary tract infection, abdominal pain upper, dyspepsia,\nalopecia, renal impairment, abdominal pain, mouth ulceration, fatigue, tremor, acute kidney injury, and decreased appetite. These common adverse reactions were also repeated\nin our AURORA 2 continuation study and our real world experience with LUPKYNIS since our product launch in 2021. Any adverse discoveries may yield various results,\nincluding:\na. regulatory authorities may require us to take LUPKYNIS off the market;\nb. regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, a contraindication or field alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n32\nc. we may be required to change the way LUPKYNIS is administered, impose other risk-management measures, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of\nLUPKYNIS;\nd. we may be subject to limitations on how we may promote LUPKYNIS;\ne. sales of LUPKYNIS may decrease significantly;\nf. refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approve application that we submit;\ng. recall of products;\nh. refusal to permit the import or export of LUPKYNIS; and\ni. we may be subject to litigation or product liability claims.\nAny of these events could prevent us, our collaborators (including Otsuka) or our potential future partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of LUPKYNIS or\ncould substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenue from the sale of LUPKYNIS. It\nwould harm our business, reputation, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe or our partners (including Otsuka) may never obtain full approval or commercialize LUPKYNIS outside of the United States, which would limit our ability to realize\ntheir full market potential.\nTo market any products outside of the United States, we and Otsuka or other potential future partners must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory\nrequirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and\nregulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval procedures vary among countries and may require\nadditional pre-clinical studies, clinical trials, or additional administrative review periods, which could result in significant delays, difficulties, and costs for us. While we have\nobtained approval by the EC and MHRA, specific jurisdictions covered by those approvals (and approvals in other jurisdictions) also require additional regulatory approvals,\nsuch as pricing and reimbursement approval, before sales can commence in those jurisdictions. Not all of those jurisdictions have provided all such approvals to date.\nIn addition, our failure to obtain regulatory approval in any country may delay or have negative effects on the process for regulatory approval in other countries. If regulatory\napproval is obtained it may not be as broad as what was obtained in other jurisdictions. We have limited experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets. If\nwe or our current or future partners fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, our target market will be\nreduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of LUPKYNIS could be harmed.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and we may be required to limit commercialization of or recalLl UPKYNIS.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of product candidates in human clinical trials, and an even greater risk in connection with our\ncommercialization of LUPKYNIS. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that LUPKYNIS causes injuries, then we could incur substantial liabilities.\nRegardless of merit of eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\na. decreased demand for LUPKYNIS;\nb. injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\nc. withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\nd. significant costs to defend the related litigation;\ne. substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\nf. loss of revenue; and\ng. the inability to, or restrictions on our ability to, commercialize any approved product.\nAlthough we maintain product liability insurance coverage, it may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. The obligation to pay any product liability claim in\nexcess of whatever insurance we can acquire, or the recall of or limitation on our ability to commercialize LUPKYNIS as a result of product liability concerns, could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, and future prospects.\n33\nCompliance with ongoing post-marketing obligations for LUPKYNIS may uncover new safety information that could give rise to a product recall, updated warnings, or\nother regulatory actions that could have an adverse impact on our business.\nAfter a regulatory body, such as the FDA, approves a drug or biologic for marketing, the product’s sponsor must comply with several post-marketing obligations that continue\nuntil the product is discontinued. These post-marketing obligations include the reporting of adverse events to the agency within specified timeframes, the submission of product-\nspecific annual reports that include changes in the distribution, manufacturing, and labeling information, and notification when a drug product is found to have significant\ndeviations from its approved manufacturing specifications (among others). Our ongoing compliance with these types of mandatory reporting requirements could result in\nadditional requests for information from regulatory bodies that govern our products and, depending on the scope of a potential product issue that a regulatory body may decide\nto pursue, could potentially also result in a request from the agency to conduct a product recall or to strengthen warnings and/or revise other label information about the product.\nRegulatory bodies may also require or request the withdrawal of the product from the market. Any of these post-marketing regulatory actions could materially affect our sales\nand increase our costs and, therefore, have the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to build out a pipeline of product candidates.\nWe may not be able to continue to identify or develop, at all or in a timely manner, new products. Even if we are successful in building our pipeline, the potential product\ncandidates that we identify may not be suitable for clinical development or commercialization. If we do not successfully identify, develop, and commercialize new products\nbased upon our approach, we will not be able to diversify our portfolio which could result in harm to our financial position and impact the trading price of our common shares.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties and Partners\nWe are dependent on Otsuka for the development and commercialization of LUPKYNIS in several countries outside the United States. The failure to meet contractual,\nregulatory, or other obligations could adversely affect our business.\nWe have entered into an exclusive license agreement with Otsuka that provides the licensee exclusive rights to the development and commercialization of LUPKYNIS in\nvarious specified regions outside of the United States. As a result, we are dependent on Otsuka to achieve full regulatory approval of LUPKYNIS for marketing in these regions\nand for the commercialization of LUPKYNIS, if approved. The timing and amount of any milestone and royalty payments we may receive under this agreement, as well as the\ncommercial success of LUPKYNIS in those regions outside of the United States, will depend on, among other things, the efforts, allocation of resources, and successful\ncommercialization of LUPKYNIS by Otsuka. Otsuka, accounted for approximately 8% of the Company's total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nWe also depend on Otsuka to comply with all applicable laws relative to the development and commercialization of LUPKYNIS in those countries. We do not control the\nindividual efforts of Otsuka and have limited ability to terminate this agreement if Otsuka does not perform as anticipated. The failure of Otsuka to devote sufficient time and\neffort to the development and commercialization of LUPKYNIS, or the failure of Otsuka to meet their obligations to us, including for future royalties, milestone payments,\nmanufacturing services payments and other collaboration payments; to adequately deploy business continuity plans in the event of a crisis; and/or satisfactorily resolve\nsignificant disagreements with us or address other factors, could harm our financial results and operations.\nIf any licensee or authorized sub-licensee of LUPKYNIS violates, or is alleged to have violated, any laws or regulations during the performance of their obligations for us, it is\npossible that we could suffer financial and reputational harm, or other negative outcomes, including possible legal consequences. Any termination, breach, or expiration of any\nof this license agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial position by reducing or eliminating the potential for us to receive milestone payments and\nroyalties. In such an event, we may be required to devote additional efforts and to incur additional costs associated with pursuing regulatory approval and commercialization of\nLUPKYNIS. Alternatively, we may attempt to identify and transact with a new licensee, but there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify a suitable licensee or\ntransact at all, or on terms that are favorable to us.\nIn addition, license, research, and development agreements with third parties include indemnification and obligation provisions that are customary in the industry. These\nguarantees generally require us to compensate the other party for certain damages and costs incurred because of third-party claims or damages arising from these transactions.\nThese provisions may survive termination of the underlying agreement. The nature of the potential obligations prevents us from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum\npotential amount we could be required to pay.\n34\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties in compliance with regulations or meet\nexpected deadlines, we might be subject to regulatory penalties or fines due to non-compliance with our post-marketing approval requirements.\nWe depend upon independent investigators and collaborators, such as contract research organizations or CROs, universities and medical institutions, to conduct clinical trials\nunder agreements with us. These collaborators are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. Nevertheless,\nwe are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, including GCP requirements, and the applicable\nprotocol. If we, or any of our CROs or third party contractors, fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable\nand the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory\nauthority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product\nproduced under current GMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials or make us subject to fines or regulatory penalties,\nwhich would materially adversely affect our business.\nWe have limited experience in drug formulation or manufacturing and rely exclusively on third parties, in many cases as sole provider, to formulate and manufacture\nLUPKYNIS, and any disruption or loss of these relationships could delay our development and commercialization efforts.\nWe have no experience in drug formulation or manufacturing and do not intend to establish our own manufacturing facilities. For example, we are using the following third\nparties for manufacturing and encapsulation:\n• Lonza is currently the sole source manufacturer of our drug substance; and\n• Catalent is solely providing services with respect to encapsulating LUPKYNIS for our commercial and clinical supply, clinical labeling and global distribution for\nclinical trial purposes.\nIf we are unable to continue our relationships with one or more of our third-party contractors, in particular where those third-party contracts are one of our sole providers, we\ncould experience delays in commercialization and development efforts as we locate and qualify new contractors. Our reliance on a limited number of third-party manufacturers\nexposes us to the following risks:\n• We may be unable to identify third-party manufacturers on acceptable terms or at all because the number of potential manufacturers is limited, and the FDA must\napprove any replacement manufacturer. This approval could require new testing and compliance inspections. In addition, a new third-party manufacturer would have to\nbe educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of LUPKYNIS after receipt of FDA approval.\n• Our third-party manufacturers might be unable to formulate and manufacture LUPKYNIS in the volume and of the quality required to meet our clinical and/or\ncommercial needs.\n• Our third-party manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to\nsuccessfully produce, store, and distribute LUPKYNIS for commercialization, as applicable.\n• The facilities used by our third-party manufacturers to manufacture LUPKYNIS must be approved by the FDA.\n• If any third-party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for LUPKYNIS, we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property\nrights to the innovation. Each of these risks could delay the commercialization of LUPKYNIS, or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenue.\nAny disruption or loss of these relationships could delay our development and commercialization efforts and our business could be harmed.\nWe rely on third parties for the supply and manufacture of LUPKYNIS, which can be unpredictable in terms of quality, cost, timing, and availability. If we encounter any\nsuch difficulties, our ability to supply LUPKYNIS for commercial sale could be delayed or halted entirely.\nManufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, stability, quality\ncontrol and assurance, and shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, provincial, state, and foreign regulations. We rely on a limited\nnumber of third parties to manufacture and supply raw materials for LUPKYNIS. The third parties we choose to manufacture and supply raw materials for LUPKYNIS are not\nunder our control and may not perform as agreed or may terminate their agreements with us, and we may not be able to find other third parties to manufacture and supply raw\nmaterials on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If any of these events were to occur, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\n35\nIn addition, drug and chemical manufacturers are subject to GMP regulations and various regulatory inspections, including those conducted by the FDA, to ensure strict\ncompliance with GMP and other government regulations. While we are obligated to audit the performance of our third-party contractors, we do not have complete control over\ntheir compliance. We could be adversely impacted if our third-party manufacturers or distributors do not comply with these standards and regulations. For non-compliance, the\nregulatory authority may levy penalties and sanctions, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of the government to grant review of submissions or market approval\nof products, or cause delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, product seizures or recalls, operating restrictions, facility closures and criminal prosecutions. Any of this\nwill have an impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe process of manufacturing LUPKYNIS is susceptible to product loss due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to contamination, equipment failure or improper\ninstallation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, contamination and inconsistency in yields, variability in product characteristics, and difficulties in scaling the\nproduction process. Even minor deviations from manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial,\nviral or other contaminations are discovered in our product or in the manufacturing facilities in which our product are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed\nfor an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. Any adverse developments affecting manufacturing operations for our product may result in\nshipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls, or other interruptions in the supply of LUPKYNIS. We may also have to take inventory write-\noffs and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts, or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives.\nWhile we attempt to mitigate against this risk by ordering additional quantities and maintaining a safety stock of our product, we may not estimate the required amounts\nsufficiently and even this may not provide sufficient mitigation. We may also incorrectly forecast our demand and over-order quantities of our product, or the materials needed\nto manufacture our product, which could result in write offs, potentially in material amounts.\nIf our third-party manufacturers are unable to produce the required commercial quantities of LUPKYNIS to meet demand on a timely basis or at all, or if they fail to comply\nwith applicable laws for the manufacturing, we will suffer damage to our reputation and commercial prospects and we will lose potential revenue.\nIn response to the ongoing armed conflicts in Ukraine and in the Middle East, the U.S. government, numerous state governments, the EU and other countries in which we\nconduct business have imposed a wide range of economic sanctions that restrict commerce and business dealings with Russia, certain regions of Ukraine, certain regions in the\nMiddle East and certain entities. Our suppliers rely on some materials that were originally sourced from the areas impacted by the armed conflict which may increase supply\ndisruptions. This could, in turn, adversely impact our ability to manufacture and distribute LUPKYNIS.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain our agreements with third parties to sell and distribute LUPKYNIS to patients, our results of operations and business could be\nadversely affected.\nWe rely on third parties to commercially sell and distribute LUPKYNIS to patients. For example, we have contracted with a limited number of specialty pharmacies and\nspecialty distributors to sell and distribute LUPKYNIS. The use of specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that\nthese organizations will:\n• not provide us accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, the number of patients who are using LUPKYNIS or serious adverse reactions, events and/or\nproduct complaints regarding LUPKYNIS;\n• not effectively sell or support LUPKYNIS or communicate publicly concerning LUPKYNIS in a manner that is contrary to FDA rules and regulations;\n• reduce their efforts or discontinue to sell or support or otherwise not effectively sell or support LUPKYNIS;\n• not devote the resources necessary to sell LUPKYNIS in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect;\n• be unable to satisfy financial obligations to us or others; or\n• cease operations.\nAny such events may result in decreased product sales and lower product revenue, which would harm our results of operations and business.\nWe are also required to comply with good distribution practices such as maintenance of storage and shipping conditions, as well as security of products, in order to ensure\nproduct quality determined by GMP is maintained throughout the distribution network. While we are obligated to audit the performance of our third-party contractors, we do not\nhave complete control over their compliance. We could be harmed if our third-party distributors do not comply with these standards and regulations.\n36\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nOur relationships with customers, healthcare providers, and third-party payors are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and\nregulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, exclusion from government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm and\ndiminished profits on future earnings.\nWe are subject to additional healthcare statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we\nconduct our business. Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of LUPKYNIS. Our future\narrangements with third-party payors and customers will expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the\nbusiness or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell, and distribute LUPKYNIS. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws\nand regulations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n• the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing\nremuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or\nrecommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or\nentity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n• the FCA imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting,\nor causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an\nobligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the\nU.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. We can be held liable under the FCA even when we do not submit\nclaims directly to government payors if we are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims;\n• the U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any\nhealthcare benefit program regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private), or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making\nany materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a\nperson or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n• the U.S. federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the “Sunshine Act” under the ACA require manufacturers of drugs, devices,\nbiologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report to the Department of Health and\nHuman Services information related to covered health care provider payments and other transfers of value and the ownership and investment interests of such healthcare\nproviders (as defined by the statute) and their immediate family members;\n• HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH) and its implementing regulations, which also\nimposes obligations on certain covered entity healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform certain\nservices involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy,\nsecurity and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and\ncriminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal\ncourts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;\n• the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false\nstatement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services (similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity\ndoes not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation);\n• consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;\n• the U.S. federal Civil Monetary Penalties law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person\nknows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or\nsupplier; and\n• analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving\nhealthcare items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers; and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to\ncomply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the\n37\nfederal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing\nexpenditures, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways\nand often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIn the United States, to help patients who have no or inadequate insurance access to LUPKYNIS, we have a patient support program that we administer in conjunction with our\npatient support program vendor. If we or our vendors are deemed to fail to comply with relevant laws, regulations, or evolving government guidance in the operation of these\nprograms, we could be subject to damages, fines, penalties or other criminal, civil or administrative sanctions or enforcement actions. We cannot ensure that our compliance\ncontrols, policies, and procedures will be sufficient to protect against acts of our employees, business partners, or vendors that may violate the laws or regulations of the\njurisdictions in which we operate.\nRegardless of whether we have complied with the law, a government investigation could impact our business practices, harm our reputation, divert the attention of management,\nincrease our expenses, and reduce the availability of assistance to our patients. Ensuring that our future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable\nhealthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or\nfuture statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations.\nIf our operations, including anticipated activities to be conducted by our sales team, were to be found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental\nregulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare\nprograms, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to\ndo business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government\nfunded healthcare programs.\nEnhanced governmental and private scrutiny over, or investigations or litigation involving, pharmaceutical manufacturer donations to patient assistance programs offered\nby charitable foundations may require us to modify our patient support programs and could negatively impact our business practices, harm our reputation, divert the\nattention of management and increase our expenses.\nTo help patients afford LUPKYNIS, we have implemented a patient support program. These types of programs, designed to assist patients in affording pharmaceuticals, have\nbecome the subject of scrutiny. In recent years, some pharmaceutical manufacturers were named in class action lawsuits challenging the legality of their patient support\nprograms and their support of independent charitable patient support foundations in connection with such programs under a variety of federal and state laws. Our patient support\nprogram could become the target of similar litigation. In addition, certain state and federal enforcement authorities and members of Congress have initiated inquiries about co-\npay assistance programs. Some state legislatures have also been considering proposals that would restrict or ban co-pay coupons. In addition, there has been regulatory review\nand enhanced government scrutiny of donations by pharmaceutical manufacturers to patient assistance programs operated by charitable foundations. For example, the Office of\nInspector General of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (OIG) has established specific guidelines permitting pharmaceutical manufacturers to make donations to\ncharitable organizations which provide co-pay assistance to Medicare patients, provided that such organizations are bona fide charities, are entirely independent of and not in\nany way controlled or influenced by the manufacturer, provide aid to applicants on a first-come basis according to consistent financial criteria, and do not link aid to use of a\ndonor’s product. If we establish a program to donate to independent charitable patient support foundations and our vendors or donation recipients are deemed to fail to comply\nwith laws or regulations in the operation of these programs, we could be subject to damages, fines, penalties or other criminal, civil or administrative sanctions or enforcement\nactions. Further, numerous organizations, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, have received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and other enforcement\nauthorities seeking information related to their patient assistance programs and support, and certain of these organizations have entered into, or have otherwise agreed to,\nsignificant civil settlements with applicable enforcement authorities. In connection with these civil settlements, the U.S. government has and may in the future require the\naffected companies to enter into complex corporate integrity agreements that impose significant reporting and other requirements on those companies. We cannot ensure that\nour compliance controls, policies and procedures will be sufficient to protect against acts of our employees, business partners or vendors that may potentially violate the laws or\nregulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Regardless of\n38\nwhether we have complied with the law, a government investigation could negatively impact our business practices, harm our reputation, divert the attention of management\nand increase our expenses.\nThe failure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar laws associated\nwith our activities outside of the United States, could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the FCPA regulations of the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws around the world\nwhere we conduct activities, including, if approved in such countries, the sale of LUPKYNIS. We face significant risks and liability if we fail to comply with the FCPA and\nother anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws that prohibit companies and their employees and third-party business partners, such as distributors or resellers, from authorizing,\noffering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to foreign government officials, political parties or candidates, employees of public international\norganizations including healthcare professionals, or private-sector recipients for the corrupt purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to any person, or\nsecuring any advantage.\nWe rely on various third parties for certain services outside the United States, including continued development of LUPKYNIS and the commercialization of LUPKYNIS. We\nmay be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third parties and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we\ndo not explicitly authorize such activities. Any violation of the FCPA, other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws could result in\nwhistleblower, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions and, in the case of the FCPA, suspension or debarment from\nU.S. government contracts, which could harm our reputation, business, operating results and prospects. In addition, responding to any enforcement action or related\ninvestigation may result in a diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nCompliance with governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection and information security could result in additional costs and\nliabilities to us or inhibit our ability to collect and process data, and the failure to comply with such requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\nPrivacy and data security have become significant issues in the United States, Europe, and in many other jurisdictions where we or our licensing partners may in the future\nconduct our operations. As we receive, collect, process, use and store personal and confidential data, we are subject to diverse laws and regulations relating to data privacy and\nsecurity. Compliance with these privacy laws, data breach notification laws, and data security requirements is rigorous and time-intensive and may increase our cost of doing\nbusiness, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation and reputational harm, which could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the regulatory framework for the receipt, collection, processing, use, safeguarding, sharing and transfer of personal and confidential data is rapidly evolving and is\nlikely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future as new global privacy rules are being enacted and existing ones are being updated and strengthened.\nRisks Related to Human Capital, Information Technology and Managing Growth\nOur employees, principal investigators, CROs and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards\nand requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, principal investigators, CROs and consultants may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these\nparties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violate the regulations of the FDA and other regulatory\nauthorities, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such authorities; healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the\nUnited States and abroad; or laws that require the reporting of financial information or data accurately.\nIn particular, sales, marketing, and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct,\nkickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales\ncommissions, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course\nof clinical trials or creating fraudulent data in our pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause harm to our reputation. We have\nadopted a code of conduct applicable to all of\n39\nour employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity\nmay not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a\nfailure to comply with these laws or regulations.\nIn addition, we are subject to the risk that a person could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are\nnot successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and\nadministrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages,\nreputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could harm our ability to operate our business and our results of\noperations.\nWe are dependent upon key personnel to achieve our business objectives.\nOur ability to retain key personnel and attract other qualified individuals is critical to our success. As a technology-driven company, intellectual input from key management and\npersonnel is critical to achieve our business objectives. The loss of the services of key individuals might significantly delay or prevent achievement of our business objectives. In\naddition, because of a relative scarcity of individuals with experience and the high degree of education and scientific achievement required for our business, competition among\nlife sciences companies for qualified employees is intense and the recent move by companies to offer a remote or hybrid work environment may increase the competition for\nsuch employees from employers outside of our traditional office locations, as a result, we may not be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms, or at all. In\naddition, because we do not maintain “key person” life insurance on any of our officers, employees, or consultants, any delay in replacing such persons, or an inability to\nreplace them with persons of similar expertise, could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also have relationships with scientific collaborators at academic and other institutions, some of whom conduct research at our request or assist us in formulating our\nresearch and development strategies. These scientific collaborators are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities\nthat may limit their availability to us. In addition, even though our collaborators are required to sign confidentiality agreements prior to working with us, they may have\narrangements with other companies to assist such other companies in developing technologies that may prove competitive to us.\nAdditionally, the workforce reduction we will implement as part of the restructuring program may negatively impact our ability to attract, integrate, retain and motivate highly\nqualified employees, and may harm our reputation with current or prospective employees.\nIncentive provisions for our key executives include the granting of equity awards that vest over time, designed to encourage such individuals to stay with us. However, a low\nshare price, whether as a result of lower than expected revenues from LUPKYNIS, disappointing progress in our development programs or as a result of market conditions\ngenerally, or other factors, could render such agreements of little value to our key executives. In such event, our key executives could be susceptible to being hired away by our\ncompetitors who could offer a better compensation package. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business, financial conditions and results of operations may\nbe harmed.\nWe may not successfully manage our growth. Our success will depend upon the timely expansion of our operations and our ability to successfully manage our growth.\nOur future growth, if any, may place a significant strain on our management and on our administrative, operational, and financial resources. Our ability to manage our growth\neffectively and in a timely fashion will require us to implement and improve our operational, financial and management systems and to expand, train, manage and motivate our\nemployees. These demands may require the hiring of additional management personnel and the development of additional expertise by management. Any increase in resources\ndevoted to research, commercialization, and product development without a corresponding increase in our operational, financial and management systems could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties. Future growth will\nimpose significant added responsibilities on members of management. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize LUPKYNIS and to compete\neffectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development and commercialization efforts\nand clinical trials effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative and,\n40\nif necessary, sales and marketing personnel. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully\ngrowing our Company.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm us.\nWe believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyberattacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. These threats can\ncome from a variety of sources, ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted\nagainst our information systems. Over the past few years, cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against.\nSeveral key areas of our business depend on the use of information technologies, including production, manufacturing, marketing, and logistics, as well as clinical and\nregulatory matters. Despite our efforts to prevent such behavior, third parties may nonetheless attempt to hack into our systems and obtain data relating to our pre-clinical\nstudies, clinical trials, patients using LUPKYNIS or our proprietary information on LUPKYNIS or other information relating to us or our business. If we fail to maintain or\nprotect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could have problems in determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have\ndifficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with physicians, and other health care professionals, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have\nincreases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach, or suffer other adverse consequences and reputational damages. While we\nhave invested in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts or those of our third-party collaborators, if any, or manufacturers,\nto implement adequate security and quality measures for data processing would be sufficient to protect against data deterioration or loss in the event of a system malfunction, or\nto prevent data from being stolen or corrupted in the event of a security breach. Any such loss or breach could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. We\nmaintain cyber insurance coverage; however, there is no guarantee that our current coverage will be sufficient or that we can secure insurance coverage in the future at\ncommercially viable rates or with the appropriate limits.\nInterruptions in the availability of server systems or communications with Internet or cloud-based services, or failure to maintain the security, confidentiality, accessibility,\nor integrity of data stored on such systems, could harm our business.\nWe rely upon a variety of Internet service providers, third-party hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers to support our business. Many of our employees\ncurrently work remotely and therefore we are highly reliant on these services for our operations. Failure to maintain the security, confidentiality, accessibility or integrity of data\nstored on such systems could damage our reputation in the market, cause us to lose revenue or market share, increase our service costs, cause us to incur substantial costs,\nsubject us to liability for damages and/or fines and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and prospects. Any damage to, or failure of, such systems, or communications to and between such systems, could result in interruptions in our operations.\nIf our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers, or third-party service partners, are breached, and\nunauthorized access is obtained to our data or our information technology systems, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. We do not have control\nover the operations of the facilities of our cloud service providers and our third party providers may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, the effect of\nclimate change (such as drought, flooding, wildfires, increased storm severity, and sea level rise), cybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages and similar events or\nacts of misconduct. In addition, any changes in our cloud service providers service levels may harm our ability to meet our requirements and operate our business.\nOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\nLitigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing\nor selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies. We may be subject to allegations through press, social media, the courts or other\nmediums that may or may not be founded. We may be required to respond to or defend against these claims and/or allegations, which will divert resources away from our\nprincipal business. There can be no assurance that our defense of such claims and/or allegations would be successful, and we may be required to make material settlements. An\nunfavorable outcome or settlement may harm our business, LUPKYNIS, results of operations, financial condition, and corporate reputation. In addition, regardless of outcome,\n41\ninvestigations, allegations of wrongdoing, and litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our business and operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nUnstable markets and economic conditions may have harmful consequences to business, financial condition, and trading price of our common shares.\nGlobal economic conditions have been impacted by high inflation, supply chain challenges and the impacts of global hostilities, such as the Russia-Ukraine war. Changes in\ninterest rates, inflation, economic growth, levels of taxation, legal and regulatory matters, foreign exchange and commodity prices may influence product purchases decisions.\nOur results of operations could be harmed by general conditions in the global economy and financial markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a\nvariety of risks to our business, including, weakened demand for our approved product and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWeak global economic conditions could decrease the number of clinical trials sites available to us and hinder our ability to conduct trials required by the FDA. A weak or\ndeclining economy could also strain our supplies, partners or third-parties, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making payments for our\nservices. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could\nadversely impact our business.\nActual or anticipated changes to the laws and regulations governing the health care system may have a negative impact on cost and access to health insurance coverage and\nreimbursement of healthcare items and services.\nThe United States and several foreign jurisdictions are considering, or have already enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in\nways that could affect our ability to sell LUPKYNIS profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting\nchanges in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access to healthcare. In the U.S, the pharmaceutical\nindustry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including the ACA and IRA.\nWhile it is difficult to assess the impact of the ACA in isolation, either in general or on our business specifically, it is widely thought that the ACA increases downward pressure\non pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of, and the price we may charge for, LUPKYNIS. Further, the U.S. and foreign\ngovernments regularly consider reform measures that affect healthcare coverage and costs. Such reforms may include changes to the coverage and reimbursement of healthcare\nservices and products. In particular, there have been recent judicial and Congressional challenges to the ACA, which could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for\nhealthcare services covered by plans authorized by the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Since its enactment,\nthere have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. As a result, there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or\nreplace, certain aspects of the ACA. Most recently, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, which, among other things, removes the penalties for not complying with the\nACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. On January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15,\n2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental\nagencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and\nwaiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.\nThe ACA has also been the subject of numerous court challenges on the basis of, among other things, constitutionality. While the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in\nsummer 2021 that the ACA was constitutional in respect to one such challenge, this does not mean that there will not be future challenges launched, which may or may not be\nsuccessful. It is unclear how these decisions, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. We\ncannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, the U.S. Budget Control Act of 2011\nresulted in aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative\namendments, will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other\nthings, also reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to\nproviders from three to five years. Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed\nproducts, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to\n42\nproduct pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.\nFor example, the Biden administration has indicated that lowering prescription drug prices is a priority, but we do not yet know what steps the administration will take, whether\nor to what degree they may impact us or LUPKYNIS, or whether such steps will be successful. We cannot predict all of the ways in which future federal or state legislative or\nadministrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nIndividual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product\npricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in\nsome cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly\nusing bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs.\nWe anticipate that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare\nfunding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for LUPKYNIS, and could harm our\nbusiness. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation\nof cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize LUPKYNIS.\nWe may face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing, or commercializing products more successfully than we do.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we have numerous potential domestic and foreign competitors, including major pharmaceutical and chemical\ncompanies, universities, academic institutions, government agencies, public and private research organizations and large, fully-integrated pharmaceutical companies which have\nextensive resources and experience in research and development, process development, clinical evaluation, manufacturing, regulatory affairs, commercialization, distribution\nand marketing. In particular, over the course of the past few years we are aware that a number of companies have announced that they are commencing clinical trials for\ndifferent treatment options for LN. Many of our potential competitors possess substantially greater research and development skills, financial, technical and marketing expertise\nand human resources than we do, and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market products. There is a risk that new products and technologies may be\ndeveloped which may be more effective or commercially viable than the product being developed or marketed by us, thus making LUPKYNIS non-competitive or obsolete.\nThere may also be market resistance to the acceptance of our new product in any indication and a risk that LUPKYNIS, even though clinically effective, is not economically\nviable.\nWhile we have new chemical entity exclusivity to January 2026, and potential patent protection out to 2037, generic entrants could file abbreviated new drug applications as\nearly as January 2025. These applications may or may not be approved by the FDA. If an ANDA is filed, it may have a negative impact on our perceived value. If even one\nANDA is approved in a manner that does not violate any then-existing patents we hold, we may be subject to competition at significantly lower prices than we currently sell\nLUPKYNIS, which could have a materially negative impact on our business.\nUse of hazardous materials might expose us to risk in the form of damages.\nDrug manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials. We and our third-party manufacturing contractors are subject to regulations governing the use,\nmanufacture, storage, handling and disposal of such materials and certain waste products. Although we believe that our third-party manufacturers have the required safety\nprocedures for handling and disposing of such materials and comply with the standards prescribed by such laws and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury\nfrom these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and such liability could exceed our\nresources.\nHealth and safety risks associated with producing a product for human ingestion cannot be eliminated and might expose us to substantial risk.\nWhile we take substantial precautions such as laboratory and clinical testing, toxicology studies, quality control and assurance testing and controlled production methods, the\nhealth and safety risks associated with producing a product for human ingestion cannot be eliminated. LUPKYNIS may be found to be, or to contain substances that are harmful\nto the health of our patients and customers and which, in extreme cases, may cause serious health conditions or death. This sort of finding may expose us to substantial risk of\nlitigation and liability. Further, we would be forced to discontinue production of LUPKYNIS, which would\n43\nharm our profitability. We maintain product liability insurance coverage; however, there is no guarantee that our current coverage will be sufficient or that we can secure\ninsurance coverage in the future at commercially viable rates or with the appropriate limits.\nRisks Related to Our Common Shares\nThere is no assurance of a sufficient liquid trading market for our common shares in the future.\nOur shareholders may be unable to sell significant quantities of common shares into the public trading markets without a significant reduction in the price of their common\nshares, or at all. There can be no assurance that there will be sufficient liquidity of our common shares on the trading market, and that we will continue to be listed on Nasdaq or\nachieve listing on any other public listing exchange.\nThe price of our common shares could be subject to volatility related or unrelated to our operations.\nThe market prices for the securities of biotechnology companies, including ours, have historically been volatile. The market has from time to time experienced significant price\nand volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of any particular company.\nThe trading price of the common shares could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control,\nincluding the results and adequacy of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, as well as those of our collaborators, or our competitors; the results of our operations, such as\nquarterly or annual sales figures; other evidence of the safety or effectiveness of LUPKYNIS or those of our competitors; announcements of technological innovations or new\nproducts by our competitors; governmental regulatory actions; developments with collaborators; developments (including litigation) concerning our patents or other proprietary\nrights of competitors; period-to-period fluctuations in operating results; guidance we may provide as to the commercial performance of LUPKYNIS; changes in estimates of our\nperformance by securities analysts; market conditions for biotechnology stocks in general; our ability to repurchase our common shares under any share repurchase program on\nfavorable terms or at all; global or local political, economic, social and health crises; market rumors; and other factors not within our control could impact the market price of\nthe common shares, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action\nlitigation has often been instituted. A class action suit against us could result in substantial costs, potential liabilities and the diversion of management’s attention and resources.\nIn recent years, shareholder activists have become involved in numerous public companies. Responding to actions by shareholders activists, such as requests for special\nmeetings, potential nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors, requests to pursue a strategic combination or other transaction, or other special requests may\ndisrupt our business and divert the attention of management and employees. In addition, any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such a situation\ncould result in the loss of potential business opportunities, be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers and make it more difficult to\nattract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could negatively impact our business. Shareholder activism could result in substantial costs and may\ncause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying\nfundamentals of our business. Our common shares may be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand of our common shares.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to repurchase Common Shares or that we will repurchase Common Shares at favorable prices.\nOur Board has the authority to authorized share repurchase programs. On February 15, 2024, we announced that we would commence our first share repurchase program. The\namount and timing of common share repurchases are subject to capital availability and our determination that share repurchases are in the best interests of the Company and are\nin compliance with all respective laws and any applicable contractual obligations. Our ability to repurchase common shares will depend on, among other factors, our cash\nbalances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions our results of operations, our financial condition and other factors beyond our control that we may\ndeem relevant. Additionally, the recently enacted IRA includes an excise tax on share repurchases, which will increase the cost of share repurchases. A reduction in repurchases\nunder, or the completion of, our share repurchase programs could have a negative effect on the market price of our common shares. We can provide no assurance that we will\nrepurchase common shares at favorable prices, if at all. Aurinia has submitted an exemptive relief application to applicable Canadian securities regulators related to the\nrepurchase, which, if not granted may limit the number of shares that the Company is able to repurchase significantly from what it is able to repurchase in reliance on applicable\nU.S. law. If the exemption is not granted, Aurinia would not be able to repurchase in excess of 5% of its issued and\n44\noutstanding common shares (being 7,230,888 Common Shares) without complying with an alternative process in Canada that may be more costly, time consuming or not\navailable.\nYou may be unable to enforce actions against us, or certain of our directors and officers under U.S. federal securities laws.\nAs a corporation organized under the provincial laws of Alberta, Canada, it may be difficult to bring actions under U.S. federal securities law against us. Some of our directors\nand officers reside principally in Canada or outside of the United States. Because all or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these persons are located outside of\nthe United States, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or those persons. Furthermore, it may not be possible for\ninvestors to enforce against us, or those persons not in the United States, judgments obtained in U.S. courts based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities\nlaws or other laws of the United States. There is doubt as to the enforceability, in original actions in Canadian courts, of liabilities based upon U.S. federal securities laws and as\nto the enforceability in Canadian courts of judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. Therefore, it\nmay not be possible to enforce those actions against us or certain of our directors and officers.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish, or cease publishing, research reports about us, our business, or our market, or if they change their recommendations\nregarding our common shares adversely, the trading price and trading volume of our common shares could decline.\nThe trading market for our common shares is and will be influenced by whether industry or securities analysts publish research and reports about us, our business, our market or\nour competitors and, if any analysts do publish such reports, what they publish in those reports. We may not obtain analyst coverage in the future. Any analysts who do cover\nus may make adverse recommendations regarding our common shares, adversely change their recommendations from time to time, and/or provide more favorable relative\nrecommendations about our competitors. If any analyst who may cover us in the future were to cease coverage of our Company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, or if\nanalysts fail to cover us or publish reports about us at all, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the trading price of our common shares or\ntrading volume to decline.\nSecurities litigation or other litigation could result in substantial damages and may divert management’s time and attention from our business.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for\nus because pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant share price volatility in recent years. We are and may become in the future the target of securities litigation.\nThe outcome of litigation is necessarily uncertain, and we could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of such suits, and we may not prevail. Monitoring and\ndefending against legal actions is time-consuming for our management and detracts from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities. In addition,\nwe may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with any such litigation. We have not established any reserves for any potential liability relating to any such\npotential lawsuits. It is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. We currently maintain insurance\ncoverage for some of these potential liabilities. Other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not\nbe enough to cover damages awarded. In addition, certain types of damages may not be covered by insurance, and insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may\nbecome unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. A decision adverse to our interests on one or more legal matters or litigation could result in the payment of\nsubstantial damages, or possibly fines, and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations. We may also be\nsubject to other potential tax consequences.\nUnder the provisions of the applicable tax legislation, our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by applicable tax\nregulatory authorities. In addition, proposed or actual changes to applicable tax legislation may significantly impact our ability to utilize our net operating losses and tax credit\ncarryforwards to offset taxable income in the future. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities.\nThe amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of a company immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further\naffect the limitation in future years. We may not be able to use some or all of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, even if we attain profitability. Additionally,\nshould an event occur that causes or is deemed to cause a change in the residency of Aurinia from Canada to the United States, for example, we\n45\nmay be subject to certain tax rules that could cause a deemed disposition of our assets for tax purposes. Should that occur, we may be subject to a material amount of tax owing,\nwithout corresponding revenue from any actual disposition of our assets. Our common shares could fall or may not increase.\nGeneral Business Risks\nIf the estimates we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our consolidated financial statements are incorrect, our actual results may vary from those\nreflected in our projections and accruals.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statement requires us to make\nestimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We\ncannot promise that our estimates or their underlying assumptions will be correct. Actual results may differ materially from those estimated amounts used in the preparation of\nour consolidated financial statements if these results differ from our historical experience, or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate, even if such\nassumptions are reasonable when made.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our\noperating results, our ability to operate our business and investors’ views of us.\nWe are subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC, including those rules and regulations mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as the rules and regulations imposed\nby Canadian securities regulatory authorities. Securities legislation requires public companies to include in their annual report a statement of management’s responsibilities for\nestablishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, together with an assessment of the effectiveness of those internal controls. Section 404 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act also requires the independent auditors of certain public companies to attest to, and report on, this management assessment. Ensuring that we have adequate\ninternal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort\nthat will need to be evaluated frequently. Our failure to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls in accordance with the requirements of applicable securities legislation\ncould have harm on our business. We could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on the price\nof our common shares. In addition, if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing\nbodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nAn investment in our common shares may result in the loss of an investor’s entire investment.\nAn investment in our common shares is speculative and may result in the loss of an investor’s entire investment. Only potential investors who are experienced in high risk\ninvestments and who can afford to lose their entire investment should consider an investment in our common shares.\nFuture issuances of debt and equity securities by us may cause the price of the common shares to fall.\nThe market price of the common shares could decline because of issuances by us of additional common shares (whether for financing or acquisition purposes or otherwise), or\nthe perception that these sales could occur. Investors will suffer dilution of their voting power and may experience dilution in earnings per share if we issue additional common\nshares.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on the common shares. While we historically have not paid cash dividends (in any currency) and do not have a current intention\nto pay cash dividends, we continually review our capital allocation strategies, including, among other things, payment of cash dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. As\na result, the return on an investment in common shares will likely depend upon any future appreciation in value, if any, and on a shareholder’s ability to sell common shares. The\npayment of future dividends, if any, will be reviewed periodically by our board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, conditions then existing including\nearnings, financial conditions, cash on hand, financial requirements to fund our commercial activities, development and growth, and other factors that our board of directors\nmay consider appropriate in the circumstances.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of our cash and cash equivalents and may not use them effectively.\n46\nOur management has broad discretion to use our cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations and could spend these funds in ways that do not improve our results of\noperations or enhance the value of our common shares. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, cause the trading price of our common shares to decline and adversely impact the commercialization of our product. Pending their use to fund\nour operations, we may invest our cash and cash equivalents in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to\ncompliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC,\nCanadian securities regulators, and the Nasdaq have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and\nfinancial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these\nrules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nApplicable securities legislation requires us, on an annual basis, to review and evaluate our internal controls. To maintain compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002, for example, we are required to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which has been both costly and challenging. We will need to\ncontinue to dedicate internal resources, continue to engage outside consultants and follow a detailed work plan to continue to assess and document the adequacy of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, continue to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a\ncontinuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. There is a risk that in the future neither we nor our independent registered public\naccounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. If we identify\none or more material weaknesses, it could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nOur business, results of operations, and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected by widespread health concerns, such as pandemics.\nWidespread health concerns, in particular in the United States but also globally, can have evolving and uncertain impacts on our business. As a result of any widespread health\nconcern, such as a pandemic, we have and may continue to experience disruptions that severely impact our business, commercialization and clinical trials, including:\na. delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials;\nb. delays or difficulties in building out and maintaining commercial infrastructure;\nc. delays in recruiting for key positions;\nd. delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\ne. interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site data monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal, provincial or state\ngovernments, employers, and others or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures, which may impact the integrity of subject data and clinical study\nendpoints;\nf. interruption or delays in the operations of applicable regulatory authorities, which could impact the ability to obtain applicable regulatory approvals, and could impact on\nability to commercialize internationally or receive milestone payments from licensees;\ng. interruption or delays in receiving supplies of our drugs or manufacturing products from our contract manufacturing organizations due to staffing shortages, production\nslowdowns or stoppages, and disruptions in delivery systems;\nh. limitations on employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our commercial and promotional activities and clinical trials, including because of\nsickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people;\ni. limited ability to access accounts and healthcare professionals, in person or at all, to provide medical information to promote our drug;\nj. staffing shortages at healthcare professionals' offices that may limit the ability to administratively process prescriptions; and\nk. reductions in patient visits to physicians and new patients might have limited access to prescribers.\nGovernment and health authority intervention in the face of a widespread health concern may vary greatly in the various geographic regions in which we operate. The extent to\nwhich a widespread health concern may impact our business,\n47\ncommercialization, and clinical trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic\nspread, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of vaccinations and actions taken in Canada, the United States and other countries to contain and treat the\ndisease. To the extent there is an impact from a widespread health concern on our business, it has not had, and we anticipate that it would continue to not have, a steady impact\nbut instead an uneven impact on various aspects of our business and operations as the variants of the virus infect different parts of the geographic regions in which we operate at\ndifferent times and to different degrees. While we are not able to compare our operational results to prior years to verify, as our sole commercial product was only approved\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has harmed our business and operations, in particular in relation to our ability to connect with, and\npromote LUPKYNIS to, health care professionals, which as a result has limited prescribing opportunities for LUPKYNIS.\nTo the extent a widespread health concern harms our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Annual\nReport.\nSales of our common shares by our employees, including our executive officers, could cause the trading price of our common shares to fall or prevent it from increasing for\nnumerous reasons, and sales by such persons could be viewed negatively by other investors.\nIn accordance with the guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, as amended, equivalent legislation in applicable jurisdictions, and our policies\nregarding equity transactions, a number of our employees, including executive officers, may adopt share trading plans pursuant to which they have arranged to sell common\nshares from time to time in the future. Generally, sales of common shares, including sales under such plans, by our executive officers and directors require public filings. Sales\nof our common shares by such persons could cause the price of our common shares to fall or prevent it from increasing. If sales by employees, executive officers, or directors\ncause a substantial number of our common shares to become available for purchase in the public market, the price of our common shares could fall or may not increase. Also,\nsales by such personnel could be viewed negatively by holders and potential purchasers of our common shares.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe maintain a cybersecurity risk management program and related policies and processes to identify, assess and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats.\nOur Information Security Policy is designed to align with certain best practices, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This policy promotes the\nmanagement and execution of our information security framework for preserving the confidentiality, integrity, availability and privacy of our information assets, including by\nhelping enable us to better oversee, monitor and identify certain risks related to the processing of information by authorized third-party service providers. We also have an\nInformation Technology (IT) Steering Committee to help ensure security and compliance across our IT services. We have in the past, and may in the future, engage third parties\nto assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity prevention and response systems and processes.\nDuring 2023, we refreshed our business continuity program to assess the resilience of our processes and systems against potential threats, including cyber-attacks. Our refreshed\ncrisis management and business continuity program establishes crisis management instructions with a detailed plan for each business department outlining critical processes,\ninternal and external dependencies and recovery strategies. In addition, routine information security training and updates are regularly rolled out to our employees, and we track\ncertain metrics that we believe help ensure we have a strong security posture.\nTo date, cybersecurity threats, including those resulting from any previous cybersecurity incidents, have not materially affected our Company, including our business strategy,\nresults of operations or financial condition. We do not believe that cybersecurity threats resulting from any previous cybersecurity incidents of which we are aware are\nreasonably likely to materially affect our Company.\n48\nGovernance\nOne of the key functions of our Board is informed oversight of our risk management process. Our Board does not have a standing risk management committee, but rather\nadministers this oversight function directly through the Board, as well as through various standing committees of our Board that address risks inherent in their respective areas\nof oversight. The Board as a whole regularly (and no less than annually) reviews management's annual enterprise risk assessment, business continuity process and cybersecurity\nposture. Our Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks associated with our financial reporting, accounting and auditing matters, as well as\nbusiness related risks (such as leadership, continuity, cybersecurity and matters relating to our commercial activities), reviewing as required our processes around the\nmanagement and monitoring of such risks, as well as conducting a risk assessment review. Our Audit Committee charter sets forth the responsibilities of the Audit Committee\nconsistent with the rules and regulations of the applicable SEC and the Nasdaq rules, including reviewing the Company's approach to risk mitigation with respect to IT and\ncybersecurity. An information security update is provided quarterly, or as needed, to the Audit Committee, with a detailed review provided at least annually, or as needed.\nIn addition, our Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for leading the assessment and management of cybersecurity risks. Our CIO has over 20 years of experience in\ninformation security and holds an MBA from The George B. Delaplaine School of Business and Economics. Our CIO regularly receives reports from our Head of IT Operations\non cybersecurity threats and incidents, as applicable.\n49\nItem 2.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and\nthe notes thereto included in this Annual Report. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that\nreflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual\nReport. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should carefully read “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements” and “Risk Factors.”\nThe following generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussion of historical items and year-to-year comparisons\nbetween 2022 and 2021 that are not included in this discussion can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2023 and such comparisons are incorporated herein by\nreference.\nOverview\nAurinia is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering therapies to people living with autoimmune diseases with high unmet medical needs. In January\n2021, we introduced LUPKYNIS (voclosporin), the first FDA-approved oral therapy for the treatment of adult patients with active LN. We continue to conduct clinical and\nregulatory activities to support the LUPKYNIS development program. We contracted with Otsuka as a collaboration partner for development and commercialization of\nLUPKYNIS in the Otsuka Territories.\nEffective February 14, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors elected to conclude its strategic review process and determined that it was in the best interest of the Company\nand its shareholders to undergo a restructuring. In principal, the corporate restructuring will involve the Company reaffirming its commitment to enhancing value and driving\nLUPKYNIS growth, while maintaining a sharp focus on operating efficiencies and maximizing cash flows. As a result, the Company is ceasing future development efforts on\nAUR200 and its pre-clinical asset AUR300.\nLUPKYNIS is an orally administered CNI immunosuppressant that has been demonstrated to improve near and long-term outcomes in LN when used in combination with\nMMF (although MMF is not currently approved as such) and steroids. By inhibiting calcineurin, LUPKYNIS reduces cytokine activation and blocks interleukin IL-2 expression\nand T-cell mediated immune responses. LUPKYNIS also potentially stabilizes podocytes, which can protect against proteinuria.\n52\nVoclosporin, the active ingredient in LUPKYNIS, is made by a modification of a single amino acid of the cyclosporine molecule. The mechanism of action of LUPKYNIS has\nbeen validated with certain earlier generation CNIs for the prevention of rejection in patients undergoing solid organ transplants and in several autoimmune indications,\nincluding uveitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and for LN in Japan. We believe that LUPKYNIS possesses pharmacologic properties with the\npotential to demonstrate best-in-class differentiation.\nOn September 15, 2022, the EC granted marketing authorization of LUPKYNIS. The centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU member states as well as in Iceland,\nLiechtenstein, Norway and Northern Ireland. The approval triggered a $30.0 million milestone payment to us, which was recognized as collaboration revenue for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. On November 29, 2022 the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had granted marketing authorization of LUPKYNIS in Great\nBritain. On April 24, 2023, LUPKYNIS received regulatory approval in Switzerland. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company received notification that the pricing and\nreimbursement milestone was secured. As a result, this triggered a $10.0 million milestone which was recognized as collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31,\n2023. On November 13, 2023, Otsuka filed a new drug application (NDA) for voclosporin for the treatment of lupus nephritis (LN) with the Japanese Ministry of Health,\nLabour, and Welfare for the manufacture and sale in Japan of voclosporin.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. In\naccordance with U.S. GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances at the\ntime such estimates are made. Actual results may differ materially from our estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions. We periodically review our\nestimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, are reflected in our financial statements prospectively\nfrom the date of the change in estimate.\nWe define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the United States that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments\nabout matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply\nthose principles. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe\nthe following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments.\nProduct Revenues\nIn the United States (and territories), we sell LUPKYNIS primarily to specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors. These customers subsequently dispense LUPKYNIS to\nhealth care providers and patients. Revenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon\ndelivery to the customer.\nReserves for discounts and allowances: Product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves\nare established. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the\namount is payable to our customer) or a liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer).\nOur estimates established for variable consideration are calculated based upon utilizing the expected value method. The transaction price, which includes variable consideration\nreflecting the impact of discounts and allowances, may be subject to constraint and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant\nreversal of the amount of the cumulative revenues recognized will not occur in a future period. Amounts related to such items are estimated at contract inception and updated at\nthe end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available.\nSignificant judgment is required in estimating variable consideration. In making these estimates, we consider historical data, including patient mix and inventory sold to our\ncustomers that has not yet been dispensed. We use a data aggregator and historical claims to estimate variable consideration for inventory sold to our customers, including\nspecialty pharmacies and specialty distributors, that has not yet been dispensed. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates. If actual results vary, we adjust these\nestimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment. As of December 31, 2023, we did not have any material adjustments to variable consideration\nestimates based on actual results.\n53\nLicense, Collaboration and Royalty Revenues\nWe enter into out-licensing agreements in which we license certain rights to LUPKYNIS to third parties. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment to us of one\nor more of the following: non-refundable, up-front license fees, development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, payments for collaboration services we provide\nthrough our contract manufacturers, payments for manufacturing services and royalties on net sales of licensed products. Each of these payments results in license, collaboration\nand royalty revenues. Our main collaboration partnership is with Otsuka. In 2023 and 2022, we recognized $16.0 million and $30.6 million, respectively, in license,\ncollaboration and royalty revenue from Otsuka.\nManufacturing Services Revenue: Our agreements may include manufacturing services to be performed by us on behalf of the counterparty. If these services are determined to\nbe distinct from the other promises or performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize the transaction price allocated to these services as revenue either over\ntime based on an appropriate measure of progress when the performance by us does not create an asset with an alternative use and we have an enforceable right to payment for\nthe performance completed to date or at a point in time as the related performance obligations are satisfied. Certain agreements may include terms where we can partially bill\nfor manufacturing services before the serves are provided, resulting in a deferred revenue which is to be recognized once the performance obligation is satisfied.\nDeferred Compensation Arrangements\nWe have recorded deferred compensation arrangements in liabilities for estimated future employee benefits relating to applicable historical employment arrangements. In 2012,\ndeferred compensation arrangements were approved by a resolution of the board of directors. Pursuant to ASC Topic 710 – Compensation, we recognize future benefits\nprovided by employee retention arrangements, as deferred compensation, which is recognized when we determine that it is probable to make future payments. The deferred\ncompensation is based on an income approach for the estimated future net revenues of voclosporin using an internal risk-adjusted net present value of the future payments to be\nmade to the individuals.\nInitially, these obligations are measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting\nperiods. Subsequent re-measurements as a result of performance obligations we meet or changes in assumptions are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations.\nThere have been no material historical adjustments to amounts recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in prior periods.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information of recent accounting pronouncements and their impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures, see Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\" to our consolidated financial statements included in \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in this Annual Report.\n54\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 Change\nRevenue:\nProduct revenue, net $ 158,533 $ 103,468 $ 55,065\nLicense, collaboration and royalty revenue 16,980 30,562 (13,582)\nTotal revenue, net 175,513 134,030 41,483\nOperating expenses\nCost of sales 14,148 5,664 8,484\nSelling, general and administrative 195,036 196,371 (1,335)\nResearch and development 49,641 44,988 4,653\nOther expense (income), net 8,379 (1,523) 9,902\nTotal cost of sales and operating expenses 267,204 245,500 21,704\nLoss from operations (91,691) (111,470) 19,779\nInterest expense (2,775) — (2,775)\nInterest income 16,997 5,118 11,879\nNet loss before income taxes (77,469) (106,352) 28,883\nIncome tax expense 551 1,828 (1,277)\nNet loss $ (78,020) $ (108,180) $ 30,160\nTotal Revenue, net\nTotal net revenue was $175.5 million and $134.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company currently has two main customers for U.S. commercial sales of LUPKYNIS and a collaboration partnership with Otsuka for sales of semi-finished product and\nlicense, collaboration and royalty revenue in Otsuka Territories. The percentage of total revenues, net from our main customers were as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\nU.S. main commercial customers 91% 80% 100%\nCollaboration partnership 8% 20% —%\nProduct Revenue, net\nProduct Revenue, net was $158.5 million and $103.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase is primarily due to an increase of\nLUPKYNIS sales to our two main customers, driven predominantly by further penetration of the LN market.\nThe market penetration can be demonstrated, in part, by 1,791 additional prescriptions (which we generally refer to as patient start forms (PSFs)) received during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 compared to 1,650 PSFs received during the year ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company added\napproximately 101 new patients, which includes, restarts (patients coming back onto therapy who do not require PSF) and an estimate of new patients beginning therapy in the\nhospital channel. Patient restarts and estimated patients coming through the hospital channel are newly reported in the fourth quarter since they have achieved numerical\nsignificance for the first time. Lastly, our 12-month persistency rate has increased from approximately 50% at December 31, 2022 to approximately 55% at December 31, 2023.\nThese factors have\n55\ncontributed to an increase in our patients on therapy with approximately 2,066 patients on LUPKYNIS therapy at December 31, 2023, compared with 1,525 at December 31,\n2022.\nLicense, Collaboration and Royalty Revenue\nLicense, collaboration and royalty revenue was $17.0 million and $30.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, license, collaboration and royalty revenue included a $10.0 million pricing and reimbursement milestone in September 2023 and additional collaboration\nand manufacturing services revenue from Otsuka. For the year ended December 31, 2022, license, collaboration and royalty revenue was primarily due to the recognition of a\n$30.0 million regulatory milestone from Otsuka following the EC marketing authorization of LUPKYNIS in September 2022.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales were $14.1 million and $5.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase is primarily due to an increase in sales of\nLUPKYNIS, coupled with the amortization of the monoplant finance right-of-use asset, which was placed into service in late June 2023.\nGross margin for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately 92% and 96%, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses decreased to $195.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $196.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. SG&A expenses\nconsisted of the following:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 Change\nSalaries, incentive pay and employee benefits $ 82,768 $ 82,129 $ 639\nProfessional fees and services 51,161 58,759 (7,598)\nShare-based compensation expense 36,511 28,438 8,073\nOther public company costs, facility costs, insurance, information technology, amortization of property and\nequipment 13,315 15,826 (2,511)\nTravel, trade shows and sponsorships 11,281 11,219 62\n$ 195,036 $ 196,371 $ (1,335)\nThe primary drivers for the decrease in SG&A were a decrease of professional fees and services due to a reduction in expenses associated with corporate legal matters and\ninsurance partially offset by an increase in share-based compensation expense.\nWe expense SG&A costs in the periods in which they are incurred. We anticipate continuing to incur significant expenses in SG&A to support the commercialization of\nLUPKYNIS.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nR&D expenses increased to $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $45.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. R&D expenses consisted of\nthe following:\n56\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 Change\nContract research organizations (CRO) and developmental expenses $ 17,858 $ 18,451 $ (593)\nClinical supply and distribution 9,104 8,614 490\nSalaries, incentive pay and employee benefits 14,546 14,034 512\nShare-based compensation expense 7,533 3,271 4,262\nTravel, insurance, patent annuity fees, legal fees and other 600 618 (18)\n$ 49,641 $ 44,988 $ 4,653\nThe primary driver for the increase in R&D expenses was due to the increase in share-based compensation expense.\nWe spent approximately $17.4 million and $13.5 million on early stage pre-clinical research programs in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The spend\ndoes not include internal resource expenses as we currently do not track these for early stage research programs, prior to IND. The increase in spend on our pre-clinical research\nprograms was offset by a decrease in spend associated with clinical voclosporin associated studies.\nWe expect our R&D expenses will decrease going forward as we cease future development on AUR200 and AUR300 and focus our efforts on the development of voclosporin\nand our FDA post-approval obligations for LUPKYNIS. We are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our R&D projects.\nOther Expense (Income), Net\nOther expense (income), net was $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to other income of $(1.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The\nprimary drivers for other expense for the year ended 2023 were expenses related to shareholder matters and the foreign exchange loss related to the revaluation of the monoplant\nfinance lease liability, which commenced in June 2023 and is denominated in CHF.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was mainly due to\nhigher yields on our investments as a result of higher interest rates.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $48.9 million and investments of $301.8 million compared to cash, cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash of $94.2 million and short-term investments of $295.2 million at December 31, 2022. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and investments are primarily\nheld in U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had working capital of $347.6 million and $396.4 million, respectively.\nWe are devoting the majority of our operational efforts and financial resources towards the commercialization and post approval commitments of our approved drug,\nLUPKYNIS. Taking into consideration the cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and investments as of December 31, 2023, we believe that our cash position is sufficient to\nfund our current plans which include funding commercial activities, such as our FDA related post-approval commitments, manufacturing and packaging commercial drug\nsupply, funding our supporting commercial infrastructure, advancing our LUPKYNIS (voclosporin) related R&D programs and funding our working capital obligations for at\nleast the next few years.\n57\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nNet cash (used in) provided by:\nOperating activities $ (33,461) $ (79,529) $ (157,692)\nInvesting activities (6,706) (60,632) (103,870)\nFinancing activities (5,130) 2,433 221,112\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents $ (45,297) $ (137,728) $ (40,450)\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $33.5 million, compared to $79.5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease\nis primarily due to an increase in cash receipts from sales of LUPKYNIS. See \"Total Revenue, net\" above for further discussion regarding our increased sales of LUPKYNIS.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $6.7 million compared to $60.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was\nprimarily due to the timing of purchases of investments and capital payment for the monoplant, offset by proceeds of maturities of investments.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $5.1 million compared to cash provided by financing activities of $2.4 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The change is primarily due to the quarterly lease payments for our monoplant finance lease, which commenced during the second quarter of 2023.\nA discussion of changes in our cash flow from the year ended December 31, 2021 to the year ended December 31, 2022 can be found in Part II, Item 7, \"Management's\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\" of the 2022 Form 10-K.\nNovember 2021 ATM facility\nIn November 2021, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement under which we issued 10.2 million common shares, resulting in net proceeds of $196.7 million through\nDecember 31, 2021. There were no sales subsequent to December 31, 2021. In February 2022, we terminated the Open Market Sale Agreement and no further sales occurred.\nWe intend to use the net proceeds to fund our operations, which include, but are not limited to, commercial activities, including our FDA related post approval commitments,\nmanufacturing and packaging commercial drug supply, funding our supporting commercial infrastructure, advancing our R&D programs and funding our working capital\nobligations.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nAs of December 31, 2023, our material short-term cash requirements are approximately $170.0 million. We anticipate our long-term cash requirements to be approximately\n$134.0 million, which does not include per annum requirements related to human capital, insurance and government payor rebates, each of which we anticipate to fluctuate\nbased on future requirements (those per annum amounts, calculated on a short-term cash requirement basis, amount to approximately $116.0 million). These short and long-term\ncash requirement estimates are all based on our current operating plans and strategies, and could fluctuate if our plans were to change.\nOur material cash requirements include the following:\n• short-term per annum expenses for human capital (which includes estimates for personnel headcount, performance bonuses, salaries, benefits and commissions);\n• payor and government rebates and co-payment programs;\n• marketing and promotional services;\n• corporate insurance premiums;\n58\n• cash requirements related to R&D projects, clinical trials and post-approval related studies and support;\n• short-term and long-term lease liabilities included on our consolidated balance sheet or Note 15, Leases for further details;\n• deferred compensation arrangements included on our consolidated balance sheet or Note 14, Deferred Compensation and Other Non-Current Liabilities for further\ndetails;\n• severance costs and potential contract termination costs related to our restructuring program; and\n• purchases for inventory and production costs to support our commercial and clinical product supply requirements, as well as capital expenditures. For further details see\nNote 13, Commitments and Contingencies.\nThere are several factors that we believe could impact our future cash requirements, including:\n• the amount of revenue received from commercial sales of LUPKYNIS, from our licensing partners;\n• the scope, rate of progress, results and costs of our clinical trials and other related regulatory requirements and activities;\n• our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n• the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel as well as any other personnel changes that we may implement;\n• the timing of our restructuring program and our ability to execute successfully on the restructuring; and\n• the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing possible patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of any such\nlitigation.\n59\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks\nOur activities can expose us to market risks which include interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, inflation risk and credit risk. Risk management is carried out by management\nunder policies approved by our Board of Directors. Our overall risk management program seeks to minimize adverse effects on our financial performance.\nInterest Rate Risk\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities with variable interest rates expose us to cash flow interest rate risk. We manage our interest rate risk by maximizing the interest income\nearned on excess funds while maintaining the liquidity necessary to conduct operations on a day-to-day basis. As of December 31, 2023 our investment portfolio includes cash,\ncash equivalents and restricted cash and investments of $350.7 million that earn interest at market rates. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our\ninvestment policy, which defines allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. Our investments held during the\nyear were comprised of highly rated instruments such as certificates of deposits, money market instruments, obligations issued by the U.S. government and U.S government\nagencies as well as corporate debt securities. As of December 31, 2023, these instruments have a weighted average remaining maturity of 7 months.\nAs of December 31, 2023, a hypothetical annual change of 100 basis points on the interest rates of our $301.8 million investments would result in approximately a $3.0 million\nfluctuation of interest income in our portfolio.\nAccounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities bear no interest. We do not believe that the results of operations or cash flows would be affected to any significant\ndegree by a sudden change in market interest rates relative to our investment portfolio.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to financial risk related to the fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency risk for the Company is the risk variations in exchange rates\nbetween the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, primarily with the Swiss Franc, Canadian dollar and Great British Pound, which could affect our operating and financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had a $90.1 million finance lease liability on our balance sheet related to the monoplant. An assumed 10% fluctuation in the Swiss Franc\ncompared to the U.S. dollar would have an approximate $9.0 million fluctuation in the valuation of the lease liability.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $1.9 million of foreign denominated third-party payables included in the Company's accounts payable and accrued liabilities\nbalance. An assumed 10% fluctuation in the exchange rates would have an approximate $0.2 million fluctuation in the amounts due.\nThere were no other foreign currency fluctuations that would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations as of December 31, 2023.\nInflation Risk\nInflation has continued to increase during 2023 and is expected to continue to be a risk. Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor, commercial support,\nmanufacturing and clinical trial expenditures. In addition, our investment portfolio may experience the risk of realized losses on our investments if we were to sell before\nmaturity due to the market volatility caused by increasing interest rates.\nCredit Risk\nOur exposure to credit risk generally consists of cash and cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable. We place our cash and cash equivalents with highly rated\nfinancial institutions and invest the excess cash in highly rated investments. It is the Company's intent for these investments to have an overall rating of A-1, or higher, by\nStandard & Poor’s, or an equivalent rating by Moody’s or Fitch. Our investment policy limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by\ninstitutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer. We do not believe that the results of\noperations or cash flows would be affected to any significant degree\n60\nby a sudden change in market interest rates relative to our investment portfolio, due to the short-term nature of the investments and our current ability to hold these investments\nto maturity.\nWe are subject to credit risk in connection with our accounts receivable due from our two main U.S. commercial customers and collaboration partnership with Otsuka which\naccounted for the majority of our accounts receivable, net balances as of December 31, 2023. We monitor economic conditions and the creditworthiness of our customers. We\nregularly communicate with our customers regarding the status of receivable balances and have not experienced any issues with collectability. The timing between the\nrecognition of revenue and the receipt of payment is not significant. Our standard credit terms range from 30 to 45 days. In 2023, we did not recognize any allowance for\ndoubtful accounts receivable related to credit risk for our customers or write any amounts off.\n61\nITEM 8.

The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures\nof a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and\nprocedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure.\nManagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and\nmanagement necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls\nand procedures as of December 31, 2023, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures\nwere effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act.\nOur internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control\nover financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated\nin their attestation report herein, which appears in the \"Index to Consolidated Financial Statements\" in Part IV.\nInherent Limitations of Internal Controls\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to\nfuture periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\nmay deteriorate.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while\nensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities,\nand migrating processes.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2023, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n63\nItem 9B. Other Information\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2023, no directors or Section 16 officers adopted or terminated any “Rule 10b5-1\ntrading arrangement” or any “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation\nS-K.\nItem 9C.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Organization and Description of Business\nAurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Aurinia or the Company) is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering therapies to people living with autoimmune\ndiseases with high unmet medical needs. In January 2021, the Company introduced LUPKYNIS® (voclosporin), the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved\noral therapy for the treatment of adult patients with active lupus nephritis (LN) and continues to conduct clinical and regulatory activities to support the LUPKYNIS\ndevelopment program. Aurinia contracted with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka) as a collaboration partner for development and commercialization of LUPKYNIS in\nthe European Union (EU), Japan, as well as the United Kingdom, Russia, Switzerland, Norway, Belarus, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Ukraine (collectively, the Otsuka\nTerritories).\nOn September 15, 2022, the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization of LUPKYNIS to Otsuka. The centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU\nmember states as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Northern Ireland.\nEffective February 14, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors elected to conclude its strategic review process and that it was in the best interest of the Company and its\nshareholders to undergo a restructuring. In principal, the corporate restructuring will involve the Company reaffirming its commitment to LUPKYNIS growth, while\nmaintaining a sharp focus on operating efficiencies and maximizing cash flows. As a result, the Company is ceasing future development efforts on AUR200 and its pre-clinical\nasset AUR300.\nAs of April 1, 2023, Aurinia's head office and registered office is located at #140, 14315-118 Avenue, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T5L 4S6. Aurinia also has a U.S.\ncommercial office located at 77 Upper Rock Circle Suite 700, Rockville, Maryland, 20850 United States.\nAurinia is incorporated pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (Alberta). The Company’s common shares are traded on the Nasdaq Global Market (Nasdaq) under the\nsymbol AUPH.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of presentation: The Company follows accounting standards established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to ensure consistent reporting of financial\ncondition, results of operations, and cash flows. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the\nUnited States of America (U.S. GAAP).\nPrinciples of consolidation: These financial statements present the consolidated financial position of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Aurinia Pharma U.S.,\nInc. (Delaware incorporated) and Aurinia Pharma Limited (UK incorporated) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of operations and cash flows for the three years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of estimates: The preparation of the accompanying financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported\namounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from those\nestimates.\nSegment information: The Company operates in one operating segment engaged in the research, development and commercialization of therapeutic drugs in which revenues\nare derived from product, license, and contract revenues. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise where separate financial information is evaluated\nregularly by the chief operating decision maker (CODM), the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. The Company's CODM\nallocates resources and assesses performance based upon discrete financial information at the consolidated level.\nF-9\nFunctional currency: The functional currency for the Company and all of its foreign subsidiaries is determined to be the U.S. dollar, therefore there is no currency translation\nadjustment upon consolidation as the remeasurement of gains or losses are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. All monetary assets and liabilities denominated\nin a foreign currency are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities (along with their related expenses) are\ntranslated at the rate of exchange in effect on the date assets were acquired. Monetary income and expense items are translated at the average foreign exchange rate for the\nperiod. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of a foreign currency denominated monetary item are included in the consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive loss in other expense (income), net.\nFair value measurements: The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and\naccrued liabilities. The Company has determined the carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period to maturity\nof the instruments.\nFinancial assets and liabilities are categorized based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance\nof a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair\nvalue hierarchy levels.\nConcentration of credit risk: Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash, cash\nequivalents and restricted cash, investments and accounts receivable, net. The Company attempts to minimize the risks related to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\nand investments by investing in a range of financial instruments. The Company established guidelines related to credit ratings and maturities intended to safeguard principal\nbalances, earn a return on investments and to maintain liquidity. The Company's investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with its investment policy, which defines\nallowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. The Company does not enter into any investment transaction for\ntrading or speculative purposes.\nThe Company’s investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments such as certificates of deposit, money market instruments, obligations issued by the U.S.\ngovernment and U.S. government agencies as well as high quality corporate debt securities, and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer. The\nCompany maintains cash balances in excess of amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation and concentrated\nwithin a limited number of financial institutions. The accounts are monitored by management to mitigate the risk.\nThe Company is exposed to financial risk related to the fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates which could have a material effect on its future operating results or cash\nflows. Foreign currency risk is the risk that variations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, primarily with the Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar and\nGreat British Pound will affect the Company's operating and financial results. The Company holds the majority of its cash and cash equivalents in U.S. dollars and the majority\nof its expenses, including commercial and clinical trial costs are also denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company's monoplant finance lease is denominated in Swiss Francs.\nThese foreign currency balances can result in fluctuations in foreign exchange gain or loss.\nMajor customers: The Company currently has two main customers for U.S. commercial sales of LUPKYNIS and a collaboration partnership with Otsuka for sales of semi-\nfinished product and royalty, collaboration and manufacturing services revenue in Otsuka Territories. The percentages of total revenues, net from our main customers were as\nfollows:\nF-10\n2023 2022 2021\nU.S. main commercial customers 91% 80% 100%\nCollaboration partnership 8% 20% —%\nIn late March 2022, the Company provided a nominal additional discount to both of its two main U.S. customers, applicable for the 2022 calendar year, in connection with\nholding additional amounts of LUPKYNIS on hand due to supply chain concerns. In December 2022, the Company extended the nominal discount to the end of 2024. Such\ndiscounts, or any future discounts, may result in reduced sales to these customers in subsequent periods and substantial fluctuations in our revenues from period to period. The\nCompany monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. The Company regularly\ncommunicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances. Global economic conditions and customer specific factors may require the Company to\nperiodically re-evaluate the collectability of its receivables and based on this evaluation the Company could potentially incur credit losses. The Company has had no historical\nwrite-offs related to our customers or receivables.\nAccounts receivable, net: Accounts receivables are stated at their net realizable value. The Company's accounts receivable represents amounts primarily due to the Company\nfrom product sales and from its Otsuka collaboration agreement (Note 10). Sales and services that have not been invoiced as of the balance sheet date are recorded as unbilled\naccounts receivable. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, accounts receivable, net were $24.1 million and $13.5 million, respectively. The timing between the\nrecognition of revenue for product sales and the receipt of payment is not significant. The Company's standard credit terms range from 30 to 45 days. The Company does not\nassess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is such that the period between the transfer of the promised good to the\ncustomer and receipt of payment will be one year or less.\nThe Company's estimates allowances using the current expected credit loss (CECL) model. Under the CECL model, the allowances reflect the net amount expected to be\ncollected from the account receivables. The Company evaluates the collectability of these cash flows based on the asset’s amortized cost, the risk of loss even when that risk is\nremote, losses over an asset’s contractual life, and other relevant information available to the Company. Accounts receivable balances are written off against the allowance when\nit is probable that the receivable will not be collected. Given the nature of the Company's accounts receivable, it determined that an allowance for current expected credit losses\nwas nil at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nAccounts receivables for the Company's U.S commercial customers are recorded net of estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and which result\nfrom discounts that are offered within contracts between us and two specialty pharmacies and one specialty distributor in the U.S. These reserves are recorded as a reduction of\naccounts receivable.\nCash and cash equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.\nCash and cash equivalents consist primarily of operating accounts, money market funds and bank money market accounts, which are recorded at fair value. Cash and cash\nequivalents totaled $48.9 million and $94.2 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company has invested its cash reserves mainly in short\nterm U.S. dollar denominated, fixed rate, highly liquid and highly rated financial instruments such as treasury notes, banker acceptances, bank bonds, and term deposits.\nRestricted cash: Restricted cash consists of the 2021 Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP) deposits of $120 thousand and $84 thousand as of December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively. Refer to note 17 \"Share-Based Compensation\" for further details on the ESPP.\nInvestments: The Company classifies its debt securities as available-for-sale in accordance with the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 320, Investments —\nDebt Securities. Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in other comprehensive loss within shareholders’\nequity. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recorded in other income (expense), net. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification\nmethod. Interest income is accrued when earned and the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity arising from acquisition is included in interest income\non the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nF-11\nIntangible assets: Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives using methods that correlate to the pattern in which the economic benefits are\nexpected to be realized. The Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to\nthe remaining period of amortization. The carrying amounts of these assets are reviewed at least annually for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\nthat the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Refer to the long-lived assets section below for impairment considerations.\nAcquired intellectual property and patents\nExternal patent costs specifically associated with preparing, filing, obtaining and protecting patents are capitalized and amortized straight-line over the shorter of the estimated\nuseful life and the patent life, commencing in the year of the grant of the patent. Patents do not contain the option to extend or renew. External legal costs incurred to defend a\npatent are capitalized when it is believed that the future economic benefit of the patent will be increased and a successful defense is probable.\nSeparately acquired intellectual property is shown at historical cost. The initial recognition of purchased intellectual property or a reacquired right is recognized as an intangible\nasset measured on the basis of the remaining contractual term of the related contract. If the terms of the contract giving rise to a reacquired right are favorable relative to the\nterms of current market transactions for the same or similar items, the difference is recognized as a gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive\nloss. Purchased intellectual property and reacquired rights are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive\nloss over periods ranging from 10 to 12 years.\nProperty and equipment: Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method. Expenditures for additions are capitalized and\nleasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are\ncharged to expense as incurred; however, maintenance and repairs that improve or extend the life of existing assets are capitalized. The carrying amount of assets disposed of\nand the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal. Gains or losses from property and equipment disposals are recognized in the\nyear of disposal.\nRecoverability and impairment of long-lived assets: ASC Topic 360 requires long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, to be evaluated for impairment at\nleast annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The judgments made related to the expected\nuseful lives of long-lived assets, definitions of lease terms and the Company’s ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of these assets are\naffected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in usage or operating performance and other\nfactors. If indicators are present, assets are grouped to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other asset groups and cash flows are\nestimated for each asset group over the remaining estimated life of each asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset group are less than\nthe asset’s carrying amount, impairment is recognized in the amount of excess of the carrying value over the fair value. The Company recorded no asset impairment charges\nduring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nLeases: The Company assesses all contracts at inception to determine whether a lease exists. The Company’s leases are all classified either as operating or finance leases per\nASC 842. The Company leases office space under operating leases that typically provide for the payment of minimum annual rentals and may include scheduled rent increases.\nThe Company also entered into a manufacturing agreement that contained an embedded lease of a dedicated manufacturing facility that was accounted for as a finance lease\nwhen the lease commencement began (see Note 15).\nThe Company made an accounting policy election to use the practical expedient that allows lessees to treat the lease and non-lease components of leases as a single lease\ncomponent. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheets and to recognize those lease payments on a straight-\nline basis in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Fixed costs associated with these arrangements are disclosed in Note 15 of the financial\nstatements.\nOperating and finance lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The\nCompany used the incremental borrowing rate for all of its leases, as the implicit\nF-12\ninterest rate was not readily determinable. In determining the Company’s incremental borrowing rate of each lease, the Company considered recent rates on secured borrowings,\nobservable risk-free interest rates and credit spreads correlating to the Company's creditworthiness, the impact of collateralization and the term of each of the Company's lease\nagreements. The lease terms range from 12 to 128 months.\nDeferred Compensation Arrangements: The Company has recorded deferred compensation arrangements in liabilities for estimated future employee benefits relating to\napplicable historical employment arrangements. The deferred compensation arrangements are part of the resolution of the board of directors of the company dated March 8,\n2012. Pursuant to ASC Topic 710, the Company recognizes future benefits provided by employee retention arrangements, as deferred compensation, which is recognized when\nthe Company determines that it is probable to make future payments. The deferred compensation is based on an income approach for the estimated future net revenues of\nvoclosporin using an internal risk-adjusted net present value of the future payments to be made to the individuals.\nThe Company is required to use judgment to determine the most appropriate model to measure the deferred compensation liability and is required to use significant judgment\nand estimates in determining the inputs into the model. The royalty rates applied to the net revenue are dependent on the type of net revenue earned, which includes product\nsales and royalty revenue. There are multiple unobservable and inherently uncertain inputs. The determination of this deferred compensation is subject to significant judgments\nand estimates in determining the assumptions related to future net revenues and the determination of the discount rate for the net present value calculation. The net revenue\nestimate for the United States includes assumptions related to the number of patients being treated (including patients who initially start taking the product but subsequently\ndiscontinue), dosing adjustments, duration of treatment, timing of generics and competitors entering the market, market penetration and potential future use in new indications.\nAdditional variables for ex-U.S. geographies include timing of approval in ex-U.S. territories, escalating royalty rates, net pricing, government payor coverage of the product,\nand market penetration. In determining the estimate for ex-U.S. revenues, the Company relies on forecasts provided by its collaboration partner.\nManagement developed the model and inputs in conjunction with their internal scientific team and utilized third party scientific studies, information provided by third party\nconsultants engaged by the Company, information from medical and pharmacy claims databases and research papers as sources to develop their inputs; application and usage of\nthese inputs is also informed by product sales and distribution data, ongoing market research fielded by the Company and third parties, and our continually evolving\nunderstanding of the market as the U.S. launch progresses. Management believes the liability is based on reasonable assumptions; however, these assumptions may be\nincomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. There are numerous significant inputs into the model all of which individually or in\ncombination may result in a material change to the obligation.\nInitially, these obligations are measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting\nperiods. Subsequent re-measurements as a result of performance obligations met by the Company or changes in assumptions are recognized in the consolidated statement of\noperations and comprehensive loss.\nContingencies: In the normal course of business, the Company may be subject to loss contingencies, such as legal proceedings, amounts arising from contractual arrangements\nand claims arising out of the Company’s business that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and\nenvironmental liability, and tax matters. In accordance with ASC Topic 450, Accounting for Contingencies, (ASC 450), the Company records accruals for such loss\ncontingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company, in accordance with this guidance, does not\nrecognize gain contingencies until realized or realizable.\nCommon Shares: The Company’s shares have no par value and therefore, upon issuance of shares, all amounts related to the shares are credited to common shares on the\nbalance sheet. The value of common shares includes cash amounts received or paid for the shares and the fair value of equity awards and warrants. Amounts for common shares\nare offset by share issue costs associated with equity offerings.\nInventories: Inventories are valued under a standard costing methodology on a first-in, first-out basis and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company\ncapitalizes inventory costs related to products to be sold in the ordinary course of business. The Company makes a determination of capitalizing inventory costs for a product\nbased on, among other factors, status of regulatory approval, information regarding safety, efficacy and expectations relating to commercial sales and\nF-13\nrecoverability of costs. Capitalized costs of inventories mainly include third party manufacturing costs, transportation, storage, insurance and allocated internal labor. The\nCompany assesses recoverability of inventory each reporting period to determine any write down to net realizable value resulting from excess or obsolete inventories.\nRevenue Recognition: Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), the Company recognizes revenue when\na customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The Company records the amount of revenue that reflects the consideration that it expects to receive in exchange for\nthose goods or services. Revenue is recognized through a five-step process: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract;\n(iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) a performance\nobligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange\nfor the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that\nare performance obligations. Revenue is recognized for the applicable performance element when each distinct performance obligation is satisfied.\nProduct Revenues\nIn the United States (and territories), the Company sells LUPKYNIS primarily to a limited number of specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors. These customers\nsubsequently resell LUPKYNIS to health care providers and patients. Revenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of the Company's product,\nwhich typically occurs upon delivery to the customer.\nReserves for discounts and allowances: Product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves\nare established. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the\namount is payable to our customer) or a liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer).\nThe Company estimates of reserves established for variable consideration are calculated based upon utilizing the expected value method. The transaction price, which includes\nvariable consideration reflecting the impact of discounts and allowances, may be subject to constraint and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable\nthat a significant reversal of the amount of the cumulative revenues recognized will not occur in a future period. Amounts related to such items are estimated at contract\ninception and updated at the end of each reporting period as addition information becomes available.\nSignificant judgment is required in estimating variable consideration. In making these estimates, the Company considers historical data, including patient mix and inventory\nsold to our customers that has not yet been dispensed. The Company uses a data aggregator and historical claims to estimate variable consideration for inventory sold to our\ncustomers, including specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors, that has not yet been dispensed. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from the Company's estimates. If\nactual results vary, the Company adjusts these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment. As of December 31, 2023, the Company did not\nhave any material adjustments to variable consideration estimates based on actual results.\nMore specifically, these adjustments include the following:\nPrompt Pay Discounts: The Company generally provides invoice discounts on product sales to its customers for prompt payment. The Company estimates that its customers\nwill earn these discounts and fees, and deducts the full amount of these discounts and fees from its gross product revenues and accounts receivable at the time such revenues are\nrecognized.\nCustomer Fees: The Company pays certain customer fees, such as fees for certain data that customers provide to the Company. The Company records fees paid to its customers\nas a reduction of revenue, unless the payment is for a distinct good or service from the customer and the Company can reasonably estimate the fair value of the goods or\nservices received. If both conditions are met, the Company records the consideration paid to the customer as SG&A expense.\nGovernment Rebates: The Company estimates its government rebates, primarily Medicaid and Medicare rebates based upon a range of possible outcomes that are probability-\nweighted for the estimated payor mix. These reserves are recorded in the same\nF-14\nperiod the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability that is included in accrued expenses on the\nconsolidated balance sheet.\nMedicaid rebates relate to the Company's estimated obligations to states under established reimbursement arrangements. Rebate accruals are recorded in the same period that the\nrelated revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability, which is included in other current liabilities. The Company's\nliability for Medicaid rebates consists of estimates for claims that a state will make for the current quarter, claims for prior quarters that have been estimated for which an\ninvoice has not been received, invoices received for claims from the prior quarters that have not been paid and an estimate of potential claims that will be made for inventory\nthat exists in the distribution channel at period end.\nFor Medicare, the Company also estimates the number of patients in the prescription drug coverage gap for whom the Company will owe an additional liability under the\nMedicare Part D program. The Company’s liability for these rebates consists of invoices received for claims from prior quarters that have not been paid or for which an invoice\nhas not yet been received, estimates of claims for the current quarter, and estimated future claims that will be made for product that has been recognized as revenue, but remains\nin the distribution channel inventories at the end of each reporting period.\nCo-payment Assistance: Co-payment assistance represents financial assistance to qualified patients, assisting them with prescription drug co-payments required by insurance.\nThe program is administered by the specialty pharmacies. The calculation of the accrual for co-payment assistance is based on the co-payments administered on the Company's\nbehalf by the specialty pharmacies.\nPayor Rebates and Administration Fees: Payor rebates and administration fees represent our estimated obligations to third parties, primarily benefit managers. Accruals are\nrecorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability. These rebates and fees result from\nformulary position and price increase limit allowances (price protection) and administration fees. The calculation of the accrual for these items are based on the estimated payors\nbuying patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over a contractual period.\nSupply of Drug Substance and Semi-finished Goods: The Company also has agreements with its partners that include options related to the promise for future supply of drug\nsubstance or drug product for either clinical development or commercial supply at the licensee’s discretion. The Company assesses if these options provide a material right to\nthe licensee and if so, they are accounted for as separate performance obligations. If the Company is entitled to additional payments when the licensee exercises these options,\nany additional payments are recorded as product sales when the licensee obtains control of the goods, which is typically upon delivery. Certain agreements include terms where\nthe Company can partially bill for drug substance used before the manufacturing cycle is complete, resulting in a deferred revenue which is to be recognized once delivery\noccurs.\nLicense, Collaboration and Royalty Revenue\nThe Company enters into out-licensing agreements that are within the scope of ASC 606, under which it licenses certain rights to LUPKYNIS to third parties. The terms of these\narrangements typically include payment to the Company of one or more of the following: non-refundable, up-front license fees; development, regulatory and commercial\nmilestone payments, payments for manufacturing supply services the Company provides through its contract manufacturers, and royalties on net sales of licensed products.\nEach of these payments results in license, collaboration and other revenues, except for revenues from royalties on net sales of licensed products, which are classified as royalty\nrevenues.\nIn determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements, the Company performs the following steps: (i)\nidentification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they\nare distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to\nthe performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. As part of the accounting for these arrangements,\nthe Company must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. The\nCompany uses key assumptions to determine the stand-alone selling price, which may include forecasted revenues, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel\ncosts, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory success.\nF-15\nLicenses of Intellectual Property: If the license to the Company’s intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the\narrangement, the Company recognizes revenues from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able\nto use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance\nobligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress\nfor purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the\nmeasure of performance and related revenue recognition.\nMilestone Payments: At the inception of each arrangement that includes development or commercial sales milestone payments, the Company evaluates whether the milestones\nare considered probable of being reached and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a\nsignificant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance\nobligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which the Company recognizes revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At\nthe end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of such development milestones and any related constraint, and if\nnecessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect license, collaboration and\nother revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment.\nManufacturing Services Revenue: The Company’s agreements may include manufacturing services to be performed by the Company on behalf of the counterparty. If these\nservices are determined to be distinct from the other promises or performance obligations identified in the arrangement, the Company recognizes the transaction price allocated\nto these services as revenue. The revenue is recognized either over time based on an appropriate measure of progress when the performance by the Company does not create an\nasset with an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for the performance completed to date; or at a point in time as the related performance\nobligations are satisfied. Certain agreements may include terms where the Company can partially bill for manufacturing services before the serves are provided, resulting in a\ndeferred revenue which is to be recognized once the performance obligation is satisfied.\nRoyalty Revenue: For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, revenue is recognized when the underlying product sales have occurred. Revenue is recorded based on\nestimated quarterly net sales reports provided by our partner. Differences between actual results and estimated amounts are adjusted in the period in which they become known,\nwhich typically follows the quarterly period in which the estimate is made. Sales-based milestone payments are recognized in the period once the milestone objectives have\nbeen achieved.\nOther Services Revenue: The Company’s agreements may include R&D or other services to be performed by the Company on behalf of the counterparty. If these services are\ndetermined to be distinct from the other promises or performance obligations identified in the arrangement, the Company recognizes the transaction price allocated to these\nservices as revenue either over time based on an appropriate measure of progress when the performance by the Company does not create an asset with an alternative use and the\nCompany has an enforceable right to payment for the performance completed to date or at a point in time as the related performance obligations are satisfied.\nCosts to obtain a contract\nAs the majority of our contracts are short-term in nature, sales commissions are generally expensed when incurred as the amortization period would have been less than one\nyear. These costs are recorded within SG&A.\nCost of sales: Cost of sales consists primarily of cost of inventories for LUPKYNIS and semi-finished product, which mainly includes third party manufacturing costs,\ntransportation, storage, insurance and allocated internal labor. Cost of sales also includes costs related to collaboration revenues.\nResearch and development costs: R&D costs are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 730, Research and Development, (ASC 730) and are expensed as incurred.\nR&D costs consist primarily of the cost of salaries, share-based compensation expenses, payroll taxes and other employee benefits, subcontractors and materials used for R&D\nactivities, including nonclinical studies, clinical trials, manufacturing costs and professional services. The costs of services performed by\nF-16\nothers in connection with the R&D activities of the Company, including R&D conducted by others on behalf of the Company, shall be included in R&D costs and expensed as\nthe contracted work is performed.\nWe accrue the costs incurred under our agreements with these third parties based on actual work completed in accordance with agreements established with these third parties.\nWe determine the accruals for R&D costs through monitoring invoices received and discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage\nof completion of the clinical studies and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under R&D\narrangements or license agreements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are probable to be achieved.\nR&D expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, were $49.6 million, $45.0 million and $51.1 million, respectively, and are included in total cost of sales\nand operating expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses: The Company's SG&A expenses include commercial and allocated administrative cost of salaries, share-based\ncompensation expenses, payroll taxes and other employee benefits, corporate facility charges and external costs required to support the marketing and sales of LUPKYNIS.\nThese SG&A costs include corporate facility operating expenses and allocated depreciation; commercial, marketing, advertising, pharmacovigilance, publications, tradeshows,\nadvisory boards, samples and operations in support of LUPKYNIS; patient assistance program costs; human resources; finance, legal, information technology and support\npersonnel expenses; and other corporate costs such as telecommunications, insurance, audit and government affairs. We expense SG&A expenses as they are incurred.\nThe Company uses a third-party logistics provider to perform a full order to cash service, which includes warehousing and shipping directly tot wo specialty pharmacies and\nreceiving orders from a specialty distributor for shipping to hospitals, on our behalf. As such, since these costs are not integral to bringing the inventories to a salable condition,\nwe elected not to treat shipping and handling costs as a fulfillment activity. Shipping and handling costs related to order fulfillment are recorded in SG&A expenses.\nAdvertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred and included in SG&A. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, advertising and marketing costs\ntotaled $15.4 million, $16.3 million and $15.4 million, respectively.\nSG&A expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $195.0 million, $196.4 million and $173.5 million, respectively, and are included in total cost of\nsales and operating expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nShared-based compensation: The Company follows ASC Topic 718, Compensation(cid:0)(cid:1)-(cid:0)(cid:1)Stock Compensation (ASC 718), which requires the measurement and recognition of\ncompensation expense, based on estimated fair values, for all share-based awards made to employees and directors. The Company records compensation expense based on the\nfair value on the grant date using the graded accelerated vesting method for all share-based payments related to stock options, performance awards (PAs), restricted stock units\n(RSUs) and purchases under the Company's 2021 ESPP. The estimated fair value of performance-based awards is measured on the grant date and is recognized when it is\ndetermined that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. The Company has elected a policy for all share-based awards to estimate forfeitures based on\nhistorical forfeiture experience at the time of grant and revise in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nIncome taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740 ,Income Taxes (ASC 740). Deferred tax assets\nand liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws\nthat are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income in\nthe period that such tax rate changes are enacted. The portion of any deferred tax asset for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized must then be\noffset by recording a valuation allowance. Financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is determined based on a more-likely-\nthan-not threshold of that position being sustained. If the tax position meets this threshold, the benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount that is more likely\nthan not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.\nF-17\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued final guidance in ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (ASC 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures requiring entities to provide\nadditional information in the rate reconciliation and disclosures about income taxes paid. For public business entities, the guidance is effective for annual periods beginning\nafter December 15, 2024. The Company is not early adopting, and therefore, this ASU is not adopted in the current period. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a\nmaterial impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures which requires public entities to\ndisclose significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision-maker. Public entities with a single reporting segment have to provide all disclosures\nrequired by ASC 280, including the significant segment expense disclosures. For public business entities, the guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December\n15, 2024. The Company is not early adopting, and therefore is not adopted in the current period. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance, which requires\nbusiness entities to make annual disclosures about transactions with a government (including government assistance) by analogizing to a grant or contribution accounting model.\nThe required disclosures include the nature of the transaction, the entity's related accounting policy, the financial statement line items affected and the amounts reflected in the\ncurrent period financial statements, as well as any significant terms and conditions. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2021. The Company adopted the ASU effective January 1, 2022, with no material impact on the consolidated financial statements in 2022 and 2023.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which clarifies and simplifies certain aspects\nof the accounting for income taxes. The standard is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December\n15, 2020. The Company adopted the ASU effective January 1, 2021 with no material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n3. Fair Value Measurement\nThe Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The carrying\nvalue of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values because of their short-term nature. Estimated fair values of available-for-sale\ndebt securities are generally based on prices obtained from commercial pricing services.\nIn connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from sources\nindependent from the Company) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (the Company’s assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities).\nAs a basis for considering such assumptions, a three-tier fair value hierarchy has been established, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\n• Level 1 - Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\n• Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions.\nF-18\nThe following table summarizes the financial assets (cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments) measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nDecember 31, 2023\n(in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nFinancial assets:\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 48,875 $ — $ — $ 48,875\nU.S. agency security — — — —\nCorporate bond — 33,781 — 33,781\nCommercial paper — 39,304 — 39,304\nTreasury bill — 122,806 — 122,806\nTreasury bond — 105,924 — 105,924\nTotal financial assets $ 48,875 $ 301,815 $ — $ 350,690\nDecember 31, 2022\n(in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nFinancial assets:\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 94,172 $ — $ — $ 94,172\nU.S. agency security — 4,948 — 4,948\nCorporate bond — 104,080 — 104,080\nCommercial paper — 125,187 — 125,187\nTreasury bill — 12,282 — 12,282\nTreasury bond — 42,220 — 42,220\nYankee bond — 6,501 — 6,501\nTotal financial assets $ 94,172 $ 295,218 $ — $ 389,390\nThe Company's Level 1 instruments include cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash that are valued using quoted market prices. Aurinia estimates the fair values of our\ninvestments in corporate debt securities, government and government related securities and certificates of deposits by taking into consideration valuations obtained from third-\nparty pricing services. The fair value of the Company's investments classified within Level 2 is based upon observable inputs that may include benchmark yield curves, reported\ntrades, issuer spreads, benchmark securities and reference data including market research publications. Additionally, at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the\nweighted average remaining contractual maturities of Aurinia's Level 2 investments were approximately 7 months for both periods. It is the Company's intent for these\ninvestments to have an overall rating of A-1, or higher, by Standard & Poor’s, or an equivalent rating by Moody’s or Fitch.\nNo credit loss allowance was recorded as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, as we do not believe the unrealized loss is a result of a credit loss due to the nature of\nour investments. We also considered the current and expected future economic and market conditions and determined that the estimate of credit losses was not significantly\nimpacted.\nRefer to Note 4, “Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash and Investments,” for the carrying amount and related unrealized gains (losses) by type of investment.\n4. Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Investments\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had $350.7 million and $389.4 million, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments,\nwhich are summarized below. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $301.8 million and $295.2 million the Company's investments, which are available-for-sale\ndebt securities, are carried at fair market value.\nF-19\nDecember 31, 2023\nEstimated Fair\n(in thousands) Amortized Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Value\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 48,875 $ — $ — $ 48,875\nCorporate bond 33,576 4 — 33,580\nCommercial paper 39,305 — (1) 39,304\nTreasury bill 122,757 49 — 122,806\nTreasury bond 105,903 21 — 105,924\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments $ 350,416 $ 74 $ (1) $ 350,489\nTotal long-term investment corporate bond 200 1 — 201\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments $ 350,616 $ 75 $ (1) $ 350,690\nDecember 31, 2022\nEstimated Fair\n(in thousands) Amortized Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Value\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 94,172 $ — $ — $ 94,172\nU.S. agency security 4,951 — (3) 4,948\nCorporate bond 104,174 — (94) 104,080\nCommercial paper 125,255 — (68) 125,187\nTreasury bill 12,290 — (8) 12,282\nTreasury bond 42,301 — (81) 42,220\nYankee bond 6,503 — (2) 6,501\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments $ 389,646 $ — $ (256) $ 389,390\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, accrued interest receivable from the investments were $0.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively and recorded as other\ncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 the Company had $331 thousand, $209 thousand and\n$47 thousand of net unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, respectively, which are included as a component of comprehensive loss on the consolidated\nstatement of operations and comprehensive loss. Currently, the Company does not intend to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be\nmaturity. Realized gains or losses were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nThe Company's short-term investments as of December 31, 2023 mature at various dates through November 2024 and the long-term investment matures in August 2025.\n5. Inventories, net\nInventories are valued under a standard costing methodology on a first-in, first-out basis and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company capitalizes\ninventory costs related to products to be sold in the ordinary course of business. The Company makes a determination of capitalizing inventory costs for a product based on,\namong other factors, status of regulatory approval, information regarding safety, efficacy and expectations relating to commercial sales and recoverability of costs. Capitalized\ncosts of inventories for LUPKYNIS mainly include third party manufacturing costs, transportation, storage, insurance and allocated internal labor. Due to the nature of the\nCompany's supply chain process, inventory that is owned by the Company, is physically stored at third-party warehouses, logistics providers, and contract manufacturers.\nThe Company assesses recoverability of inventory at each reporting period to determine any write down to net realizable value resulting from excess or obsolete inventories. As\nof December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Aurinia had recorded reserves\nF-20\nof finished goods inventories of approximately $0.8 million and $3.9 million, respectively, which were primarily related to potential inventory obsolescence.\nThe components of inventories, net are as follows:\n(in thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nRaw materials $ 1,746 $ 2,217\nWork in process 37,376 21,059\nFinished goods 583 1,476\nTotal inventories, net $ 39,705 $ 24,752\n6.

License and Collaboration Agreements\nOtsuka Contract\nOn December 17, 2020, the Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Otsuka for the development and\ncommercialization of LUPKYNIS in the Otsuka Territories.\nF-22\nAs part of the agreement, the Company received an upfront cash payment of $50.0 million in 2020 for the license agreement and thereafter has received $40.0 million in\nregulatory and pricing approval milestones as detailed below. The Company has the potential to receive an additional $10.0 million milestone related to Japan regulatory\napproval. The Company provides semi-finished product of LUPKYNIS to Otsuka on a cost-plus basis, and will receive tiered royalties on future sales ranging from 10 to 20\npercent (dependent on territory and achievement of sale thresholds) on net product sales by Otsuka, along with additional milestone payments based on the attainment of certain\nannual sales. In addition, certain collaboration services are to be provided to Otsuka on agreed upon rates.\nIn furtherance of the collaboration and license agreement with Otsuka mentioned above, on August 1, 2022, the Company entered into a commercial supply agreement with\nOtsuka, formalizing the terms to supply semi-finished goods of LUPKYNIS to Otsuka in the Otsuka Territories, including capacity sharing of the monoplant to provide\nmanufacturing services.\nOn September 15, 2022, the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization of LUPKYNIS. The centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU member\nstates as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Northern Ireland. The\napproval triggered a $30.0 million milestone payment to the Company, which was recognized as collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. On November\n29, 2022 Aurinia announced that the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had granted marketing authorization of LUPKYNIS in Great Britain. On\nApril 24, 2023, LUPKYNIS received regulatory approval in Switzerland. The Company continues to progress with regulatory approval with Otsuka in the other Otsuka\nTerritories.\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, the Company received notification that the pricing and reimbursement milestone was secured. As a result, this triggered a $10.0 million\nmilestone which was recognized as collaboration revenue in the quarter. On November 13, 2023, Otsuka filed a new drug application (NDA) for voclosporin for the treatment of\nlupus nephritis (LN) with the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare for the manufacture and sale in Japan of voclosporin.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 the Company recognized $6.0 million, $0.5 million and nil respectively, of additional\ncollaboration revenue from services provided under the agreement.\nRiptide License\nOn August 17, 2021, a license for AUR300 (M2 macrophage modulation via CD206 binding) was secured through a global licensing and research agreement with Riptide\nBioscience, Inc. (Riptide), a private company. As part of the agreement, in 2021 the Company paid Riptide an upfront license fee of $6.0 million, which was expensed as\nresearch and development on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. During the first quarter of 2022, Aurinia paid an additional $4.0 million to\nRiptide for the achievement of a onetime milestone, which was expensed as research and development on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nEffective February 14, 2024 the Company is ceasing future development of AUR300.\n11. Segment Information and Geographic Data\nAs the operations comprise a single reporting segment, amounts disclosed in the consolidated financial statements represent those of the single reporting unit. Aurinia elected to\ndisclose geographical revenue from customers based on geographical location of contracting entity (and where the related payment stream of the customer is located). The\nCompany currently has two main customers for U.S. commercial sales of LUPKYNIS which accounted in total of approximately5 1% and 40% and 45% and 35% of the\nCompany's total revenues for the year ending December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The company has a collaboration partnership with Otsuka for sales of\nsemi-finished product and license, royalty and collaboration revenue in Otsuka Territories. The percentage of total revenues, net from our main customers were as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\nU.S. main commercial customers 91% 80% 100%\nCollaboration partnership 8% 20% —%\nF-23\nRevenues by Geographic Location\nThe following geographic information reflects revenue, net of adjustments, based on customer location:\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nRevenue\nUnited States $ 157,958 $ 102,460 $ 45,488\nJapan 17,555 31,481 —\nOther — 89 117\nTotal $ 175,513 $ 134,030 $ 45,605\nLong-lived Assets by Location\nLong-lived assets by location consist of net property and equipment and right-of-use assets:\n(in thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nLong-lived assets, net\nSwitzerland $ 108,715 $ —\nUnited States 7,324 8,235\nCanada 528 322\nTotal $ 116,567 $ 8,557\nThe increase in Switzerland as of December 31, 2023 was due to the monoplant finance lease. For further discussion, refer to Note 15, \"Leases\".\n12. Income Taxes\nIncome (losses) before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows:\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nCanada $ (90,226) $ (112,359) $ (180,374)\nForeign 12,757 6,007 168\n$ (77,469) $ (106,352) $ (180,206)\nThe components of income tax expense consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nCurrent:\nCanada $ — $ — $ —\nForeign 551 1,828 760\n551 1,828 760\nDeferred:\nCanada — — —\nForeign — — —\nTotal deferred — — —\nIncome tax expense (benefit) $ 551 $ 1,828 $ 760\nF-24\nThe Company's parent entity is located in Canada and therefore the Canadian statutory rate is utilized. The provision for income taxes varied from the income taxes provided\nbased on the Canadian statutory rate of 24.6%, 26.7%, and 26.8% for the years ending December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in the statutory rate is a\nresult of the Company’s Canadian operations moving to primarily Alberta, which has a lower provincial rate. The Company's December 31, 2022 increase in tax expense is\nprimarily driven by withholding tax payments paid, and such decrease for December 31, 2023 is due to such withholding tax payments not recurring during the year.\n2023 2022 2021\nCanada statutory income tax benefit 24.6 % 26.7 % 26.8 %\nEffect of tax rates on foreign jurisdictions 0.6 0.3 —\nWithholding taxes (0.2) (1.1) —\nImpact of future rates and tax rate changes (15.6) (0.1) (0.1)\nForeign tax credit 0.2 1.1 —\nNon-deductible share-based compensation (13.8) (8.1) (4.5)\nState income taxes (0.9) (0.1) —\nChange in valuation allowance 3.1 (21.5) (21.8)\nScientific Research and Experimental Development (SRED) and Research Credits 1.3 1.1 0.3\nOther — — (1.1)\nEffective tax rate (0.7)% (1.7)% (0.4)%\nThe net deferred tax assets (liabilities) consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss carry-forwards $ 137,907 $ 141,020\nShare issue costs 2,325 4,209\nLease liability 23,837 1,860\nIntangible assets 1,479 1,400\nResearch credit carry-forwards 8,263 7,462\nCapitalized research and development — 1,663\nDeferred compensation 2,384 3,391\nAccruals 3,646 2,887\nOther 2,688 2,427\nGross deferred tax assets 182,529 166,319\nValuation allowance (161,898) (164,514)\nTotal deferred tax assets 20,631 1,805\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nRight-of-use asset (20,060) (1,128)\nProperty and equipment and intangible assets (571) (677)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (20,631) (1,805)\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ — $ —\nThe Company’s valuation allowance decreased by net $2.6 million in 2023 as compared to 2022 as a result of the decrease in the deferred blended tax rate applied to Canada\ndeferred tax balances offset by additional pre-tax losses which are not more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Company’s net deferred tax asset, including net operating loss carryforwards, are not more likely than not realizable as a result of the Company’s significant cumulative\npre-tax losses.\nF-25\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has $557.1 million of Canada gross net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and approximately $6.5 million of Canada Investment Tax\nCredits and British Columbia Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SRED) with an expiration period of 2029 through 2043. The Company also has\napproximately $4.1 million of U.S. federal gross NOL carryforwards that carryforward indefinitely, although limited to eighty percent of taxable income annually, and research\nand development tax credits of $0.1 million with an expiration of 2043. The Company’s ability to utilize the U.S. federal and state tax attribute carryforwards to offset any\ntaxable income or tax liability in certain taxable periods may be limited under Section 382/383 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nUncertain Income Tax Positions\nThe Company was under audit by the Comptroller of Maryland for years 2019 through 2021 and during the year was notified that the audit is now complete with no significant\nchanges. The Company is currently under examination by the Canadian Revenue Agency for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021. The Company is subject to examination in the\nU.S., UK and Canada. In the UK, tax periods remain open from 2021 through 2023. In the U.S. and Canada, tax periods remain open from 2020 through 2023 and 2009 through\n2023, respectively, due to the tax attribute carryforwards.\n13. Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company may, from time to time, be subject to claims and legal proceedings brought against it in the normal course of business. Such matters are subject to many\nuncertainties. Management believes the ultimate resolution of such contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nOn December 18, 2020, the Company commenced an action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc., Sun\nPharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., and Sun Pharma Global FZE (collectively, \"Sun\"). The action was a claim for patent infringement under the patent laws of the United States\narising from Sun's commercial manufacture, use, offer to sell, or sales within the United States, and/or importation into the United States of Sun's CEQUA product. In January\n2023, we announced a settlement of this action with Sun.\nOn February 24, 2022, Sun Pharmaceuticals Inc. petitioned for an IPR by the USPTO in respect of the '036 patent. The IPR was instituted on July 26, 2022. On January 25,\n2023, the USPTO announced that the inter partes review had been terminated, based on a Joint Motion for Termination filed by us and Sun Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nOn April 15, 2022, a purported shareholder class action complaint, Ortmann v. Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, Inc. et al., case no. 1:22-cv-02185, was filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New York (Eastern District of New York), naming us and certain of our officers as defendants. The lawsuit alleges that we made\nmaterially false and misleading statements regarding our financial guidance and commercial prospects in violation of certain federal securities laws. The plaintiff seeks\nunspecified monetary damages on behalf of the putative class and an award of costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. On June 2, 2022, the case was\ntransferred from the Eastern District of New York to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. On February 20, 2023, the Court appointed a lead plaintiff\nand approved lead plaintiff’s selection of lead counsel. On May 22, 2023, the lead plaintiff filed its amended complaint. On October 20, 2023, we filed a motion to dismiss the\namended complaint (the \"Motion to Dismiss\"). On December 8, 2023, the lead plaintiff filed its opposition to the Motion to Dismiss. On January 12, 2024, we filed our reply in\nsupport of the Motion to Dismiss. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against this action.\nManufacturing Commitments\nThe Company has various manufacturing agreements to support our commercial and clinical product supply requirements.\nWe rely on Lonza, a third party manufacturer, to produce a portion of commercial and clinical quantities of our commercial and clinical drug substance requirements. We have\nfirm orders with Lonza for future purchases of drug substance, with remaining total non-cancellable future commitments of approximately $11.0 million through 2024 of which\n$0.9 million was paid during 2023. If we terminate certain firm orders with Lonza without cause, we will be required to pay for drug substance scheduled for manufacture under\nour arrangement.\nF-26\n14. Deferred Compensation and Other Non-current Liabilities\nThe Company recorded other non-current liabilities of $10.9 million and $12.2 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The balance as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 primarily included deferred compensation arrangements whereby certain executive officers as of March 8, 2012 were provided with\nfuture potential employee benefit obligations for remaining with the Company, for a certain period of time. These obligations were also contingent on the occurrence of\nuncertain future events. One of the former officers, Dr. Robert T. Foster, is considered a related party following his appointment to the Board of Directors on September 21,\n2023. For further discussion, refer to Note 19, “Related Party”.\n15. Leases\nThe Company has the following lease obligations:\nVictoria, British Columbia\nIn December 2020, Aurinia entered into a lease for office space in Victoria, British Columbia. During September 2022, the fixed lease term ended on the Victoria lease and the\nCompany exercised its right to enter into a short-term month to month lease, of which expenses were incurred in SG&A. On March 31, 2023, the Company terminated the\nVictoria lease.\nRockville, Maryland\nDuring March 2020, the Company entered into a lease for its U.S. commercial office in Rockville, Maryland for a total of3 0,531 square feet of office space. The lease has a\nremaining term of approximately 8 years and has an option to extend for two five-year periods after the 11 years has elapsed and has an option to terminate afters even years.\nDuring 2020, the Company received lease incentives for tenant leasehold improvements by the landlord in the amount of $2.3 million for the Maryland lease. The Company\nrecorded the lease incentives as additions to the lease liability. The lease term commenced on March 12, 2020. When measuring the lease liability, the Company discounted\nlease payments using its incremental borrowing rate at March 12, 2020. The incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liability on March 12, 2020 was 5.2% based on the\nfinancial position of the Company, geographical region and term of lease. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had a right-of-use asset of $4.5 million and lease liability of\n$7.4 million included in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a right of use asset of $4.9 million and lease liability of $8.0 million\nincluded in the consolidated balance sheets.\nEdmonton, Alberta\nDuring October 2022, the Company entered into a long term lease in Edmonton for a total of4 ,375 square feet of office space. The lease is for a six year term and has an option\nto renew after five years at prevailing market rates. The lease commenced on November 1, 2022 and the Company recorded the lease as an operating lease. The lease is not\nmaterial to the Company's financial position.\nFor all operating leases, the Company incurs variable lease costs. These costs include operation and maintenance costs included in SG&A and are expensed as incurred. The\nvariable lease costs are not material to the Company's financial position.\nThe operating lease costs for the years ended December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were approximately $0.8 million, $1.0 million and $1.0 million,\nrespectively.\nMonoplant\nOn December 15, 2020, the Company entered into a collaborative agreement with Lonza to build a dedicated manufacturing facility within Lonza’s existing small molecule\nfacility in Visp, Switzerland. The dedicated facility (also referred to as \"monoplant\") is equipped with state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment to provide cost and production\nefficiency for the manufacturing of voclosporin, while expanding existing capacity and providing supply security to meet future commercial demand.\nF-27\nFollowing U.S. regulatory approval of LUPKYNIS in January 2021, the construction of the monoplant began. The Company has completed a capital expenditure payment\nprogram for the monoplant totaling approximately CHF 21.0 million. The first capital expenditure payment was made in February 2021 of $11.8 million (CHF 10.5 million) and\nwas treated as an upfront lease payment and recorded under other non-current assets on consolidated balance sheets. The second payment of $11.9 million (CHF 10.5 million)\nbecame due when the facility fulfilled the required operational qualifications, which occurred during the second quarter of 2023. The Company now has the exclusive right to\nuse the monoplant by paying a quarterly fixed facility fee.\nThe Company has determined that the monoplant arrangement will be accounted for as a finance lease under ASC 842. Under ASC 842, the lease term begins at the\ncommencement date and is based on the noncancellable period for which a lessee has the right to use an underlying asset. Aurinia determined that the lease commencement\noccurred at the point when the FDA manufacturing validation process began, which occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nThe Company, at lease inception, recorded an ROU asset of approximately $117.6 million and a corresponding lease liability of $94.1 million, which is the present value of the\nminimum lease payments beginning July 2023 and ending in 2030. The incremental borrowing rate applied to value the lease liability at inception is 6.19%, which was based on\nthe financial position of the Company, geographical region and term of lease.\nAs of December 31, 2023 the ROU asset, net and corresponding lease liability balance were $108.7 million and $90.1 million, respectively. For the year ending December 31,\n2023, ROU amortization related to the finance lease and interest expense was $8.9 million and $2.8 million, respectively. For the year ending December 31, 2023,\napproximately $5.9 million foreign exchange loss related to the revaluation of the monoplant finance lease liability was recorded in other expense (income) on the consolidated\nstatements of operations and comprehensive loss. The monoplant finance lease commenced in June 2023 and is denominated in CHF.\nThe following table represents the weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rates for the Company's leases for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022:\nAs of December 31, 2023 As of December 31, 2022\nWeighted Average Remaining Weighted Average Discount Weighted Average Remaining Weighted Average Discount\nLease Term (years) Rate Lease Term (years) Rate\nOperating leases 7.6 5.28% 8.7 5.3%\nFinance lease 6.3 6.19% — —\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases for the years ended December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are as follows:\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities\nFinancing cash flows from finance lease $ (10,025) $ — $ —\nOperating cash flows from finance leases $ (2,311) $ — $ —\nOperating cash flows from operating lease $ (1,080) $ (1,160) $ (646)\nInitial recognition of operating lease right-of-use asset $ — $ 57 $ 419\nSupplemental disclosure of noncash transactions\nFinance right-of-use asset obtained in exchange for lease obligations (monoplant) $ 117,622 $ — $ —\nFinance lease liability arising from obtaining right-of-use assets (monoplant) $ 94,140 $ — $ —\nF-28\nFuture maturities of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023 are as follows:\n(in thousands) Finance Lease Payments Operating Lease Payments\n2024 $ 17,240 $ 1,114\n2025 17,240 1,142\n2026 17,240 1,170\n2027 17,240 1,199\n2028 17,240 1,228\nThereafter 21,551 3,302\nTotal lease payments 107,751 9,155\nLess: imputed interest (17,663) (1,636)\nTotal $ 90,088 $ 7,519\nBeinheim\nThe Company has entered into an equipment and facility finance lease for a backup manufacturing encapsulation site in Beinheim, France that has not yet commenced and is\ntherefore, not included in the above table. As part of the agreement, the Company expects to make payments of approximately $1.0 million prior to lease commencement and\nthe future value of minimum lease payments will total approximately $0.1 million.\n16. Shareholders' Equity\nCommon shares: The Company has authorized an unlimited number of common shares with no par value. As of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,1 43.8 million, 142.3\nmillion and 141.6 million common shares, respectively, were issued and outstanding. Each common share entitles the holder too ne vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the\nCompany’s shareholders. Common shareholders are not entitled to receive dividends unless declared by the Company’s Board of Directors. Any future determination regarding\nthe declaration and payment of dividends is expected to be declared and paid in the Company's functional currency, the U.S. dollar.\nAs discussed below from time to time, we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of securities to fund our operations, which includes, but is not limited to, commercial\nactivities, inventory costs, R&D programs, FDA related post approval commitments and funding our working capital obligations.\nNovember 19, 2021 At-the-market (ATM) facility\nOn November 19, 2021 the Company entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. pursuant to which the Company may from time to time sell,\nthrough ATM offerings, common shares that would have an aggregate offering price of up to $250.0 million. Pursuant to this agreement the Company issued 10.2 million\ncommon shares at a weighted average price of $19.90 resulting in gross proceeds of $202.4 million as of December 31, 2021. The Company incurred share issue costs of\napproximately $5.6 million which included up to a 3% underwriting commission of $5.3 million and professional fees of $0.3 million directly related to the ATM.\nOn February 25, 2022, the Company gave notice to Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. to terminate the Open Market Sale Agreement. No further sales occurred under the Open Market\nSale Agreement.\nWarrants:\nWarrant related to December 28, 2016 bought deal public offering: On December 28, 2016, the Company completed a $28.8 million Bought Deal public offering (2016\nPublic Offering). Under the terms of the 2016 Public Offering, each Unit consisted of one common share and one-half (0.50) of a common share purchase warrant (December\n2016 Warrant). The Company issued 12.8 million Units at a subscription price per Unit of $2.25, exercisable for a period of five years from the date of issuance at an\nF-29\nexercise price of $3.00. These December 2016 Warrants also met the scope exceptions provided in ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, as they were indexed to the Company’s\nown shares, and therefore were accounted for under ASC 505, Equity.\nAt initial recognition on December 28, 2016, the Company recorded warrants in the amount of $7.2 million based on the estimated fair value of the December 2016 Warrants\nwith allocated share issuance costs of $655 thousand recognized as a reduction of equity.\nDuring 2019, certain holders of these Warrants exercised at $3.00 per share for gross proceeds of $5.5 million. During 2020, a holder exercised 500 Warrants at $3.00 per share\nfor gross proceeds of $2 thousand. During 2021, 1.7 million warrants had been exercised at $3.00 per share for gross proceeds of $0.3 million. Of these 1.7 million warrants, the\nCompany issued 1.3 million common shares in lieu of 1.6 million warrants. All gross proceeds were recorded as an increase in cash and equity. The remaining 6,000 warrants\nexpired as of December 31, 2021.\nThere was no warrant activity during 2023 and 2022 . The warrant activity for 2021 is as follows:\nNumber of warrants\n(in thousands)\nBalance at December 31, 2020 1,690\nWarrants exercised (1,684)\nWarrants expired (6)\nBalance at December 31, 2021 —\n17. Shared-Based Compensation\nThe Company's Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan), which was adopted and approved by the Company's shareholders in June 2021, allows for an issuance\nof up to an aggregate of 23.8 million shares (inclusive of then outstanding awards) and provides for grants of stock options, performance awards (PAs) and restricted stock units\n(RSUs) that may be settled in cash and common shares. Also in June 2021, the Company's shareholders adopted and approved the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n(2021 ESPP), which allows for the issuance of up to 2.5 million shares of which 419 thousand and 286 thousand were purchased during 2023 and 2022, respectively. The 2021\nESPP is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) but also permits the Company to include the\nemployees, including non-United States employees, in offerings not intended to qualify under Section 423. The purpose of the 2021 ESPP is to provide eligible employees with\nopportunities to purchase the Company’s common shares at a discounted price.\nDuring 2022, the Company modified the 2021 ESPP for the current and future offerings. The new ESPP terms shortened the plan fromf our (4) purchases over a 24 month\noffering period to two (2) purchases over a 12 month offering period. Additionally, the ESPP now contains a rollover mechanism; that is, if the stock price on the purchase date\nis less than the offering price (as that is determined under the 2021 ESPP), that offering is then canceled and any participants are rolled into the new 12 month offering period at\nthe lower price. As a result of the modification, we recorded incremental expense during 2022 which was immaterial to the consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive loss.\nIn addition to stock options, PAs and RSUs granted under the Plan, the Company has granted certain stock options and RSUs as inducements material to new employees\nentering into employment with the Company in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4). The inducements were granted outside of the Plan during 2023 and 2022.\nStock Options\nThe Plan requires the exercise price of each option not to be less than the closing market price of the Company’s common shares on the day immediately prior to the date of\ngrant. The board of directors approves the vesting criteria and periods at its discretion. The options issued under the plan are accounted for as equity-settled share-based\npayments. The stock options and inducement stock options have a ten-year term and vest over three years with one-third of the shares vesting on the twelve month anniversary\nfrom the grant date, and the remaining options vesting in twenty-four equal monthly installments thereafter.\nF-30\nThe following table summarizes the number of stock options outstanding under the Plan for the years ended December 31, 2023.\nWeighted-Average Aggregate Intrinsic\nNumber of Shares Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Value\n(in thousands) Exercise Price Life (in years) (in thousands)\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 13,295 $ 12.09 7.74 $ 21\nGranted 760 $ 9.53\nExercised/released (563) $ 5.50\nCancelled/forfeited (1,936) $ 16.08\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 11,556 $ 10.63 7.03 $ 7,967\nOptions exercisable, December 31, 2023 9,422 $ 11.73\nVested and expected to vest, December 31, 2023 11,379 $ 11.55\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $5.86, $6.52 and $7.34, respectively. The\ntotal fair value of options vested during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $40.9 million, $49.2 million and $24.9 million, respectively.\nTotal intrinsic value of options exercised was $2.0 million, $0.9 million and $50.3 million for years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIn determining the fair value of the options granted, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model and reviews the following assumptions each reporting period:\nExpected Term - Expected term (in years) is based upon the contractual term, taking into account expected employee exercise and expected post-vesting employment\ntermination behavior. Based on the Company's historical expected lives data during 2023 and 2022, the expected life remained constant. The length of the expected life in 2023\nis in line with historic data and what management expects in the future.\nVolatility - The Company considers historical volatility of its common shares in estimating its future stock price volatility. The expected life is used to determine market\nvolatility of the underlying stock. The change in the volatility in 2023 and 2022 was due to the Company's stock being more volatile. Given the growth of the Company, the\nexpected life used to determine previous market volatility and comparable peer group reflects an appropriate estimate of future volatility.\nRisk-free interest rate - The risk-free interest rate for the expected life of the options was based on the yield available on government benchmark bonds with an approximate\nequivalent remaining term at the time of the grant.\nDividend yield - The Company has never paid dividends on its common shares and has no plans to pay dividends on our common shares in the near future. Therefore, the\nCompany dividend yield is zero.\nThe following weighted average assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the options granted during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n2023 2022 2021\nExpected term (in years) 5 years 5 years 4 years\nVolatility 71 % 70 % 66 %\nRisk-free interest rate 3.99 % 2.06 % 0.46 %\nDividend yield 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 %\nF-31\nPerformance Awards and Restricted Stock Units\nThe Company has granted PAs and RSUs and intends to grant RSUs and PAs under the Plan, as well as inducements for certain new hires as discussed above. The RSUs and\nPAs are fair valued based on the market price of our common shares on the date of the grant. The RSUs and PAs and inducement RSUs and PAs shall vest in three equal annual\ninstallments on the first, second and third anniversary of the grant date.\nThe following table summarizes the PA and RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2023:\nNumber of Shares\n(in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value\nUnvested balance, December 31, 2022 1,980 $ 10.84\nGranted 6,827 $ 9.03\nVested (583) $ 11.57\nForfeited (417) $ 9.33\nUnvested balance, December 31, 2023 7,807 $ 9.29\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs and PAs granted during the years December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $9.03, $11.16 and $14.42, respectively. Total\nintrinsic value of RSUs and PAs vested and released was $5.4 million, $2.9 million and nil for years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCompensation Expense\nShare-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 totaled approximately $45.3 million, $32.3 million and $31.2 million, respectively,\nas shown in the table below.

Net Loss Per Common Share\nBasic and diluted net loss per Common Share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.T he numerator and denominator\nused in the calculation of basic and diluted net loss amounts per Common Share are as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\nNet loss for the year $ (78,020) $ (108,180) $ (180,966)\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding 143,236 141,915 129,369\nNet loss per common share (expressed in $ per share) $ (0.54) $ (0.76) $ (1.40)\nThe Company did not include the securities in the following table in the computation of the net loss per common share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive during\neach period:\n2023 2022 2021\nOutstanding stock options 11,556 13,295 12,074\nUnvested performance awards 921 — 64\nUnvested restricted units 6,886 1,980 191\n19,363 15,275 12,329\n19. Related Party\nILJIN SNT Co., Ltd (ILJIN) is considered to be a related party due to their equity ownership of over5 % as per their public filings. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, Aurinia paid\n$0.5 million, nil and $6.0 million, respectively, upon achievement of specific milestones. The amount payable to ILJIN is nil as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nOn September 21, 2023, the Company appointed Dr. Robert T. Foster to the Board of Directors. Dr. Foster is considered a related party since he is one of the former executive\nofficers of the Company who, as of March 8, 2012 was provided with future potential employee benefit obligations for remaining with the Company for a certain period of time.\nThese obligations are contingent on the occurrence of uncertain future events. Dr. Foster was not a related party of the Company between his resignation from the Company in\n2014, and his appointment to the Board of Directors on September 21, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $0.8 million and $7.6 million of current and\nnoncurrent liabilities related to Dr. Foster, respectively. From the time that Dr. Foster became a related party, the Company made a payment of $ 0.1 million to him for the\ndeferred compensation.\nF-33\n20.

Subsequent Events\nEffective February 14, 2024, the Board of Directors of Aurinia elected to conclude its strategic review process and to discontinue future development of AUR200 and AUR300\nresearch and development programs and prioritize resource allocation. This will result in a one-time charge in the first quarter of 2024 of approximately $11 - $15 million. The\ncharge will primarily be made up of severance costs, contract termination costs and other costs associated with terminating the programs. The Board also approved a share\nrepurchase program of up to $150 million worth of the Company's common shares (each, a “common share”) (the maximum value of which is subject to receipt of regulatory\napproval in Canada).\nF-34\nExhibit 21.1\nLIST OF SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following is a list of subsidiaries of Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc. as of December 31, 2023.\nSubsidiary State or Other Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Organization\nAurinia Pharma U.S., Inc.

Introduction\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc., an Alberta corporation (the “Company”), has determined that it is in the\nbest interests of the Company and its shareholders to adopt this Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy (this “Policy”) providing for the\nCompany’s recoupment of Recoverable Incentive Compensation that is received by Covered Officers of the Company under certain circumstances.\nCertain capitalized terms used in this Policy have the meanings given to such terms in Section 3 below.\nThis Policy is designed to comply with, and shall be interpreted to be consistent with, Section 10D of the Exchange Act, Rule 10D-1\npromulgated thereunder (“Rule 10D-1”) and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5608 (the “Listing Standards”).\n2. Effective Date\nThis Policy shall apply to all Incentive Compensation that is received by a Covered Officer on or after October 2, 2023 (the “Effective Date”).\nIncentive Compensation is deemed “received” in the Company’s fiscal period in which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive\nCompensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of such Incentive Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\n3. Definitions\n“Accounting Restatement” means an accounting restatement that the Company is required to prepare due to the material noncompliance of the\nCompany with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in\npreviously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the\nerror were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period.\n“Accounting Restatement Date” means the earlier to occur of (a) the date that the Board, a committee of the Board authorized to take such\naction, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have\nconcluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, or (b) the date that a court, regulator or other legally authorized body\ndirects the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\n“Administrator” means the Compensation Committee or, in the absence of such committee, the\nBoard.\n“Code” means the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations\npromulgated thereunder.\n“Compensation Committee” means the Compensation Committee of the Board. “Covered Officer” means each current and\nformer Executive Officer. “Exchange” means the Nasdaq Stock Market.\n“Exchange Act” means the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n“Executive Officer” means the Company’s president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting\nofficer, the controller), any vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or\nfinance), any other officer who performs a policy-making function, or any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the\nCompany. Executive officers of the Company’s parent(s) or subsidiaries are deemed executive officers of the Company if they perform such policy-\nmaking functions\nfor the Company. Policy-making function is not intended to include policy-making functions that are not significant. Identification of an executive\nofficer for purposes of this Policy would include at a minimum executive officers identified pursuant to Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K promulgated\nunder the Exchange Act.\n“Financial Reporting Measures” means measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in\npreparing the Company’s financial statements, and any measures derived wholly or in part from such measures, including Company stock price and total\nshareholder return (“TSR”). A measure need not be presented in the Company’s financial statements or included in a filing with the SEC in order to be a\nFinancial Reporting Measure.\n“Incentive Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial\nReporting Measure.\n“Lookback Period” means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Accounting Restatement Date, as well as any transition\nperiod (resulting from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years (except that a\ntransition period of at least nine months shall count as a completed fiscal year). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lookback Period shall not include\nfiscal years completed prior to the Effective Date.\n“Recoverable Incentive Compensation” means Incentive Compensation received by a Covered Officer during the Lookback Period that\nexceeds the amount of Incentive Compensation that would have been received had such amount been determined based on the Accounting Restatement,\ncomputed without regard to any taxes paid (i.e., on a gross basis without regard to tax withholdings and other deductions). For any compensation plans\nor programs that take into account Incentive Compensation, the amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation for purposes of this Policy shall\ninclude, without limitation, the amount contributed to any notional account based on Recoverable Incentive Compensation and any earnings to date on\nthat notional amount. For any Incentive Compensation that is based on stock price or TSR, where the Recoverable Incentive Compensation is not\nsubject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement, the Administrator will determine the amount of\nRecoverable Incentive Compensation based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or TSR upon which\nthe Incentive Compensation was received. The Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide\nsuch documentation to the Exchange in accordance with the Listing Standards.\n“SEC” means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n4. RECOUPMENT\n(a) Applicability of Policy. This Policy applies to Incentive Compensation received by a Covered Officer (i) after beginning services as an\nExecutive Officer, (ii) who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for such Incentive Compensation, (iii) while the\nCompany had a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association, and (iv) during the Lookback Period.\n(b) Recoupment Generally. To the extent permitted by applicable law, pursuant to the provisions of this Policy, if there is an Accounting\nRestatement, the Company must reasonably promptly recoup the full amount of the Recoverable Incentive Compensation, unless the conditions of one\nor more subsections of Section 4(c) of this Policy are met and the Compensation Committee, or, if such committee does not consist solely of\nindependent directors, a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board, has made a determination that recoupment would be impracticable.\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, recoupment is required regardless of whether the Covered Officer engaged in any misconduct and regardless\nof fault, and the Company’s obligation to recoup Recoverable Incentive Compensation is not dependent on whether or when any restated financial\nstatements are filed.\n(c) Impracticability of Recovery. Recoupment may be determined to be impracticable if, and\nonly if:\n(i) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount of the applicable Recoverable\nIncentive Compensation; provided that, before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Recoverable Incentive\nCompensation based on expense of enforcement, the Company shall make a reasonable attempt to recover such Recoverable Incentive\nCompensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to the Exchange in accordance with the Listing\nStandards;\n(ii) recoupment of the applicable Recoverable Incentive Compensation would violate home country law where that law was adopted\nprior to November 28, 2022; provided that, before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Recoverable Incentive\nCompensation based on violation of home country law, the Company shall obtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the\nExchange, that recoupment would result in such a violation, and shall provide such opinion to the Exchange in accordance with the Listing\nStandards; or\n(iii) recoupment of the applicable Recoverable Incentive Compensation would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan,\nunder which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(13) or Code\nSection 411(a) and regulations thereunder.\n(d) Sources of Recoupment. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Administrator shall, in its sole discretion, determine the timing\nand method for recouping Recoverable Incentive Compensation hereunder, provided that such recoupment is undertaken reasonably promptly. Subject\nto compliance with any applicable law, the Administrator may, in its discretion, seek recoupment from a Covered Officer from any of the following\nsources or a combination thereof, whether the applicable compensation was approved, awarded, granted, payable or paid to the Covered Officer prior to,\non or after the Effective Date: (i) direct repayment of Recoverable Incentive Compensation previously paid to the Covered Officer; (ii) cancelling prior\ncash or equity-based awards (whether vested or unvested and whether paid or unpaid); (iii) cancelling or offsetting against any planned future cash or\nequity-based awards; (iv) forfeiture of deferred compensation, subject to compliance with Code Section 409A; and (v) any other method authorized by\napplicable law or contract. Subject to compliance with any applicable law, the Administrator may effectuate recoupment under this Policy from any\namount otherwise payable to the Covered Officer, including amounts payable to such individual under any otherwise applicable Company plan or\nprogram, e.g., base salary, bonuses or commissions and compensation previously deferred by the Covered Officer. The Administrator need not utilize\nthe same method of recovery for all Covered Officers or with respect to all types of Recoverable Incentive Compensation.\n(e) No Indemnification of Covered Officers. Notwithstanding any indemnification agreement, applicable insurance policy or any other\nagreement or provision of the Company’s certificate\nof incorporation or bylaws to the contrary, no Covered Officer shall be entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses in connection with any\nenforcement of this Policy by the Company, including paying or reimbursing such Covered Officer for insurance premiums to cover potential\nobligations to the Company under this Policy.\n(f) Indemnification of Administrator. Any members of the Administrator, and any other members of the Board who assist in the\nadministration of this Policy, shall not be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation made with respect to this Policy and shall be\nindemnified by the Company to the fullest extent under applicable law and Company policy with respect to any such action, determination or\ninterpretation. The foregoing sentence shall not limit any other rights to indemnification of the members of the Board under applicable law or Company\npolicy.\n(g) No “Good Reason” for Covered Officers. Any action by the Company to recoup or any recoupment of Recoverable Incentive\nCompensation under this Policy from a Covered Officer shall not be deemed (i) “good reason” for resignation or to serve as a basis for a claim of\nconstructive termination under any benefits or compensation arrangement applicable to such Covered Officer, or (ii) to constitute a breach of a contract\nor other arrangement to which such Covered Officer is party.\n5. Administration\nExcept as specifically set forth herein, this Policy shall be administered by the Administrator. The Administrator shall have full and final\nauthority to make any and all determinations required under this Policy. Any determination by the Administrator with respect to this Policy shall be\nfinal, conclusive and binding on all interested parties and need not be uniform with respect to each individual covered by this Policy. In carrying out the\nadministration of this Policy, the Administrator is authorized and directed to consult with the full Board or such other committees of the Board as may\nbe necessary or appropriate as to matters within the scope of such other committee’s responsibility and authority. Subject to applicable law, the\nAdministrator may authorize and empower any officer or employee of the Company to take any and all actions that the Administrator, in its sole\ndiscretion, deems necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose and intent of this Policy (other than with respect to any recovery under this Policy\ninvolving such officer or employee).\n6. Severability\nIf any provision of this Policy or the application of any such provision to a Covered Officer shall be adjudicated to be invalid, illegal or\nunenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Policy, and the invalid, illegal or\nunenforceable provisions shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to render any such provision or application enforceable.\n7. No Impairment of Other Remedies\nNothing contained in this Policy, and no recoupment or recovery as contemplated herein, shall limit any claims, damages or other legal\nremedies the Company or any of its affiliates may have against a Covered Officer arising out of or resulting from any actions or omissions by the\nCovered Officer. This Policy does not preclude the Company from taking any other action to enforce a Covered Officer’s obligations to the Company,\nincluding, without limitation, termination of employment and/or institution of civil proceedings. This Policy is in addition to the requirements of Section\n304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX 304”) that are applicable to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and to\nany other compensation recoupment policy and/or similar provisions in any employment, equity plan, equity award, or other individual agreement, to\nwhich the Company is a party or which the Company has adopted or may adopt and maintain from time to time; provided, however, that compensation\nrecouped pursuant to this Policy shall not be duplicative of compensation recouped pursuant to SOX 304 or any such compensation recoupment policy\nand/or similar provisions in any such employment, equity plan, equity award, or other individual agreement except as may be required by law.\n8. Amendment; Termination\nThe Administrator may amend, terminate or replace this Policy or any portion of this Policy at any time and from time to time in its sole\ndiscretion. The Administrator shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to comply with applicable law or any Listing Standard.\n9. Successors\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Officers and, to the extent required by Rule 10D-1 and/or the applicable\nListing Standards, their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.\n10. Required Filings\nThe Company shall make any disclosures and filings with respect to this Policy that are required by law, including as required by the SEC.\nAurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nIncentive Compensation Recoupment Policy\nForm of Executive Acknowledgment\nI, the undersigned, agree and acknowledge that I am bound by, and subject to, the Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc.

These forward-looking statements or information include but are not limited to statements or information with respect\nto:Aurinia’s 2024forecast of $210m-$220m in net product revenue; the estimated patient population for lupus nephritis; the results of Aurinia’s clinical trials;Aurinia’s commercialization\nstrategy; the duration of Aurinia’s patent portfolio; andAurinia’s estimated timelines for clinical studies, including for the ENLIGHT-LN registry study and AUR200 SAD study. It is possible that\nsuch results or conclusions may change based on further analyses of these data. Words such as “anticipate,” “will,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “target,\" “plan,\" “goals,\" “objectives,\"\n“may” and other similar words and expressions, identify forward-looking statements.\nWe have made numerous assumptions about the forward-looking statements and information contained herein, including among other things, assumptions about the patient population for\nLN;the number of patients on LUPKYNIS therapy; the adherence to and persistency of treatment of LN patients; the average dosing per patient; the average annualized net revenue per\npatient;that another company will not create a substantial competitive product for Aurinia’s LN business without violatingAurinia’sintellectual property rights; the size of the LN market; the\naccuracy of results from our clinical trials; the accuracy of reported data from third party studies and reports; our ability to conduct preclinical studies on anticipated timelines;\nthat Aurinia’s intellectualproperty rights are valid and do not infringe the intellectual property rights of other parties; that regulatory bodies will not unduly delay or condition jurisdictional, pricing\nor reimbursementapprovals; and that our suppliers and contractors will meet their contracted requirements. Even though the management ofAuriniabelieves that the assumptions made, and\nthe expectationsrepresented by such statements or information are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking information will prove to be accurate.\nForward-looking information by their nature are based on assumptions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results,\nperformance or achievements of Auriniato be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking information. Should one or\nmore of these risks and uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in forward-looking statements or\ninformation.Such risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others, the following: difficulties we may experience in completing the commercialization of LUKYNIS; the market and\npatientpopulation for the LN business may not be as estimated; Auriniamay have to pay unanticipated expenses; Aurinianot being able to extend or fully protect its patent portfolio for\nLUPKYNIS;competitors may arise with similar products; Auriniamay not be able to obtain sufficient supply to meet commercial demand for LUPKYNIS in a timely fashion; unknown impact and\ndifficultiesimposed by widespread health concerns, on our business operations including clinical, regulatory and commercial activities; the results from our clinical studies and from third party\nstudies and reports may not be accurate; and our assets or business activities may be subject to disputes that may result in litigation or other legal claims. Although we have attempted to\nidentify factorsthat would cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-lookingstatements and information, there may be other factors that cause\nactual results, performances, achievements or events to not be as anticipated, estimated or intended. Also, many of the factors are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that forward-\nlookingstatements or information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, you should not\nplace unduereliance on forward-looking statements or information. Except as required by law,Auriniawill not update forward-looking information.\nAll forward-looking information contained in this presentation is qualified by this cautionary statement.
