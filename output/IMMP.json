This promising data in INSIGHT-003 suggests a complementary effect from the addition of efti, a unique MHC Class II agonist, to the standard-of-care combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy which has revolutionised the treatment landscape in lung cancer. The IKF will also support and is looking forward to participating in the upcoming TACTI-004 study, which has PFS and OS as dual primary endpoints.”\n\n**Key Results -** **Data cutoff - 15 October 2024** The survival data from the triple combination therapy in patients irrespective of PD-L1 expression with a minimum follow-up of 22 months (N=21) at data cut-off shows:\n\nINSIGHT-003 Results  \n---  \nMedian Overall Survival (OS) | 32.9 months  \nMedian Progression-Free Survival (PFS) | 12.7 months  \n24-month Overall Survival (OS) | 81.0%  \n  \nThese results compare favourably to the 22.0-month median OS, 9.0-month median PFS, and 24-month OS rate of 45.5% from a registrational trial of anti-PD-1 and doublet chemotherapy in non-squamous 1L NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression.1 Notably, ~19% of the 21 patients in INSIGHT-003 with mature survival data have high PD-L1 expression, who typically respond better to anti-PD-1 therapy, versus ~32% in the registrational trial of anti-PD-1 and doublet chemotherapy.\n\n**Marc Voigt, CEO of Immutep, stated** , “The overall survival and progression-free survival data from this mature cohort of patients in INSIGHT-003 with nearly a 2-year minimum follow-up exceeds our expectations. We are encouraged to see efti build upon the historical clinical outcomes from the most widely used immunotherapy-chemo combination today. Additionally, the early evaluations in the expansion cohort of 19 patients, who all have low or negative PD-L1 expression, are tracking well and we look forward to additional data updates from the INSIGHT-003 trial in 2025 and beyond. Our focus on potentially driving a new standard of care globally in first line treatment of NSCLC is boosted by these results and we are well advanced in our preparations to initiate the TACTI-004 Phase III trial.”\n\nData from all evaluable patients to date (N=40) demonstrates significant improvement of Overall Response Rate (ORR) according to RECIST 1.1 across all levels of PD-L1 expression compared to historical control2:\n\n  * 75.0% ORR versus 62.1% ORR in patients with high PD-L1 expression (TPS >50%)\n  * 58.8% ORR versus 49.2% ORR in patients with low PD-L1 expression (TPS 1-49%)\n  * 47.4% ORR versus 32.3% ORR in patients with negative PD-L1 expression (TPS <1%)\n\n\n\nIn this all-comer PD-L1 trial, the 55.0% ORR and 87.5% Disease Control Rate (DCR) are from the following breakdown of patients by PD-L1 expression: TPS _>_ 50% (N=4), TPS 1-49% (N=17), and TPS <1% (N=19). As compared to the general 1L NSCLC patient population of which each of these PD-L1 levels represents roughly one-third, INSIGHT-003 is biased towards low and negative PD-L1 (TPS <50%) patients who are typically less responsive to anti-PD-1 therapy.\n\nIn these patients with low and negative PD-L1 expression (36 of 40 patients), the triple combination achieved a 52.8% ORR and 86.1% DCR. Of note, all 19 patients in the expansion cohort have TPS <50% and several with stable disease have potential to become responders.\n\n**Safety** Safety continues to be favourable for efti in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, with no new safety signals.\n\n**Next Steps** INSIGHT-003, a multi-centre study led by the Frankfurt Institute of Clinical Cancer Research IKF, is nearing completion of patient enrolment. Additional data updates from this trial are expected in 2025 and beyond.\n\n**About INSIGHT-003** INSIGHT-003 is an investigator-initiated, multi-centre study led by the [Frankfurt Institute of Clinical Cancer Research (IKF)](https://klinische-krebsforschung.de/). It is being run as the third arm (Stratum C) of the ongoing Phase I INSIGHT trial with Prof. Dr. Salah-Eddin Al-Batran as lead investigator. The study is evaluating a triple combination therapy in front line non-small cell lung cancer patients consisting of efti administered subcutaneously in conjunction with an existing approved standard-of-care combination of anti-PD-1 therapy (pembrolizumab) and doublet chemotherapy (carboplatin and pemetrexed) delivered intravenously. The trial will assess the safety, tolerability, and initial efficacy of the combination.\n\n**About Immutep** Immutep is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel LAG-3 immunotherapy for cancer and autoimmune disease.

Based on preliminary analysis among 21 patients available for primary endpoint assessment, the triple combination therapy demonstrates significant efficacy in the neoadjuvant setting for resectable STS.\n\nKatarzyna Kozak, M.D., Ph.D., and Paweł Sobczuk, M.D., Ph.D., medical oncologists at the Department of Soft Tissue/Bone Sarcoma and Melanoma at MSCNRIO (Warsaw) and the trial’s principal investigators, stated: “Our belief in efti’s unique mechanism of action to complement radiotherapy and pembrolizumab in order drive better outcomes for patients with this rare aggressive disease was the foundation of the EFTISARC-NEO trial. These very encouraging results we are presenting today build our confidence in the synergistic effects of this new therapeutic approach and its potential to treat these patients in dire need of more effective therapies. In particular, the high level of hyalinization/fibrosis achieved with this novel combination therapy, three-times above historical results from standard radiotherapy, demonstrates remarkable efficacy in patients with resectable soft tissue sarcomas.”\n\nIn the neoadjuvant setting for patients with resectable STS, the combination achieved a greater than three-fold increase in tumour hyalinization/fibrosis (median 50%) at the time of surgical resection as compared to a historical median 15% from standard radiotherapy alone. In addition to being the primary endpoint of the EFTISARC-NEO study, the tumour hyalinization/fibrosis rate has also been identified as an important predictor of overall survival for STS patients.1,2\n\nThe EFTISARC-NEO trial, with a data cut-off of 20 October 2024, also showed 71.4% of patients achieved a pathologic response defined as ≥35% of hyalinization/fibrosis and 9.5% of patients achieved a complete pathologic response. The triple combination therapy is safe with no grade ≥3 toxicities related to efti and pembrolizumab.\n\nDr. Frédéric Triebel, CSO of Immutep, said: “We are pleased with the strength of these preliminary results in this difficult-to-treat cancer. To see 71.4% of soft tissue sarcoma patients achieving a pathologic response defined as ≥35% of hyalinization/fibrosis combined with low viable tumour cells at 8% is very promising, especially as strong efficacy has been observed in different STS subtypes. We look forward to further evaluation of efti’s potential as neoadjuvant immunotherapy to help drive improved clinical outcomes.”\n\nThe ongoing open-label EFTISARC-NEO Phase II study, conducted by the Maria Skłodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology (MSCNRIO) in Warsaw, is expected to reach the planned enrolment of 40 patients in Q1 CY2025. The trial is primarily funded with an approved grant from the Polish government awarded by the Polish Medical Research Agency program.

The study will enrol ~750 patients regardless of PD-L1 expression in order to address the entire 1L NSCLC market eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy.\n\n**TACTI-003 (KEYNOTE-C34) – Phase IIb clinical trial in 1L HNSCC** TACTI-003 is evaluating efti in combination with MSD’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) as first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients (1L HNSCC). The randomized Cohort A portion of the study is evaluating efti in combination with KEYTRUDA as compared to KEYTRUDA monotherapy in patients with PD-L1 positive (Combined Positive Score [CPS] ≥1) tumours, whereas Cohort B is evaluating efti in combination with KEYTRUDA in patients with PD-L1 negative tumours (CPS <1).\n\nIn July, Immutep reported updated positive efficacy and safety results from Cohort B of the TACTI-003 Phase IIb trial at an ESMO Virtual Plenary session. In patients with negative PD-L1 expression (CPS <1) in Cohort B, efti in combination with KEYTRUDA® achieved a 35.5% objective response rate (ORR). This is among the highest recorded for a treatment approach not containing chemotherapy in patients with CPS <1. The immuno-oncology combination with efti also attained a high complete response rate of 9.7%, which compares favourably to a historical control of 0% from anti-PD-1 monotherapy in 1L HNSCC patients with a CPS <1. Additionally, durability of responses was tracking well.\n\nIn September, further data was reported from Cohort A of the TACTI-003 trial in a late-breaking abstract and prestigious Proffered Paper oral presentation at ESMO Congress 2024. At ESMO, late-breaking abstracts are generally reserved for high-quality, new research findings from randomised phase II or phase III trials with implications for clinical practice or understanding of disease processes. Proffered Papers are oral presentations of original data of superior quality, followed by expert discussion and perspectives.\n\nIn patients with PD-L1 positive tumours (CPS ≥1), efti in combination with KEYTRUDA outperformance was largest in CPS ≥20 with 31.0% ORR (34.5% ORR including a partial response recorded after data cut-off date) versus 18.5% ORR for KEYTRUDA monotherapy. Efti in combination with KEYTRUDA led to a high durability of response of 17.5 months in patients with CPS ≥1 and the combination continues to have favourable safety profile. Additionally, a statistically significant increase in absolute lymphocyte count, measured as an exploratory biomarker, was seen in the efti with KEYTRUDA arm indicating an effective efti-induced immune response in this randomised setting.\n\nImmutep will continue to follow the maturing data from TACTI-003, with the most relevant endpoint of Overall Survival expected in 2025 and engage with regulatory authorities regarding potential paths forward.\n\n**TACTI-002 (KEYNOTE-PN798) – Phase II clinical trial in 1L NSCLC** Immutep continues to follow patients with first-line non-small cell lung cancer (1L NSCLC), in Part A of the TACTI-002 trial, where excellent median Overall Survival (mOS) rates were seen across all levels of PD-L1 expression. Immutep has previously reported final data from the other parts of the TACTI-002 trial.\n\n**AIPAC-003 – Integrated Phase II/III trial in MBC** Subsequent to quarter end, Immutep completed patient enrolment in the randomised Phase II portion of the AIPAC-003 trial in October. The Phase II portion enrolled 65 metastatic hormone receptor positive (HR+), HER2-negative/low or triple-negative breast cancer patients who had exhausted endocrine therapy including cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors. The patients have been enrolled across 22 clinical sites in Europe and the United States and have been randomised 1:1 to receive either 30mg or 90mg dosing of efti in combination with paclitaxel to determine the optimal biological dose of efti consistent with the FDA’s Project Optimus initiative. Further updates will be provided after data collection, data cleaning and analysis.\n\n**INSIGHT-003 – Phase I in non-squamous 1L NSCLC** The investigator-initiated INSIGHT-003 trial continued to enrol patients throughout the quarter and they have been safely dosed across six sites in Germany. Further updates from the trial are anticipated in Q 4 CY2024.\n\n**INSIGHT-005 – Phase I trial in Urothelial Carcinoma** The INSIGHT-005 trial is evaluating efti and the anti-PD-L1 therapy BAVENCIO® (avelumab) in up to 30 patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. The study is jointly funded with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.\n\n**EFTISARC-NEO – Phase II Trial in Soft Tissue Sarcoma** New data from the EFTISARC-NEO Phase II investigator-initiated trial of efti in combination with radiotherapy plus KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) for patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS) will be presented on 14 November at the Connective Tissue Oncology Society (CTOS) 2024 Annual Meeting taking place in San Diego, California.\n\n**IMP761 DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE** In August, Immutep successfully dosed the first participant in the first-in human Phase I trial of IMP761 after receiving regulatory clearance from the ethics and competent authority in the Netherlands to initiate the study. Safety data from this first-in-human study is anticipated by the end of the calendar year 2024, with pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data in first half CY2025.\n\nIMP761 is a first-in-class agonist LAG-3 antibody designed to restore balance to the immune system by enhancing the “brake” function of LAG-3 to silence dysregulated self-antigen-specific memory T cells that cause many autoimmune diseases.\n\n**INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY** During the quarter, Immutep was granted seven new patents for efti, IMP761 and LAG525 (ieramilimab) in various territories.\n\nTwo patents were granted for efti in combination with a PD-1 pathway inhibitor in South Korea and Brazil and one patent was granted in Mexico for a binding assay for determining MHC Class II binding activity. The assay is used in the characterisation of efti in GMP-grade manufacturing.\n\nNew patents were also granted for IMP761 in India and Israel. For LAG525, which is exclusively licensed to Novartis by Immutep, two new patents were granted in Australia and Taiwan.\n\n**CORPORATE & FINANCIAL SUMMARY**\n\n**Immutep enters the ASX300** Following the September quarterly review of the S&P Dow Jones Indices, Immutep was added to the S&P/ASX 300 index. Joining the ASX300 recognises the Company's considerable growth over the years, enhances its market visibility and supports investor confidence.\n\n**Cash Flow Summary** During the quarter, Immutep continued to advance its clinical trial programs for efti and preclinical program for IMP761 to create value for shareholders. The Company is well funded with a strong cash and cash equivalent balance as at 30 September 2024 of approximately A$120.3 million. In addition to this cash balance, Immutep has an A$52.0 million bank term deposit, which has been recognised as a short-term investment due to the maturity date of 5-12 months. This aggregate position of A$172.3 million as at 30 September 2024 gives Immutep an expected cash reach to the end of CY2026.\n\nCash receipts from customers in Q1 FY25 were $20k. During the quarter, Immutep received a €2,194,918 (~A$3,602,362) research and development (R&D) tax incentive payment in cash from the French Government under its Crédit d’Impôt Recherche scheme and $549k from the Australian government R&D tax rebate.\n\nThe net cash used in G&A activities in the quarter was $961k, compared to $1.9 million in Q4 FY24. Payments to Related Parties comprises Non-Executive Directors’ fees and Executive Directors’ remuneration of $576 k.\n\nThe net cash used in R&D activities during the quarter was $9.5 million, compared to $3.8 million to Q4 FY24. The increase is mainly due to the increased level of clinical trial activities. Payment for staff costs was $2.8 million in the quarter compared to $2.0 million in Q4 FY24.\n\nTotal net cash outflows used in operating activities in the quarter were $8.6 million compared to $7.4 million in Q4 FY24.\n\nFor the cash flow used in investing activities, the company invested $32.4 million in bank term deposits with maturity between 5 and 6 months which has been recognised as a short-term investment.\n\nNet cash outflow from financing activities for the quarter was approximately $373 k including $254k for the payment of capital raising cost.\n\n**About Immutep** Immutep is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel LAG-3 immunotherapy for cancer and autoimmune disease.

Our journey to this\npoint has been led by our lead clinical candidate eftilagimod alpha’s (efti) ability to safely enhance clinical\noutcomes and expand the number of patients who respond\n“The potential for efti in combination\nto standard-of-care therapies, including anti-PD-1 therapy,\nwith KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy is to\nchemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The selection of 1L NSCLC\nset a new standard-of-care 1L NSCLC. We\nas our focus indication was driven by compelling clinical\nare confident in efti’s ability to strengthen\nresults achieved with efti, coupled with the large market\nclinical outcomes and expand the number\nopportunity and high unmet need for more durable\nof patients who respond to the world’s\noptions. The data that has emerged in our lung cancer trials\ntop selling drug.”\nsince has only increased our confidence in this decision.\nWe are now in the fortunate position to have efti being evaluated in combination with the top selling drug\nin the world (KEYTRUDA®) targeting one of the largest indications in oncology, 1L NSCLC, in a Phase III. This\nis due to our third and most important collaboration with MSD (Merck & Co) signed in June 2024. With an\nestimated ~35% of KEYTRUDA’s $28 billion in trailing twelve-month sales1 from lung cancer (predominantly\n1L NSCLC), a successful outcome in the upcoming TACTI-004 (Two ACTIve Immunotherapies) trial would\npresent a blockbuster opportunity for efti. Importantly, unlike many new drugs that must establish\nthemselves in markets, efti will be uniquely positioned as an “add-on” to KEYTRUDA in combination with\nchemotherapy, the leading standard-of-care treatment in 1L NSCLC today.\nAmong the topics this update will cover are Immutep’s favourable positioning as a Phase III company in\none of the largest markets in oncology and the pivotal TACTI-004 trial designed in collaboration with MSD.\nThe design of TACTI-004 sets the foundation for efti in combination with KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy to\npotentially establish a new standard-of-care for almost all 1L NSCLC patients eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy.\nBefore moving on, I would like to thank all our shareholders for their support. We are in a strong financial\nposition with cash runway to the end of CY2026 to reach multiple catalysts and milestones to create\nshareholder value as we strive to make a positive difference in the lives of cancer patients globally.\nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Over 2 Million Cases Annually and Growing; High Unmet Need\nLung cancer is the leading cause of death among all cancer types and the Estimated new cases of\nlung cancer: 2022 to 2030\nincidence is set to increase to approximately 3 million cases worldwide by\n2,480,675 3,022,602\n20302. NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer representing ~80-85%\nof all diagnoses.3 While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) like anti-PD-1\ntherapy have revolutionised treatment of 1L NSCLC, only ~20% of patients\nrespond to ICIs alone driving substantial research in combination therapies to Source: Int’l Agency for Research on Cancer – WHO\n1\ngenerate better response rates and clinical outcomes. The condition is often diagnosed at a late stage4, and\nless than 30% of patients are alive five years after diagnosis5. Given these facts, there remains a high unmet\nneed for additional treatment options for people living with NSCLC.\nStandard-of-Care KEYTRUDA and its Dominant Market Share in Metastatic Lung Cancer\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have\nICI Sales in 2023 (in US$ Billions)\nrevolutionised the treatment landscape for\nmany cancer types. As shown in the graphic, the 40\nmost widely used ICIs are anti-PD-1 therapies6,\n30\nwhich also have the highest estimated growth\nrate in the years ahead. Among these PD-1 20\ninhibitors KEYTRUDA is dominant, capturing\n10\n~71% of the roughly $35 billion of anti-PD-1\ntherapeutics sold in 2023.\n0\nToday, KEYTRUDA has approvals in over 40 CTLA-4 PD-L1 PD-1\ncancer indications7 and the most significant is Source: Bloomberg and company reports\nlung cancer. It represented an estimated $9 billion of KEYTRUDA’s $25 billion in sales during 20238. To put\nKEYTRUDA’s dominance in lung cancer into perspective, MSD captures between 7 to 8 of every 10\nmetastatic lung cancer patients today9.\nWith this said, the sheer size of the 1L NSCLC market is such that multiple ICI-based approaches are\nsuccessful commercially. Estimates have the total addressable NSCLC drug market rising to US$48 billion\nin sales in 2031 and ICIs generating over half those sales10. Which ICIs have approvals as monotherapy or\nin combination to treat lung cancer are often based on PD-L1 expression as measured by tumour\nproportion score (TPS). This FDA-approved biomarker for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in metastatic 1L NSCLC\nstratifies patients into three key PD-L1 levels: high (TPS ≥50%), low (TPS 1-49%), and negative (TPS <1%).\nEach of these PD-L1 levels represents approximately one-third of the total 1L NSCLC patient population,\nmaking one segment just as valuable as the others. Another stratification factor for ICI therapy is whether\na patient has non-squamous (NSQ) or squamous (SQ) cancer types, representing roughly 70% and 30% of\n1L NSCLC cases, respectively.\nThe table below shows the regulatory approvals for ICIs in the US and EU for the treatment of 1L NSCLC\neither as monotherapy or in combination with another immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy11:\nHigh PD-L1 (TPS >50%) Low PD-L1 (TPS 1-49%) Negative PD-L1 (TPS<1%)\n1L NSCLC ICI Therapies\nUS EU US EU US EU\nNon-Squamous/Squamous (NSQ/SQ) NSQ SQ NSQ SQ NSQ SQ NSQ SQ NSQ SQ NSQ SQ\nKEYTRUDA + Chemo\nOPDIVO + Yervoy + Chemo\nLIBTAYO + Chemo\nOPDIVO + Yervoy\nKEYTRUDA Monotherapy\nLIBTAYO Monotherapy\nTECENTRIQ Monotherapy\nTECENTRIQ + Bev + Chemo\nThe largest commercial market opportunity in 1L NSCLC captures all patients regardless of PD-L1\nexpression (TPS 0-100%) as well as both NSQ and SQ cancer types, and it is this patient population that\nKEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy is most often chosen by physicians today.\n2\nTACTI-004 is designed to target this exact same large patient population and based on the efficacy and\nsafety results achieved to date, efti in combination with KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy is uniquely\npositioned to potentially drive a new standard-of-care treatment paradigm.\nA Differentiated Approach in Metastatic 1L NSCLC with Efti, a First-in-Class MHC Class II Agonist\nWhat sets efti apart from all other cancer immunotherapies is (1) it is a first-in-class soluble LAG-3 protein\nand (2) it is the only MHC Class II agonist in clinical development today. Quite simply, there is nothing else\nlike it.\nImmutep uses this proprietary LAG-3\nimmunotherapy as a tool to stimulate a\nbroad anti-cancer immune response\nthrough its unique activation of antigen-\npresenting cells (APC) known as\ndendritic cells.\nThe discovery of these powerful\nimmune cells by Rockefeller University\nscientist Ralph M. Steinman in 1973 led\nto his 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Source: Rockefeller University\nMedicine12. In Rockefeller University’s overview of Dr. Steinman's accomplishment, the dendritic cell is\ndescribed as “the cell type that is almost singularly responsible for commanding the efforts of all other\nimmune cells”.\nAs master regulators of the immune response, dendritic cells represent the key bridge between adaptive\nand innate immunity, and they play an essential role in orchestrating an effective response against\ncancer13. Efti flips the “on switch” to these powerful immune cells by binding to a specific subset of MHC\nclass II molecules. This leads to the activation and proliferation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, CD4+ helper T\ncells, dendritic cells, NK cells, and monocytes to target and kill cancer.\nAdditionally, efti upregulates the expression of key biological molecules including C-X-C motif chemokine\nligand 10 (CXCL10) that recruits cancer-fighting immune cells to tumour sites and interferon-gamma (IFN-\nƴ), which enhances the function of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and further boosts their anti-tumour effects. This\nis all achieved via simple subcutaneous administration of efti, which provides a better patient experience\nand broadens access for patients and healthcare providers alike as compared to intravenous\nadministration.\nImmutep’s differentiated immuno-oncology (IO) approach is leading to the alignment of efficacy and safety\nwith mature clinical data in multiple clinical trials focused on 1L NSCLC. Importantly, efti in combination\nwith KEYTRUDA with or without chemotherapy has led to very strong response rates and durable\nresponses across all levels of PD-L1 expression in patients with 1L NSCLC. More importantly, the impressive\n3\nresponse rates, durability, and progression-free survival (PFS) achieved in these 1L NSCLC trials has\ntranslated into compelling overall survival (OS) as well.\nRobust response rates, durability, and progression free survival from efti plus\npembrolizumab across all PD-L1 expression levels translate into compelling overall survival\nObjective Response Rate (ORR) Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Overall Survival (OS)\nEfti + Pembrolizumab Pembrolizumab monotherapy\nSource: Immutep Corporate Presentation\nThis has been seen across two clinical trials in 1L NSCLC evaluating efti with KEYTRUDA. The first trial is the\nrelatively large TACTI-002 Phase II (data shown above)14 with 114 patients enrolled across six different\ncountries. Data from this trial have previously been selected for oral presentations at three prestigious\nconferences: ESMO, SITC, and ASCO. The second trial is the investigator-initiated INSIGHT-003 Phase I\nevaluating efti + KEYTRUDA + chemotherapy that’s enrolling patients at several top institutions in Germany.\nAs reported on 14 November 2024, mature data from patients in INSIGHT-003\nwith a minimum follow-up of 22 months (N=21) shows excellent results that\nexceeded expectations with 32.9 months median OS, 12.7 months median PFS,\nand 24-month OS rate of 81.0%15. These compare favourably to the 22.0-month\nmedian OS, 9.0-month median PFS, and 24-month OS rate of 45.5% from a\nregistrational trial of anti-PD-1 and doublet chemotherapy, which also enrolled\nnon-squamous 1L NSCLC patients regardless of PD-L1 expression16.\nNotably, only ~19% of the 21 patients in INSIGHT-003 with mature survival data\nhave high PD-L1 expression, who typically respond better to anti-PD-1 therapy,\nversus ~32% in the registrational trial of anti-PD-1 and doublet chemotherapy17.\nINSIGHT-003’s skew towards patients with negative (TPS <1%) and low (TPS 1-49%)\nPD-L1 expression further underpins the strength of the data we are seeing from\nthe study. Source: Immutep\nData from all evaluable patients in INSIGHT-003 through the 15 October 2024 cutoff date (N=40)\ndemonstrates significant improvement of Objective Response Rate (ORR) according to RECIST 1.1 across\nall levels of PD-L1 expression compared to historical control15,16. In patients with low and negative PD-L1\nexpression (36 of 40 patients), who are typically less responsive to anti-PD-1 therapy, the triple\ncombination achieved a 52.8% ORR and 86.1% Disease Control Rate (DCR). Of note, all 19 patients in the\nexpansion cohort have TPS <50% and several with stable disease have potential to become responders.\nAdditional data updates from INSIGHT-003 are expected in 2025 and beyond.\n4\nStrategic Collaboration with MSD for Phase III Trial in First Line Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\nWhile ICIs have revolutionised the treatment landscape in NSCLC, most patients do not respond to anti-\nPD-(L)1 monotherapy. This has driven the biotech industry to search for combinations with anti-PD-(L)1\ntherapies that can (1) expand the number of patients who respond, (2) improve upon the clinical outcomes\nfor patients who do respond, and (3) overcome primary or acquired resistance. Efti’s clinical data to date\nin 1L NSCLC suggests it can accomplish all of these in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy in a safe manner.\nIn June 2024, Immutep entered into a clinical trial TACTI-004 Phase III\ncollaboration and supply agreement with MSD (Merck &\n• Third and most important collaboration\nCo., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA), through a subsidiary, to\n& supply agreement with MSD signed in\nevaluate efti in combination with MSD’s anti-PD-1\nJune 2024\ntherapy KEYTRUDA® and chemotherapy for the first-line\n• Registrational Phase III trial in 1L NSCLC\ntreatment of metastatic NSCLC in a pivotal Phase III\nwith ~750 patients\ntrial16. At its signing, this collaboration and supply\n• Immutep to conduct trial & retains all\nagreement was the first for a Phase III that MSD had\ncommercial rights to efti\nentered into in over two years.\n• Potential to establish new standard-of-\ncare in NSCLC, one of largest oncology\nThis triple combination therapy with efti has the\nindications and revenue drivers for\npotential to set a new standard-of-care across the entire\nKEYTRUDA\nNSCLC patient population regardless of PD-L1 expression\n• Planned KEYTRUDA supply has\nby strengthening clinical outcomes for responders,\nsignificant value (typical ICI drug supply\novercoming primary resistance, and broadening the\nfor such a PIII trial is approx. US$100m)\nnumber of patients who respond to therapy.\nTACTI-004 (Two ACTive Immunotherapies-004) Registrational Phase III Trial\nTACTI-004 will be a 1:1 randomised, double-blind, multinational, controlled clinical study to evaluate efti\nin combination with MSD’s KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) and standard chemotherapy compared to the\ncombination of pembrolizumab, chemotherapy and placebo in first-line metastatic NSCLC, regardless of\nPD-L1 expression, not amenable to EGFR/ALK/ROS1 based therapy. The global study will enrol ~750 NSCLC\npatients, including non-squamous/squamous subtypes, in more than 150 sites and well over 20 countries\nworldwide.\nThe trial design was formulated in collaboration with MSD and has received positive feedback from the US\nFDA and other regulatory agencies. Overall Survival (OS) and Progression-Free Survival (PFS) are dual\nprimary endpoints, and like most large pharma Phase III trials, a reasonable differential between treatment\nand control arms will lead to the trial’s success.\nImportantly, the trial also has a prespecified futility boundary in late 2025 or early 2026 and a preplanned\n5\ninterim analysis that could occur as soon as year-end 2026 or early 2027 depending on events. Both are\nkey milestones.\nSummary\nIn summary, we are excited as we approach the initiation of the TACTI-004 registrational trial and becoming\na Phase III company.\nThe largest commercial market opportunity in 1L NSCLC captures all patients regardless of PD-L1\nexpression (TPS 0-100%) as well as both non-squamous and squamous cancer types. It is this patient\npopulation that KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy is most often chosen by physicians today.\nTACTI-004 targets this exact patient population. This is key because if the Phase III trial is successful, efti\nwill be positioned as a simple “add-on” to KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy that does billions\nof dollars in sales in 1L NSCLC today.\nWe have high confidence in efti’s ability to strengthen clinical outcomes and expand the number of lung\ncancer patients who respond to the world’s top selling drug. This belief is bolstered by the strength of\nefficacy and safety results achieved to date across two lung cancer trials evaluating efti with KEYTRUDA,\nand particularly as it relates to TACTI-004’s dual primary endpoints of Overall Survival and Progression-\nFree Survival. Like most large pharma Phase III trials, a reasonable differential between treatment and\ncontrol arms would lead to the trial’s success.\nWe are grateful for the continued support of our shareholders and investors that has provided us with\nstrong financial means to advance our plan to make a lasting difference in the lives of cancer patients and\ntheir families worldwide.\nFootnotes:\n1.
