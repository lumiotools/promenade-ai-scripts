For the nine months, trailing three quarters organic growth as of September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. In both cases, excludes revenue from acquisitions completed after September 30, 2023. _\n\n_ 3  Pursuant to the Company’s $25 million repurchase authorization. _\n\n_ 4  Basic Adjusted EPS and Diluted Adjusted EPS are all non-GAAP financial metrics the Company believes offer valuable perspectives on results of operations (see non-GAAP tables below for reconciliations). Adjusted EPS (Basic and Diluted) include addbacks for non-reoccurring expenses specific to acquisitions, non-cash stock compensation expense associated with pre-IPO grants, and other expenses not in the ordinary course of business. With respect to the elimination of any non-cash stock compensation expense, the Company computes an adjusted tax expense or benefit which accounts for the elimination of any periodic windfall or shortfall tax effects resulting from the difference between grant date fair value and vest date value. With respect to all other eliminations, the Company applies its average marginal statutory tax rate, currently 25.6%, to derive the tax adjustment associated with the elimination of expenses. A reconciliation of non-GAAP Adjusted EPS to GAAP EPS, both basic and diluted, is included with this press release for reference. _\n\n**_Forward-Looking Statements_ **\n\n_This press release may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(the “Company” or “Bowman”) (NASDAQ: BWMN), today announced it has entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire Exeltech Consulting, Inc. (“Exeltech”) based in Lacey, Washington. Exeltech specializes in bridge design, transportation planning, environmental compliance, civil engineering, landscape architecture, permitting and construction management for owners and operators of transportation infrastructure, transit facilities, ports and harbors, waterfront developments, building structures, and storm drainage and utility systems. Led by Santosh Kuruvilla, PE, SE, PMP, Exeltech serves clients throughout the Pacific Northwest from offices in Washington, Oregon, and Montana. \n\n“Exeltech complements Bowman from both a services and geographic footprint perspective,” said Gary Bowman, chairman and CEO of Bowman. “The structural bridge design and transportation infrastructure experience of the Exeltech team expands the capacity and reach of our rapidly growing national transportation and ports and harbors practices. Their location directly complements our recent FCS acquisition and strengthens our presence in the Pacific Northwest. Given that we’ve already begun collaborating with Exeltech on projects, I expect a meaningful amount of revenue and utilization synergies from this combination.” \n\n“We have steadily grown Exeltech and successfully expanded our reach within our markets, and now we want to extend our reach nationally,” said Santosh Kuruvilla, president of Exeltech. “Joining with Bowman offers us the opportunity to align with a rapidly growing national firm with a commitment to expanding in areas where we are highly experienced. We believe we can be consequential in that effort and look forward to introducing our team’s extensive structural bridge and civil transportation capabilities into Bowman’s portfolio of service offerings.” \n\nExeltech’s structural engineering team brings extensive expertise in the design, inspection, assessment, repair, retrofit, replacement, load rating, and construction of a wide range of structures. Their knowledge spans local, state, and federal requirements for roadway and pedestrian bridges, grade separations, tunnels, culverts, retaining walls, fixed and floating structures, as well as marinas, piers, wharves, breakwaters, docks, and both new and historic buildings. Exeltech’s civil engineering team supports a wide range of projects, including roadways, roundabouts, pedestrian and bicycle enhancements, parking, parks and trails, airports, marine facilities, railroads, fish passage improvements, culvert replacements and general use site development. Additionally, Exeltech’s environmental sciences team focuses on creating highly constructible, cost-effective designs that deliver the highest degrees of regulatory, environmental and sustainability standards. \n\nFinanced with a combination of cash, seller term notes, and a convertible note with a conversion strike price of $32.32 per share, the acquisition conforms with previously discussed target multiples and operating metrics. Bowman anticipates the acquisition will initially operate at an annualized net service billing run rate of approximately $7.0 million and be immediately accretive. Closing is subject to certain usual and customary conditions which the Company expects to be met on or after November 5, 2024. More detailed information on M&A activities, pipeline, and guidance updates are provided in connection with scheduled quarterly and annual communications. \n\nMorrissey Goodale, a specialized management consulting and research firm exclusively serving the architecture, engineering, and environmental consulting industries, initiated the transaction and advised Exeltech. \n\n**About Exeltech Consulting, Inc.**\n\nFounded in 1989 and subsequently purchased in 1998 by Santosh Kuruvilla, PE, SE, PMP, Exeltech works with state, federal, and local agencies, consultant teams, and private clients. The firm provides design, planning, permitting, and construction management services relating to bridges, roads, transit facilities, waterfront developments, buildings, landscape architecture, site developments and storm drainage and utility systems. Over its nearly 40-year history, the firm has transformed from a bridge engineering firm into a multidisciplinary consulting company providing planning, permitting, design, and construction management for clients’ building, site development, and transportation projects.

The results of this report can be found on the Sustainability page of Bowman’s investor relations [website](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.bowman.com%2Fesg%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54139561&newsitemid=20241021076664&lan=en-US&anchor=website&index=1&md5=3b61949a54053a7149b77f587e89b4ba). \n\n“This initial assessment is a significant step in our journey as a socially engaged and sustainability conscious company,” said Bruce Labovitz, chief financial officer and designated sustainability officer. “The assessment revealed insightful perspectives and highlighted critical areas where stakeholders believe our operations intersect with sustainability, social engagement, and financial exposures. From here, we will plan targeted strategies and impactful initiatives that address the identified sustainability topics, prioritizing those with high degrees of double materiality. We look forward to leveraging the insights from this report to direct our future efforts most effectively and transparently.” \n\n**About Bowman Consulting Group Ltd.**\n\nHeadquartered in Reston, Virginia, Bowman is a national engineering services firm delivering infrastructure solutions to customers who own, develop, and maintain the built environment.

My name is Tia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to\nwelcome everyone to the Bowman Consulting Group Third Quarter 2024 Conference Call.\n[Operator's Instructions]\nPlease note that many of the comments made today are considered forward-looking statements under\nfederal securities laws. As described in the company's filings with the SEC, these statements are subject\nto numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and\nthe company is not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition,\non today's call, the company will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as adjusted EBITDA,\nadjusted net income and net service billing. You can find this information together with the reconciliations\nto the most directly comparable GAAP information in the company's earnings press release and 8-K filed\nwith the SEC and on the company's investor website at investors.bowman.com. Management will deliver\nprepared remarks, after which they will take live questions from published research analysts.\n[Operator's Instructions]\nReplays of the call will be available on the company's investor website. Mr. Bowman, you may begin your\nprepared remarks.\nGary P. Bowman\nCEO & Chairman\nThank you, Tia. Good morning. Thank you for joining the Bowman Consulting Group's Third Quarter\n2024 Earnings Call. With me this morning is Bruce Labovitz, our CFO. I want to take a moment now\nto welcome all our new employees, including everyone who is joining us from ExelTech Consulting in\nWashington State. This morning, I'm going to start off with some introductory comments, after which\nBruce will discuss our financial results. Then I'll come back for some additional remarks about our\ntrajectory into 2025, and we'll end with Q&A. You'll find our quarterly highlights on Slide 3. For the third\nquarter, we reported over $100 million of net revenue, a first in the firm's history. This is a noteworthy\naccomplishment given that our revenue in 2020, that was the last full year prior to our IPO, was $103\nmillion. This is an exciting time for us as we continue to advance toward our frequently discussed goal of\nreaching $500 million in gross revenue annual run rate within our first 5 years as a public company. The\ncontinuing strength of our markets across all divisions and services resulted in healthy year-over-year\ngrowth of net service billings and adjusted EBITDA during the quarter. Interest rates came down for the\nfirst time in nearly 5 years, which reenergized the building infrastructure market. And as we had hoped\nwould be the case, several large transportation awards that we have been waiting on finally got underway\nlate in the quarter.\nIn July, we affected a change in leadership within operations. We promoted Dan Swayze to the role of\nChief Operating Officer, and he's hit the ground running. We expected Mike Bruen to settle into the newly\nindependent position of President, engaging him in oversight of non-day-to-day operations and strategy\nof the company. Once in the role, however, Mike decided it was not what he wanted, and he elected to\nretire from Bowman after nearly 30 years with the company. In the interest of both clarity of leadership\nand timely reassignment of responsibilities, Mike resigned from both his leadership and governance\nroles immediately upon announcing his retirement. For now, we do not intend to refill or reassign the\nposition of President. The job of leading day-to-day operations is now squarely in Dan's hands, and I'm\nextremely pleased. He's been right there alongside Bruce and me during the past couple of months as\nwe've implemented staffing adjustments to better align labor and revenue. These efforts have already\nstarted paying dividends as evidenced by the third quarter results. At the same time, we redoubled our\ncommitment to bottom-up forecasting.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 07, 2024\nI'm confident we will remain diligent about proper alignment of labor, accurately forecasting revenue and\ncontinual improvement of performance. Our markets remain healthy and sales of new work continues\nto outpace revenue. Year-over-year, our backlog grew 27%. Since the end of Q2, backlog increased by\n$28 million, of which approximately 1/3 was attributable to backlog acquired during the quarter, with the\nbalance coming from robust bookings of new work, which resulted in a book-to-burn ratio that was well\nabove 1. Okay. With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Bruce to discuss the financial results. Bruce?\nBruce J. Labovitz\nExecutive VP & Chief Financial Officer\nTerrific. Thanks, Gary. Well, it certainly was an all-hands-on deck effort during the quarter to refocus and\nrealign our operations to deliver the solid results we released last night. As a quick reminder to everyone,\nwe refer to net service billing and net revenue interchangeably. Net revenue is an industry standard\nnon-GAAP metric that represents the revenue generated by our workforce by eliminating pass-through\nproject expenses from gross revenue. So I'll start with revenue on Slide 4. Gross revenue in the third\nquarter was up 21% year-over-year at $113.9 million with net revenue up 23% to $101 million. Year-to-\ndate, we've generated $313 million of gross revenue and $281 million of net revenue, which represents\nyear-over-year increases of 24% and 26%, respectively. During the quarter, we implemented targeted\nstaffing adjustments throughout the company to better align our labor with current and forecast revenue.\nOur gross margin for the quarter without giving effect to any of these labor adjustments was 52.4% as\ncompared to 51.6% in the third quarter last year. Year-to-date gross margin has been 51.9% as compared\nto 51% this time last year. On a sequential basis, as compared to Q2 this year, SG&A was down 140 basis\npoints as a percent of gross revenue at 45.6%.\nWhile this is not a destination, it is meaningful progress in our efforts to leverage economies of scale as we\ngrow. On Slide 5, you'll see the noncash stock compensation in the quarter was $6.5 million compared to\n$7.2 million last year. Year-to-date, noncash stock compensation expense is $20.4 million, which includes\nroughly $1.4 million of expense related to our employee stock purchase plan. We're still projecting roughly\n$26 million in total stock compensation expense for 2024, which will be 6% to 7% of net revenue. Looking\nahead, we expect that percentage to drop to around 5% in 2025 and settle in around the 3% to 4% range\nthereafter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased $1.9 million from last year to just under $17 million\nor a 16.7% margin on net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA this quarter included roughly $1.6 million of onetime\ncosts related to the restructuring of labor during the quarter. We believe labor adjustments are now behind\nus. For the 9 months ended September 30, adjusted EBITDA increased $6.7 million over last year to $42.5\nmillion, which was a 15.1% margin on net revenue. We still believe we can achieve a sustained high teens\nmargin at scale with optimized labor. Before I talk about revenue in detail, I'll quickly point out a small\nchange in our presentation of the gross revenue by market table.\nBased on comments we've received relating to the consistency of presentation between current and prior\nperiod filings, we're no longer modifying the reported acquired revenue from prior periods. To calculate\norganic growth, however, we remain consistent in our methodology of considering revenue from acquired\ncompanies to be part of the organic base of revenue after 4 quarters. As detailed in the press release and\nSlide 6, 49% of gross revenue for the quarter was from Building Infrastructure, 19% from Transportation,\n18% from Power and Utilities and 14% from emerging markets, which includes imaging and mapping,\nwater resources, mining and environmental services. As compared to last year, Building Infrastructure is\ndown 550 basis points as a percentage of gross revenue or nearly 10%, with emerging markets increasing\nnearly 800 basis points or more than doubling. This is in large part due to the acquisition of Surdex, but\nit's also from other gains in Water and Environmental Services. The distribution of net revenue by vertical\nwas roughly the same. During the third quarter, gross revenue from acquired companies was $23.3 million\nand net revenue was $20.4 million or roughly 20% of gross and net revenue. This quarter, acquisition\nrevenue included Excellence, Dennis, CFA, Blankinship, High Mesa, Hess Rountree, TCE, Moore, Speece\nLewis, Surdex, Element, Robau and FCS. At year-end, acquisitions we made in Q4 of 2023, meaning\nExcellence through Hess Rountree) will fall off the acquired revenue list.\nTurning to Slide 7. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, organic growth of net revenue at the end of the third\nquarter was approximately 8.3% as compared to total net revenue for the trailing 4 quarters at the end of\nthe third quarter last year, during which all net revenue was included in the organic basis. Organic growth\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 4\nBOWMAN CONSULTING GROUP LTD. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 07, 2024\nof net revenue during that period was most significant in emerging markets at 63%, with Transportation\nnext at 17%, followed by Power and Utilities at 14% and Building Infrastructure at 1%. Nominally,\nTransportation was the largest contributor, followed by Power and Utilities, emerging markets and\nBuilding Infrastructure. This trailing 4 quarters view of organic growth is a little different than we've\npresented in the past. Given the volatility created by the inconsistent timing and frequency of acquisitions\nbetween quarters, we feel this presentation of trailing 4-quarter growth offers a better perspective for\nunderstanding growth trends. For the 9 months ended September 30, gross revenue from acquired\ncompanies was $49.8 million and net revenue was $45.1 million or roughly 16% of both gross and net\nrevenue. Organic growth of net revenue for the 9 months was approximately 5.6% as compared to the\nsame 9-month period last year, where all net revenue was likewise considered organic. Again, the largest\npercentage growth was emerging markets at 48%, followed by Transportation at 14%, Power and Utilities\nat 6.2% and Building Infrastructure at just under 1%.\nAnd again, transportation contributed the largest nominal growth. We believe that organic growth from\nBuilding Infrastructure will continue to rebound into 2025, while growth from emerging markets will\nmoderate a little bit now that the starting basis is higher. Turning to Slide 8. Our balance sheet is as\nhealthy as it's been with roughly $12 million of cash on hand, low leverage and plenty of capital available.\nOur line of credit is close to $70 million available, and our equipment financing capacity is sufficient\nto cover CapEx through 2025. Net debt on September 30 was roughly $85 million, which represents a\nleverage ratio of 1.6x trailing 4 quarters adjusted EBITDA and approximately 1.2x forward 4 quarters\nof adjusted EBITDA. Cash flow from operations for the 9 months was up $5.5 million sequentially from\nJune 30 at $11 million, with $44 million year-to-date cash flow from operations before a $33 million use\nof cash from changes in working capital. With respect to cash and liquidity, interestingly, in October, we\nfound ourselves unexpectedly back in the position of having the opportunity to file our 2023 returns in\naccordance with the R&D position we had adopted for our '22 returns. As it turned out, definitive guidance\nthe IRS was expected to have released prior to October had not been issued as we approach filing our\nreturns.\nThis allowed our tax advisers and us at Pricewaterhouse to reach a reasonable basis position for continued\nR&D expense deductibility, enabled us to file without remitting the approximately $12 million payment\nwe expected to make and without accruing for penalties. So that $12 million will stay with us for now.\nAnd since the filing was deemed to be a reportable subsequent event, you will see further disclosure\nabout the return of the UTP in the 10-Q. During the quarter, we used our capital to buy back just about\n500,000 shares of common stock under our $25 million authorization at an average price of approximately\n$23.89 per share. This does not include shares of treasury stock purchased to cover taxes associated with\nstock vesting. On September 30, we had 17.7 million shares outstanding. We've continued to repurchase\nshares under the authorization since the end of the quarter. And as of today, we have approximately 17.5\nmillion shares outstanding. You can see on Slide 9 that at the end of the quarter, we had gross backlog\nof $380 million, which is $81 million more than the end of Q3 2023, and as Gary said, over $28 million\nmore than June 30. While approximately $10 million of the sequential increase over last quarter was a\nresult of acquired backlog, the balance was derived from new orders. The distribution of backlog is slightly\noverweighted to transportation relative to revenue in the third quarter.\nGiven the nature of our sales cycle and the generally longer-term nature of transportation projects, I\nwould not read much into that mismatch. Turning to Slide 10. In the release yesterday, we increased our\n2024 net revenue outlook to accommodate the revenue we'll pick up from the recent Exeltech acquisition\nand reaffirmed adjusted EBITDA, which would not have reached the rounding threshold if we added it. We\nalso introduced a net revenue outlook for 2025 of $422 million to $437 million, which represents organic\ngrowth of net revenue between 5% and 9% based on pro forma full year 2024 net revenue adjusted\nfor partial year acquisitions as the basis. For our outlook for 2025 adjusted EBITDA, we're projecting a\n16% to 17% margin on net revenue with a range of $68 million to $75 million. As always, that excludes\nfuture acquisitions not closed as of today. As evidenced by the more than 30% reduction to our equity\nvalue in response to last quarter's roughly 4% reduction to revenue guidance and roughly 8% reduction\nto adjusted EBITDA guidance, the message is clear that there's no benefit to stretching with respect to\n2025 guidance at this time. As such, we will revisit our outlook in connection with our quarterly and year-\nend reports throughout 2025. We're hopeful that this quarter demonstrates to the market that Bowman\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 07, 2024\nis not damaged and our equity is meaningfully undervalued at current multiples as compared to our peers\nand other comparable transactions we see in the marketplace for firms our size. Before I go, I'll quickly\nmention that I'll be at the Baird Conference in Chicago next week, the Craig-Hallum Conference in New\nYork and others throughout the remainder of the year and into next year. Check our investor website to\nsee a calendar of where we'll be presenting and meeting investors in person. Gary?\nGary P. Bowman\nCEO & Chairman\nOkay. Thank you, Bruce. Last week, we announced the acquisition of Washington state-based Exeltech\nConsulting. It's a well-established 35-year-old engineering design and program management firm. They\nhave extensive bridge design, structural engineering, transportation planning and environmental sciences\ncapabilities. Geographically, this acquisition complements our July acquisition of Washington-based FCS\nGroup, which is a professional services firm focused on rate and financial consulting for the utility and\nrenewable energy industries. The acquisition of Exeltech fits right into our strategic objectives by fueling\nthe growth of our national transportation practice and expanding the breadth of associated offerings.\nThe fact that Exeltech and FCS are in close proximity to each other provides Bowman with an immediate\ncombination of regional expertise, established customer relationships and expansion of our operational\nfootprint to the Pacific Northwest and beyond. From a macro perspective, the first Fed rate cut in several\nyears has energized real estate markets. However, uncertainty around the pace of future rate cuts and\nthe landscape of regulatory and economic policy is having a sort of paralyzing effect on this market. Good\nnews for us is that planning and engineering are the first steps in preparing for project starts and restarts.\nAnd we see a notable uptick in market activity in real estate-related markets, particularly in multifamily\nmarkets such as build for rent and apartments.\nOkay. Turning to Slide 11. Several of the transportation award starts that were delayed over the first\npart of the year finally got underway in the latter part of the third quarter. Notable among these is the\nIllinois DOTI 55 corridor rehabilitation project, where we're providing multiyear management and design\nservices for a 16-mile section of the highway. Others include a design build project for the Virginia DOT\nand a comprehensive roadway improvement project for U.S. Right 1 in Philadelphia. Large third quarter\ntransportation wins now making their way through contracting include a $10 million award with Cook\nCounty, Illinois. And furthermore, we expect -- we fully expect activity relating to the Allegheny Tunnel\nbypass project for the Pennsylvania Turnpike Authority to increase through the end of the year. In our\ndeveloping Ports and harbors practice, which we now group with transportation, we were awarded several\nmillion dollars in contracts to be delivered in 2025 from both long-standing and new customers. Our new\nport asset conditions kit is an innovative proprietary delivery platform that we've developed for marine\nfacility operators, and we've got high hopes for its prospects moving forward. Coastal and resiliency\nengineering, combined with high altitude aerial surveying has enhanced our ability to pursue public and\nprivate sector customers in the aftermath of ever more frequent and ferocious natural disasters.\nAnother aspect of our Ports and Harbors expansion includes enhanced waterfront capabilities, which have\nbeen leveraged by our traditional development practice leaders to pursue urban waterfront redevelopment\nand coastal shore protection opportunities in areas, including Kentucky, South Carolina and Maine. Also,\nwe're expanding our focus to inland recreational marinas and boating facilities in areas such as Pittsburgh,\nCharleston, Savannah, Philadelphia, Houston and others. On other fronts, we recently contracted to\nimmediately start work at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport in Charlotte, North Carolina. The\nscope of this work includes comprehensive survey services for a new 10,000-foot runway. Additionally,\nwe were awarded our fifth ongoing on-call agreement with Southwest Gas, expanding our service area\ninto Western and Northern Nevada and California. Revenue in our MEP group is trending upwards with\nstrength in commissioning services. And in the power markets, we're seeing an uptick in electrification\nand decarbonization assessments as the industry moves more toward net zero and all-electric solutions.\nAcquisitions continue to have a positive long- and short-term impact on the organic growth of the\nbusiness. A notable example is our growing fire protection engineering practice, which came from the\nFisher acquisition.\nOur contract for surveying hazardous material storage facilities from Marine Corps bases in the U.S. and\nJapan was recently expanded by an additional 21 sites. Over the course of our nearly 30 years in business,\norganic growth has always been a central focus of our approach to growth and expansion. Our long-term\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6\nBOWMAN CONSULTING GROUP LTD. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 07, 2024\ntrack record of a robust organic growth is a result of culture, attitude, risk tolerance and an eye for good\nmarkets. These attributes can characterize us still today. Our recent inclusion as an ENR top 150 global\ndesign firm puts us in good company among industry elites and works to solidify our brand as a premier\nprovider of comprehensive engineering and design solutions. Going into 2025, I expect that we'll continue\nto be acquisitive, likely with larger average revenue size and a bit less frequent than we've been over\nthe past several years. We'll continue to focus on adjacent businesses in attractive markets that we can\nreadily integrate and grow significantly over time. While private equity continues to play an ever more\nactive role in the industry paying outsized multiples for larger firms, we're confident that our culture\nand approach will continue to make us competitive and successful in our M&A activities. Our strategy is\nworking. Clearly, we stumbled last quarter in terms of forecasting, but we've recovered our firm footing\nand are poised to deliver on our commitments during the remainder of the year and into 2025. Our efforts\ntoward diversification, integration, leadership transition and process excellence have positioned us to\ngrow organically, expand our services, make acquisitions that broaden our footprint while deepening our\ncustomer relationships and wallet share and most importantly, deliver long-term profitability, cash flow\nconversion and value creation for our shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call back to the operator\nfor questions and answers.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7\nBOWMAN CONSULTING GROUP LTD. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 07, 2024\nQuestion and Answer\n....................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator\n[Operator's Instructions]\nThe first question comes from the line of Jeff Martin with ROTH Capital Partners.\nJeffrey Michael Martin\nROTH MKM Partners, LLC, Research Division\nGood to see the efforts put into the quarter starting to show through. So I guess first question, are we\ndone with the internal changes? Are we heading in -- did you head into the fourth quarter with a clean\nslate? And if not, what remains to be done?\nGary P. Bowman\nCEO & Chairman\nClean slate, yes. It's always a journey. But over the third quarter, the changes we've made, we consider\nthat -- we reached our destination there. We're ever diligent and deliberate in keeping an eye on that. So\nit's something that always evolves, but done deal.\nJeffrey Michael Martin\nROTH MKM Partners, LLC, Research Division\nGood to hear that. Okay. And then with respect to your updated 2025 guidance, what level of organic\ngrowth are you assuming for that year? And if you're assuming any different equation in that organic\ngrowth relative to what you had previously assumed, maybe help detail that for us.\nBruce J. Labovitz\nExecutive VP & Chief Financial Officer\nYes, Jeff, midpoint of that is probably around 7% organic growth for next year. Again, coming out of the\nchute conservative on that. We've -- it's basically looking at this year as adjusted for acquisitions as the\nbase growing forward. I don't know that there's any significant shifts in strategy related to next year other\nthan continuing focus on these markets that we're in.\nJeffrey Michael Martin\nROTH MKM Partners, LLC, Research Division\nGreat. And then the last one for me. You mentioned moving up the size of M&A deals going forward.\nCould you help maybe give us some relative perspective on how much you plan to move up? And then I\nguess the second part to that question would be curious to get an update on how the Surdex acquisition is\nperforming since that is one of your largest acquisitions to date.\nGary P. Bowman\nCEO & Chairman\nRight. I'll say, it's an evolution in our M&A strategy. Really, it's a recognition as we're getting larger and\nlarger, it takes the larger deals to move the needle. So we don't have any real -- we don't have a target\nsize, but just a strategy, get larger and the larger they get, by definition, almost a little less frequent. As\nfar as Surdex, we're pleased so far. We're seeing lots of cross-selling and revenue synergy and it's moving\nalong fine.\nBruce J. Labovitz\nExecutive VP & Chief Financial Officer\nJeff, we've averaged sub -10 this year in our acquisitions and sort of setting a goal to get that into double\ndigits next year, you think about the number of acquisitions and we talk about that in terms of revenue,\nright, revenue bought. Surdex was an outlier in that. So kind of putting that aside, I think doing things\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8\nBOWMAN CONSULTING GROUP LTD. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 07, 2024\nmore in the sort of, let's call it, the recent Exeltech, which was closer in that -- the FCS, the Exeltech\ncloser to the 10s as opposed to the smaller ones that the TCEs and the Elements and Speeces that were\nearlier in the year and try to cut a couple of turns in terms of number of acquisitions out, but still continue\nto increase the amount of revenue bought.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from the line of Aaron Spychalla with Craig-Hallum.\nAaron Michael Spychalla\nCraig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division\nSo maybe first on transportation. Good to see some of those awards come in there. I know that's been\na big focus for you. Can you just talk about how that pipeline looks there, continuing to expand to more\nDOTs and starting to see that IIJA funding come out here in the back half of the year?\nGary P. Bowman\nCEO & Chairman\nWe are seeing the pipeline continuing to expand in several of our acquisitions, like we mentioned on the\ncall, Exeltech. So it's a big focus of our inorganic growth strategy, but the acquisition several years ago of\nMcMahon and our Chicago operations, they're seeing some good robust and large transportation projects.\nBruce J. Labovitz\nExecutive VP & Chief Financial Officer\nGary, you'll see we're focused on DOT, certainly. That's kind of like, let's call that a depth, but there's\nalso a breadth and breadth being things like the adding bridge engineering, bridge design and that sort\nof structural element of transportation engineering to try to expand how many things we can do for an\never-growing base of clients. we've already started -- we mentioned we already started working with\nExeltech in advance of the acquisition, and they're already teaming with them on projects that -- where\ntheir skill set brings additional capabilities and opportunities to groups that are better entrenched with\nlarger transportation departments than they would have been nationally, but with an additional scope of\nservices.\nGary P. Bowman\nCEO & Chairman\nWe're in early innings with Surdex, but Surdex was not able to serve big transportation markets prior\nto joining us. And now with our broad clientele, we're looking into actively marketing state DOTs for the\naerial survey work that Surdex brings.\nBruce J. Labovitz\nExecutive VP & Chief Financial Officer\nIt's one of those that it kind of adds a bit of momentum. It's an accelerant. You get 1, 2, 3, 5, 20 DOTs.\nNow the next 10 of them are easier to get than the first 10 to 20.\nAaron Michael Spychalla\nCraig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division\nNo, that's really helpful color. And then just second for me, can you just maybe some early reads or\nthoughts just on the election and what that might mean for your business here moving forward?\nGary P. Bowman\nCEO & Chairman\nCertainly, we're speaking of early innings. We're in barely up to the plate on assessing that. We think,\nif anything, it will be positive for our business. We have some presence in fossil fuels and oil and gas.\nWe think the change in the regulatory environment will make that a more robust market. We're looking\nforward to that. We fully anticipate that the infrastructure spending is -- the dice is cast on that. So\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9\nBOWMAN CONSULTING GROUP LTD. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 07, 2024\nwe're quite confident that we won't see any adverse effect on that. Some analysts feel that the new\nadministration may move to some more privatization of infrastructure. So we're already thinking how\nwe focus on marketing to our PPP developer clients. And in the mining, the lack of the change in the\nregulatory environment probably increased mining. We're cautiously optimistic on the renewables --\nthere's a lot of thought that the renewables, the IRA has created so much economic activity in red states\nthat it hopefully will stay in effect. If a different party, the other party had won the election, we'd probably\nbe more apt to double down on our renewables, but we're fully confident that our presence in renewables\nwill continue to be a robust part of what we do.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from the line of Andy J. Wittmann with Baird.\nAndrew John Wittmann\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nI guess I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the early look here at 2025. And specifically, if you\nlooked at your backlog today, how does it compare to like historical levels in terms of the amount of that\n2025 work that you're guiding to that's covered? Is it more? Is it less? And can you also just comment\nabout the level of permitting and notices received that you've received on this work just as it comes out\nof last quarter where some of those delays were some of the reasons for the shortfall. So I just wanted to\nget your confidence that the permitting and the things that are needed to get to work are in place for this\n'25 outlook.\nGary P. Bowman\nCEO & Chairman\nSo Andy, I would say that the backlog is relatively characteristically similar, maybe a little bit more\nbeneficially stacked for next year only because of some of these timing issues we've had in the last couple\nof quarters and a quarters or so that there's a little bit of more ready-to-go kind of stuff that might hit a\nlittle quicker. But I'd say, generally speaking, the backlog is similar in nature. It's bigger, obviously, than\nit's been. But relative to what we forecast for next year, I think it's characteristically aligned. In terms of\npermitting, again, we don't anticipate any real hurdles with that.\nAndrew John Wittmann\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nOkay. That's helpful. Just maybe a couple of clarifications here then. It looks like the onetime costs\nassociated with the staffing adjustments. Was that -- it looks like there's -- in the other line for your\nadjusted EBITDA bridge is more than a little bit than it has been historically. Is it in there and added back,\nBruce?\nBruce J. Labovitz\nExecutive VP & Chief Financial Officer\nYes.\nAndrew John Wittmann\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nOkay. And then -- I'm sorry, just on the -- in your script, the comments on the changes related to the\ncalculation of organic growth -- can you just go through that one more time, just so I can make sure\nunderstood what you're doing now.\nGary P. Bowman\nCEO & Chairman\nFor the quarter, so looking at third quarter, we looked at a trailing 4-quarter organic growth rate using the\nsame methodology we've used in terms of anything that is more than 4 quarters prior was in the organic\nbase from which we were growing. Anything that was acquired in the last 4 quarters is eliminated from the\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10\nBOWMAN CONSULTING GROUP LTD. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 07, 2024\ntotal net revenue used to calculate the growth on top of that. In terms of the year-to-date, it's the same\nas it's been.\nAndrew John Wittmann\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nSorry. So you're saying that the 8% organic NSR growth that you highlighted in your release is based on a\n4-quarter result that's reported for this quarter. Did I understand that correctly?\nGary P. Bowman\nCEO & Chairman\nTrailing 4 quarters -- trailing 4 quarters from third quarter. So it would be fourth through third and then\nthird -- 4 '22 to third '23 versus '23 to '24.\nAndrew John Wittmann\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nGot it. Okay. I'm going to try this maybe a couple of different ways. What would the calculation have been\nunder the old methodology for the third quarter?\nGary P. Bowman\nCEO & Chairman\nSo the third quarter discretely would have been about flat because there was -- because of the timing of\nacquisitions in the previous year.\nAndrew John Wittmann\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nYes. Okay. Yes, that's what I was trying to understand. Okay. That makes more sense Okay. So then just\nin terms of the M&A pace, I'm just -- I'm kind of curious, did the organizational changes in the quarter at\nall impact the deal flow that you're able to execute? Or were they kind of mutually exclusive actions for\nthe company during the quarter?\nBruce J. Labovitz\nExecutive VP & Chief Financial Officer\nThe organizational changes didn't adversely affect our ability to do deals and a pace of deals. I'll call it, our\nmachine is still in place.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson & Company.\nAndrew John Wittmann\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nA question around the margin expansion implied in 2025. What are the levers you're going to be able\nto pull to support that? Just thinking about that in context of what we've seen in 2024 thus far? Is it\nbeneficial contract mix? Is it the margin expansion implied in 2025? I mean, what are the levers you're\ngoing to be able to pull to support that?\nBruce J. Labovitz\nExecutive VP & Chief Financial Officer\nSo we think that we are, again, continuing to improve our economies of scale. We think that we are --\nas we're growing the top line, we're starting to be able to better meter the overhead costs associated\nwith the revenue. Like some of the -- I don't know that I would say it's built into the contract rates. We\ncertainly are seeing some improvement in, I think, some of the multipliers that we think we can be getting\non some of these projects marginally, and that's all it takes is marginal improvement.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

Bowman\nCEO & Chairman\nA continued focus on operational excellence. That's a lever that always to be pushed, and it's one that\nrenewed focus on that.\nBruce J. Labovitz\nExecutive VP & Chief Financial Officer\nWhen we look at this quarter... We're in the range of that.\nAndrew John Wittmann\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nRight. So the expectation is, especially with some of the things you've been doing here internally in the\nlast -- well more than 9 months that you should be able to outgrow your SG&A?\nGary P. Bowman\nCEO & Chairman\nYes. We think we can squeeze a little bit more out of labor, the relationship with labor multiple of --\nrevenue multiple of labor and SG&A. And again, I think this quarter, we're in the range of where we want\nto be for the whole year next year.\nAndrew John Wittmann\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nOkay. And then I guess just on building infrastructure, maybe just sort of the residential exposure, state\nof affairs, some companies talking about sort of slower trends as of late. I know you're not really directly\ntied to the stats per se, but is that area of your business stable for you? It sounds like maybe you're\nanticipating it to reaccelerate based on conversations you're having. Just be curious if you could talk\naround that.\nGary P. Bowman\nCEO & Chairman\nYes, it's stable and not to quit what you just said, but we are -- based on conversations, based on level of\nactivity on proposal activity, we do see new energy being injected into that going into 2025.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from the line of Alex Rygiel with B. Riley.\nAlexander John Rygiel\nB. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division\nA couple of quick questions here. First on stock-based comp, first, stock-based comp declining as a\npercentage of revenue. Is this a change in compensation strategy? Is it a swap into more cash comp? Can\nyou talk about that comment a little bit more?\nGary P. Bowman\nCEO & Chairman\nI think it's a combination of a couple of things. Yes, it is metering of the utilization of stock as\ncompensation looking ahead. There is the burn off of old grants that burned off now of -- from pre-IPO\ndays. It has to do with the -- yes, there may be some shift towards more cash-based compensation. I\ndon't know that it is an increase in overall compensation, but a shifting of paradigm there a bit and just\ngrowing into the level of having revenue grow at such that it absorbs from a percentage basis more of that\nstock comp.\nAndrew John Wittmann\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

And then 2 questions as it relates to some of your end markets. First, any update on the\ndata center market and in particular, these really large AI data centers? And then secondly, if you can\nprovide any comments on whether or not you're seeing multifamily opportunities reaccelerate?\nBruce J. Labovitz\nExecutive VP & Chief Financial Officer\nOn the data centers, the activity is robust. We continue to grow our presence in that market. Right now,\nit's outside of the building, almost -- we do civil engineering and for the site engineering. We are looking\nat opportunities looking into next year, some opportunities to get inside the building with the mechanical\nand electrical facilities. On the residential -- on the multifamily, yes, we are seeing some significant\nmovement in multifamily. Like I say, as far as proposals, level of interest from the market. So we have a\nhigh degree of optimism that we'll see some acceleration in the multifamily activity next year.\nGary P. Bowman\nCEO & Chairman\nYes, Alex, the data center market constraint today is the power, not the land. And so in a lot of ways,\nthings are bleeding across a couple of different sectors for us. So I think there is activity we see in the\ncapacity side of power to provide for what is an ever-increasing demand for the physical data center\nlocations. You're certainly reading about how folks are starting very preliminarily to look at SMRs as power\nsources for data centers. So we're -- it's coming at us from 2 different directions.\nBruce J. Labovitz\nExecutive VP & Chief Financial Officer\nAnd one of the things that we're seeing, hearing from -- in the data center market, the AI data centers,\nthey're not so -- I use this term, I think it's right, extensive to latency. So there's a lot more flexibility\nto where AI data centers can be located as far as proximity to the fiber corridors. So that just -- that\nopens up more opportunities for us with our geographic dispersion to do data center work in areas that we\nweren't doing it before.\nGary P. Bowman\nCEO & Chairman\nWe do get a lot of inquiries, I'm told, about from landowners thinking about rezonings or reuse\napplications to change over. Hey, can I be a data center? Everybody now has got a couple of acres left to\nbe a data center.\nOperator\nThere are no additional questions left at this time. I will hand it back to Gary for closing remarks.\nGary P. Bowman\nCEO & Chairman\nThank you, Tia. Just I'll close by thanking everybody for participating this morning. Thank you to those\nwho are part of the Bowman for all the hard work done, all the good work over this quarter, certainly to\nour investors and stockholders. Thank you for the faith you put into us. And we're quite pleased with Q3\nand quite pleased with our progress in continuing to evolve this company and reach our growth goals.\nWith that, we'll wrap it up for the morning. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator\nThat concludes today's conference call. Thank you. You may now disconnect your lines.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

CONSULTING GROUP LTD.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n1. Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation\nNature of Business\nBowman Consulting Group Ltd. (along with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Bowman” or “we” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the Commonwealth of\nVirginia on June 5, 1995 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware on November 13, 2020. The Company’s headquarters is located in Reston, VA and the\nCompany has over 100 offices throughout the United States and two offices in Mexico. Bowman is a professional services firm delivering innovative solutions to the\nmarketplace of customers who own, develop and maintain the built environment. Within that arena, we provide planning, design, engineering, geospatial, survey,\nconstruction management, environmental consulting and land procurement services to markets that encompass the buildings in which people live, work and learn in;\nas well as the systems that provide water, electricity and other vital services, and the roads, bridges, and transportation systems used to get from place to place. We\nprovide services to customers through fixed-price and time-and-material based contracts containing multiple milestones and independently priced deliverables.\nTypically, contract awards are on a negotiated basis, ranging in value from a few thousand dollars to multiple millions of dollars and can have varying durations\ndepending on the size, scope, and complexity of the project.\nThe Company’s workforce typically provides the full scope of engineering and other contract services. However, with respect to certain specialty services or\nother compliance requirements within a particular contract, we may engage third-party sub-consultants.\nCommon Stock Offering\nOn April 1, 2024, the Company closed on an offering of common stock in which it issued and sold 1,323,530 shares at an offering price of $34.00 per share,\nresulting in net proceeds of $42.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before expenses of the offering.\nOn April 1, 2024, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 179,412 shares of the Company’s common stock at an offering price of\n$34.00 per share, resulting in additional gross proceeds of approximately $6.1 million. After giving effect to this exercise of the overallotment option, the total\nnumber of shares sold by the Company in this common stock offering increased to 1,502,942 shares with gross proceeds of approximately $51.1 million. The\nexercise of the over-allotment option closed on April 1, 2024, at which time the Company received net proceeds of $5.7 million after underwriting discounts and\ncommissions.\nDeferred offering costs consist primarily of accounting, legal and other fees related to the common stock offering. Prior to the offering, all deferred costs were\ncapitalized within prepaid and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. We capitalized $0.2 million of deferred offering costs within prepaid and other\ncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. No deferred offering costs were capitalized in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as\nof September 30, 2024.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and footnotes of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and applicable regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)\nregarding interim financial information. In the opinion of management, the interim financial information includes all adjustments of a normal recurring nature\nnecessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations, financial position, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows. The results of operations for the\ncurrent period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year or the results for any future periods.\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related\nfootnotes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 12, 2024.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All\nintercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n8\nTable of Contents\n2. Significant Accounting Policies\nThe following is a summary of the significant accounting policies and principles used in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements:\nEmerging Growth Company\nSection 102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or\nrevised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not\nhave a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) are required to comply with the new or revised\nfinancial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that\napply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period\nwhich means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth\ncompany, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s\nfinancial statements with another public company that is either not an emerging growth company or, an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the\nextended transition period, difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs discussed in Note 1, the Company provides a variety of engineering and related professional services to customers located throughout the United States.\nThe Company enters into agreements with clients that create enforceable rights and obligations and for which it is probable that the Company will collect the\nconsideration to which it will be entitled as services transfer to the customer. It is customary practice for the Company to have written agreements with its customers\nand revenue on oral or implied arrangements is generally not recognized. The Company recognizes revenue based on the consideration specified in the applicable\nagreement. Excluded from the transaction price are amounts collected on behalf of third parties for sales and similar taxes.\nLong-term contracts typically contain billing terms that provide for invoicing once a month and payment on a net 30-day basis. Exceptions to monthly billing\nare to ensure that the Company performs satisfactorily and do not represent a significant financing component. For example, certain fixed price contracts provide for\nmilestone billings based upon the attainment of specific project objectives to ensure the Company meets its contractual requirements rather than monthly billing.\nAnother example is, contracts that include retentions or holdbacks paid at the end of a project to ensure that the Company meets the contract requirements. The\nCompany does not assess whether a contract contains a significant financing component if the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between\npayment by the customer and the transfer of promised services to the customer will be less than one year.\nAs a professional services engineering firm, the Company generally recognizes revenue over time as control transfers to a customer based upon the extent of\nprogress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation.\nFor services delivered under fixed price contracts, the Company uses the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs since costs incurred (an input\nmethod) represents a reasonable measure of progress towards the satisfaction of a performance obligation in order to estimate the portion of revenue earned. This\nmethod faithfully depicts the transfer of value to the customer when the Company is satisfying a performance obligation that entails a number of interrelated tasks or\nactivities for a combined output that requires the Company to coordinate the work of employees and sub-consultants. Contract costs typically include direct labor,\nsubcontract and consultant costs, materials and indirect costs related to contract performance. Changes in estimated costs to complete these obligations result in\nadjustments to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis, so that revised estimates are recognized in the current period. Changes in estimates can routinely occur over\nthe contract term for a variety of reasons including, changes in scope, unanticipated costs, delays or favorable or unfavorable progress that differ from original\nexpectations. In situations where the remaining estimated costs to perform exceed the consideration to be received, the Company accrues the entire estimated loss\nduring the period the loss becomes known.\nWhen a performance obligation is billed using a time-and-material type contract, the Company measures its progress to complete based upon the hours\nincurred for the period times contractually agreed upon billing rates plus any materials delivered or consumed in the project. When applicable, the Company will\nrecognize revenue under these contracts as invoiced under the practical expedient.\n9\nTable of Contents\nIn certain situations, it is possible that two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract, or a single contract should be\naccounted for as multiple performance obligations. This requires significant judgment and could impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition. Such\ndeterminations are made using management’s best estimate and knowledge of contracts and related performance obligations.\nThe Company’s contracts may contain variable consideration in the form of unpriced or pending change orders or claims that either increase or decrease the\ncontract price. Variable consideration is generally estimated using the expected value method but may from time to time be estimated using the most likely amount\nmethod depending on the circumstance. Estimated amounts are included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative\nrevenue recognized will not occur or when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Estimates of variable consideration are based upon\nhistorical experience and known trends.\nThe Company recognizes claims against vendors, sub-consultants, and others as a reduction in costs when the contract establishes enforceability, and the\namounts of recovery are reasonably estimable and probable. Reduction in costs are recognized at the lesser of the amount management expects to recover or costs\nincurred.\nContract related assets and liabilities are classified as current assets and current liabilities. Significant balance sheet accounts related to the revenue cycle are as\nfollows:\nAccounts receivables, net:\nAccounts receivable, net (contract receivables) includes amounts billed under the contract terms. The amounts are stated at their net realizable value. The\nCompany maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated number of receivables that will not be collected. The Company considers several\nfactors in its estimated expected credit losses including knowledge of a client’s financial condition, its historical collection experience, and other factors relevant to\nassessing the collectability of such receivables. No single client accounted for more than 10% of the Company's outstanding receivables at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023.\nContract Assets:\nContract Assets are recorded when progress to completion revenue earned on contracts exceeds amounts billed under the contract. It may also include contract\nretainages that can be billed once contract stipulations are satisfied.\nContract Liabilities:\nContract Liabilities are recorded when amounts billed under a contract exceeds the progress to completion revenue earned under the contract.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts and Expected Credit Losses\nThe Company records accounts receivable net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is determined based upon management’s review of the\nestimated collectability of the specific accounts receivable, client type, client credit worthiness, plus a general provision based upon the historical loss experience and\nexisting economic conditions. The Company charges off uncollectible amounts against the allowance for doubtful accounts once management determines the\namount, or a portion thereof, to be worthless. Upon determination that a specific receivable is uncollectible, the receivable is written off against the allowance for\nexpected credit losses. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the balance in the allowance for expected credit losses was $2.8 million and $2.2 million,\nrespectively.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and\nexpenses during the reporting period. Actual results could vary from the estimates and assumptions that were used.\nConcentration of Credit Risk and other Concentrations\nThe Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and accounts receivable.\nCash balances at various times during the year may exceed the amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company’s cash deposits are\nheld in institutions whose credit ratings are monitored by management, and the Company has not incurred any losses related to such deposits.\n10\nTable of Contents\nThe Company can, at times, be subject to a concentration of credit risk with respect to outstanding accounts receivable. However, the Company believes no\nsuch concentration existed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company’s customers are located\nthroughout the United States across diverse market sectors. Although the Company generally grants credit without collateral, management believes that its contract\nacceptance, billing, and collection policies are adequate to minimize material credit risk. Also, for non-governmental customers, the Company can often place\nmechanics liens against the real property associated with the contract in the event of non-payment.\nFair Value Measurements\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC Topic 820”) provides the framework for measuring and\nreporting financial assets and liabilities at fair value. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability\n(an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.\nThe codification establishes a three-level disclosure hierarchy to indicate the level of judgment used to estimate fair value measurements:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date;\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and\ninputs other than quoted prices (such as interest rate and yield curves);\nLevel 3: Uses inputs that are unobservable, supported by little or no market activity and reflect significant management judgment.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n• The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to the\nrelatively short duration of these instruments;\n• The carrying amounts of debt obligations approximate their fair values as the terms are comparable to terms currently offered by local financial\ninstitutions for arrangements with similar terms to industry peers with comparable credit characteristics. Accordingly, the debt obligations involve Level 3\nfair value inputs;\nFair value measurements relating to our business combinations are made primarily using Level 3 inputs including discounted cash flow and to the extent\napplicable, Monte Carlo simulation techniques. Fair value for the identified intangible assets is generally estimated using inputs primarily for the income approach\nusing the multiple period excess earnings method. The significant assumptions used in estimating fair value include (i) revenue projections of the business, including\nprofitability, (ii) attrition rates and (iii) the estimated discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with receiving future cash flows. Other personal property\nassets, such as property, plant and equipment, are valued using the cost approach, which is based on replacement or reproduction costs of the asset less depreciation.\nThe fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated using published treasury rates in the Wall St. Journal and discounting the present value along with other\nsignificant assumptions which include projections of revenue, and probabilities of meeting those projections, as well as Monte Carlo simulation techniques.\nThe following is a summary of change in contingent consideration:\nFor the Nine Months Ended For the Year Ended\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nBalance at beginning of period $ 10,567 $ 487\nFair value of contingent consideration issuances 1,874 10,379\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration 321 (299)\nSettlement of contingent consideration (3,518) –\nBalance at end of period $ 9,244 $ 10,567\n11\nTable of Contents\nThe change in fair value consideration is included in Other Expense in the Condensed Consolidated Income Statement.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognizes deferred income tax assets or liabilities for expected future tax consequences of events recognized in the condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income tax assets or liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the financial\nstatement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply when the differences settle or become realized. Valuation\nallowances are provided when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset is not realizable or recoverable in the future. As of September 30, 2024, no valuation\nallowances are required, and all deferred tax assets are realizable.\nThe Company assesses uncertain tax positions to determine whether income tax positions will more likely than not be sustained upon examination by the\nInternal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. If the Company cannot reach a more-likely-than-not determination, no benefit is recorded. If the Company\ndetermines that the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, the Company records the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized\nwhen the tax position is settled. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Beginning January 1,\n2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current year and now requires\ntaxpayers to capitalize and amortize research and development costs pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 174. The capitalized expenses are amortized over a\n5-year period for domestic expenses and a 15-year period for foreign expenses. As of December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an uncertain tax return of\n$42.5 million related to its position regarding Section 174 costs. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company made a determination to change its accounting\nmethod for Section 174 costs, and accordingly, released an uncertain tax position reserve of $47.9 million associated with the previously established position. While\nthis method change is a timing difference between current and deferred taxes, the effect of this release generated an income tax benefit of $4.0 million as a result of a\ndecrease in accrued tax penalties and interest. In October 2024, the Company reevaluated its previous determination in this matter and concluded there was a\nreasonable basis to file the 2023 income tax return under its historical accounting method for Section 174 costs. Accordingly, the Company has re-established the\naforementioned uncertain tax position, and determined that accrued penalties are no longer necessary based on the tax filing position and disclosure. As of the quarter\nended September 30, 2024, the Company's uncertain tax position reserve for Section 174 costs was $51.1 million.\nThe Company recognizes the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The\nCompany’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 69.5% and 233.4%, respectively. The change in the Company’s effective\ntax rate is predominantly due to changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate and certain non-recurring discrete events, as discussed below. The most prominent\nfactors impacting the estimated annual effective tax rate include an increase in projected R&D credits generated for 2024, an increase in the projected limitations of\nthe deductible executive compensation for 2024, and an overall reduction in forecasted income for 2024 relative to 2023. With respect to the projected R&D credit,\nthe Company anticipates the 2024 generated R&D credit to be $3.5 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to the projected R&D credit to be generated of\n$2.9 million as of September 30, 2023. Similarly, the Company anticipates the annual projected limitation on the deductibility of executive compensation to be\n$21.3 million for 2024 as compared to $7.9 million for 2023.\nFurther, the Company also recognized a net discrete benefit of $7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net discrete\nbenefit of $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net discrete benefit is predominantly the result of a windfall tax benefit for restricted\nstock awards, penalties and interest recorded for uncertain tax positions, and other non-recurring adjustments. More specifically, the windfall tax adjustment for\nrestricted stock awards recognized at a value higher than the grant date fair value is $4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and $2.1 million for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023. Penalties and interest accrued for uncertain tax positions was $1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, and $0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, there was a one-time $4.0 million decrease in accrued penalties and interest for\nthe reversal of the uncertain tax position for Section 174 costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as discussed above. Further, for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, the Company recognized a non-recurring $0.2 million reduction to the state income tax payable. These factors increased the rate by 74.4% for\nthe quarter ended September 30, 2024, and increased the rate by 186.6% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and certain states in which it operates. Based on the timing of the filing of certain tax\nreturns, the Company’s federal income tax returns for tax years 2020 and thereafter\n12\nTable of Contents\nremain subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The statute of limitations on the Company’s state income tax returns generally conforms to the\nfederal three-year statute of limitations.\nSegments\nThe Company operates in one segment based upon the financial information used by its chief operating decision maker in evaluating the financial\nperformance of its business and allocating resources. The single segment represents the Company’s core business of providing engineering and related professional\nservices to its customers.\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\nAccounting guidance not yet adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures, which requires disclosure of significant segment expenses and other segment items in annual and interim periods. ASU 2023-07 is effective for\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and requires retrospective application to\nall prior periods presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the new standard.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires disaggregated information about an entity’s\neffective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and\nshould be applied prospectively. Retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the new standard.\nOther than those noted above, which are still being evaluated, the Company does not believe that any other recently issued standards will have a material effect\non its condensed consolidated financial statements.\n3. Earnings (loss) Per Share and Certain Related Information\nBasic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to the Company available to common stockholders by the weighted\naverage number of common shares outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the\npotential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were either exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the\nissuance of common stock that would share in the earnings (loss) of the Company. The dilutive effect of options is reflected in diluted earnings (loss) per share by\napplication of the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of shares to be purchased under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan is reflected in diluted\nearnings (loss) per share by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding that would have been outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of\nconvertible debt is reflected in diluted earnings (loss) per share by application of the if-converted method. The Company uses the two-class method to determine\nearnings (loss) per share.\nFor calculating basic earnings (loss) per share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the weighted average number of shares outstanding\nexclude 1,225,485 and 1,329,013 non-vested restricted shares and 2,291 and 3,561 unexercised substantive options. The computation of diluted earnings per share\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 did not assume the effect of restricted shares or substantive options because the effects were antidilutive.\nFor calculating basic earnings per share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the weighted average number of shares outstanding exclude\n1,795,553 and 1,806,070 non-vested restricted shares and 7,273 and 8,501 unexercised substantive options. The computation of diluted earnings per share for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023 did not assume the effect of restricted shares or substantive options because the effects were antidilutive.\n13\nTable of Contents\nThe following table represents a reconciliation of the net income (loss) and weighted average shares outstanding for the calculation of basic and diluted\nearnings (loss) per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except share data):\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator\nNet income (loss) $ 771 $ 1,183 $ (2,869) $ 1,086\nEarnings allocated to non-vested shares 53 146 – 140\nTotal $ 718 $ 1,037 $ (2,869) $ 946\nDenominator\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 16,537,472 12,814,971 15,559,279 12,304,751\nEffect of dilutive nominal options – – – –\nEffect of dilutive contingently earned shares 297,865 978,149 – 1,133,090\nDilutive average shares outstanding 16,835,337 13,793,120 15,559,279 13,437,841\nBasic income (loss) per share $ 0.04 $ 0.08 $ (0.18) $ 0.08\nDilutive income (loss) per share $ 0.04 $ 0.08 $ (0.18) $ 0.07\nShare Repurchases\nOn November 17, 2023, the board of directors authorized a $10 million share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to\n$10 million of our common stock. On August 16, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to this repurchase authorization from $10 million to\n$25 million (collectively referred to as the \"2023 Repurchase Authorization\"). The authorization is effective through August 31, 2025. The execution of the\nrepurchase program is expected to be consistent with the Company’s strategic initiatives which prioritize investments in organic and acquisitive growth. The timing\nand amount of any share repurchases will be determined by management at its discretion based on several factors including share price, market conditions and capital\nallocation priorities. Shares may be repurchased from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means, including\nthe use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, in accordance with applicable securities laws and other restrictions. The\nshare repurchase program does not obligate Bowman to acquire a specific number of shares of common stock and may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at\nany time without notice.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 563,521 shares of common stock at an average price per share of $24.75, and\nhas $11.1 million remaining under the 2023 Repurchase Authorization.\n4. Acquisitions\nBusiness Combinations\nSurdex Corporation\nOn April 2, 2024, the Company entered into a merger agreement with Surdex Corporation (“Surdex”), a St. Louis-based geospatial and engineering services\nfirm providing low, medium and high-altitude digital orthoimagery, advanced high-resolution LiDAR, intelligent digital mapping, 3D hydrography, and disaster\nmapping. The Company paid total consideration of $43.3 million, which was comprised of cash, promissory note, common stock and assumed liabilities. The shares\nare subject to a six-month lock up. The promissory note bears a simple interest rate fixed at 6.50%, and is payable in equal quarterly payments of principal and\ninterest beginning July 2024 and ending July 2027. The merger agreement contains a contingent consideration feature which affords the sellers the opportunity to\nearn additional consideration in the form of the Company's common stock, depending on the average trading price of the Company's common stock for the 90\ntrading days post-acquisition. For tax purposes, the Surdex transaction is considered a tax-free merger, in which the assets have been recorded at their respective\ncarrying values. As a result, there is no corresponding tax goodwill, and therefore no tax goodwill to be amortized or otherwise deductible.\n14\nTable of Contents\nThe following summarizes the preliminary calculations of the fair values of Surdex assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date (in\nthousands):\n(in thousands) Surdex\nAssets:\nAccounts receivable, net $ 4,052\nContract assets 3,210\nPrepaid and other current assets 1,956\nProperty and equipment, net 15,085\nOperating lease, right-of-use assets 1,030\nGoodwill 17,685\nOther intangible assets 12,810\nTotal assets acquired: $ 55,828\nLiabilities:\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities, current portion $ 3,937\nContract liabilities 685\nOther non-current obligations 10,689\nOperating lease obligation, less current portion 1,030\nDeferred tax liability 7,067\nTotal liabilities assumed: $ 23,408\nNet assets acquired: $ 32,420\nCash flow reconciling items:\nIssuance of common stock as partial consideration $ (16,536)\nCash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired $ 15,884\nThe purchase price allocation, including the residual amount allocated to goodwill, is based on preliminary information and is subject to change as additional\ninformation concerning final asset and liability valuations are obtained and management completes its reassessment of the measurement period procedures based on\nthe results of the preliminary valuation. During the applicable measurement period, the Company will adjust assets and liabilities if new information is obtained\nabout facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in revised estimated values of those assets or liabilities as of\nthat date.

Goodwill results from an\nassembled workforce, which does not qualify for separate recognition, as well as expected future synergies from combining operations. For asset acquisitions, all the\ngoodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. For three of the acquisitions, the purchase agreement includes a contingent consideration feature,\nwhich affords the sellers the opportunity to earn additional consideration in the form of the Company's common stock, cash and non-negotiable promissory notes,\nbased on certain financial performance thresholds.

After giving effect to this exercise of the overallotment option, the total number of shares sold by the Company in this\ncommon stock offering increased to 1,502,942 shares with total gross proceeds of approximately $51.1 million. The exercise of the overallotment option closed on\nApril 1, 2024, at which time the Company received net proceeds of $5.7 million after underwriting discounts and commissions.\nMethods of Evaluation\nWe use a variety of financial and other information in monitoring the financial condition and operating performance of our business. Some of the information\nwe use to evaluate our operations is financial information that is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), while other information may\nbe financial in nature and either built upon GAAP results or may not be in accordance with GAAP (Non-GAAP). We use all this information together for planning\nand monitoring our operations, as well as determining certain management and employee compensation.\nThe Company operates as a single business segment represented by our core business of providing multi-disciplinary professional engineering solutions to\ncustomers. While we evaluate revenue and other key performance indicators relating to various divisions of labor, our leadership neither manages the business nor\ndeliberately allocates resources by service line, geography, or end market. Our financial statements present results as a single operating segment.\nComponents of Income and Expense\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from services performed by our employees, pass-through fees from sub-consultants, and reimbursable contract costs. On our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements, we report gross revenue, which represents total revenue billed to customers excluding taxes collected from customers. Gross\nrevenue less revenue derived from pass-through sub-consultant fees, reimbursable expenses and other direct expenses represents our net service billing, or that\nportion of our gross revenue attributable to services performed by our employees. Our peers use the calculation underlying net service billing to normalize peer\nperformance assessments and provide meaningful insight into trends over time. Refer to — Other Financial Data, Non-GAAP measurements and Key Performance\nIndicators below for further discussion of the use of this non-GAAP financial measure.\nWe generally do not generate profit from the pass-through of sub-consultants and reimbursable expenses. As such, contract profitability is most heavily\nimpacted by the mix of labor utilized to complete the tasks and the efficiency of those resources in completing the tasks. Our largest direct contract cost is\nconsistently our labor. To grow our revenue and maximize overall profitability we carefully monitor and manage our cost of labor and the utilization thereof.\nMaintaining an optimal level of utilization on a balanced pool of growing labor resources represents our greatest prospect for delivering increasing profitability.\nWe enter into contracts that contain two types of pricing characteristics:\nHourly contracts, also referred to as time and materials, are common for professional and technical consulting assignments both short-term and multi-year in\nduration. Under these types of contracts, there is no predetermined maximum fee and we generally experience no risk associated with cost overruns. For hourly\ncontracts, we negotiate billing rates and charge our customers based upon the actual hours expended toward a deliverable. These contracts may have not-to-exceed\nparameters requiring us to receive additional authorizations from our customer to continue working, but we likewise do not have to continue working without\nassurances of payment for such additional work. Hourly assignments represented approximately $9.8 million and $30.2 million or 9% and 10% of our gross contract\nrevenue for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. For each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, hourly\nassignments represented approximately $11.4 million and $28.5 million or 12% and 11% of our gross contract revenue, respectively.\n33\nTable of Contents\nLump sum contracts, also referred to as fixed fee, typically require the performance of some, or all, of the obligations under the contract for a specified amount,\nsubject to price adjustments only if the scope of the project changes or unforeseen requirements arise. Our fixed fee contracts generally include a specific scope of\nwork and defined deliverables. Lump sum contracts can involve both hourly and fixed fee tasks. The majority of our assignments are lump sum in nature\nrepresenting approximately $104.1 million and $283.1 million or 91% and 90% of our gross contract revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively. For each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, assignments that are lump sum in nature represented approximately $83.0\nmillion and $224.8 million or 88% and 89% of our gross contract revenue, respectively. Recognizing revenue from lump sum assignments requires management\nestimates of both total contract value when there are contingent compensation elements of the fee arrangement and expected cost at completion. We closely monitor\nour progress to completion and adjust our estimates when necessary. We do not recognize revenue from work that has no documented customer commitment and is\nperformed at risk.\nContract Costs\nContract costs consist of direct payroll costs, sub-consultant costs and other direct expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nDirect payroll costs represent the portion of salaries and wages incurred in connection with the production of deliverables under customer assignments and\ncontracts. Direct payroll costs include allocated fringe costs (i.e. health benefits, employer payroll taxes, and retirement plan contributions), paid leave and incentive\ncompensation.\nSub-consultants and direct expenses include both sub-consultants and other outside costs associated with performance under our contracts. Sub-consultant and\ndirect costs are generally reimbursable by our customers under the terms of our contracts.\nPerformance under our contracts does not involve significant machinery or other long term depreciable assets. Most of the equipment we employ involves\ndesktop computers and other shared ordinary course IT equipment. We present direct costs exclusive of depreciation and amortization and as such we do not present\ngross profit on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expenses consist of selling, general and administrative costs, non-cash stock compensation, depreciation and amortization and settlements and other\nnon-core expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses represent corporate and other general overhead expenses, salaries and wages not allocated to customer projects\nincluding management and administrative personnel costs, incentive compensation, personal leave, office lease and occupancy costs, legal, professional and\naccounting fees.\nNon-cash stock compensation represents the expenses incurred with respect to shares and options issued by the Company, both vested and unvested, to\nemployees as long-term incentives. Non-cash stock compensation cost will be the grant date fair value of the awards, or the Black-Scholes-Merton value of stock\noptions on the grant date, recognized ratably over the vesting period(s) of each award. Future non-cash stock compensation expense for unvested shares is the\ncumulative total of the unvested portion of all issued and outstanding awards and their individual grant date fair values. Stock awards will continue to be an\nimportant part of our long-term retention and rewards philosophy.\nDepreciation and amortization represent the depreciation and amortization expense of our property and general IT equipment, capital lease assets, tenant\nimprovements and intangible assets.\n(Gain) loss on sale represents gains or losses inclusive of foreign exchange and accumulated depreciation recapture resulting from the disposal of an asset upon\nthe sale or retirement of such asset.\n34\nTable of Contents\nOther (Income) Expense\nOther (income) expense consists of other non-operating and non-core expenses, including transaction related costs associated with acquisitions.\nTax (Benefit) Expense\nIncome tax (benefit) expense, current and deferred, includes estimated federal, state and local tax expense associated with our net income, as apportioned to the\nstates in which we operate. Estimates of our tax expense include both current and deferred tax expense along with all available tax incentives and credits.\nOther Financial Data, Non-GAAP Measurements and Key Performance Indicators\nBacklog\nWe measure the value of our undelivered gross revenue in real time to calculate our backlog and predict future revenue. Backlog includes awarded, contracted,\nand otherwise secured commitments along with revenue we expect to realize over time for predictable long-term and reoccurring assignments. We report backlog\nquarterly as of the end of the last day of the reporting period. We use backlog to predict revenue growth and anticipate appropriate future staffing needs. Backlog\ndefinitions and methods of calculation vary within our industry. As such, backlog is not a reliable metric on which to evaluate us relative to our peers. Backlog\nneither derives from, nor reconciles to, any GAAP results.\nNet Service Billing\nIn the normal course of providing services to our customers, we routinely subcontract services and incur direct third-party contract expenses that may or may\nnot be reimbursable and may or may not be billed to customers with mark-up. Gross revenue less revenue derived from pass-through sub-consultant fees and\nreimbursable expenses represents our net service billing, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, and is the portion of our gross contract revenue attributable to\nservices performed by our employees. Because the ratio of sub-contractor and direct expense costs to gross billing varies between contracts, gross revenue is not\nnecessarily indicative of trends in our business. As a professional services company, we believe that metrics derived from net service billings more accurately\ndemonstrate the productivity and profitability of our workforce than do those derived from gross revenue. Our industry uses the calculation of net service billing to\nnormalize peer performance assessments and provide meaningful insight into trends over time.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe view Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as an important indicator of normalized performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as\nnet income before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization, plus discontinued expenses, non-core legal settlements and other costs not in the\nordinary course of business, non-cash stock-based compensation, and other acquisition related adjustments such as professional fees, fair value adjustments and\nworking capital adjustments. Our peers may define Adjusted EBITDA differently.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin, net\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin, net, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, represents Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, as a percentage of net service\nbillings, as defined above.\n35\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nCombined results of operations\nThe following represents our condensed consolidated results of operations for periods indicated (in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nGross contract revenue $ 113,932 $ 94,434 $ 313,341 $ 253,290\nContract costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 54,282 45,693 150,779 124,098\nOperating expense 59,217 46,125 165,974 126,155\nIncome (loss) from operations 433 2,616 (3,412) 3,037\nOther expense 1,572 1,495 6,000 3,852\nIncome tax (benefit) (1,910) (62) (6,543) (1,901)\nNet income (loss) $ 771 $ 1,183 $ (2,869) $ 1,086\nNet margin 0.7 % 1.3 % (0.9)% 0.4 %\nOther financial information 1\nNet service billing $ 101,363 $ 82,124 $ 281,033 $ 223,479\nAdjusted EBITDA 16,970 15,057 42,511 35,783\nAdjusted EBITDA margin, net 16.7 % 18.3 % 15.1 % 16.0 %\n1 Represents non-GAAP financial measures. See Other Financial Information and Non-GAAP key performance indicators below.\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023\nGross Contract Revenue\nGross contract revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased $19.5 million or 20.6% to $113.9 million as compared to $94.4 million for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross contract revenue attributable to work performed by our\nworkforce increased $19.3 million, or 23.5% to $101.4 million or 89.0% of gross contract revenue as compared to $82.1 million or 87.0% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 (see Net service billing – non-GAAP). Of the $19.5 million increase in gross contract revenue during the three months ended September 30,\n2024, acquisitions represented $23.3 million of the increase. To evaluate the Company’s growth, revenue from acquisitions is treated as acquired for a period of four\nquarters post-closing, after which it is considered organic. For each measurement and comparison period, historical balances of acquired and organic revenue bases\nare adjusted to reflect revenue accordingly.\nChanges in gross contract revenue disaggregated between our core and emerging end markets were as follows (in thousands other than percentages):\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\nConsolidated Gross Contract Revenue 2024 %GCR 2023 %GCR Change % Change\nBuilding Infrastructure3 $ 56,174 49.3 % $ 51,909 55.0 % $ 4,265 8.2 %\nTransportation 21,851 19.2 % 19,769 20.9 % 2,082 10.5 %\nPower & Utilities3 20,041 17.6 % 18,586 19.7 % 1,455 7.8 %\nOther Emerging Markets 1 15,866 13.9 % 4,170 4.4 % 11,696 280.5 %\nTotal: $ 113,932 100.0 % $ 94,434 100.0 % $ 19,498 20.6 %\nAcquired 2 $ 23,332 20.5 % $ 15,431 16.3 % $ 7,901 51.2 %\n1 Represents environmental, mining, water resources, imaging and mapping and other.\n36\nTable of Contents\n2 Acquired revenue in prior periods is as previously reported; four quarters post-closing, acquired revenue is reclassified as organic for the purpose of calculating organic growth rates.\n3 Includes periodic reclassifications of revenue between categories from prior periods for consistency of presentation.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross contract revenue from our building infrastructure market increased $4.3 million or 8.2% as compared to\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023. Building Infrastructure includes commercial, municipal and residential infrastructure. The increase in building\ninfrastructure revenue is the result of acquisitions. Within the building infrastructure market, 39.3% of gross contract revenue was derived from residential\nassignments including single family, multi-family and mixed-use housing stock, 42.9% from commercial assignments including retail, hospitality and quick-serve\nrestaurants (QSR), office and industrial, data centers and healthcare, and 17.7% from municipal assignments, including parks and schools. Within residential, 59.8%\nof gross contract revenue was derived from for-sale homebuilding assignments, 35.7% from residential multi-family and 4.5% from mixed use projects. While the\nhomebuilding market shows signs of rebounding from prior year interest rate impacts, for-sale residential services represented just 11.6% of our total gross contract\nrevenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Within commercial, 36.7% of revenue was derived from office and industrial assignments, 41.3% from\nretail, hospitality, and quick serve restaurants, 15.7% from data centers, and 6.2% from healthcare. We continue to experience strong demand for our building\ninfrastructure services and maintain a positive outlook on this market as we continue to experience strength in markets including data centers, quick serve\nrestaurants, industrial distribution facilities, schools, and build-for-rent communities.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from transportation increased $2.1 million or 10.5% as compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to new contract awards in transportation both from public and private customers along with acquired\ntransportation backlog which we were able to deliver to customers, within transportation, 64.5% of our gross contract revenue was derived directly from public\nsector customers including state and local departments of transportation (\"DOTs\"), tollway operators, transit authorities aviation operators and others with the\nremaining 35.5% derived from private sector customers. We expect to continue to increase our transportation revenue and improve the diversification of our revenue.\nWe believe the transportation market continues to present significant opportunity for future growth and we remain committed to investing in leadership, technical\nexpertise, business development and acquisitions for this market.\nWith the convergence of renewable energy with traditional transmission infrastructure and the continued growth we are projecting in the clean energy\ntransition, we have consolidated renewable energy into the power and utilities category (sometimes referred to herein as the power, utilities and energy market) of\nour revenue mix and have adjusted historical balances accordingly. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from power and utilities increased $1.5\nmillion or 7.8% as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The additional increase in gross contract revenue from the power and utilities market is\nprincipally attributable to acquisitions and increased revenue associated with the expansion of a multi-year utility undergrounding assignment in Florida, along with\nadditional increases derived from gas pipeline and electric transmission projects nationally. Within the power and utilities market, 73.8% of our gross contract\nrevenue was derived from customers operating traditional power operations and 26.2% was derived from customers focused on renewables, electric vehicle (\"EV\")\ninfrastructure and energy transition operations. The power and utilities market continues to experience increasing infrastructure investment as changing weather\npatterns, energy transition mandates and other safety initiatives positively impact demand for the services we provide. Based on recent increases in program\ncommitments within the gas pipeline replacement market, we believe trends in power and utilities provide meaningful opportunity for continued growth and we are\ncommitted to investing resources accordingly.\nOur other emerging markets consist of mining, water resources, imaging and mapping, environmental consulting, and other natural resources services. Adjusted\nfor the change, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from emerging markets increased $11.7 million or 280.5% as compared to the three months\nended September 30, 2023. This increase is primarily due to the acquisition of Surdex Corporation; see Note 4 - Acquisitions for additional information. Emerging\nmarket sectors represent lines of business that have not yet grown to a size whereby we would distinguish them as a separate market. Gross contract revenue within\nour emerging markets was 54.0% from imaging and mapping activities, 12.9% from mining activities where we have specialized in copper mining, 25.3% from\nwater resources activities, and 7.8% from environmental and other natural resources consulting. Scarcities in water resources and the increasing need for water\nmanagement gives us confidence that we will be able to increase revenue accordingly. With recent and future acquisitions, we expect to experience continued growth\nfrom investment in various emerging market services.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, public sector customers, defined as direct contracts with municipalities, public agencies, or\ngovernmental authorities, represented 32.3% and 14.8% of our gross contract revenue, respectively. A portion of that increase is due to the reclassification of\ncontracts for the Pike Corporation from the private\n37\nTable of Contents\nsector to the public sector. This does not include work done indirectly on public sector projects. Gross contract revenue from projects for public sector clients are\nincluded in the end market most aligned with work performed.\nContract costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\nTotal contract costs, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased $8.6 million or 18.8% to $54.3 million for the three months ended September 30,\n2024, as compared to $45.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total contract costs\nrepresented 47.7% and 48.4% of total contract revenue, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 total contract costs represented\n53.6% and 55.6% of revenue attributable to our workforce, respectively (see Net Service Billing).\nDirect payroll costs increased $8.3 million or 24.9% to $41.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $33.4 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023. Direct payroll accounted for 76.8% of total contract costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of\n3.7 percentage points as compared to 73.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nDirect labor, the component of direct payroll costs associated with the cost of labor relating to work performed on contracts increased $5.8 million or 22.8% to\n$31.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $25.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in direct\nlabor is primarily due to an increase in staffing to accommodate growth. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, direct labor costs represented\n27.4% and 26.9% of gross contract revenue, respectively and represented 30.8% and 30.9% of the revenue attributable to our workforce, respectively.\nOther direct payroll costs, the component of direct payroll costs associated with fringe and incentive compensation (cash and non-cash) increased by $2.6\nmillion or 32.5% to $10.6 million as compared to $8.0 million.\nSub-consultants and other direct expenses increased $0.3 million or 2.4% to $12.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to\n$12.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, sub-consultant and other direct expenses\nrepresented 11.1% and 13.0% of gross contract revenue, respectively. This decrease is not indicative of an anticipated long-term shift in the composition of our gross\ncontract revenue, and we expect to experience periodic volatility in concentration of sub-consultant utilization.\nOperating Expense\nTotal operating expense increased $13.1 million or 28.4% to $59.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $46.1 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $10.2 million or 24.5% to $51.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to\n$41.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Indirect labor increased $4.5 million or 23.6% to $23.6 million as compared to $19.1 million primarily\ndue to an increase in staffing to accommodate growth. General overhead increased $4.3 million or 32.6% to $17.5 million as compared to $13.2 million due to\nincreased costs associated with the overall growth of the Company.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $2.9 million or 64.4% to $7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $4.5 million for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is primarily due to an increase in intangible assets and assets leased under financing arrangements. We\ncontinue to increase the use of our finance lease facility as we continue to grow. Intangible assets have increased due to multiple acquisitions. Gains on the sale of\ncertain IT equipment and automobiles remained $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30,\n2023.\nOther (Income) Expense\nOther expense increased by $0.1 million to $1.6 million of expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $1.5 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\n38\nTable of Contents\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased $1.8 million to a $1.9 million benefit, as compared to $0.1 million benefit for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023, see note 2, Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024, is 167.7% as compared to\n(5.5)% for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nIncome (Loss) Before Tax and Net Income (Loss)\nLoss before tax increased by $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, to ($1.1) million of loss compared to $1.1 million of income for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023. Net income decreased by $0.4 million to $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $1.2\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nOther financial information and Non-GAAP key performance indicators\nNet service billing (non-GAAP)\nNet service billing increased $19.3 million or 23.5% to $101.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $82.1 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023. Net service billing reconciles to gross contract revenue as follows (in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nGross contract revenue $ 113,932 $ 94,434\nLess: sub-consultants and other direct expenses 12,569 12,310\nNet service billing $ 101,363 $ 82,124\nBecause sub-consultants and reimbursable expenses are most often pass-through items with little or no mark-up, they generally have a dilutive effect on gross,\noperating, and net margins while having little accretive effect on profitability. As such, where possible, we focus our resources and business development efforts\nprincipally on increasing revenue derived from our own workforce. Management primarily focuses its internal performance metrics on net service billing.\n39\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $1.9 million or 12.7% to $17.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $15.1 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Adjusted EBITDA also includes $0.4\nmillion and $0.1 million, respectively, relating to non-reocurring acquisition expenses such as professional fees, fair value adjustments and working capital\nadjustments.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin, net (non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin, net represents Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above) as a percentage of net service billing (as defined above). For the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, net was 16.7% and 18.3% respectively.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nGross Contract Revenue\nGross contract revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased $60.0 million or 23.7% to $313.3 million as compared to $253.3 million for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross contract revenue attributable to work performed by our workforce\nincreased $57.5 million, or 25.7% to $281.0 million or 89.7% of gross contract revenue as compared to $223.5 million or 88.2% for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 (see Net service billing – non-GAAP). Of the $60.0 million increase in gross contract revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nacquisitions represented $49.8 million of the increase. To evaluate the Company’s growth, revenue from acquisitions is treated as acquired for a period of four\nquarters post-closing, after which it is considered organic. For each measurement and comparison period, historical balances of acquired and organic revenue bases\nare adjusted to reflect revenue accordingly.\n40\nTable of Contents\nChanges in gross contract revenue disaggregated between our core and emerging end markets were as follows (in thousands other than percentages):\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\nConsolidated Gross Contract Revenue 2024 %GCR 2023 %GCR Change % Change\nBuilding Infrastructure3 $ 165,709 52.9 % $ 144,862 57.2 % $ 20,847 14.4 %\nTransportation 60,145 19.2 % 51,658 20.4 % 8,487 16.4 %\nPower & Utilities3 56,229 17.9 % 47,481 18.7 % 8,748 18.4 %\nOther Emerging Markets 1 31,258 10.0 % 9,289 3.7 % 21,969 236.5 %\nTotal: $ 313,341 100.0 % $ 253,290 100.0 % $ 60,051 23.7 %\nAcquired 2 $ 49,767 15.9 % $ 27,050 10.7 % $ 22,717 84.0 %\n1 Represents environmental, mining, water resources, imaging and mapping and other.\n2 Acquired revenue in prior periods is as previously reported; four quarters post-closing, acquired revenue is reclassified as organic for the purpose of calculating organic growth rates.\n3 Includes periodic reclassifications of revenue between categories from prior periods for consistency of presentation.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross contract revenue from our building infrastructure market increased $20.9 million or 14.4% as compared\nto the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Building infrastructure includes commercial, municipal and residential infrastructure. The increase in building\ninfrastructure revenue is the result of acquisitions. Within the building infrastructure market, 34.8% of gross contract revenue was derived from residential\nassignments including single family, multi-family and mixed-use housing stock, 45.3% from commercial assignments including retail, hospitality and quick-serve\nrestaurants (QSR), office and industrial, data centers and healthcare, and 19.9% from municipal assignments including, parks and schools. Within residential, 53.3%\nof gross contract revenue was derived from for-sale homebuilding assignments, 40.3% from residential multi-family and 6.4% from mixed use projects. While the\nhomebuilding market shows signs of rebounding from prior year interest rate impacts, for-sale residential services represented just 9.8% of our total gross contract\nrevenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Within commercial, 35.8% of revenue was derived from office and industrial assignments, 40.6% from\nretail, hospitality, and quick serve restaurants, 14.5% from data centers, and 9.1% from healthcare. We continue to experience strong demand for our building\ninfrastructure services and maintain a positive outlook on this market as we continue to experience strength in markets including data centers, quick serve\nrestaurants, industrial distribution facilities, schools, and build-for-rent communities.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from transportation increased $8.5 million or 16.4% as compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to new contract awards in transportation both from public and private customers along with acquired\ntransportation backlog which we were able to deliver to customers, within transportation, 62.0% of our gross contract revenue was derived directly from public\nsector customers including state and local departments of transportation (\"DOTs\"), tollway operators, transit authorities, aviation operators and others with the\nremaining 38.0% derived from private sector customers. We expect to continue to increase our transportation revenue and improve the diversification of our revenue.\nWe believe the transportation market continues to present significant opportunity for future growth and we remain committed to investing in leadership, technical\nexpertise, business development and acquisitions for this market.\nWith the convergence of renewable energy with traditional transmission infrastructure and the continued growth we are projecting in the clean energy\ntransition, we have consolidated renewable energy into the power and utilities category (sometimes referred to herein as the power, utilities and energy market) of\nour revenue mix and have adjusted historical balances accordingly. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from power and utilities increased $8.8\nmillion or 18.4% as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The additional increase in gross contract revenue from the power and utilities market is\nprincipally attributable to acquisitions and increased revenue associated with the expansion of a multi-year utility undergrounding assignment in Florida, and to\nincreases derived from gas pipeline and electric transmission projects nationally. Within the power and utilities market, 75.6% of our gross contract revenue was\nderived from customers operating traditional power operations and 24.4% was derived from customers focused on renewables, electric vehicle (\"EV\") infrastructure\nand energy transition operations. The power and utilities market continues to experience increasing infrastructure investment as changing weather patterns, energy\ntransition mandates and other safety initiatives positively impact demand for the services we provide. Based on recent increases in program\n41\nTable of Contents\ncommitments within the gas pipeline replacement market, we believe trends in power and utilities provide meaningful opportunity for continued growth and we are\ncommitted to investing resources accordingly.\nOur other emerging markets consist of mining, water resources, imaging and mapping, environmental consulting, and other natural resources services. Adjusted\nfor the change, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from emerging markets increased $22.0 million or 236.5% as compared to the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. This increase is primarily due to the acquisition of Surdex Corporation; see Note 4 - Acquisitions for additional information. Emerging\nmarket sectors represent lines of business that have not yet grown to a size whereby we would distinguish them as a separate market. Gross contract revenue within\nour emerging markets was 43.8% from imaging and mapping activities, 19.7% from mining activities where we have specialized in copper mining, 27.6% from\nwater resources activities, and 8.9% from environmental and other natural resources consulting. Scarcities in water resources and the increasing need for water\nmanagement gives us confidence that we will be able to increase revenue accordingly. With recent and future acquisitions, we expect to experience continued growth\nfrom investment in various emerging market services.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, public sector customers, defined as direct contracts with municipalities, public agencies, or\ngovernmental authorities, represented 26.0% and 12.8% of our gross contract revenue, respectively. A portion of that increase is due to the reclassification of\ncontracts for the Pike Corporation from the private sector to the public sector. This does not include work done indirectly on public sector projects. Gross contract\nrevenue from projects for public sector clients are included in the end market most aligned with work performed.\nContract costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\nTotal contract costs, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased $26.7 million or 21.5% to $150.8 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, as compared to $124.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total contract costs\nrepresented 48.1% and 49.0% of total contract revenue, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 total contract costs represented 53.7%\nand 55.5% of revenue attributable to our workforce, respectively (see Net Service Billing).\nDirect payroll costs increased $24.2 million or 25.7% to $118.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $94.3 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. Direct payroll accounted for 78.6% of total contract costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.6\npercentage points as compared to 76.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nDirect labor, the component of direct payroll costs associated with the cost of labor relating to work performed on contracts increased $17.5 million or 24.8%\nto $88.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $70.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in direct\nlabor is primarily due to an increase in staffing to accommodate growth. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, direct labor costs represented\n28.1% and 27.9% of gross contract revenue, respectively and represented 31.4% and 31.6% of the revenue attributable to our workforce, respectively.\nOther direct payroll costs, the component of direct payroll costs associated with fringe and incentive compensation (cash and non-cash) increased by $6.6\nmillion or 27.8% to $30.3 million as compared to $23.7 million. This increase includes a $1.6 million increase in non-cash stock compensation as several new stock\nawards were granted to Company leadership as well as employees in connection with acquisitions. Also, stock compensation has become a larger part of our\nemployee incentive plans.\nSub-consultants and other direct expenses increased $2.5 million or 8.4% to $32.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $29.8\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, sub-consultant and other direct expenses\nrepresented 10.3% and 11.8% of gross contract revenue, respectively. This decrease is not indicative of an anticipated long-term shift in the composition of our gross\ncontract revenue, and we expect to experience periodic volatility in concentration of sub-consultant utilization.\nOperating Expense\nTotal operating expense increased $39.8 million or 31.5% to $166.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $126.2 million for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $32.1 million or 28.2% to $145.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared\nto $113.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Indirect labor\n42\nTable of Contents\nincreased $14.8 million or 29.2% to $65.4 million as compared to $50.6 million primarily due to an increase in staffing to accommodate growth. General overhead\nincreased $12.4 million or 33.6% to $49.3 million as compared to $36.9 million due to increased costs associated with the overall growth of the Company.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $7.8 million or 60.9% to $20.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $12.8 million\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is primarily due to an increase in intangible assets and assets leased under financing arrangements. We\ncontinue to increase the use of our finance lease facility as we continue to grow. Intangible assets have increased due to multiple acquisitions. Gains on the sale of\ncertain IT equipment and automobiles increased $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30,\n2023.\nOther (Income) Expense\nOther expense increased by $2.1 million to $6.0 million of expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $3.9 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense of $2.3 million due to an increase in finance leases and\nnotes payable.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased $4.6 million to a $6.5 million benefit, as compared to $1.9 million benefit for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, see note 2, Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is 69.5% as compared to\n233.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nIncome (Loss) Before Tax and Net Income (Loss)\nLoss before tax increased by $8.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to ($9.4) million of loss compared to ($0.8) million of loss for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. Net loss increased by $4.0 million to ($2.9) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to\n$1.1 million of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nOther financial information and Non-GAAP key performance indicators\nNet service billing (non-GAAP)\nNet service billing increased $57.5 million or 25.7% to $281.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $223.5 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. Net service billing reconciles to gross contract revenue as follows (in thousands):\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nGross contract revenue $ 313,341 $ 253,290\nLess: sub-consultants and other direct expenses 32,308 29,811\nNet service billing $ 281,033 $ 223,479\nBecause sub-consultants and reimbursable expenses are most often pass-through items with little or no mark-up, they generally have a dilutive effect on gross,\noperating, and net margins while having little accretive effect on profitability. As such, where possible, we focus our resources and business development efforts\nprincipally on increasing revenue derived from our own workforce. Management primarily focuses its internal performance metrics on net service billing.\n43\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $6.7 million or 18.8% to $42.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $35.8 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Adjusted EBITDA also includes $2.4\nmillion and $0.9 million, respectively, relating to non-reocurring acquisition expenses such as professional fees, fair value adjustments and working capital\nadjustments.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin, net (non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin, net represents Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above) as a percentage of net service billing (as defined above). For the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, net was 15.1% and 16.0% respectively.\nBacklog (other key performance metrics)\nOur backlog increased $74.1 million or 24.2% to $379.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $305.7 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 our backlog was comprised as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nBuilding Infrastructure 46 % 55 %\nTransportation 29 % 24 %\nPower & Utilities 15 % 17 %\nOther Emerging Markets 10 % 4 %\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents balances, cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit\nFacility (as defined below), lease financing, proceeds from stock sales and other structured debt securities. Our principal uses of cash are operating expenses,\nworking capital requirements, capital\n44\nTable of Contents\nexpenditures, repayment of debt, acquisitions, and acquisition related payments. On September 30, 2024, we maintained a $100.0 million Revolving Credit Facility\nwith Bank of America N.A., our primary lender. See -\"Credit Facilities and Other Financing\" below for more information on our Revolving Credit Facility. Under\nthe terms of our Revolving Credit Facility, available cash in our primary operating account sweeps against the outstanding balance every evening. Our cash on hand\ntherefore generally consisted of petty cash and other non-operating funds not included in the nightly sweep. Cash on hand included the cash we kept in short-term\ninvestment accounts along with deposits and payments in transit in our operating sweep account. Our cash on hand decreased by $9.0 million on September 30, 2024\nas compared to December 31, 2023.\nWe regularly monitor our capital requirements and believe our sources of liquidity, including cash flow from operations, existing cash, and borrowing\navailability under our credit and lease facilities will be sufficient to fund our projected cash requirements and strategic initiatives for the next year. To the extent we\nexperience any potential liquidity or capital shortfalls relating to growth and acquisition, we currently expect to rely on debt financing to meet those shortfalls. We\nuse our equity as a component of consideration in acquisitions. In addition, depending on market conditions, we may opportunistically access the public debts and\nequity markets.\nWe are actively pursuing acquisitions as part of our strategic growth initiative. At any given time, we are assessing multiple opportunities at varying stages of\ndue diligence. These acquisition opportunities range in size, timing of closing, valuation, and composition of consideration. In connection with acquisitions, we use a\ncombination of cash, bank financing, seller financing, and equity to satisfy the purchase price. Currently, we have several acquisitions under consideration. There can\nbe no assurance that any opportunity in the process of being reviewed will close but we expect over time to utilize a meaningful portion of our current liquidity and\ncapital resources for acquisitions.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (amounts in thousands) 2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 12,382 $ 12,271\nNet cash used in investing activities (23,636) (16,999)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 2,227 5,877\nChange in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (9,027) 1,149\nCash and cash equivalents, end of period 11,660 14,431\nOperating Activities\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $12.4 million, which primarily consisted of ($2.9) million net\nloss, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense of $20.3 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $20.6 million, offset by deferred taxes of ($18.4)\nmillion and a net cash outflow of ($8.4) million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The net outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was\nprimarily due to a $10.8 million increase in accounts receivable resulting from a combination of acquired accounts receivable from acquisitions and an increased\nbilling to our clients, a $6.9 million increase in contract assets and liabilities, and a $6.4 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by\na $2.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $12.3 million, which primarily consisted of our $1.1 million\nnet income, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense of $18.3 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $12.8 million, and deferred taxes of ($11.1)\nmillion, offset by a net cash outflow of ($9.5) million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities before changes in\noperating assets and liabilities was $21.8 million. The net outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $14.6 million increase in\naccounts receivable resulting from increased billing to our clients, a $4.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and $10.3 million increase in contract\nassets and liabilities, partially offset by a $19.8 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\n45\nTable of Contents\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $6.6 million to $23.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $17.0 million for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash used for investing is primarily attributable to acquisitions that occurred in the first three quarters\nof 2024.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $2.2 million compared to $5.9 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023, a decrease of $3.7 million. The decrease in net cash provided by financing is primarily attributable to the net proceeds of $47.2 million\nfrom the common stock offering, $4.6 million from finance leases, $1.5 million from issuance of common stock, offset by the $13.0 million used for repayment of\nthe revolving line of credit and the fixed line, $11.0 million used for repayment of notes and $11.1 million used to purchase treasury shares.\nCredit Facilities and Other Financing\nOn May 2, 2024 the Company and certain of its subsidiaries as guarantors entered into a new credit agreement with lenders, Bank of America N.A, as\nAdministrative Agent, the Swingline Lender and L/C Issuer, and TD Bank, N.A. as syndication agent (the “New Credit Agreement”) which provides for a new $100\nmillion revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Revolving Credit Facility replaced the Company’s previous $70.0 million revolving credit\nfacility (the \"2022 Revolving Credit Facility\"), and its non-revolving fixed line of credit (\"Fixed Line #2\") with Bank of America, N.A. In addition, the Company and\ncertain of its subsidiaries entered into a Security and Pledge Agreement, dated as of May 2, 2024, with Bank of America, N.A., in its capacity as Administrative\nAgent. The New Credit Agreement is secured by all the assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors.\nUnder the New Credit Agreement, the Company is required to comply with certain covenants, including covenants on indebtedness, investments, liens and\nrestricted payments, as well as maintain certain financial covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio and leverage ratio of debt to EBITDA (as defined in the\nNew Credit Agreement). At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nAll outstanding principal on the Revolving Credit Facility is due on May 2, 2029. On September 30, 2024, the interest rates on the Revolving Credit Facility\nranged from 7.22% to 9.20%. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility was $32.3 million.\nWe utilize master lease facilities primarily with Honour Capital LLC (“Honour”) and Enterprise Leasing (“Enterprise”). The Honour Capital lease facility\nfinances our acquisition of IT infrastructure, geospatial and survey equipment, aircraft cameras and related equipment, furniture and other long-lived assets. On May\n3, 2024, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Surdex Corporation, entered into an Aircraft Loan and Security Agreement, Promissory Note and related\ntransaction documents, with Wingspire Finance LLC pursuant to which Surdex borrowed approximately $6.3 million secured by a pledge of its aircraft, aircraft\nengines and other equipment. The Company guaranteed the obligations of Surdex under the financing agreements.\nThe Enterprise lease facility finances the acquisition of field trucks and other service vehicles. At September 30, 2024, we maintained a fleet of\napproximately 600 vehicles. All our leasing facilities allow for both operating and finance leasing. We allocate finance lease payments between amortization and\ninterest. The payment terms on the lease agreements range between 30 and 50 months with payments totaling approximately $1.0 million per month. We utilize a\nthird party valuation specialist to formulate the incremental borrowing rates for the Company, to calculate the present value on new leases.\nWe regularly evaluate our options with respect to capital and our requirements for operations and growth. We do not limit our consideration to traditional bank\nfinancing, but rather include other structured debt and equity as option for additional capital.\nFor more information about our credit facilities, see Note 11 – Revolving Credit Facility and Fixed Credit Facilities.\nRegistration Statement\nWe have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the “Shelf Registration Statement”),\nwhich enables us to issue shares of our common stock and preferred stock, warrants\n46\nTable of Contents\nand rights to purchase any of such securities and/or debt securities, either individually or in units, in one or more offerings. We will file a prospectus supplement\ncontaining the amount and type of securities each time we issue securities under our Shelf Registration Statement. On April 1, 2024, we sold 1,502,942 shares of\ncommon stock for gross proceeds of approximately $51.1 million pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated\nMarch 26, 2024. The selling stockholders in the Offering sold an aggregate of 188,234 shares of common stock. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the\nsale of shares of common stock by the selling stockholders in the Offering See “Overview” above for more details.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements, no special purpose entities, and no activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at\nfair value.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe use estimates in the determination of certain financial results. Estimates used in financial reporting utilize only information available to us at the time of\nformulation. These estimates are subject to change as new information becomes available.\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies relating to the use of\nestimates described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfiled with the SEC dated March 12, 2024.\nCautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements\nOur disclosure and analysis in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, contains forward-looking statements.

Any forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed in the Risk\nFactors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and projections about future events and they are subject to risks and uncertainties\nknown and unknown that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Important factors that\ncould cause such differences include:\n• our ability to retain the continued service of our key professionals and to identify, hire, retain and utilize additional qualified personnel;\n• changes in demand from the clients that we serve;\n• any material outbreak or material escalation of international hostilities, including developments in the conflict involving Russia and the Ukraine, or the\nMiddle East and the economic consequences of related events such as the imposition of economic sanctions and resulting market volatility;\n• changes in general domestic and international economic conditions such as inflation rates, interest rates, tax rates, higher labor and healthcare costs,\nrecessions, and changing government policies, laws and regulations;\n• the U.S. government and other governmental and quasi-governmental budgetary and funding approval process;\n47\nTable of Contents\n• our ability to execute our acquisitions strategy, including successful completion of acquisitions and the integration of new acquisitions into our operations\nand financial reporting;\n• the possibility that our contracts may be terminated by our clients;\n• our ability to win new contracts and renew existing contracts;\n• competitive pressures and trends in our industry and our ability to successfully compete with our competitors;\n• our dependence on a limited number of clients;\n• our ability to complete projects timely, in accordance with our customers’ expectations, or profitability;\n• our ability to successfully manage our growth strategy;\n• our ability to raise capital in the future;\n• the credit and collection risks associated with our clients;\n• our ability to comply with procurement laws and regulations;\n• changes in laws, regulations, or policies;\n• weather conditions and seasonal revenue fluctuations may adversely impact our financial results;\n• the enactment of legislation that could limit the ability of local, state and federal agencies to contract for our privatized services;\n• our ability to complete our backlog of uncompleted projects as currently projected;\n• the risk of employee misconduct or our failure to comply with laws and regulations;\n• our ability to control, and operational issues pertaining to, business activities that we conduct with business partners and other third parties;\n• our need to comply with a number of restrictive covenants and similar provisions in our credit facility that generally limit our ability to (among other\nthings) incur additional indebtedness, create liens, make acquisitions, pay dividends and undergo certain changes in control, which could affect our ability\nto finance future operations, acquisitions or capital needs;\n• significant influence by our principal stockholder and the existence of certain anti-takeover measures in our governing documents; and\n• the factors identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors”, and in our other filings with the\nSEC.\nAny forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to\nreflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except to the extent required by\napplicable laws or rules. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which factors will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the\nimpact of each factor of our business or to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any\nforward-looking statements. We qualify all information presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and particularly our forward-looking statements, by these\ncautionary statements.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to certain market risks from transactions that are entered into during the normal course of business. We have not entered into derivative\nfinancial instruments for trading purposes. We have no significant market risk exposure to interest rate changes related to the promissory notes issued as partial\nconsideration for acquisitions since these contain fixed interest rates. Our only debt subject to interest rate risk is the New Credit Agreement under which rates are\ntied to Term SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate), plus an applicable rate which varies between 2.10% and 2.60% based on our ratio of Funded Debt to\nEBITDA (as each is defined in the New Credit Agreement). As of September 30, 2024, there was $32.3 million outstanding on the Credit Agreement. A one\npercentage point change in the assumed interest rate of the New Credit Agreement would change our annual interest expense by approximately $0.3 million in 2024.\nOur finance lease obligations with Honour and Enterprise were $28.6 million as of September 30, 2024. These finance lease obligations bear interest at a fixed\nrate. Accordingly, there is no exposure to market risk related to these obligations.\n48\nTable of Contents\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer\nand Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in\nRules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Company in reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized,\nand reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Based\non such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-\n15(e) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n49\nTable of Contents\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of our business activities. As of the date of this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q, we are not party to any litigation, the outcome of which if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected\nto have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThere have been no material changes to any of the principal risks that we believe are material to our business, results of operations and financial condition,\nfrom the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nItem 2.

On August 16, 2024, the board of directors authorized an increase to this repurchase authorization from $10 million to $25 million (collectively\nreferred to as the \"2023 Repurchase Authorization\"). The authorization is effective through August 31, 2025. The execution of the repurchase program is expected to\nbe consistent with the Company’s strategic initiatives which prioritize investments in organic and acquisitive growth. The timing and amount of any share\nrepurchases will be determined by management at its discretion based on several factors including share price, market conditions and capital allocation priorities.\nShares may be repurchased from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means, including the use of trading\nplans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act in accordance with applicable securities laws and other restrictions. The share repurchase\nprogram does not obligate Bowman to acquire a specific number of shares of common stock and may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without\nnotice.

The\nnumber of shares underlying any such equity award shall be determined by dividing the dollar value of the award by the Fair Market\nValue of the Company’s common stock as defined under the Equity Plan. If the level of Company business objectives and other\nperformance terms set by the Compensation Committee falls between achievement levels (that is, threshold, target or maximum),\nlineal interpolation shall be used to determine the amount of Executive’s long term equity award for such year.\n(ii) Executive shall not directly or indirectly, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise encumber shares of the Company’s common stock\nawarded under the Equity Plan as collateral for indebtedness, including but not limited to, holding such shares in a margin account\nor any other account that could cause the common stock to be subject to a margin call or otherwise be available as collateral for a\nmargin loan.\n(d) Executive acknowledges that the Annual Equity Awards and all other compensation that qualifies as “Incentive-Based\nCompensation” under the Company’s Executive Officer Claw-Back Policy is subject to the terms of such policy.\nSection 5.

For purposes of making the calculations\nrequired under this Section, the Independent Advisor may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes\nand may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code; provided that\nthe Independent Advisor shall assume that Executive pays all taxes at the highest marginal rate. The Company and Executive shall\nfurnish to the Independent Advisor such information and documents as the Independent Advisor may reasonably request in order to make\na determination under this Section. The Company shall bear all costs that Independent Advisor may incur in connection with any\ncalculations contemplated by this Section. Any reduction of the Payments payable hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by first\nreducing the\n8\ncash payments under Section 7, second by reducing COBRA reimbursement and lastly by reducing any other Payments in a manner\ndetermined by the Company, in consultation with Executive in accordance with Code Section 409A.\n(c) If Executive is determined to be entitled to a Reduced Amount pursuant to Section 8(a) and, notwithstanding any reduction\ndescribed in this Section 8 (or in the absence of any such reduction), the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) determines that Executive is\nliable for the Excise Tax as a result of the receipt of one or more Payments, then Executive shall be obligated to surrender or pay back to\nthe Company, within one hundred twenty (120) days after a final IRS determination, an amount of such payments or benefits equal to the\n“Repayment Amount.” The Repayment Amount with respect to such Payments shall be the smallest such amount, if any, as shall be\nrequired to be surrendered or paid to the Company so that Executive’s net proceeds with respect to such Payments (after taking into\naccount the payment of the excise tax imposed on such Payments) shall be maximized. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Repayment\nAmount with respect to such Payments shall be zero if a Repayment Amount of more than zero would not eliminate the Excise Tax\nimposed on such Payments or if a Repayment Amount of more than zero would not maximize the net amount received by Executive from\nthe Payments. If the Excise Tax is not eliminated pursuant to this Section 8, Executive shall pay the Excise Tax.\nSection 9. Restrictive Covenants. Executive acknowledges and recognizes the highly competitive nature of the businesses of the\nCompany and accordingly agrees, as a condition of Executive’s continued employment with the Company, to be bound by and comply\nwith the Restrictive Covenants contained in Appendix B attached hereto and incorporated by reference herein. Executive acknowledges\nand agrees that the Company’s remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of Section 1 of Appendix B or a\nmaterial breach or material threatened breach of any of the provisions of Section 2 of Appendix B of this Agreement would be inadequate\nand the Company would suffer irreparable damages as a result of such breach or threatened breach. In recognition of this fact, Executive\nagrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any\nbond, shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the form of specific performance, temporary restraining order, temporary or permanent\ninjunction or any other equitable remedy which may then be available.\nSection 10. Representation and Warranty of Executive.

Taxes. The Company may withhold from any payments made under this Agreement all applicable taxes, including but not\nlimited to income, employment, and social insurance taxes, as shall be required by law.

On the first business day following the expiration of the Specified Employee Delay\nPeriod, Executive shall be paid, in a single cash lump sum, an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all payments delayed pursuant to\nthe preceding sentence, and any remaining payments not so delayed shall continue to be paid pursuant to the payment schedule set forth\nherein.\n(b) Each payment in a series of payments hereunder shall be deemed to be a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the\nCode.\n(c) To the extent that any right to reimbursement of expenses or payment of any benefit in-kind under this Agreement constitutes\nnonqualified deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code), (i) any such expense reimbursement shall be\nmade by the Company no later than the last day of the taxable year following the taxable year in which such expense was incurred by\nExecutive, (ii) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit, and (iii)\nthe amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided during any taxable year shall not affect the expenses\neligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits to be provided in any other taxable year; provided, that the foregoing clause shall not be\nviolated with regard to expenses reimbursed under any arrangement covered by Section 105(b) of the Code solely because such expenses\nare subject to a limit related to the period the arrangement is in effect.\n(d) The payments and benefits provided hereunder are intended to be structured in a manner to avoid the implication of any\npenalty taxes under Section 409A of the Code and shall be interpreted consistent with such intent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no\nevent whatsoever shall the Company be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalties that may be imposed on Executive as a result of\nSection 409A of the Code or any damages for failing to comply with Section 409A of the Code (other than for withholding obligations or\nother obligations applicable to employers, if any, under Section 409A of the Code). If any provision of this Agreement (or of any award\nof compensation, including equity compensation or benefits) would cause Executive to incur any additional tax or interest under Section\n409A of the Code, the Company shall, after consulting with and receiving the approval of Executive, reform such provision in a manner\nintended (but not guaranteed by the Company) to avoid the incurrence by Executive of any such additional tax or interest.\nSection 13.

To be considered for the Alpha Select List, we look for as many of the following characteristics as possible:\n\n  * ![Alpha Select Conference](/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/conference-photo.jpg)Sub-$500 million market cap\n  * Attractive business models\n  * Strong management teams\n  * Sustainable competitive advantage\n  * Unique solutions to large problems\n  * Above average growth prospects\n  * Significant unappreciated value\n  * Little or no sell-side coverage\n\n\n\nLast year alone, we sponsored over 1,300 meetings with institutional investors in support of our Alpha Select companies. These meetings provided visibility for the companies and introduced them to over 400 institutional investors in the U.S. and Canada.\n\n**15 th Annual Craig-Hallum Alpha Select Conference**Tuesday, November 19, 2024Featuring over 90 public companies\n\nEntering its fifteenth year, the **Craig-Hallum Alpha Select Conference** has earned a reputation among our clients as an important idea generation opportunity. Attending companies have been individually selected by the Craig-Hallum research team and are either currently on or display characteristics that are consistent with the Alpha Select List.\n\nThe majority of participating companies are covered by Craig-Hallum research analysts, and we also look forward to introducing you to non-covered companies we believe you will find of interest as well as some selected larger cap “graduates” of the list. **Attendance is by invitation only, please contact your Craig-Hallum representative.**\n\nLoading\n"
