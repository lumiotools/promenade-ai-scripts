          "url": "https://www.cb.bank/getmedia/f23fa5eb-3ad7-47f7-b04f-6623a650e2fc/2022-Code-of-Ethics.pdf",
          "content": "Code of Ethics and Business Conduct\nThis Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (the “Code”) represents an overview of the corporate\npolicies that should govern the actions of all employees, officers and directors of CB Financial\nServices, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Community Bank (collectively, the “Company”). It is\nnot a replacement for policies and procedures that address the specifics of our business or\nwhich may impose stricter or more detailed requirements. No code of conduct can cover every\npotential situation. The Code is designed to provide written standards to promote honest and\nethical conduct, compliance with law and a vehicle for prompt internal reporting and\naccountability to assume adherence to the Code. It is, therefore, your responsibility to apply the\nprinciples set forth in this Code in a responsible fashion and with the exercise of good business\njudgment.\nCertain parts of this Code may apply specifically to “executive officers.” Executive officer means\na member of the Company’s or its subsidiaries’ management so designated by resolution of the\nBoard of Directors.\nThe policies and procedures contained in this Code do not constitute a legal contract and may\nbe changed, modified or discontinued from time to time without notice (except as required by\nlaw) and in the sole discretion of the Company. Failure to adhere to these policies and\nprocedures may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.\nExcept as otherwise provided by written agreement or applicable law, persons employed by the\nCompany or its subsidiaries are employed at will and the Company reserves the right to take\nemployment action, including termination, at any time for any reason without notice.\nFinancial Policies\nUse of Company Assets\nThe Company’s assets are to be used exclusively in the pursuit of the Company’s business\nexcept for minimal personal use authorized by your supervisor in accordance with other\nCompany policies. The Company’s assets include equipment, facilities, supplies, services such\nas telephones and computer networks, and the time and efforts of its employees. You should\nnot use Company assets for personal gain or convenience, or make Company assets available\nfor the gain or convenience of anyone else, or for any purpose other than conducting the\nCompany’s business unless you have management authorization to do so.\nAuthority to Make Commitments\nOnly specific employees are authorized to make financial or other commitments on behalf of the\nCompany. Commitments might be such things as approving a loan or other extension of credit,\nordering equipment or materials, authorizing business travel, approving payment of an invoice\nor expense report, authorizing budgets or budget overruns, signing leases or other contracts,\nselling Company assets, settling litigation or other claims, borrowing money, setting\ncompensation or employee benefits, making charitable contributions and other transactions.\nThese authorizations are in writing and are governed by corporate policies. You should not\nmake a Company commitment unless you have the authority to do so. If you are unsure of your\nlevel of authority, you should check with your supervisor.\nBribes and Other Illegal Corporate Payments\nThe use of Company funds for payments to any individual, company or organization for the\npurpose of obtaining favorable treatment in securing business or other special considerations is\nprohibited. This policy does not prohibit normal and customary business expenses such as\nreasonable entertainment, trade organization dues or similar expenses that are allowed by\napplicable Company policies, which must be properly reported on an appropriate expense\nreport form.\nRelations with Government Employees\nThe U.S. government has various regulations prohibiting government personnel from accepting\nentertainment, gifts, gratuities or other business courtesies that may be acceptable in the private\ncommercial sector. All Company employees who may have to make these sorts of judgments\nmust understand and comply with the letter and intent of such regulations.\nIntegrity of Records and Reports\nThe Company’s accounting records are relied upon to produce reports to the Company’s\nmanagement, shareholders, government agencies and others. All Company accounting records\nand reports produced from those records shall be kept and presented in a timely fashion and in\naccordance with the laws of each applicable jurisdiction. Such records and reports must\naccurately and fairly reflect in reasonable detail the Company’s assets, liabilities, revenues and\nexpenses.\nResponsibility for accurate and complete financial records does not rest solely with the\nCompany’s accounting employees. All employees involved in approving transactions, supplying\nsupporting information for transactions and determining account classifications have\nresponsibility for complying with our policies.\nReports to Management\nThe same high standards required in the Company’s external reporting apply to financial reports\nto management. Accruals and estimates included in internal reports (such as business plans,\nbudgets and forecasts) shall be supported by appropriate documentation and based on good-\nfaith judgment.\nPayments and Disbursements\nAll payments made by or on behalf of the Company must be documented in the accounting\nrecords with appropriate approval(s) and an adequate description of the business purpose of\nthe disbursement.\nCash Deposits and Bank Accounts\nAll cash received by the Company shall be promptly recorded in the accounting records and\ndeposited in a bank account properly authorized by the Company. All bank accounts and other\ncash accounts shall be clearly and accurately recorded in the accounting records. No\nunrecorded accounts, funds or assets shall be established for any purpose.\nCooperation with Inquiries\nEmployees shall provide complete and accurate information in response to inquiries from the\nCompany’s internal auditor and outside independent registered public accountants as well as\nthe Company’s legal counsel.\nPOLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND ACTIVITIES\nNo Company funds or assets, including the work time of any employee, may be contributed,\nloaned or made available, directly or indirectly, to any political party or to the campaign of any\ncandidate for a local, state or federal office.\nConflicts of Interest\nYou must carry out your professional responsibilities with integrity and with a sense of loyalty to\nthe Company. You must avoid any situation that involves a possible conflict or an appearance\nof a conflict of interest between your personal interests and the interests of the Company.\nKnowingly acting in a manner that presents a conflict between your personal interests and the\nbest interests of the Company is a violation of this Code.\nA conflict of interest cannot be defined precisely, only illustrated. The basic factor that exists in\nall conflict situations is a division of loyalty between the Company’s best interests and the\npersonal interest of the individual. Many, but not all, conflict situations arise from personal\nloyalties or personal financial dealings. It is impossible to list every circumstance giving rise to a\npossible conflict of interest, but the following illustrates the types of situations that may cause\nconflicts.\nFamily Members\nA conflict of interest may exist when the Company does business with or competes with an\norganization in which a family member has an ownership or employment interest. “Family\nmembers” include a spouse, parents, children, siblings and in-laws. You may not conduct\nbusiness on behalf of the Company with family members or an organization with which you or a\nfamily member is associated unless you receive prior written approval under this Code.\nOwnership in Other Businesses\nYou cannot own, directly or indirectly, a significant financial interest in any business entity that\ndoes business with or is in competition with the Company unless you receive prior written\napproval under this Code. As a guide, “a significant financial interest” is defined as ownership\nby an employee and/or family members of more than 1% of the outstanding securities/capital\nvalue of a corporation or that represents more than 5% of the total assets of the employee\nand/or family members.\nOutside Employment\nEmployees must keep outside business activities, such as a second job or self-employment,\ncompletely separate from the employee’s activities with the Company. Employees may not use\nCompany assets, facilities, materials, or services of other employees for outside activities\nunless specifically authorized by the Company, such as for certain volunteer work.\nDisclosure Required - When in Doubt, Ask!\nYou should avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest. Conflicts can arise unexpectedly\nand prompt disclosure is critically important. Employees must disclose existing or emerging\nconflicts of interest (including personal relationships that could reasonably be considered to\ncreate conflicts) to their manager and follow the guidance provided. Executive officers and\ndirectors must disclose existing or emerging conflicts of interest to the Chief Executive Officer.\nAccepting Gifts and Gratuities\nAccepting Things of Value\nExcept as provided below, you may not solicit or accept for yourself or for a third party anything\nof value from anyone in return for any business, service or confidential information of the\nCompany. Things of value include gifts, meals, favors, services and entertainment. The\npurpose of this policy is to ensure that the Company’s business is safeguarded from undue\ninfluence of bribery and personal favors.\nThe solicitation and acceptance of things of value is generally prohibited by the Bank Bribery\nAct. Violations may be punished by fines and imprisonment.\nPermitted Transactions\nThe following transactions are permitted and will be considered as exceptions to the general\nprohibition against accepting things of value:\n• Acceptance of gifts, gratuities, amenities or favors based on family or personal\nrelationships when the circumstances make clear that it is those relationships, rather\nthan the business of the Company, that are the motivating factors;\n• Acceptance of meals, refreshments, travel arrangements, accommodations or\nentertainment, all of a reasonable value, in the course of a meeting or other occasion,\nthe purpose of which is to hold bona fide business discussions or to foster better\nbusiness relations, provided that the expense would be paid for by the Company as a\nreasonable business expense if not paid for by another party;\n• Acceptance of advertising or promotional material of reasonable value, such as pens,\npencils, note pads, key chains, calendars and similar items;\n• Acceptance of discounts or rebates on merchandise or services that do not exceed\nthose available to other customers;\n• Acceptance of gifts of reasonable value related to commonly recognized events or\noccasions, such as a promotion, new job, wedding, retirement, birthday or holiday; or\n• Acceptance of civic, charitable, education or religious organizational awards for\nrecognition of service and accomplishment.\nOther Transactions\nIf you are offered or receive something of value beyond what is permitted in this Code, you must\nobtain prior approval before you may accept or keep it. Transactions other than those\ndescribed above may be approved so long as approval is consistent with the Bank Bribery Act.\nIf you are at all uncertain as to whether you may accept something of value, do not hesitate to\nask.\nCorporate Opportunities\nDirectors and officers of the Company stand in a fiduciary relationship to the Company. It is a\nbreach of this duty for any such person to take advantage of a business opportunity for his or\nher own personal profit or benefit when the opportunity is within the corporate powers of the\nCompany and when the opportunity is of present or potential practical advantage to the\nCompany, unless the Board of Directors knowingly elects not to avail itself of such opportunity\nand the director’s or officer’s participation is approved in advance by the Board. It is the policy\nof the Company that no director or executive officer of the Company will appropriate a corporate\nopportunity without the consent of the Board of Directors.\nEqual Employment Opportunity, Harassment and Sexual Harassment\nEqual Employment Opportunity\nIt is the policy of the Company to provide equal employment opportunity in full compliance with\nall federal, state and local equal employment opportunity laws and regulations.\nHarassment Prohibited\nThe Company is committed to providing a work environment where all employees work free\nfrom harassment because of race, color, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, national\norigin, disability or any characteristic protected by applicable law. The Company will not tolerate\nharassment by employees, supervisors, customers or others.\nOur policy is essentially based on common sense: all employees should treat each other with\nrespect and courtesy. Harassment in any form – including verbal and physical conduct, visual\ndisplays, threats, demands and retaliation – is prohibited.\nWhat Constitutes Sexual Harassment\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has guidelines that define sexual harassment\nas unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct\nof a sexual nature when:\n• Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of\nan individual’s employment, or used as the basis for employment decisions affecting\nsuch individual; or\n Such conduct creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.\nSexual harassment can involve either a tangible employment action or a hostile work\nenvironment. Sexual harassment includes more than overt physical or verbal intimidation.\nLewd or vulgar remarks, suggestive comments, posters, pictures and calendars, pressure for\ndates and sexual favors, and unacceptable physical contact are examples of what can\nconstitute harassment.\nIt is important to realize that what may not be offensive to you may be offensive to others. You\nshould consider carefully the effect of your words and actions on others, and should not assume\nthat another employee’s failure to object means that the employee welcomes the behavior at\nissue.\nThe Company as a general matter does not seek to regulate the private social behavior of\nemployees. However, intimate relationships between supervisors and employees whom they\ndirectly supervise are discouraged. Because of the undesirable workplace repercussions that\nthey may have, any such ongoing relationship should be disclosed to the supervisor’s\ndepartment head. All employees should understand that no one at the Company has the\nauthority to offer job benefits or threaten job disadvantages based on the provision of sexual\nfavors.\nSexual harassment also can occur among co-workers or result from behavior by contractors or\nother non-employees who have reason to interact with Company employees. Our policy\nextends to these circumstances as well.\nObligation to Report\nAny employee who has reason to believe that he/she is being harassed must promptly report\nthe harassment. The official procedure for reporting violations or suspected violations of this\npolicy is located below in this Code under the Heading “How to Report a Violation.” Do not\nallow an inappropriate situation to continue by not reporting it, regardless of who is creating the\nsituation.\nInvestigations\nAs set forth below under “Administration of the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct,” the\nCompany will promptly investigate allegations of harassment and, to the extent possible,\nconduct such investigations confidentially. Any employee who is found to have violated this\npolicy is subject to discipline or discharge.\nNo Retaliation\nThe Company will not tolerate retaliation in any form against an employee who has, in good\nfaith, reported an incident of harassment, and employees should not fear that such a report will\nendanger his/her job.\nIllegal and Impairing Substances\nYou may not possess, use, sell, distribute or be under the influence of illegal drugs while on\nCompany property or while conducting Company business anywhere. Such behavior is a\nviolation of Company policy in addition to being a violation of the law.\nWhen reporting for work and throughout the work day, you must be fit for duty at all times and,\nin particular, not pose a safety hazard to yourself or others through your use of alcohol or other\nlegal, but impairing, substances.\nWorkplace Violence\nThe Company expressly prohibits any acts of violence or threats of violence by any Company\nemployee against any other person in or about Company facilities or in connection with the\nconduct of Company business elsewhere at any time.\nYou are prohibited from possessing firearms while on Company property or while conducting\nCompany business anywhere at any time unless authorized by the Company\nMarketing Practices and Antitrust\nMarketing Practices\nThe Company’s products and services must be sold fairly and honestly. You should not attempt\nto take advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged\ninformation, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other unfair practice. Many of the\nproducts and services provided by the Company are subject to laws and regulations that specify\nthe information that must be provided to the Company’s customers. It is the policy of the\nCompany to comply fully with these disclosure requirements.\nAntitrust\nThe antitrust laws are intended to foster free and open competition and it is important that the\nCompany comply with the letter and the spirit of such laws. Agreements that reduce business\ncompetition are a core concern of the antitrust laws and violations may result in severe civil and\ncriminal penalties to the Company and to individuals. Antitrust laws pertain to dealings with\ncustomers and suppliers as well as competitors.\nIn some cases, depending on the circumstances, the antitrust laws prohibit discussions among\ncompetitors about competitively sensitive subjects. The most serious antitrust violations are\nagreements among competitors that directly restrict competition among them.\nThese include agreements:\n• To raise, lower or stabilize prices;\n• To divide the areas in which they will do business or the customers they will serve; or\n• To refuse to deal with certain customers or suppliers.\nConduct intended to drive a competitor out of business may also violate antitrust laws. It is the\npolicy of the Company to fully comply with all applicable antitrust laws.\nAntitrust is a complex area of the law and violations have serious consequences for the\nCompany and for individuals personally. The Company’s legal counsel should be consulted\nwith any questions.\nComputer Networks, Voice Mail, E-mail, the Internet and social media\nMany Company employees depend on access to computer networks, voice mail, e-mail and/or\nthe Internet to do their jobs. These tools come with risks and responsibilities that all employees\nmust understand and accept.\nYou must use these resources only for the business activities of the Company (except as\ndescribed below under “Authorized Uses”) and:\n• Properly identify yourself in electronic communication;\n• Use only your own password and user ID to gain access to systems or data;\n• Accept full personal responsibility for the activities undertaken with your password and\nuser ID;\n• Delete e-mail, voice mail and other electronic files in accordance with applicable record\nretention policies; and\n• Comply with the computer security policies of the Company and conduct yourself in a\nmanner that protects the Company from damage, theft, waste and violations of the law,\nincluding:\n- Protecting against exposure to potentially destructive elements, intentional\n(viruses, sabotage, etc.) or unintentional (bugs); and\n- Protecting against unauthorized access to Company information or resources\n(hacking).\nCompany Property and Privacy\nComputer networks and electronic communications systems, and all messages and log files\ngenerated on or handled by them (including back-up copies), are considered to be the property\nof the Company.\nThere should be no expectation of privacy in these electronic interactions. The Company may\nmonitor the content of your electronic communications or monitor the content of server log files\nto review what Web sites or other Internet locations you have visited and what files you may\nhave sent or received. Computer networks, e-mail systems, voice mail systems and server logs\nare monitored regularly to support routine and non-routine activities such as operations,\nmaintenance, auditing, security and investigations. You should also keep in mind that, as a\nmatter of law, the Company may be called upon to turn over this information to law enforcement\nand private litigants.\nYou may not intercept or disclose, or assist in intercepting or disclosing, electronic\ncommunications or Internet activity except as specifically provided above and only then with\nappropriate authorization.\nAuthorized Uses\nCompany computer networks, e-mail and voice mail systems and Internet access generally\nmust be used only for Company business activities. Incidental personal use is permitted if it:\n• Doesn’t preempt or interfere with any Company business activity or with employee\nproductivity; and\n• Consumes only a trivial amount of Company resources.\nIncidental personal use is subject to the same policies as business use.\nProhibited Uses\nUnder no circumstances should Company computer networks, e-mail and voice mail systems or\nInternet access be used:\n• For any illegal activity;\n• To communicate offensive sexual, racial or other remarks, jokes, slurs and obscenities;\n• For private business, commercial or solicitation activities;\n• For chain-letter communications of any kind;\n• For charitable endeavors that are not Company-sponsored or authorized, including any\nfundraising;\n• For gambling; or\n• For pornography.\nAdditional uses may be prohibited or limited by other provisions of this Code or by other\nCompany policies, such as the Electronic Communications and Equipment Safeguards Policy.\nSocial Media\nSocial media may be used by Community Bank employees; however, there are guidelines that\nmust be followed when referring to any information about the Bank, its employees, customers,\nvendors, affiliates or associates.\nEmployees must refrain from any activities that are considered to be defamatory, discriminatory,\nobscene, profane, libelous, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful or embarrassing when\nposting to a Community Bank-hosted site or are representing the Bank on any other channel\nlisted above.\nEmployees may not disclose any confidential or proprietary information about the Bank, its\naffiliates, customers, vendors or suppliers, including but not limited to business and financial\ninformation, represent that they are communicating the views of the Bank, or do anything that\nmight reasonably create the impression that they are communicating on behalf of the Bank.\nEmployees who participate in online communication deemed not to be in the best interest of\nCommunity Bank, its employees, affiliates, customers, vendors or suppliers could be subject to\ndisciplinary action up to and including termination. Please refer to the Bank’s Social Media\nPolicy for further guidance.\nConfidential Information\nMany employees learn confidential Company information in the course of their jobs and use it to\nperform important functions. It is vitally important that all employees handle confidential\ninformation properly.\nThere are two major concerns:\n• Preventing the release of unauthorized or inappropriate information that might adversely\naffect the Company’s business; and\n• Avoiding violations of the law.\nWhat is Confidential Information?\nWhat follows is not a complete list of what is considered confidential information, but it illustrates\nwhat is typically confidential unless it has been disclosed by the Company in a press release, or\nother authorized formal or official public communication:\n• Financial results, budgets or forecasts;\n• Business plans, operating plans, strategy statements, memos, operating manuals,\norganization charts and other internal communications;\n• Company investments, acquisitions or divestitures;\n• New products, processes or designs;\n• Whether a product or business is meeting financial or other expectations;\n• Business relationships or the terms of any business arrangement, including prices paid\nor received by the Company;\n• Customer data such as customer names and addresses or any confidential personal or\nbusiness information of the customer;\n• Advertising and marketing plans and campaigns;\n• Wages and salaries, bonus or compensation plans, notices to employees or\nunannounced personnel changes; and\n• Personal information about any employee.\nIn general, if information about the Company has not been made public by the Company, it\nshould be treated as confidential.\nNon-Disclosure and Non-Use\nYou may not disclose to unauthorized persons or use for your own personal advantage or profit,\nor the advantage or profit of another, any confidential information that you obtain as a result of\nyour position with the Company. This includes not only customers and the press, but also\nbusiness associates, family members and personal friends. It is a serious mistake to disclose\nsuch information to anyone simply because you are confident that that person will neither try to\nbenefit from it nor disclose it to others.\nYour obligations not to disclose the Company’s confidential information and not to use it for\nunauthorized purposes continue after your affiliation with the Company ends.\nPrivacy of Customer Information\nThe Company is entrusted with important information about individuals and businesses. It is\nessential that you respect the confidential nature of this information. The Company is legally\nobliged to protect the privacy of a consumer’s personal financial information. The Company’s\nprivacy practices are set out in a privacy policy that is circulated to our customers and made\navailable to the public. All employees are expected to adhere to the Company’s privacy policy.\nSafeguarding Confidential Information\nWhen conducting business, many employees may become privy to confidential information\nabout Community Bank, its present and prospective customers and suppliers, its stockholders\nand employees. Employees who possess such confidential information must understand that it\nhas been given to them for an express business purpose, may be disclosed only on a need-to-\nknow basis, and used only for a proper business purpose. Discretion should be used when\nconfidential information is disclosed, and it should never be disseminated to unauthorized\npersons.\nConfidential Information and Personal Liability\nMisuse of confidential information may result in civil or criminal liability, or in sanctions or\npenalties against both Community Bank and the individual responsible for misusing such\ninformation. Employees, directors and their associates may be held personally liable for using\nconfidential information for personal benefit.\nAccountability\nIt is the policy of Community Bank to treat all information regarding its customers and\nemployees in strictest confidence. Failure to maintain the confidentiality of this information will\nresult in corrective action, up to and including immediate dismissal.\nPublic Disclosures\nYou may be asked for information about the Company by the media, trade groups, consultants\nand others collecting information for various purposes. You should not make public statements\non behalf of the Company or provide confidential information in response to external inquiries\nunless you have been authorized to do so.\nProper Disclosures\nSome employees must disclose confidential Company information as a part of their job\nresponsibilities. This policy on confidential information is not intended to prohibit such\nauthorized disclosures.\nA few examples of situations in which confidential information might properly be disclosed are:\n• Disclosure of operational data to vendors or consultants in connection with providing\nservices to the Company;\n• Participation in legitimate and authorized industry surveys;\n• Providing data to governmental agencies as part of required filings; or\n• An authorized employee responding to media inquiries.\nYou should be certain that you understand what you have been authorized to disclose, and to\nwhom, prior to disclosing any confidential information.\nExaminations, Government Investigations and Litigation\nRegulatory Examinations\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to examination by federal and state banking\nregulators. It is Company policy to cooperate fully with the Company’s regulators.\nGovernment Investigations\nIt is Company policy to cooperate with reasonable and valid requests by federal, state or local\ngovernment investigators. At the same time, the Company is entitled to all the safeguards\nprovided in the law for persons under investigation, including representation by legal counsel.\nAccordingly, if a government investigator requests an interview with you, seeks information or\naccess to files, or poses written questions, he/she should be told that you must first consult with\nthe Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who will then provide advice as to further action,\nincluding consultation with legal counsel.\nPenalties\nYou should be aware that criminal sanctions could be imposed upon any person who submits\nfalse or misleading information to the government in connection with any regulatory examination\nor government investigation.

We recognize that alcohol abuse and\ndrug use pose a significant threat to our goals. We have established a drug-free\nworkplace program that balances our respect for individuals with the need to maintain\nan alcohol and drug-free environment.\n This organization encourages employees to voluntarily seek help with drug and\nalcohol problems.\nCovered Workers\nAny individual who conducts business for the organization, is applying for a position or\nis conducting business on the organization's property is covered by our drug-free\nworkplace policy. Our policy includes, but is not limited to all employees.\nApplicability\nOur drug-free workplace policy is intended to apply whenever anyone is representing or\nconducting business for the organization. Therefore, this policy applies during all\nworking hours, whenever conducting business or representing the organization and\nwhile on organization property.\nProhibited Behavior\nIt is a violation of our drug-free workplace policy to use, possess, sell, trade, and/or offer\nfor sale alcohol, illegal drugs or intoxicants.\nCertain employees are authorized to entertain Bank clients or prospects at certain social\nor networking events which occur outside of normal working hours. In all cases, the\nemployee should use extreme caution and good sense when consuming or purchasing\nalcoholic beverages in social or networking settings and when conducting business\nwhen alcohol is present.\nNo employee shall report for duty or remain on duty when the employee uses any\ndrugs, except when the use is pursuant to the instructions of a physician who has\nadvised the employee that the drug does not adversely affect the employee’s ability to\nsafely perform their tasks.\nNotification of Convictions\nAny employee who is convicted of a criminal drug violation in the workplace must notify\nthe organization in writing within five calendar days of the conviction. The organization\nwill take appropriate action within 30 days of notification. Federal contracting agencies\nwill be notified when appropriate.\nSearches\nEntering the organization's property constitutes consent to searches and inspections. If\nan individual is suspected of violating the drug-free workplace policy, he or she may be\nasked to submit to a search or inspection at any time. Searches can be conducted of\npockets and clothing, lockers, wallets, purses, briefcases and lunchboxes, desks and\nwork stations and vehicles and equipment.\nDrug Testing\nTo ensure the accuracy and fairness of our testing program, all testing will be conducted\naccording to Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)\nguidelines where applicable and will include a screening test; a confirmation test; the\nopportunity for a split sample; review by a Medical Review Officer, including the\nopportunity for employees who test positive to provide a legitimate medical explanation,\nsuch as a physician's prescription, for the positive result; and a documented chain of\ncustody.\nAll drug-testing information will be maintained in separate confidential records.\nEach employee, as a condition of employment, will be required to participate in pre-\nemployment, random, post-accident, reasonable suspicion and return-to-duty testing\nupon selection or request of management.\nThe substances that will be tested for are: Amphetamines, Cannabinoids (THC),\nCocaine, Opiates, Phencyclidine (PCP), Alcohol, Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines,\nMethaqualone and Propoxyphene.\nTesting for the presence of alcohol will be conducted by analysis of breath.\nTesting for the presence of the metabolites of drugs will be conducted by the analysis of\nurine.\nAny employee who tests positive will be immediately removed from duty, referred to a\nsubstance abuse professional for assessment and recommendations, required to pass\na Return-to-Duty test and sign a Return-to-Work Agreement and terminated\nimmediately if he/she tests positive a second time or violates the Return-to-Work\nAgreement.\nAn employee will be subject to the same consequences of a positive test if he/she\nrefuses the screening or the test, adulterates or dilutes the specimen, substitutes the\nspecimen with that from another person or sends an imposter, will not sign the required\nforms or refuses to cooperate in the testing process in such a way that prevents\ncompletion of the test.\nConsequences\nOne of the goals of our drug-free workplace program is to encourage employees to\nvoluntarily seek help with alcohol and/or drug problems. If, however, an individual\nviolates the policy, the consequences are serious.\nIn the case of applicants, if he or she violates the drug-free workplace policy, the offer of\nemployment can be withdrawn. The applicant may reapply after six months and must\nsuccessfully pass a pre-employment drug test.\nIf an employee violates the policy, he or she will be subject to progressive disciplinary\naction and may be required to enter rehabilitation. An employee required to enter\nrehabilitation who fails to successfully complete it and/or repeatedly violates the policy\nwill be terminated from employment. Nothing in this policy prohibits the employee from\nbeing disciplined or discharged for other violations and/or performance problems.\nReturn-to-Work Agreements\nFollowing a violation of the drug-free workplace policy, an employee may be offered an\nopportunity to participate in rehabilitation. In such cases, the employee must sign and\nabide by the terms set forth in a Return-to-Work Agreement as a condition of continued\nemployment.\nAssistance\nCommunity Bank recognizes that alcohol and drug abuse and addiction are treatable\nillnesses. We also realize that early intervention and support improve the success of\nrehabilitation. To support our employees, our drug-free workplace policy:\n Encourages employees to seek help if they are concerned that they or their\nfamily members may have a drug and/or alcohol problem.\n Encourages employees to utilize the services of qualified professionals in the\ncommunity to assess the seriousness of suspected drug or alcohol problems and\nidentify appropriate sources of help.\n Offers all employees and their family members assistance with alcohol and drug\nproblems through the Employee Assistance Program (EAP).\nTreatment for alcoholism and/or other drug use disorders may be covered by the\nemployee benefit plan. However, the ultimate financial responsibility for recommended\ntreatment belongs to the employee.\nConfidentiality\nAll information received by the organization through the drug-free workplace program is\nconfidential communication. Access to this information is limited to those who have a\nlegitimate need to know in compliance with relevant laws and management policies.\nShared Responsibility\nA safe and productive drug-free workplace is achieved through cooperation and shared\nresponsibility. Both employees and management have important roles to play.\nAll employees are required to not report to work or be subject to duty while their ability\nto perform job duties is impaired due to on- or off-duty use of alcohol or other drugs.\nIn addition, employees are encouraged to:\n Be concerned about working in a safe environment.\n Use the Employee Assistance Program.\n Report dangerous behavior to their supervisor.\nIt is the supervisor's responsibility to:\n Inform employees of the drug-free workplace policy.\n Observe employee performance.\n Investigate reports of dangerous practices.\nCommunication\nCommunicating our drug-free workplace policy to both supervisors and employees is\ncritical to our success. To ensure all employees are aware of their role in supporting our\ndrug-free workplace program:\n All employees will receive a written copy of the policy.\n The policy will be reviewed in orientation sessions with new employees.\nMedical Marijuana\nCommunity Bank will not discriminate against an applicant or employee on the basis of\nthe person’s status as a registered medical marijuana patient or on the basis of a\nregistered patient’s positive drug test for marijuana components or metabolites\nAll employees, including those who are registered medical marijuana patients, are\nprohibited from ingesting, using or possessing any form of marijuana in the workplace\nand from working while under the influence of marijuana. Any employee who violates\nthis policy is subject to discipline, up to and including, termination of employment.\nEmployees who have concerns about the use of medical marijuana while at work should\ncontact HR for more information.\n(Rev. 2/2022)\nPOLICY AGAINST DISCRIMINATION, HARRASSMENT, AND RETALIATION\nCommunity Bank is committed to providing a work environment free from discrimination, harassment, and\nretaliation. It is Community Bank’s policy that all employees have a right to work in an environment free of\ndiscrimination and harassment based on race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability,\nmental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender\nexpression, age, sexual orientation, military and veteran status, or any other basis protected by federal, state, or\nlocal law. Community Bank prohibits discrimination against its employees, independent contractors, interns, and\nvolunteers in any form—by supervisors, coworkers, customers, or suppliers.\nNo employee, not even the highest-ranking employee in the company, is exempt from the requirements of this\npolicy.\nIf you find conduct in the workplace to be unwelcome, offensive, or discriminatory, you are expected to\nimmediately inform the person engaging in the conduct in a clear and unambiguous manner that the conduct is\nunwelcome, offensive, or discriminatory and that you want the conduct to stop. However, if you are uncomfortable\ntaking this action, or if the conduct does not stop after you have warned the offending person, you should\nimmediately contact your supervisor. If you feel you cannot seek help from your supervisor, you should contact\nhis or her supervisor or the VP, Human Resources Manager or a member of executive/senior management for\nassistance. Complaints may also be filed using the Bank’s anonymous complaint line, which can be accessed by\nphone at 1-888-845-0815 or online at www.mycompliancereport.com (code CBFV).\nEvery complaint will be investigated as promptly, thoroughly, and impartially as possible. We will protect the\nconfidentiality of complaints to the fullest extent possible. If the investigation determines that discrimination or\nharassment has occurred, Community Bank will take immediate and appropriate action.\nWhile the investigation proceeds, Community Bank may put reasonable interim measures in place, including, but\nnot limited to, a leave of absence, change of shift, or transfer. The failure or refusal of any employee to cooperate\nin a company investigation of alleged wrongful conduct may subject the employee to disciplinary action, up to and\nincluding termination.\nOnce reports of alleged violations of this policy are thoroughly investigated, the company will take appropriate\naction. Community Bank may conclude that a violation has occurred. The company might also conclude,\ndepending on the circumstances, either that no violation of policy occurred or that Community Bank cannot\nconclude whether a violation occurred.\nIf Community Bank determines that this policy has been violated or that other inappropriate conduct has occurred,\neffective remedial action will be taken appropriate to the totality of the circumstances, including disciplinary action,\nup to and including termination. Community Bank may discipline an employee for any inappropriate conduct\ndiscovered while investigating reports or alleged violations of this policy, even if the conduct does not amount to\na violation of the law or even a violation of this policy. If the person who engaged in the unwelcome or offensive\nconduct is not employed by Community Bank, the company will take whatever corrective action is reasonable and\nappropriate under the circumstances. Following the conclusions of the company’s investigation, a company\nrepresentative will advise the principal parties concerned of the results of the investigation separately.\nCommunity Bank will not retaliate against any employee for engaging in “protected activity.” Generally, protected\nactivity consists of either:\nParticipating in an equal employment opportunity (EEO) process, such as providing witness information; assisting or\notherwise participating in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the EEO laws, including\nmaking an internal complaint to an employer or union; participating in an employer’s own internal investigation; or\nfiling an administrative charge or lawsuit alleging discrimination in violation of the EEO laws; or\nOpposing a practice made unlawful by one of the employment discrimination statutes (e.g., communicating a\nreasonable belief that the employer’s activity violates the EEO laws) or engaging in nonverbal acts of opposition (e.g.,\nresisting an unwanted sexual advance by a supervisor or refusing to carry out an order reasonably believed to be\ndiscriminatory).\nRetaliatory conduct is taking an adverse action against an employee because he or she engaged in protected\nactivity. Examples of adverse action include firing, demotion, denial of promotion, unjustified negative evaluations,\nincreased surveillance, harassment, and assault\nTo avoid retaliation, supervisors and managers should:\n Avoid publicly discussing the protected activity.\n Be careful not to share information about the protected activity with any other managers or supervisors.\n Be mindful not to isolate the employee.\n Avoid reactive behavior such as denying the employee information, equipment, or benefits provided to others\nperforming similar duties.\n Be careful not to interfere with the complaint investigation.\n Be careful not to threaten the employee, witnesses, or anyone involved in the processing of the complaint.\n Apply policies and practices consistently. If a departure from the usual policy or practice is necessary,\ndocument the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the exception.\nCommunity Bank will not retaliate against any employee for complaining about discrimination or harassment. If\nyou feel you have been retaliated against, you should immediately contact your supervisor. If you feel you cannot\nseek help from your -supervisor, you should contact his or her supervisor, or the VP, Human Resources Manager,\nor executive/senior management for assistance.\nEvery complaint of retaliation will be investigated as promptly, thoroughly, and impartially as possible. We will\nprotect the confidentiality of complaints to the fullest extent possible. If the investigation determines that retaliation\nhas occurred, Community Bank will take immediate and appropriate action, up to and including termination.\nCommunity Bank will ensure that managers and supervisors take positive steps to comply with this policy. They\nare required to be aware of potential discrimination situations, quickly resolve any discrimination issues that arise,\nand refrain from retaliation or harassment against any employee involved in the filing, investigation, or resolution\nof a discrimination claim.\nManagers, supervisors, and all other employees are required to cooperate fully with the investigation and\nresolution of all retaliation complaints.\n(Rev. 02/2022)"

The Company intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor\nprovisions contained in the Act. The Company’s ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is\ninherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the\nCompany and its subsidiaries include, but are not limited to, general and local economic conditions, changes in market interest\nrates, deposit flows, demand for loans, real estate values and competition, competitive products and pricing, the ability of our\nclients to make scheduled loan payments, loan delinquency rates and trends, our ability to manage the risks involved in our\nbusiness, our ability to control costs and expenses, inflation, market and monetary fluctuations, changes in federal and state\nlegislation and regulation applicable to our business, actions by our competitors, and other factors that may be disclosed in the\nCompany’s periodic reports as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These risks and uncertainties should be\nconsidered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. The\nCompany assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as may be required by applicable law or\nregulation.\nExplanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to financial measures presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we use, and\nthis investor presentation may contain or reference, certain non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures provide useful information in understanding our underlying results of operations or financial position and\nour business and performance trends as they facilitate comparisons with the performance of other companies in the financial\nservices industry. Non-GAAP adjusted items impacting the Company's financial performance are identified to assist investors in\nproviding a complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business and in analyzing the Company’s\noperating results on the same basis as that applied by management. Although we believe that these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures enhance the understanding of our business and performance, they should not be considered an alternative to GAAP\nor considered to be more important than financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily\ncomparable with similar non-GAAP measures which may be presented by other companies. Where non-GAAP financial\nmeasures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial\nmeasure, can be found within the referenced earnings release.\nCB Financial Services, Inc.

As of the close of\nbusiness on that date, 5,142,901 shares of Company common stock were outstanding. Each share of common stock has\none vote.\nThe Company’s Articles of Incorporation provides that record holders of the Company’s common stock who beneficially\nown, either directly or indirectly, in excess of 15% of the Company’s outstanding shares are not entitled to any vote with respect\nto those shares held in excess of the 15% limit, subject to limited exceptions.\nOwnership of Shares; Attending the Meeting\nYou may own shares of the Company in one or more of the following ways:\n• Directly in your name as the stockholder of record; and\n• Indirectly through a broker, bank or other holder of record in “street name.”\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name, you are the holder of record of these shares and we are sending these\nproxy materials directly to you. As the holder of record, you have the right to give your proxy directly to us or to vote in person\nat the meeting.\nIf you hold your shares in street name, your broker, bank or other holder of record is sending these proxy materials to you.\nAs the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other holder of record how to vote by filling out a\nvoting instruction form that accompanies your proxy materials. Your broker, bank or other holder of record may allow you to\nprovide voting instructions by telephone or by the Internet. Please see the instruction form provided by your broker, bank or\nother holder of record that accompanies this proxy statement. If you hold your shares in street name, you will need proof of\nownership to be admitted to the meeting. Examples of proof of ownership are a recent brokerage statement or a letter from a\nbank or broker. If you want to vote your shares of CB Financial common stock held in street name in person at the meeting, you\nmust obtain a written proxy in your name from the broker, bank or other nominee who is the record holder of your shares.\nQuorum and Voting\nQuorum. We will have a quorum and will be able to conduct the business of the annual meeting if the holders of a majority\nof the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote are present at the meeting, either in person or by proxy.\nVote Required for Proposals. In voting on the election of directors, you may vote in favor of the nominees, withhold votes\nas to all nominees, or withhold votes as to specific nominees. There is no cumulative voting for the election of directors.\nDirectors must be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the annual meeting. This means that the nominees receiving the\n9\ngreatest number of votes will be elected up to the maximum number of directors to be elected at the annual meeting. The\nmaximum number of directors to be elected at the annual meeting is three.\nIn voting on the approval of the CB Financial Services, Inc. 2024 Equity Incentive Plan, you may vote in favor of the\nproposal, vote against the proposal or abstain from voting. To approve the proposal, the affirmative vote of a majority of the\nvotes cast at the annual meeting is required.\nIn voting on the ratification of the appointment of FORVIS, LLP to serve as the Company’s independent registered public\naccounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, you may vote in favor of the proposal, vote against the proposal\nor abstain from voting. To ratify the appointment of FORVIS, LLP, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the\nannual meeting is required.\nIn voting on the proposal to approve the compensation of the named executive officers, you may vote in favor of the\nproposal, vote against the proposal or abstain from voting. To approve the compensation of the named executive officers, the\naffirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting is required.\nHow We Count Votes. If you return valid proxy instructions or attend the meeting in person, we will count your shares to\ndetermine whether there is a quorum, even if you abstain from voting. Broker non-votes also will be counted to determine the\nexistence of a quorum.\nIn the election of directors, votes that are withheld and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the election.\nIn counting votes on the proposals to approve the CB Financial Services, Inc. 2024 Equity Incentive Plan and to ratify the\nappointment of FORVIS, LLP to serve as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, we will not count\nabstentions and broker non-votes as votes cast. Therefore, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome\nof the vote on the proposal. Similarly, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the advisory\n(non-binding) vote on the compensation of the named executive officers.\nEffect of Not Casting Your Vote\nIf you hold your shares in street name, you must cast your vote if you want it to count in the election of directors (Item 1),\nin the vote to approve the CB Financial Services, Inc. 2024 Equity Incentive Plan (Item 2) or in the advisory (non-binding) vote\nregarding the compensation of the named executive officers (Item 4). Current stock market regulations prohibit your bank or\nbroker from voting your uninstructed shares in the election of directors and on certain other matters on a discretionary basis.\nTherefore, if you hold your shares in street name and you do not instruct your bank or broker how to vote on Items 1, 2 or 4, no\nvotes will be cast on these matters on your behalf. These are referred to as “broker non-votes.” Your bank or broker, however,\nhas discretion to vote any uninstructed shares on the ratification of the appointment of the Company’s independent registered\npublic accounting firm (Item 3).\nVoting by Proxy\nThe Company’s Board is sending you this proxy statement to request that you allow your shares of Company common\nstock to be represented at the annual meeting by the persons named on the enclosed proxy card. All shares of Company common\nstock represented at the meeting by properly executed and dated proxies will be voted according to the instructions indicated on\nthe proxy card. If you sign, date and return a proxy card without giving voting instructions, your shares will be voted as\nrecommended by the Board.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that you vote:\n• “FOR” all the nominees for director;\n• \"FOR\" the approval of the CB Financial Services, Inc. 2024 Equity Incentive Plan;\n• “FOR” the ratification of the appointment of FORVIS, LLP to serve as the Company’s independent registered public\naccounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024; and\n• “FOR” the approval of the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers.\nIf any matters not described in this proxy statement are properly presented at the annual meeting, the persons named in the\nproxy card will use their judgment to determine how to vote your shares. This includes a motion to adjourn or postpone the\nannual meeting to solicit additional proxies. If the annual meeting is postponed or adjourned, your shares of Company common\nstock may be voted by the persons named in the proxy card on the new meeting date, provided that the new meeting occurs\nwithin 30 days of the original date of the annual meeting and you have not revoked your proxy. We do not currently know of\nany other matters to be presented at the annual meeting.\nInstead of voting by completing and mailing a proxy card, registered stockholders can vote their shares of Company\ncommon stock via the Internet or by telephone. The Internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate\n10\nstockholders’ identities, allow stockholders to provide their voting instructions and confirm that their instructions have been\nrecorded properly. Specific instructions for Internet and telephone voting appear on the enclosed proxy card. The deadline for\nvoting via the Internet or by telephone is 1:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on May 15, 2024.\nRevoking Your Proxy\nWhether you vote by mail, telephone or via the Internet, if you are a registered stockholder, unless otherwise noted, you\nmay later revoke your proxy by:\n• sending a written statement to that effect to the Company’s Corporate Secretary;\n• submitting a properly signed proxy card with a later date;\n• voting by telephone or via the Internet at a later time (if initially able to vote in that manner) so long as such vote is\nreceived by the applicable time and date set forth above for registered stockholders; or\n• voting in person at the annual meeting.\nIf you hold your shares through a bank, broker, trustee or nominee and you have instructed the bank, broker, trustee or\nnominee to vote your shares, you must follow the directions received from you bank, broker, trustee or nominee to change those\ninstructions.\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nDirector Independence\nThe Company’s Board currently consists of 9 members, all of whom are independent under the listing requirements of the\nNASDAQ Stock Market except for John H. Montgomery and Ralph Burchianti, who are our employees. In determining the\nindependence of directors, the Board considered the various deposit, loan and other relationships that each director has with the\nBank, including loans and lines of credit outstanding to Mark E. Fox, Charles R. Guthrie, CPA, John J. LaCarte, Roberta\nRobinson Olejasz and David F. Pollock or to their related entities, as well as the transactions disclosed under “Other\nInformation Relating to Directors and Executive Officers—Transactions with Related Persons”, but determined in each case\nthat these relationships did not interfere with their exercise of independent judgment in carrying out their responsibilities as\ndirectors.\nBoard Diversity\nThe Company’s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market. Nasdaq’s Board Diversity Rule requires the\nCompany to publicly disclose Board-level diversity statistics annually. As required by the Board Diversity Rule, the Company\nposted these statistics for 2022 and 2023 at the Investor Relations section of the Bank’s website (https://www.cb.bank). The\nBoard Diversity Rule also requires the Company to have or explain in its annual meeting proxy statement why it does not have\nat least one diverse director by August 7, 2023, and at least two diverse directors by August 6, 2025. The Company currently\nqualifies as a “smaller reporting company” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. Because the Company\nqualifies as a “smaller reporting company” it may satisfy the diversity objective of the Board Diversity Rule by having two\nfemale directors. The Company currently has one female director.\nBoard Leadership Structure and Board’s Role in Risk Oversight\nMr. Fox serves as Chairman of the Board and Mr. Guthrie serves as Vice Chairman of the Board. The Board believes this\narrangement is appropriate given that more than a simple majority of the members of the Board are independent. The Board\nbelieves that the independent directors, working together, provide strong, independent oversight of the Company’s management\nand affairs. The Board has not designated a lead independent director.\nRisk is inherent with every business, and how well a business manages risk can ultimately determine its success. The\nCompany faces several risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, strategic risk and reputation\nrisk. Management is responsible for the daily management of risks the Company faces, while the Board, as a whole and through\nits committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk oversight role, the Board has the\nresponsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and\nfunctioning as designed. To do this, the Chairman of the Board meets regularly with management to discuss strategy and the\nrisks facing the Company. Senior management attends the Board meetings and is available to address any questions or concerns\nraised by the Board on risk management and any other matters. The independent members of the Board, working together,\nprovide strong, independent oversight of the Company’s management and affairs through its standing committees and, when\nnecessary, special meetings of independent directors.\n11\nCorporate Governance Policy\nThe Board has adopted a corporate governance policy to govern certain activities, including: the duties and responsibilities\nof directors; the composition, responsibilities and operations of the Board; the establishment and operation of Board\ncommittees; succession planning; convening executive sessions of independent directors; the Board’s interaction with\nmanagement and third parties; and the evaluation of the performance of the Board and of the President and Chief Executive\nOfficer.\nBoard Committees\nThe following table identifies the Board’s standing committees and their members as of December 31, 2023. All members\nof each committee are independent in accordance with the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market. Each committee\noperates under a written charter that is approved by the Board and that governs its composition, responsibilities and operation.\nEach committee reviews and reassesses the adequacy of its charter at least annually. The charter of each committee is available\nat the Investor Relations section of the Bank’s website (https://www.cb.bank).\nNominating/\nCorporate\nAudit Compensation Governance\nDirector Committee Committee Committee\nJonathan A.

The Audit Committee is also responsible for\nengaging the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm and monitoring its conduct and independence. The\nCompany’s Board has designated Charles R. Guthrie, CPA as an “audit committee financial expert” under the rules of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission.\nCompensation Committee\nThe Compensation Committee approves the compensation objectives for the Company and the Bank, establishes the\ncompensation for the Company’s and Bank’s executive management and conducts the performance review of the President and\nChief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee reviews and evaluates all components of compensation, including\nsalaries, cash incentive plans, long-term incentive plans and various employee benefit matters. The Compensation Committee\nalso administers and has discretionary authority over the issuance of equity awards under the Company’s equity incentive plan.\nDecisions by the Compensation Committee with respect to the compensation of executive officers, except for the issuance of\nequity awards, are approved by the full Board. The Compensation Committee also assists the Board in evaluating potential\ncandidates for executive positions. With respect to other executive officers, the Chief Executive Officer recommends their\nannual compensation based on both individual and company-wide performance, subject to review and approval of the\nCompensation Committee and the Board. In addition, the Compensation Committee may delegate to management certain of its\nduties and responsibilities, including the adoption, amendment, modification or termination of the Bank’s tax-qualified\nretirement plans and health and welfare plans. The Compensation Committee also reviews the form and amount of\ncompensation paid to our non-management directors from time to time.\nThe Compensation Committee has sole authority and responsibility under its charter to approve the engagement of any\ncompensation consultant it uses and the fees for those services. The Compensation Committee did not engage the services of a\n12\ncompensation consultant during 2023. The Company/Compensation Committee engaged Meridian as a third-party consultant in\nconnection with the form and design of the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan. The fees associated with the consultation service was\napproximately $24,000.\nNominating/Corporate Governance Committee\nThe Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in: (i) identifying individuals qualified to become\nBoard members, consistent with criteria approved by the Board; (ii) recommending to the Board the director nominees for the\nnext annual meeting; (iii) implementing policies and practices relating to corporate governance, including implementation of\nand monitoring adherence to corporate governance guidelines; (iv) leading the Board in its annual review of the Board’s\nperformance; and (v) recommending director nominees for each committee.\nMinimum Qualifications for Director Nominees. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee has adopted a set of\ncriteria that it considers when it selects individuals to be nominated for election to the Board. A candidate must meet the\neligibility requirements set forth in the Company’s Bylaws, which include a requirement that the candidate has not been subject\nto certain criminal or regulatory actions. A candidate also must meet any qualification requirements set forth in any Board or\ncommittee governing documents.\nIf a candidate is deemed eligible for election to the Board, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee will then\nevaluate the following criteria in selecting nominees:\n• contributions to the range of talent, skill and expertise of the Board;\n• financial, regulatory and business experience, knowledge of the banking and financial service industries, familiarity\nwith the operations of public companies and ability to read and understand financial statements;\n• familiarity with the Company’s market area and participation in and ties to local businesses and local civic, charitable\nand religious organizations;\n• personal and professional integrity, honesty and reputation;\n• the ability to represent the best interests of the stockholders of the Company and the best interests of the institution;\n• the ability to devote sufficient time and energy to the performance of his or her duties;\n• independence as that term is defined under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission and stock exchange listing\ncriteria; and\n• current equity holdings in the Company.\nThe Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee also will consider any other factors it deems relevant, including\ndiversity, age, competition, size of the Board and regulatory disclosure obligations.\nWith respect to nominating an existing director for re-election to the Board, the Nominating/Corporate Governance\nCommittee will consider and review an existing director’s attendance and performance at Board meetings and at meetings of\ncommittees on which he or she serves; length of Board service; the experience, skills and contributions that the existing director\nbrings to the Board; and independence.\nDirector Nomination Process. For purposes of identifying nominees for the Board, the Nominating/Corporate Governance\nCommittee relies on personal contacts of the committee members and other members of the Board, as well as its knowledge of\nmembers of the communities served by the Bank. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee will also consider director\ncandidates recommended by stockholders according to the policy and procedures set forth below. The Nominating/Corporate\nGovernance Committee has not previously used an independent search firm to identify nominees.\nIn evaluating potential nominees, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee determines whether the candidate is\neligible and qualified for service on the Board by evaluating the candidate under the criteria set forth above. If such individual\nfulfills these criteria, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee will conduct a check of the individual’s background\nand interview the candidate to further assess the qualities of the prospective nominee and the contributions he or she would\nmake to the Board.\nConsideration of Stockholder Recommendations. It is the policy of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee to\nconsider director candidates recommended by stockholders who appear to be qualified to serve on the Company’s Board. The\nNominating/Corporate Governance Committee may choose not to consider an unsolicited recommendation if no vacancy exists\non the Board and the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee does not perceive a need to increase the size of the Board.\nIn order to avoid the unnecessary use of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee’s resources, the Nominating/\nCorporate Governance Committee will consider only those director candidates recommended in accordance with the procedures\nset forth below.\n13\nProcedures to be Followed by Stockholders. To submit a recommendation of a director candidate to the Nominating/\nCorporate Governance Committee, a stockholder should submit the following information in writing, addressed to the Chairman\nof the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, care of the Corporate Secretary, at the main office of the Company:\n1. The name of the person recommended as a director candidate;\n2. All information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of\ndirectors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;\n3.

A statement disclosing whether such stockholder is acting with or on behalf of any other person and, if applicable, the\nidentity of such person.\nIn order for a director candidate to be considered for nomination at the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders, the\nrecommendation must be received by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee at least 120 calendar days before the\ndate the Company’s proxy statement was released to stockholders in connection with the previous year’s annual meeting,\nadvanced by one year.\nBoard and Committee Meetings\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors held 18 meetings. One director\nattended less than 75% of the total meetings of the Company’s and the Bank’s Board of Directors and the respective committees\non which such director served during the fiscal year.\nDirector Attendance at Annual Meeting of Stockholders\nThe Board encourages each director to attend the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders. All of the Company’s\ndirectors then serving attended last year’s annual meeting of stockholders.\nCode of Ethics and Business Conduct\nThe Company has adopted a code of ethics and business conduct which applies to all of the Company’s and the Bank’s\ndirectors, officers and employees. A copy of the code of ethics and business conduct is available on the Investor Relations\nsection of the Bank’s website (https://www.cb.bank).\nREPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE\nThe Company’s management is responsible for the Company’s internal controls and financial reporting process. The\nCompany’s independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements and issuing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States. The Audit Committee oversees the Company’s internal controls and financial\nreporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors.\nIn this context, the Audit Committee has met and held discussions with management and the independent registered public\naccounting firm. Management represented to the Audit Committee that the Company’s consolidated financial statements were\nprepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and the Audit Committee has\nreviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and the independent registered public\naccounting firm. The Audit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm matters required to be\ndiscussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit\nCommittee, which include matters related to the conduct of the audit of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public\naccounting firm, required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the\nindependent registered public accounting firm’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has\ndiscussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the firm’s independence from the Company and its\nmanagement. In concluding that the registered public accounting firm is independent, the Audit Committee considered, among\nother factors, whether the non-audit services provided by the firm were compatible with its independence.\n14\nThe Audit Committee discussed with the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope and\nplans for their audit. The Audit Committee meets with the independent registered public accounting firm, with and without\nmanagement present, to discuss the results of their examination, their evaluation of the Company’s internal controls, and the\noverall quality of the Company’s financial reporting.\nIn performing all of these functions, the Audit Committee acts only in an oversight capacity. In its oversight role, the Audit\nCommittee relies on the work and assurances of the Company’s management, which has the primary responsibility for financial\nstatements and reports, and of the independent registered public accounting firm who, in its report, express an opinion on the\nconformity of the Company’s consolidated financial statements to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\nThe Audit Committee’s oversight does not provide it with an independent basis to determine that management has maintained\nappropriate accounting and financial reporting principles or policies, or appropriate internal controls and procedures designed to\nassure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committee’s\nconsiderations and discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm do not assure that the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the\nUnited States, that the audit of the Company’s consolidated financial statements has been carried out in accordance with\ngenerally accepted auditing standards or that the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm is “independent.”\nIn reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board, and the\nBoard has approved, that the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company’s Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit\nCommittee also has approved, subject to stockholder ratification, the selection of the Company’s independent registered public\naccounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.\nAudit Committee of the Board of Directors of\nCB Financial Services, Inc.\nCharles R.

No further grants will be made under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan upon stockholder approval of the 2024\nEquity Incentive Plan.\nFederal Income Tax Considerations\nThe following is a summary of the federal income tax consequences that may arise in conjunction with participation in the 2024\nEquity Incentive Plan.\nRestricted Stock. A participant who has been granted a restricted stock award will not realize taxable income at the time of\ngrant, provided the stock subject to the award is not delivered at the time of grant, or if the stock is delivered, it is subject to\nrestrictions that constitute a “substantial risk of forfeiture” for federal income tax purposes. Upon the later of delivery or vesting\nof shares subject to an award, the holder will realize ordinary income in an amount equal to the then fair market value of those\nshares and the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction for tax purposes. Gains or losses realized by the\nparticipant upon disposition of the shares will be treated as capital gains and losses, with the basis in the shares equal to the fair\nmarket value of the shares at the time of delivery or vesting. Dividends paid to the holder during the restriction period, if so\nprovided, will also be compensation income to the participant and the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction\nfor tax purposes. A participant who makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code will include the full\nfair market value of the restricted stock award subject to such election in taxable income in the year of grant at the grant date\nfair market value. Participants will be able to exercise voting rights with respect to unvested restricted stock awards.\nRestricted Stock Units. A participant who has been granted a restricted stock unit will not realize taxable income at the time of\ngrant and will not be entitled to make an election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code since no stock is transferred\nto the recipient on the date of grant. At the time a restricted stock unit vests, assuming the award is settled at that time, the\nrecipient will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock or the amount of\ncash received. If the restricted stock unit is not distributed at the time it vests, no income will be recognized at that time and\ntaxation will be deferred until the value of the restricted stock unit is settled. At the time the recipient recognizes taxable income\non a restricted stock unit, the Company will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction of the same amount recognized by the\naward recipient.\nDividend Equivalent Rights. The grant of a dividend equivalent right will not result in taxable income to the participant. At the\ntime of payment of a cash dividend with respect to shares of common stock underlying a dividend equivalent right, or with\nrespect to a stand-alone dividend equivalent right, the cash received will be taxable to the participant as ordinary income and the\nCompany will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction.\n22\nWithholding of Taxes. The Company may withhold amounts from participants to satisfy tax withholding requirements. Except\nas otherwise provided by the Compensation Committee, participants may have shares withheld from awards to satisfy the tax\nwithholding requirements.\nChange in Control. Any acceleration of the vesting or payment of awards under the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan in the event of\na change in control or termination of service following a change in control may cause part or all of the consideration involved to\nbe treated as an “excess parachute payment” under the Internal Revenue Code, which may subject the participant to a 20%\nexcise tax and limit the tax deduction by the Company.\nTax Advice. The preceding discussion is based on federal tax laws and regulations presently in effect, which are subject to\nchange, and this discussion does not purport to be a complete description of the federal income tax aspects of the 2024 Equity\nIncentive Plan. A participant may also be subject to state and local taxes in connection with awards under the 2024 Equity\nIncentive Plan.\nAccounting Treatment\nUnder U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company is required to recognize compensation expense in its\nfinancial statements over the requisite service period or performance period based on the grant date fair value of equity-based\ncompensation (such as restricted stock awards and restricted stock units).\nAwards to be Granted\nThe Board of Directors adopted the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan, and the Compensation Committee intends to meet after\nstockholder approval to determine the specific terms of the awards, including the allocation of awards to officers, employees\nand non-employee directors. At the present time, no specific determination has been made as to the grant or allocation of\nawards. As of March 25, 2024, there were 7 non-employee directors, approximately 162 employees and approximately no\nservice providers eligible to receive awards under the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan.\nRequired Vote and Recommendation of the Board\nIn order to approve the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan, the proposal must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes\ncast at the meeting.\nThe Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the approval of the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan.\nItem 3 — Ratification of the Appointment of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has appointed FORVIS, LLP (\"FORVIS\") to serve as the Company’s\nindependent registered public accounting firm for the 2024 fiscal year, subject to ratification by stockholders.

The following table sets forth the total fees billed by FORVIS for services performed for the 2023 and 2022 fiscal\nyears.\nFiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nAudit Fees (1) $ 352,946 $ 324,865\nAudit-Related Fees (2) 13,125 12,605\nTax Fees (3) 27,195 29,555\nTotal Fees $ 393,266 $ 367,025\n(1) Includes professional services rendered for the audit of the Company's annual financial statements and review of financial\nstatements included in Forms 10-Q, or services normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings (i.e., attest\nservices required by FDICIA or Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), including out-of-pocket expenses.\n(2) Includes professional services rendered in connection with the audit of the Company’s employee benefit plan.\n(3) Includes professional services rendered for the preparation of state and federal tax returns and tax consulting matters.\nThese services and related fees were communicated and approved in accordance with the Audit Committee’s policies and\napplicable SEC and PCAOB rules.\nPolicy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of the Independent Registered\nPublic Accounting Firm. The Audit Committee has adopted a policy for approval of audit and permitted non-audit services by\nthe Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee will consider annually and approve the\nprovision of audit services by the independent registered public accounting firm and, if appropriate, approve the provision of\ncertain defined audit and non-audit services. The Audit Committee also will consider on a case-by-case basis and, if appropriate,\napprove specific engagements.\nAny proposed specific engagement may be presented to the Audit Committee for consideration at its next regular meeting\nor, if earlier consideration is required, to the Audit Committee or one or more of its members. The member or members to\nwhom such authority is delegated shall report any specific approval of services at its next regular meeting.

This proposal, commonly known as a “say-on-pay” proposal, gives\nthe Company’s stockholders the opportunity to endorse or not endorse the Company’s executive compensation program and\npolicies through a vote on the following resolution:\n“Resolved, that the Company’s stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company’s named\nexecutive officers, as described in the tabular disclosure regarding named executive officer compensation and the accompanying\nnarrative disclosure in this proxy statement.”\nBecause the vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Company or the Board. However, the Compensation\nCommittee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements.\nThe Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” approval of the compensation of the Company’s named\nexecutive officers.\nThe federal securities laws also require the Company to obtain, at least once every six years, a stockholder vote on the\nfrequency of a stockholder vote on the compensation of the named executive officers. At the Company’s 2020 annual meeting\nof stockholders, the Board of Directors recommended, and the Company’s stockholders voted in favor of, an annual advisory\nvote on the compensation of the named executive officers. The next stockholder vote on the frequency of a stockholder vote on\nthe compensation of the named executive officers will occur no later than at the Company’s 2026 annual meeting of\nstockholders.\n24\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nSummary Compensation Table.

The composition of the bonus was the following; $300,000 cash payout, 6,250\nshares of stock awards and 10,000 shares of stock options that vested immediately upon the grant date of December 20, 2023 at the\ncurrent grant date market price of $24.03. The value of the stock awards and stock options were $150,188 and $56,428, respectively.\n(2) Amounts presented for a fiscal year were paid in the next year for performance pursuant to the Corporation's Incentive Compensation\nPlan.\n(3) These amounts represent the grant date fair value of the awards issued to the named executive officers under the 2021 Equity Incentive\nPlan, as determined in accordance with applicable accounting standards, based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on\nthe grant date ($22.01 and $26.25 per share on February 16, 2023 and 2022, respectively). Although the full grant date fair value of the\nstock awards and option awards are reflected in the above table, the actual value of the stock options, if any, realized by the named\nexecutive officers will depend on the extent to which the market value of the Company common stock exceeds the exercise price of the\nstock option on the date of exercise. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the value realized by a named executive officer will be at or\nnear the estimated values reflected in the above table.\n(4) The following table details the amounts reported in the “All Other Compensation” column for 2023. The table may exclude perquisites\nwhich did not exceed $10,000 in the aggregate for each named executive officer.\nMr. Montgomery Mr. Burchianti Ms. George\nEmployer contributions to 401(k) plan $ 26,072 $ 26,342 $ 14,764\nEmployer insurance premiums 15,332 5,689 1,171\nCompany car 2,812 — —\nCell phone 840 — 300\nCash in lieu of dividends on restricted stock awards 7,588 3,663 3,510\nImputed income on split dollar life insurance 4,259 559 —\nTotal Other Compensation $ 56,903 $ 36,253 $ 19,745\nEmployment Agreements and Executive Consultant Agreement.

The employment agreement for Ms. George has a current term that expires on\nApril 30, 2025. On each anniversary date (which is defined as May 1 of each calendar year), the employment agreement will\nextend for one year such that the remaining term will be for 36 months thereafter, provided that disinterested members of the\nBank’s Board of Directors conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of Ms. George and affirmatively approve the\nextension.\nThe employment agreement provides for an annual base salary rate of $243,361 for Ms. George.

The Bank maintains a bonus program designed to align the interests of employees of the\nBank with the overall performance of the Company and the Bank. Eligible employees, including our named executive officers\nare participants of the bonus program. Each employee’s bonus amount is assigned as a percentage of base salary reflecting their\nrole, responsibility, performance, as well as competitive market. Target incentive opportunities are 45% of salary for Chief\nExecutive Officer and 35% of salary for other named executive officers. The bonus amounts are determined based on the\nsatisfaction of objective performance targets and paid out in a combination of cash and equity. All executives receive 50% in\ncash and 50% in equity (25% restricted stock awards and 25% stock options), except for our Chief Executive Officer, who\nreceived 40% in cash and 60% in equity (30% restricted stock awards and 30% stock options). The bonus is based on the\nweighted financial ratings from the Corporate Scorecard for the following levels, Threshold, Target and Superior established by\nthe Compensation Committee and can range from 10-80% for the Chief Executive Officer and 10-60% for other executives. For\n2023, performance goals were pre-tax income (50%), nonperforming assets ratio (15%), deposit growth (15%), and loan growth\n(20%). Peer data from like-sized financial institutions was considered to evaluate these factors.\nSplit Dollar Agreements. The Bank has entered into split dollar life insurance agreements with each Messrs. Montgomery\nand Burchianti. Under each agreement, the executive’s designated beneficiary will be entitled to share in the proceeds under a\nlife insurance policy owned by the Bank on the life of the executive. The death benefit payable to Mr. Montgomery is $500,000\nless the value of Mr. Montgomery’s 5,000 shares of restricted stock and 15,000 stock options awarded under the 2015 Equity\nIncentive Plan on August 31, 2020 determined as of the date of death, provided, however, that the death proceeds will not\nexceed the “net death proceeds.” The “net death proceeds” is defined as the total death proceeds of the Policy minus the greater\nof: (i) the cash surrender value or (ii) the aggregate premiums paid by the Bank related to the Policy. The death benefit payable\nto Mr. Burchianti is $200,000, provided, however that the death benefit must not exceed the executive’s net-at-risk portion of\nthe proceeds (which is the difference between the cash surrender value of the policy and the total proceeds payable under the\npolicy upon the death of the insured). For Mr. Burchianti, if his termination occurs subsequent to a change in control of the\nBank, he will be 100% vested in his death benefit. The Bank is the sole beneficiary of any death proceeds remaining after the\nexecutive’s death benefit has been paid to his designated beneficiary.\n401(k) Plan. The Bank maintains the 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan, a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan (the\n“401(k) Plan”), for all employees who have satisfied the 401(k) Plan’s eligibility requirements. Each eligible employee can\nbegin participating in the 401(k) Plan on the first day of the calendar quarter following the attainment of age 18 and completion\nof three months of service.\nA participant may contribute up to 100% of his or her compensation to the 401(k) Plan on a pre-tax or post-tax (referred to\nas a “Roth” contribution) basis, subject to the limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. For 2023, the salary deferral\ncontribution limit was $22,500 provided, however, that a participant over age 50 may contribute an additional $7,500 to the\n401(k) Plan. Each plan year, the Bank makes a matching contribution, based on each participant’s salary deferral contribution.\nThe matching contribution formula is currently a 25% match of employee 401(k) Plan deferrals (if any) up to the first 4% of\ncompensation deferred. In addition to salary deferral contributions, the 401(k) Plan provides that the Bank will make a safe\nharbor employer contribution to each eligible participant’s account equal to 3% of the participant’s compensation earned during\nthe plan year (referred to as a “safe harbor contribution”). A participant is always 100% vested in his or her salary deferral and\nsafe harbor contributions. In addition, for the 2023 plan year, the Bank made a discretionary profit sharing contribution to each\neligible participant's account equal to 1%.\nEach participant vests in his or her profit sharing contribution at a rate 20% per year such that the participant will become\n100% vested upon the completion of five years of credited service. However, a participant will immediately become 100%\nvested in any profit sharing contributions upon the participant’s death, disability or attainment of age 65 while employed with\nthe Bank.\nGenerally, a participant (or participant’s beneficiary upon death) may receive a distribution from his or her vested account\nat retirement, age 59½ (while employed with the Bank), death, disability or termination of employment, which is payable in a\nlump sum. Each participant has an individual account under the 401(k) Plan and may direct the investment of his or her account\nbalance among a variety of investment options available under the plan.\n27\n2021 Equity Incentive Plan. At the 2021 annual meeting, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2021 Equity Incentive\nPlan to provide officers, employees and directors of the Company and the Bank with additional incentives to promote the\ngrowth and performance of the Company.\nSubject to permitted adjustments for certain corporate transactions, the maximum number of shares of Company common\nstock that may be delivered to participants under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan is equal to 500,000 shares of Company\ncommon stock (the “Share Limit”). Shares of Company common stock subject to the Share Limit may be issued pursuant to\ngrants of stock options, restricted stock awards or restricted stock units, provided, however that the Share Limit is reduced, on a\none-for-one basis, for each share of common stock subject to a stock option grant, and on a two and one-half-for-one basis for\neach share of common stock issued pursuant to restricted stock awards or restricted stock unit awards. If any award granted\nunder the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan expires, terminates, is canceled or is forfeited without being settled or exercised or is\nsettled without the issuance of shares of common stock, shares of Company common stock subject to such award will be made\navailable for future grant under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan. If any shares are surrendered or tendered to pay the exercise\nprice of a stock option, such shares will not again be available for grant under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan. In addition,\nshares of common stock withheld in payment for purposes of satisfying tax withholding obligations with respect to an award do\nnot become available for re-issuance under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan.\nEmployees and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to receive awards under the 2021 Equity Incentive\nPlan, except non-employee directors may not be granted incentive stock options. The 2021 Equity Incentive Plan will be\nadministered by the members of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may grant any of these types of\nawards subject to performance-based vesting conditions. Such awards shall be referred to herein as “performance awards.” As\nof December 31, 2023, stock options and 0 shares of restricted stock remain available for award from the 2021 Equity\nIncentive Plan.\nThe Compensation Committee shall specify the vesting schedule or conditions of each award. Awards made under the 2021\nEquity Plan are subject to a minimum vesting period of one year from the date of grant, provided, however, that the following\nawards would not be subject to the one year minimum vesting requirement: (1) substitute awards granted in connection with\nawards that are assumed, converted or substituted pursuant to a merger, acquisition or similar transaction; (2) awards to non-\nemployee directors that vest on the earlier of the one-year anniversary of the date of grant or the next annual meeting of\nstockholders that is at least 50 weeks after the immediately preceding year’s annual meeting; and (3) up to 5% of the available\nshare reserve authorized for issuance under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, vesting (including the reduction or elimination of any restrictions) may be accelerated in the\nevent of death, disability, or upon involuntary termination of employment or service following a change in control.\nAs part of this proxy statement, stockholders are being asked to approve the CB Financial Services, Inc. 2024 Equity\nIncentive Plan (see Item 2). If stockholders approve the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan, no additional awards will be granted under\nthe 2021 Equity Incentive Plan.\n28\nOutstanding Equity Awards.

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company’s executive officers and directors,\nand persons who own more than 10% of any registered class of the Company’s equity securities, to file reports of ownership and\nchanges in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These individuals are required by regulation to furnish the\nCompany with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file.\nDelinquent Section 16(a) Reports. Based solely on its review of the copies of the reports it has received and written\nrepresentations provided to it from the individuals required to file the reports, the Company believes that each of its executive\nofficers and directors has complied with applicable reporting requirements for transactions in the Company’s common stock\nduring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, except for Karl G. Baily, Jonathan A. Bedway, Richard B. Boyer, Ralph\nBurchianti, Mark E. Fox, Charles R. Guthrie, CPA, Joseph Headlee, John J. LaCarte, John H. Montgomery, Roberta Robinson\nOlejasz, David F. Pollock, John M. Swiatek, Jamie L. Prah, CPA, and Jennifer L. George who each inadvertently failed to file a\ntimely Form 4 for the February 16, 2023 equity grants, and for John H. Montgomery and Jennifer L. George who each\ninadvertently failed to file a timely Form 4 to report the sale of common stock shares to cover taxes related to equity vesting on\nDecember 20, 2023 and December 15, 2023, respectively.\n29\nTransactions with Related Persons\nLoans and Extensions of Credit. Federal law generally prohibits the Company from making loans to its executive officers\nand directors. However, there is a specific exemption from such prohibition for loans made by the Bank to its executive officers\nand directors in compliance with federal banking regulations. Federal banking regulations generally require that all loans or\nextensions of credit to executive officers and directors of insured institutions must be made on substantially the same terms,\nincluding interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and must\nnot involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. However, federal regulations allow\nfinancial institutions, such as the Bank, to make loans to executive officers and directors at reduced interest rates if the loans are\nmade under a benefit program that is generally available to all other employees and that does not give preference to any\nexecutive officer or director over any other employee.\nIn addition, loans made to a director or executive officer in an amount that, when aggregated with the amount of all other\nloans to the person and his or her related interests, are in excess of the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the Bank’s capital and\nsurplus, up to a maximum of $500,000, must be approved in advance by a majority of the disinterested members of the Bank’s\nBoard of Directors.\nThe outstanding balance of loans extended by the Bank to its executive officers and directors and related parties was $0.0\nmillion at December 31, 2023. Such loans were made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms,\nincluding interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to the Bank,\nand did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features when made.\nOther Transactions. Since January 1, 2023, there have been no transactions and there are no currently proposed\ntransactions in which the Company or the Bank were or are to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and\nin which any of the Company’s executive officers and directors had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.\nPay Versus Performance\nPay Versus Performance (\"PvP\"). The SEC adopted amendments to its rules in August 2022 requiring companies to\ndisclose information reflecting the correlation between executive compensation actually paid by a company and the company's\nfinancial performance. The following table lists executive compensation actually paid to John H. Montgomery, the Company's\nprincipal executive officer (\"PEO\"), and Ralph Burchianti and Jennifer L. George, the Company's Non-PEO named executive\nofficers (\"NEOs\"), and total shareholder return (\"TSR\") and net income for the Company's two most recent fiscal years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAverage Value of Initial\nSummary Fixed $100\nCompensation Average Investment\nCompensation Table Total Compensation Based on Total\nSCT Total for Actually Paid to for Non-PEO Actually Paid to Shareholder\nYear PEO PEO NEOs (1) Non-PEO NEOs Return (2) Net Income (3)\n2023 $1,182,137 $1,277,812 $391,627 $429,341 $133.58 $22,550,000\n2022 651,808 605,669 387,094 366,173 116.69 11,247,000\n(1) The Average SCT Table Total for Non-PEO NEOs consist of compensation for Mr. Burchianti and Ms. George for each year presented.\n(2) The total shareholder return (\"TSR\") is calculated by taking the difference of the Company's stock price from the beginning of the measurement\nperiod, December 31, 2020 at $20.01, and the ending of the measurement periods of December 31, 2022 and 2023 at $21.43 and $23.81, respectively.

Calvario, Corporate Secretary. Communications to\nindividual directors should be sent to such director at the Company’s address. Stockholders who wish to communicate with a\ncommittee of the Board should send their communications to the attention of the Chairman of the particular committee.

This practice, known as “householding,” is designed to\nreduce our printing and postage costs. However, if a stockholder residing at such an address wishes to receive a separate annual\nreport or proxy statement in the future, he or she should contact the broker or other holder of record. If you own your shares in\n“street name” and are receiving multiple copies of our annual report and proxy statement, you can request householding by\ncontacting your broker or other holder of record.\nWhether or not you plan to attend the annual meeting, please vote by marking, signing, dating and promptly returning the\nenclosed proxy card in the enclosed envelope, or by voting via the Internet or by telephone.\nBy Order of the Board of Directors,\nElizabeth A.

Any amendment by the Committee to the Plan or an Award Agreement\npursuant to this Section 2.5 shall maintain, to the extent practicable, the original intent of the applicable provision without\nviolating Code Section 409A. A Participant’s acceptance of any Award under the Plan constitutes acknowledgement and\nconsent to such rights of the Committee, without further consideration or action. Any discretionary authority retained by the\nCommittee pursuant to the terms of this Plan or pursuant to an Award Agreement shall not be applicable to an Award which is\ndetermined to constitute Deferred Compensation, if such discretionary authority would contravene Code Section 409A.

In addition, the Committee is authorized to make adjustments in the terms and\nconditions of, and the criteria included in, outstanding Awards (including, without limitation, cancellation of Awards in\nexchange for the in-the-money value, if any, of the vested portion thereof, or substitution or exchange of Awards using stock of\na successor or other entity) in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, events described in\nthe preceding sentence) affecting the Company or any parent or Subsidiary or the financial statements of the Company or any\nparent or Subsidiary, or in response to changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles.\nSection 3.5 Delivery of Shares.

BUSINESS\nCB Financial Services, Inc.\nCB Financial Services, Inc. (the “Company”), a Pennsylvania corporation, is a bank holding company headquartered in\nCarmichaels, Pennsylvania. The Company’s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “CBFV.”\nThe Company conducts its operations primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary, Community Bank, a Pennsylvania-\nchartered commercial bank. At December 31, 2023, the Company, on a consolidated basis, had total assets of $1.46 billion,\ntotal liabilities of $1.32 billion and stockholders’ equity of $139.8 million.\nCopies of the Company's reports, proxy and information statements, and other information filed electronically with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) are available free of charge through the SEC’s website address at https://\nwww.sec.gov and through the Bank’s website address at https://www.cb.bank.\nCommunity Bank\nCommunity Bank is a Pennsylvania-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Carmichaels, Pennsylvania. The Bank\noperates 10 offices in Greene, Allegheny, Washington, Fayette and Westmoreland Counties in southwestern Pennsylvania and\nthree offices in Marshall and Ohio Counties in West Virginia. The Bank also has a loan production office in Allegheny County,\na loan production office and a corporate center in Washington County and an operations center in Greene County,\nPennsylvania. The Bank is a community-oriented institution offering residential and commercial real estate loans, commercial\nand industrial loans, and consumer loans as well as a variety of deposit products for individuals and businesses in its market\narea.\nThe Bank is the sole shareholder of Exchange Underwriters, Inc. (\"Exchange Underwriters\" or “EU”), a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary located in Washington County that was a full-service, independent insurance agency that offered property and\ncasualty, commercial liability, surety and other insurance products. On December 1, 2023, the Company announced that the\nBank and EU entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with World Insurance Associates, LLC (\"World\") pursuant to which\nEU sold substantially all of its assets to World for a purchase price of $30.5 million cash plus possible additional earn-out\npayments. The sale of assets was completed on December 8, 2023 and resulted in a pre-tax gain of $24.6 million. Assets\nremaining in the EU subsidiary at December 31, 2023 consisted primarily of cash received from the sale of assets. The EU\nsubsidiary will be dissolved with the remaining assets and liabilities being transferred to the Bank during 2024.\nThe Bank was originally chartered in 1901 as The First National Bank of Carmichaels. In 1987, the Bank changed its name\nto Community Bank, National Association. In December 2006, the Bank completed a charter conversion from a national bank\nto a Pennsylvania-chartered commercial bank wholly-owned by the Company. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home\nLoan Bank (“FHLB”) System. Its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).\nThe principal executive office is located at 100 North Market Street, Carmichaels, Pennsylvania, and the telephone number\nat that address is (724) 966-5041. The website address is https://www.cb.bank. Information on this website is not and should not\nbe considered to be a part of this Report.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe intend to operate as a well-capitalized and profitable community bank dedicated to providing exceptional personal\nservice to our customers. We believe that we have a competitive advantage in the markets we serve because of our knowledge\nof the local marketplace and our long-standing history of providing superior, relationship-based customer service. We will\ncontinue to grow and create value for our stockholders. Our employees will be treated fairly and given opportunities for\npersonal growth. We will be closely involved in improving our communities. Our business strategies emphasize building on\ncore strengths and are discussed below.\n• Create a sales and service culture to build full relationships with our customers and utilize technology\ninvestments to enhance speed of process to improve our customer experience. We have successfully grown\nvaluable core deposits (demand deposits, NOW accounts, money market accounts and savings accounts) that represent\nlonger-term customer relationships and provide a lower cost of funding compared to certificates of deposit and\nborrowings. Empowering our experienced, high quality employees to provide superior customer service in all aspects\nof our business which is further supported by the use of technology and a wide array of modern financial products can\nlead to stronger customer relationships, enhance fee revenue and allow the Bank to be the bank of choice across our\nfootprint for residents and small and medium sized businesses.\n• Evolve toward more electronic/digital products and processes driving greater efficiency and expand our brand\nawareness in our market. We intend to focus on building our mobile and online capabilities through an improved\nmobile banking platform and product offering, omnichannel experience that is consistent with quick results and\ninteractive alerts.\n51\n• Enhance profitability and efficiency while continuing to invest for future growth. Margin compression continues\nto be a challenge. To combat this impact on core earnings, we view cost reduction as a key part of a company-wide\nefficiency effort. Short-term targeted cost reductions combined with long-term strategic initiatives will better position\nthe Company for high performance. In addition, this strategy aligns with our efforts to simplify processes while\nutilizing technology to improve efficiency and build capabilities that supports future growth and high performance.\n• Continue our track record of opportunistic growth in the robust Pittsburgh metropolitan area and across our\nfootprint. We believe we have competed effectively by leveraging our branch network and a full assortment of\nbanking products to facilitate deposit and loan growth in our core locations, including southwestern Pennsylvania,\nOhio River Valley, and central West Virginia.\n• Leverage our credit culture and strong loan underwriting to uphold our asset quality metrics. We have sought to\nmaintain a high level of asset quality and moderate credit risk by using underwriting standards that we believe are\nconservative. Although we intend to continue our efforts to originate commercial real estate and commercial and\nindustrial loans, we intend to continue our philosophy of managing loan exposures through our conservative, yet\nreasonable, approach to lending.\nHuman Capital\nThe Bank's culture is defined by our mission to partner with individuals, businesses, and communities to realize their\ndreams, protect their financial futures and improve their lives. Our Motto and Cornerstone are “Client Experience First”. To\nhave a truly great client experience we must have a phenomenal employee experience. Our Team members need to have the\ntools, training, processes, and leadership to support their delivery of a truly exceptional client experience. Improving our\noperational efficiency empowers our employees to work smarter and enables us to be more responsive to our clients.\nWe value our employees by investing in a healthy work-life balance, competitive compensation and benefit packages and a\nvibrant, team-oriented environment centered on professional service and open communication. We strive to build and maintain\na high-performing culture and be an “employer of choice” by creating a work environment that attracts and retains outstanding,\nengaged employees. The success of our business is highly dependent on our employees, who provide value to our clients and\ncommunities through their dedication to helping clients achieve the American dream of home ownership and financial security.\nDemographics. As of December 31, 2023, we employed 159 full-time and 3 part-time employees in Pennsylvania and\nWest Virginia. None of these employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. During 2023, we hired 49\nemployees and our voluntary turnover rate was 19%.\nDiversity and Inclusion. We strive toward having a powerful and diverse team of employees, knowing we are better\ntogether with our combined wisdom and intellect. With a commitment to equality, inclusion, and workplace diversity, we focus\non understanding, accepting, and valuing the differences between people. We continued our commitment to equal employment\nopportunity through a robust affirmative action plan which includes annual compensation analyses and ongoing reviews of our\nselection and hiring practices alongside a continued focus on building and maintaining a diverse workforce.\nCompensation and Benefits. We provide a competitive compensation and benefits program to help meet the needs of our\nemployees. In addition to salaries, these programs include opportunity for annual bonuses, a 401(k) Plan with an employer\nmatching contribution in addition to an employer annual contribution, an equity incentive plan, healthcare and insurance\nbenefits, health savings accounts, paid time off, paid leave and an employee assistance program.\nLearning and Development. We invest in the growth and development of our employees by providing a multi-dimensional\napproach to learning that empowers, intellectually grows, and professionally develops our colleagues. Our employees receive\ncontinuing education courses that are relevant to the banking industry and their job function within the Company. In addition,\nwe have created learning paths for specific positions that are designed to encourage an employee’s advancement and growth\nwithin our organization. We support and encourage managers to hire from within. We also offer a peer mentor program,\nleadership, and customer service training. These resources provide employees with the skills they need to achieve their career\ngoals, build management skills, and become leaders within our Company.\nThe safety, health and wellness of our employees is a top priority. We promote the health and wellness of our employees\nby strongly encouraging work-life balance, offering flexible work schedules, keeping the employee portion of health care\npremiums to a minimum and sponsoring various wellness programs.\nMarket Area\nThe Company’s southwestern Pennsylvania market area consists of Allegheny, Fayette, Greene, Washington and\nWestmoreland Counties. Greene County is a significantly more rural county compared to the counties in which we have our\nother branches. Our offices located in Allegheny, Washington, Fayette, and Westmoreland Counties are in the southern\nsuburban area of metropolitan Pittsburgh. Our market area extends into West Virginia with three offices in Marshall and Ohio\nCounties.\n52\nThe following table sets forth certain economic statistics for our market area.\nAverage\nUnemployment Annual\nPopulation (1) Rate % (2) Wage (3)\nPennsylvania 12,961,683 2.9 $ 66,404\nAllegheny 1,233,253 2.8 72,540\nFayette 125,755 4.0 48,620\nGreene 34,663 3.0 64,324\nWashington 210,383 2.9 63,388\nWestmoreland 352,057 3.0 53,456\nWest Virginia 1,770,071 4.0 55,900\nMarshall 29,752 5.1 65,156\nOhio 41,447 3.9 53,508\n(1) Based on the latest data published by the U.S. Census Bureau (State - July 2023; County - July 2022)\n(2) Based on the latest data published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (December 2023)\n(3) Based on the latest data published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (Second Quarter 2023)\nThe market area has been impacted by the energy industry through the extraction of untapped natural gas reserves in the\nMarcellus Shale and Utica Shale Formation. The Utica Shale formation lies beneath most of Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania\nand New York, as well as Kentucky, Maryland, Tennessee, Virginia and a part of Canada. The Marcellus Shale Formation\nextends throughout much of the Appalachian Basin and most of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Eastern Ohio. Both\nformations are located near high-demand markets along the East Coast. The proximity to these markets makes it an attractive\ntarget for energy development and has resulted in significant job creation through the development of gas wells and\ntransportation of gas.\nCompetition\nWe encounter significant competition both in attracting deposits and in originating real estate and other loans. Our most\ndirect competition for deposits historically has come from other commercial banks, savings banks, savings associations and\ncredit unions in our market area, and we expect continued strong competition from such financial institutions in the foreseeable\nfuture. The Company faces additional competition for deposits from online financial institutions and non-depository\ncompetitors, such as the mutual fund industry, securities and brokerage firms, and insurance companies. We compete for\ndeposits by offering depositors a high level of personal service and expertise together with a wide range of financial services.\nOur deposit sources are primarily concentrated in the communities surrounding our branch offices. As of June 30, 2023, our\nFDIC-insured deposit market share in the counties we serve was 0.60% out of 48 bank and thrift institutions. Our FDIC-insured\ndeposit market share in the counties we serve, excluding Allegheny County, which is the second most populous county in\nPennsylvania, but where the Bank's has limited presence with one branch, was 5.15% out of 31 bank and thrift institutions.\nSuch data does not reflect deposits held by credit unions.\nThe competition for real estate and other loans comes principally from other commercial banks, mortgage banking\ncompanies, government-sponsored entities, savings banks and savings associations. This competition for loans has increased\nsubstantially in recent years. We compete for loans primarily through the interest rates, prepayment penalties, and loan fees we\ncharge and the efficiency and quality of services we provide to borrowers. Factors that affect competition include general and\nlocal economic conditions, current interest rate levels and the volatility of the mortgage markets.\nLending Activities\nGeneral. Our principal lending activity has been the origination in our local market area of residential one- to four-family,\ncommercial real estate, construction, commercial and industrial, and consumer loans. At December 31, 2023, our total loans\nreceivable, which excludes the allowance for credit losses, increased $60.5 million, or 5.8%, to $1.11 billion compared to $1.05\nbillion at December 31, 2022.\nResidential Real Estate Loans. Residential real estate loans are comprised of loans secured by one- to four-family\nresidential properties. Included in residential real estate loans are traditional one- to four-family mortgage loans, home equity\ninstallment loans, and home equity lines of credit. We generate loans through our marketing efforts, existing customers and\n53\nreferrals, real estate brokers, builders and local businesses. At December 31, 2023, $347.8 million, or 31.3%, of our total loan\nportfolio was invested in residential loans.\nOne- to Four-Family Mortgage Loans. One of our primary lending activities is the origination of fixed-rate, one- to four-\nfamily, owner-occupied, residential mortgage loans with terms up to 30 years secured by property located in our market area.\nAt December 31, 2023, one- to four-family mortgage loans totaled $278.2 million. Our one- to four-family residential mortgage\nloans are generally conforming loans, underwritten according to secondary market guidelines. We generally originate mortgage\nloans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which, for\n2023, is typically $726,200 for single-family homes, except in certain high-cost areas in the United States. Our mortgage loans\namortize monthly with principal and interest due each month. These loans often remain outstanding for significantly shorter\nperiods than their contractual terms because borrowers may refinance or prepay loans at their option without a prepayment\npenalty.\nWhen underwriting one- to four-family mortgage loans, we review and verify each loan applicant’s income and credit\nhistory. Management believes that stability of income and past credit history are integral parts in the underwriting process.\nWritten appraisals are generally required on real estate property offered to secure an applicant’s loan. We generally limit the\nloan-to-value ratios of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans to 80% of the purchase price or appraised value of the\nproperty, whichever is less. For one- to four-family real estate loans with loan-to-value ratios of over 80%, we generally require\nprivate mortgage insurance. We require fire and casualty insurance on all properties securing real estate loans. We require title\ninsurance, or an attorney’s title opinion, as circumstances warrant.\nOur one- to four-family mortgage loans customarily include due-on-sale clauses, which give us the right to declare a loan\nimmediately due and payable in the event, among other things, that the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the underlying\nreal property serving as collateral for the loan.\nFixed-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with terms of 15 years or more are originated for resale to the\nsecondary market. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we originated $2.4 million of fixed-rate residential mortgage\nloans, respectively, which were subsequently sold in the secondary mortgage market.\nThe origination of fixed-rate mortgage loans versus adjustable-rate mortgage loans is monitored on an ongoing basis and is\naffected significantly by the level of market interest rates, customer preference, our interest rate risk position and our\ncompetitors’ loan products. Adjustable-rate mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate totaled $56.1\nmillion at December 31, 2023. Adjustable-rate mortgage loans make our loan portfolio more interest rate sensitive. However, as\nthe interest income earned on adjustable-rate mortgage loans varies with prevailing interest rates, such loans do not offer\npredictable cash flows in the same manner as long-term, fixed-rate loans. Adjustable-rate mortgage loans carry increased credit\nrisk associated with potentially higher monthly payments by borrowers as general market interest rates increase. It is possible\nthat during periods of rising interest rates that the risk of delinquencies and defaults on adjustable-rate mortgage loans may\nincrease due to the upward adjustment of interest costs to the borrower, resulting in increased loan losses.\nWe do not offer an “interest only” mortgage loan product on one- to four-family residential properties (where the borrower\npays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). We also do not offer loans that\nprovide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest\nowed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not offer a “subprime loan”\nprogram (loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies,\nprevious charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit\nscores or high debt-burden ratios) or Alt-A loans (traditionally defined as loans having less than full documentation). We may\noriginate loans to consumers with a credit score below 660. This may be defined as subprime loans, however there are typically\nmitigating circumstances that according to FDIC guidance and our opinion would not designate such loans as “subprime.”\nHome Equity Loans. At December 31, 2023, home equity loans totaled $57.5 million. Our home equity loans and lines of\ncredit are generally secured by the borrower’s principal residence. The maximum amount of a home equity loan or line of credit\nis generally 85% of the appraised value of a borrower’s real estate collateral less the amount of any prior mortgages or related\nliabilities. Home equity loans and lines of credit are approved with both fixed and adjustable interest rates, which we determine\nbased upon market conditions. Such loans are fully amortized over the life of the loan. Generally, the maximum term for home\nequity loans is 20 years.\nOur underwriting standards for home equity loans include a determination of the applicant’s credit history and an\nassessment of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the\napplicant’s monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment, and\nadditionally from any verifiable secondary income. We also consider the length of employment with the borrower’s present\nemployer. Creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration; however, the underwriting process also includes a\ncomparison of the value of the collateral in relation to the proposed loan amount.\n54\nWe primarily originate home equity loans secured by first lien mortgages. Home equity loans in a junior lien position\ntotaled $4.8 million at December 31, 2023 and entail greater risks than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans or home\nequity loans secured by first lien mortgages. In such cases, collateral repossessed after a default may not provide an adequate\nsource of repayment of the outstanding loan balance because of damage or depreciation in the value of the property or loss of\nequity to the first lien position. Further, home equity loan payments are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial\nstability, and therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Finally, the\napplication of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount\nthat can be recovered on such loans in the event of a default.\nCommercial Real Estate Loans. We originate commercial real estate loans that are secured primarily by improved\nproperties, such as retail facilities, office buildings and other non-residential buildings as well as multifamily properties. At\nDecember 31, 2023, $467.2 million, or 42.1% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of commercial real estate loans.\nOur commercial real estate loans generally have adjustable interest rates with terms of up to 15 years and amortization\nperiods up to 25 years. The adjustable rate loans are typically fixed for the first five years and adjust every five years thereafter.\nThe maximum loan-to-value ratio of our commercial real estate loans is generally 75% to 80% of the lower of cost or appraised\nvalue of the property securing the loan.\nWe consider a number of factors in originating commercial real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial\ncondition of the borrower, including project-level and global cash flows and debt service coverage, credit history and\nmanagement expertise, as well as the value and condition of the property, securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications\nof the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar\nproperty and the borrower’s payment history with the Bank and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing\nthe loan, the factors considered include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and\ndepreciation, and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the property. We generally will not lend to high\nvolatility commercial real estate projects. All commercial real estate loans are appraised by outside independent state certified\ngeneral appraisers. Personal guarantees are generally obtained from the principals of commercial real estate loan borrowers,\nalthough this requirement may be waived in limited circumstances depending upon the loan-to-value ratio and the debt-service\nratio associated with the loan. The Bank requires property and casualty insurance and flood insurance if the property is in a\nflood zone area.\nWe underwrite commercial real estate loan participations to the same standards as loans originated by us. In addition, we\nconsider the financial strength and reputation of the lead lender. We require the lead lender to provide a full closing package as\nwell as annual financial statements for the borrower and related entities so that we can conduct an annual loan review for all\nloan participations. Loans secured by commercial real estate generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than residential\nmortgage loans and carry larger loan balances. This increased credit risk is a result of several factors, including the effects of\ngeneral economic conditions on income producing properties and the successful operation or management of the properties\nsecuring the loans. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is typically dependent upon the\nsuccessful operation of the related business and real estate property. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower’s\nability to repay the loan may be impaired.\nCommercial real estate loans generally have higher credit risks compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans,\nas they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition,\npayment experience on loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the\nrelated real estate project, and this may be subject, to a greater extent, to adverse conditions in the real estate market and in the\ngeneral economy.\nConstruction Loans. We originate construction loans to individuals to finance the construction of residential dwellings and\nalso originate loans for the construction of commercial properties, including hotels, apartment buildings, housing developments,\nand owner-occupied properties used for businesses. At December 31, 2023, $43.1 million, or 3.9% of our total loan portfolio,\nconsisted of construction loans. Our construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the\nconstruction phase, which is usually 12 to 18 months. At the end of the construction phase, the loan generally converts to a\npermanent residential or commercial mortgage loan. Loans generally can be made with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80%\non both residential and commercial construction. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require a pro\nforma appraisal of the property, as completed by an independent licensed appraiser. We also will require an inspection of the\nproperty before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. We typically do not lend to developers unless\nthey maintain a 15% cash equity position in the project.\nCommercial and Industrial Loans. We originate commercial and industrial loans and lines of credit to borrowers located\nin our market area that are generally secured by collateral other than real estate, such as equipment, accounts receivable,\ninventory, and other business assets. At December 31, 2023, $111.3 million, or 10.0% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of\ncommercial and industrial loans.\n55\nCommercial and industrial loans generally have terms of maturity from five to seven years with adjustable interest rates\ntied to the prime rate, SOFR or the weekly average of the FHLB of Pittsburgh three- to ten-year fixed rates. We generally\nobtain personal guarantees from the borrower or a third party as a condition to originating the loan. On a limited basis, we will\noriginate unsecured business loans in those instances where the applicant’s financial strength and creditworthiness has been\nestablished. Commercial business loans generally bear higher interest rates than residential loans, but they also may involve a\nhigher risk of default because their repayment is generally dependent on the successful operation of the borrower’s business.\nOur underwriting standards for commercial business loans include a determination of the applicant’s ability to meet\nexisting obligations and payments on the proposed loan from normal cash flows generated in the applicant’s business. We\nassess the financial strength of each applicant through the review of financial statements and tax returns provided by the\napplicant. The creditworthiness of an applicant is derived from a review of credit reports as well as a search of public records.\nWe periodically review business loans following origination. We request financial statements at least annually and review them\nfor substantial deviations or changes that might affect repayment of the loan. Our loan officers may also visit the premises of\nborrowers to observe the business premises, facilities, and personnel and to inspect the pledged collateral. Lines of credit\nsecured with accounts receivable and inventory typically require that the customer provide a monthly borrowing base certificate\nthat is reviewed prior to each draw request. Underwriting standards for business loans are different for each type of loan\ndepending on the financial strength of the applicant and the value of collateral offered as security. All commercial loans are\nassigned a risk rating, which is reviewed internally, as well as by independent loan review professionals, annually.\nCommercial and industrial business loans involve a greater risk of default than one- to four-residential mortgage loans of\nlike duration because their repayment generally depends on the successful operation of the borrower’s business and the\nsufficiency of collateral, if any.\nConsumer Loans. We originate consumer loans that primarily consist of indirect auto loans and, to a lesser extent, secured\nand unsecured loans and lines of credit. As of December 31, 2023, consumer loans totaled $111.6 million, or 10.1%, of our total\nloan portfolio, of which $103.9 million were indirect auto loans. Consumer loans are generally offered on a fixed-rate basis.\nOur underwriting standards for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant’s credit history and an assessment of\nthe applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the applicant’s monthly\nincome may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment, and additionally from any\nverifiable secondary income. We also consider the length of employment with the borrower’s present employer as well as the\namount of time the borrower has lived in the local area. Creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration; however,\nthe underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral in relation to the proposed loan amount.\nIndirect auto loans are loans that are sold by auto dealerships to third parties, such as banks or other types of lenders. We\nwork with various auto dealers throughout our lending area. The dealer collects information from the applicant and transmits it\nto us electronically for review, where we can either accept or reject the applicant without ever meeting the applicant. If the\nBank approves the applicant’s request for financing, the Bank purchases the dealership-originated installment sales contract and\nis known as the holder in due course that is entitled to receive principal and interest payments from a borrower. As\ncompensation for generating the loan, a portion of the rate is advanced to the dealer and accrued in a prepaid dealer reserve\naccount. As a result, the Bank’s yield is below the contractual interest rate because the Bank must wait for the stream of loan\npayments to be repaid. The Bank will receive a pro rata refund of the amount prepaid to the dealer only if the loan prepays\nwithin the first six months or if the collateral for the loan is repossessed. The Bank is responsible for pursuing repossession if\nthe borrower defaults on payments. The Bank discontinued this product offering as of June 30, 2023.\nConsumer loans entail greater risks than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, particularly consumer loans\nsecured by rapidly depreciating assets, such as automobiles, or loans that are unsecured. In such cases, collateral repossessed\nafter a default may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance because of damage, loss or\ndepreciation. Further, consumer loan payments are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are\nmore likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Such events would increase our risk of\nloss on unsecured loans. Finally, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and\ninsolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans in the event of a default.\nLoan Approval Procedures and Authority\nOur lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures\nestablished by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). In the approval process for residential loans, we assess the borrower’s\nability to repay the loan and the value of the property securing the loan. To assess the borrower’s ability to repay, we review the\nborrower’s income and expenses and employment and credit history. In the case of commercial loans, we also review projected\nincome, expenses and the viability of the project being financed. We generally require appraisals of all real property securing\nloans. Appraisals are performed by independent licensed appraisers. The Bank’s loan approval policies and limits are also\nestablished by its Board. All loans originated by the Bank are subject to its underwriting guidelines. Loan approval authorities\nvary based on loan size in the aggregate. Individual officer loan approval authority generally applies to loans of up to $1.0\n56\nmillion. Loans above that amount and up to 65% of the Bank’s legal lending limit may be approved by the Loan Committee.\nLoans in the aggregate over 65% of the Bank’s legal lending limit must be approved by the Board.\nDelinquencies and Classified Assets\nWhen a borrower fails to remit a required loan payment, a courtesy notice is sent to the borrower prior to the end of their\nappropriate grace period stressing the importance of paying the loan current. If a payment is not paid within the appropriate\ngrace period, then a late notice is mailed. In addition, telephone calls are made and additional letters may be sent. Collection\nefforts continue until it is determined that the debt is uncollectible.\nFor loans secured by real estate, a Homeownership Counseling Notice is mailed when the loan is 45 days delinquent. In\nPennsylvania, an Act 91 Notice is mailed to the borrower stating that they have 33 days to cure the default before foreclosure is\ninitiated. In West Virginia, a Notice of Default is mailed and in Ohio, a demand letter is mailed when a loan is 60 days\ndelinquent. When a loan becomes 90 or more days delinquent, it is forwarded to the Bank’s attorney to pursue other remedies.\nAn official mortgage foreclosure complaint typically occurs at 120 days delinquent. In the event collection efforts have not\nsucceeded, the property will proceed to a Sheriff Sale to be sold.\nFor commercial loans, the borrower is contacted in an attempt to reestablish the loan to current payment status and ensure\ntimely payments continue. Collection efforts continue until the loan is 60 days past due, at which time demand payment,\ndefault, and/or foreclosure procedures are initiated. We may consider loan workout arrangements with certain borrowers under\ncertain circumstances.\nInvestment Activities\nGeneral. The Company’s investment policy is established by its Board. The policy emphasizes safety of the investment,\nliquidity requirements, potential returns, cash flow targets, and consistency with the Company’s interest rate risk management\nstrategy.\nOur current investment policy permits us to invest in U.S. treasuries, U.S government agency securities, mortgage-backed\nsecurities (MBS's), collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO's), investment grade corporate bonds, obligations of states and\npolitical subdivisions, short-term instruments, collateralized loan obligations (CLO's) and other securities. The investment\npolicy also permits investments in certificates of deposit, securities purchased under an agreement to resell, banker’s\nacceptances, commercial paper and federal funds. Our current investment policy generally does not permit investment in\nstripped mortgage-backed securities, short sales, derivatives, or other high-risk securities. Federal and Pennsylvania state laws\ngenerally limit our investment activities to those permissible for a national bank.\nThe accounting rules require that, at the time of purchase, we designate a debt security as held to maturity, available-for-\nsale, or trading, depending on our ability and intent. Securities available for sale are reported at fair value, while securities held\nto maturity are reported at amortized cost. Our entire debt securities portfolio is designated as available-for-sale.\nThe debt securities portfolio consists primarily of U.S. government agency securities, obligations of states and political\nsubdivisions, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations of government sponsored enterprises,\ncollateralized loan obligations and corporate bonds. We expect the composition of our debt securities portfolio to continue to\nchange based on liquidity needs associated with loan origination activities. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we had\nno debt securities that were deemed to be impaired.\nWe also invest in equity securities, which consist primarily of mutual funds and a portfolio of bank stocks. This portfolio is\nvalued at fair value with changes in market price recognized through noninterest income.\nWe maintain a minimum amount of liquid assets that may be invested in specified short-term securities and certain other\ninvestments. Liquidity levels may be increased or decreased depending upon the yields on investment alternatives and upon\nmanagement’s judgment as to the attractiveness of the yields then available in relation to other opportunities and its expectation\nof the level of yield that will be available in the future, as well as management’s projections as to the short-term demand for\nfunds to be used in our loan originations and other activities.\nU.S. Government Agency Securities. At December 31, 2023, we held U.S. Government and agency securities with a fair\nvalue of $3.9 million compared to $44.6 million at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2023, these securities had an average\nexpected life of 8.0 years. While these securities generally provide lower yields than other investments, such as mortgage-\nbacked securities, our current investment strategy is to maintain investments in such instruments to the extent appropriate for\nliquidity and pledging purposes, as collateral for borrowings, and for prepayment protection.\nObligations of States and Political Subdivisions. At December 31, 2023, we held available-for-sale municipal bonds with\na fair value of $3.4 million compared to $13.3 million at December 31, 2022. 100% of our municipal bonds are issued by local\nmunicipalities or school districts located in Pennsylvania. Municipal bonds may be general obligation of the issuer or secured\nby specific revenues. The majority of our municipal bonds are general obligation bonds, which are backed by the full faith and\ncredit of the municipality, paid off with funds from taxes and other fees, and have ratings (when available) of A or above. We\n57\nalso invest in a limited amount of special revenue municipal bonds, which are used to fund projects that will eventually create\nrevenue directly, such as a toll road or lease payments for a new building.\nMortgage-Backed Securities. We invest in mortgage-backed (“MBS”) and collateralized mortgage obligation (“CMO”)\nsecurities insured or guaranteed by the United States government or government-sponsored enterprises. These securities, which\nconsist of MBS’s issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, had an amortized cost of $178.0 million and $143.3\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and a fair value of $159.7 million and $121.1 million at December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2023, all MBS’s had fixed rates of interest.\nMBS’s are created by pooling mortgages and issuing a security with an interest rate that is less than the interest rate on the\nunderlying mortgages. CMO’s generally are a specific class of MBS’s that are divided based on risk assessments and maturity\ndates. These mortgage classes are pooled into a special purpose entity, where tranches are created and sold to investors.\nInvestors in a CMO are purchasing bonds issued by the entity, and then receive payments based on the income derived from the\npooled mortgages. The various pools are divided into tranches are then securitized and sold to the investor. MBS’s typically\nrepresent a participation interest in a pool of one- to four-family or multifamily mortgages, although we invest primarily in\nMBS’s backed by one- to four-family mortgages. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the\nform of securities to investors. Some security pools are guaranteed as to payment of principal and interest to investors. MBS’s\ngenerally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees and credit\nenhancements. However, MBS’s are more liquid than individual mortgage loans because there is an active trading market for\nsuch securities. In addition, MBS’s may be used to collateralize our specific liabilities and obligations. Finally, MBS’s are\nassigned lower risk-weightings for purposes of calculating our risk-based capital level.\nInvestments in MBS’s involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the\ntime of purchase, which may result in adjustments to the amortization of any premium or acceleration of any discount relating\nto such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities.\nCollateralized Loan Obligation Securities. We invest in collateralized loan obligation (“CLO”) securities issued by\nspecialized financial institutions or investment banks. These floating-rate securities are backed by pools of high-quality\ncommercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans, typically first-lien bank loans to corporations. Our CLO portfolio\nhad an amortized cost of $29.9 million and a fair value of $29.8 million at December 31, 2023. The Bank held no CLO's as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\nCorporate Debt. At December 31, 2023, we held corporate debt securities with a fair value of $7.7 million. We invest in\ncorporate debt issued by financial institutions which have fixed to floating-rate terms. Corporate debt are unsecured, medium\nor long term, interest-bearing bonds issued by financial institutions that are backed only by the general credit of the issuer. As\nsuch, investments in corporate debt involve default risk that the company may fail to make timely payments of interest or\nprincipal. We perform a credit analysis to verify the creditworthiness of the financial institution prior to purchase.\nSources of Funds\nGeneral. Deposits have traditionally been the Company’s primary source of funds for use in lending and investment\nactivities. The Company also uses borrowings, primarily FHLB of Pittsburgh advances, to supplement cash flow needs,\nlengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk purposes and manage the cost of funds. In addition, funds are derived\nfrom scheduled loan payments, investment maturities, loan prepayments, loan sales, retained earnings and income on earning\nassets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and\noutflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition.\nDeposits. Deposits are generated primarily from residents within the Company’s market area. The Company offers a\nvariety of deposit accounts. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the\namount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate.\nInterest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates\nand terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors\nand growth goals.\nThe flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and other\nprevailing interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts offered allows the Company to be competitive in\nobtaining funds and responding to changes in consumer demand. Based on experience, the Company believes that its deposits\nare relatively stable. However, the ability to attract and maintain deposits and the rates paid on these deposits has been and will\ncontinue to be significantly affected by market conditions.\n58\nBorrowings. Deposits are our primary source of funds for lending and investment activities. If the need arises, we may rely\nupon borrowings to supplement our supply of available funds and to fund deposit withdrawals. Our borrowings may consist of\nadvances from the FHLB, subordinated debt, funds borrowed under repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased.\nThe FHLB functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for us and other member savings associations and financial\ninstitutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB and are authorized to apply for advances on the\nsecurity of such stock and certain of our home mortgages, provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met.\nWe typically secure advances from the FHLB with one- to four-family residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans.\nAdvances are made pursuant to several different programs. Each credit program has its own interest rate and range of\nmaturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of a\nmember institution’s stockholders’ equity or on the FHLB’s assessment of the institution’s creditworthiness. At December 31,\n2023, we had a maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB of up to $478.9 million and available borrowing capacity of\n$438.3 million. At December 31, 2023, we had $20.0 million FHLB advances outstanding. As an alternative to pledging\nsecurities, the facility is also used for standby letters of credit to collateralize public deposits in excess of the level insured by\nthe FDIC. Commitments for standby letters of credit to secure public deposits were $18.9 million and $26.2 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase represent business deposit customers whose funds, above designated target\nbalances, are transferred into an overnight interest-earning investment account by purchasing securities from the Bank’s\ninvestment portfolio under an agreement to repurchase. We may be required to provide additional collateral based on the fair\nvalue of the underlying securities. Short-term borrowings may also consist of federal funds purchased.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Bank maintained a Borrower-In-Custody of Collateral line of credit agreement with the FRB\nfor $103.8 million that requires monthly certification of collateral, is subject to annual renewal, incurs no service charge and is\nsecured by commercial and consumer indirect auto loans. The Bank also maintains multiple line of credit arrangements with\nvarious unaffiliated banks totaling $50.0 million. At December 31, 2023, we did not have any outstanding balances under any\nof these borrowing relationships.\nIn December 2021, the Company entered into a term loan in the principal amount of $15.0 million, evidenced by a term\nnote which matures on December 15, 2031 (\"2031 Note\"). The 2031 Note is an unsecured subordinated obligation of the\nCompany and may be repaid in whole or in part, without penalty, on any interest payment date on or after December 15, 2026\nand at any time upon the occurrence of certain events. The 2031 Note initially bears a fixed interest rate of 3.875% per year to,\nbut excluding, December 15, 2026 and thereafter at a floating rate equal to the then-current three-month term SOFR plus 280\nbasis points. The 2031 Note qualifies as Tier 2 capital under regulatory guidelines. At December 31, 2023, the principal balance\nand unamortized debt issuance costs for the 2031 Note were $15.0 million and $322,000, respectively.\nSubsidiary Activities\nCommunity Bank is the only subsidiary of the Company. The Bank wholly-owns Exchange Underwriters, Inc., a former\nfull-service, independent insurance agency.\nREGULATION AND SUPERVISION\nGeneral\nCB Financial Services, Inc. is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as\namended. As such, it is registered with, subject to examination and supervision by, and otherwise required to comply with the\nrules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board.\nCommunity Bank is a Pennsylvania-chartered commercial bank subject to extensive regulation by the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Banking and Securities and the FDIC. The Bank’s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the\nFDIC. The Bank must file reports with the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the FDIC concerning its\nactivities and financial condition, in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, such\nas mergers or acquisitions with other depository institutions. There are periodic examinations of the Bank by the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Banking and Securities and the FDIC to review the Bank’s compliance with various regulatory requirements.\nThe Bank is also subject to certain reserve requirements established by the Federal Reserve Board. This regulation and\nsupervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a commercial bank can engage and is intended\nprimarily for the protection of the FDIC and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive\ndiscretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with\nrespect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change\nin such regulation, whether by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or\nCongress could have a material impact on the operations of the Bank.\n59\nSet forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to CB Financial\nServices, Inc., and Community Bank. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations\naddressed, is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on CB Financial\nServices, Inc. and Community Bank, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations involved.\nFederal Legislation\nThe Dodd-Frank Act made significant changes to the regulatory structure for depository institutions and their holding\ncompanies. However, the Dodd-Frank Act’s changes go well beyond that and affect the lending, investments and other\noperations of all depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve to set minimum capital levels for\nbank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries, and the components of\nTier 1 capital for holding companies are restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for\ninsured depository institutions. The legislation also establishes a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot\nbe lower than the standards in effect upon passage, and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and\ncapital requirements that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized\nproducts and derivatives.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce\nconsumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of\nconsumer protection laws that apply to all banks, such as the Bank, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or\nabusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all\nbanks with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks with $10 billion or less in assets are still examined for compliance by their\napplicable bank regulators. The new legislation also gave state attorney generals the ability to enforce applicable federal\nconsumer protection laws.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average\nconsolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The legislation also increased the maximum\namount of deposit insurance for banks to $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act increased shareholder influence over\nboards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so called\n“golden parachute” payments. The legislation also directs the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive\ncompensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not. Further,\nthe legislation requires that originators of securitized loans retain a percentage of the risk for transferred loans, directs the\nFederal Reserve to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees and contains a number of reforms related to mortgage\norigination.\nThe Dodd Frank Act has resulted in an increased regulatory burden and compliance, operating and interest expense for the\nCompany and the Bank.\nBank Regulation\nBusiness Activities. The Bank derives its lending and investment powers from the applicable Pennsylvania law, federal law\nand applicable state and federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, The Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured\nby residential and commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain\nother assets, subject to applicable limits.\nCapital Requirements. Federal regulations require state banks to meet three minimum capital standards: a 1.5% tangible\ncapital ratio, a 4% core capital to assets leverage ratio (3% for savings associations receiving the highest rating on the\ncomposite, or “CAMELS,” rating system for capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to\nmarket risk), and an 8% risk-based capital ratio.\nThe risk-based capital standard for state banks requires the maintenance of Tier 1 (core) and total capital (which is defined\nas core capital and supplementary capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 4% and 8%, respectively. In determining the\namount of risk weighted assets, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor of\n0% to 1250%, assigned by the regulations, based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Core capital is defined as\ncommon stockholders’ equity (including retained earnings), certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus\nand minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less intangibles other than certain mortgage servicing\nrights and credit card relationships. The components of supplementary capital include cumulative preferred stock, long-term\nperpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock, the allowance\nfor loan losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-\nsale securities with readily determinable fair market values. Overall, the amount of supplementary capital included as part of\ntotal capital cannot exceed 100% of core capital. Additionally, an institution that retains credit risk in connection with an asset\nsale is required to maintain additional regulatory capital because of the purchaser’s recourse against the institution. In assessing\n60\nan institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as\nwell and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual associations where necessary.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements.\nThe risk-based capital rule and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets by the FDIC and the other federal bank\nregulators are consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain\nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The rule applies to all depository institutions (such as the Bank) and top-tier bank holding\ncompanies with total consolidated assets of $3.0 billion or more. Among other things, the rule established a common equity\nTier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), increases the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets\nrequirement (from 4.0% to 6.0% of risk-weighted assets) and assigns a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more\nthan 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition,\ndevelopment or construction of real property. The rule also requires unrealized gains and losses on certain available-for-sale\nsecurities to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-in or opt-out is\nexercised. The Bank elected the one-time opt-out election for accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCL”) to be excluded\nfrom the regulatory capital calculation. The rule limits a banking organization’s capital distributions and certain discretionary\nbonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5% of common equity\nTier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.\nThe capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in at 0.625% per year beginning January 1, 2016 and ended January 1,\n2019, when the full 2.5% capital conservation buffer requirement became effective.\nLoans-to-One Borrower. Generally, a Pennsylvania-chartered commercial bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a\nsingle or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of capital. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10% of\nunimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real\nestate. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations.\nCapital Distributions. The Pennsylvania Banking Code states, in part, that dividends may be declared and paid only out of\naccumulated net earnings and may not be declared or paid unless surplus is at least equal to capital. Dividends may not reduce\nsurplus without the prior consent of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. In addition, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Act provides that an insured depository institution may not make any capital distribution if, after making such\ndistribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All insured institutions have a responsibility under the Community\nReinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-\nincome borrowers. The FDIC is required to assess the Bank’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act.\nFailure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain\ncorporate applications, such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity\nAct and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics\nspecified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result\nin enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose their rating. The Bank\nreceived a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent federal examination.\nTransactions with Related Parties. A state-chartered bank’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited\nby Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls or\nis under common control with an insured depository institution, such as the Bank. The Company is an affiliate of the Bank\nbecause of its control of the Bank. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject\nto certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a state-chartered bank from\nlending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from\npurchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with\nsafe and sound banking practices, not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the\ninstitution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates.\nThe Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities\ncontrolled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act\nand Regulation O of the Federal Reserve. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to\ninsiders be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less\nstringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the\nnormal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit\nextended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank’s capital.\nIn addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the Bank’s Board. Extensions of credit to\nexecutive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved.\n61\nStandards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for\nall insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and\naudit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, and other\noperational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and\nsoundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions\nbefore capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any\nstandard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to\nachieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may\nrequire the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further\nenforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties.\nPrompt Corrective Action Regulations. Under the Federal Prompt Corrective Action statute, the FDIC is required to take\nsupervisory actions against undercapitalized state-chartered banks under its jurisdiction, the severity of which depends upon the\ninstitution’s level of capital. An institution that has total risk-based capital of less than 8% or a leverage ratio or a Tier 1 risk-\nbased capital ratio that generally is less than 4% is considered to be “undercapitalized”. An institution that has total risk-based\ncapital less than 6%, a Tier 1 core risk-based capital ratio of less than 3% or a leverage ratio that is less than 3% is considered to\nbe “significantly undercapitalized.” An institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2% is deemed to\nbe “critically undercapitalized.”\nGenerally, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the “Pennsylvania Department of Banking” or\n“PDBS”) is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a state-chartered bank that is “critically undercapitalized” within\nspecific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of\nthe date that an institution is deemed to have received notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or\n“critically undercapitalized.” Any bank holding company of an institution that is required to submit a capital restoration plan\nmust guarantee performance under the plan in an amount of up to the lesser of 5% of the institution’s assets at the time it was\ndeemed to be undercapitalized by the FDIC or the amount necessary to restore the institution to adequately capitalized status.\nThis guarantee remains in place until the FDIC notifies the institution that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for\neach of four consecutive calendar quarters. Institutions that are undercapitalized become subject to certain mandatory measures,\nsuch as restrictions on capital distributions and asset growth. The PDBS may also take any one of a number of discretionary\nsupervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of\nsenior executive officers and directors.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Bank met the criteria for being considered “well capitalized.”\nIn addition, the final capital rule adopted in July 2013 revises the prompt corrective action categories to incorporate the\nrevised minimum capital requirements of that rule.\nEnforcement. The Pennsylvania Department of Banking maintains enforcement authority over the Bank, including the\npower to issue cease and desist orders and civil money penalties and to remove directors, officers or employees. It also has the\npower to appoint a conservator or receiver for a bank upon insolvency, imminent insolvency, unsafe or unsound condition or\ncertain other situations. The FDIC has primary federal enforcement responsibility over non-Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”)-\nmember state banks and has authority to bring actions against the institution and all institution-affiliated parties, including\nstockholders, and any attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful actions likely\nto have an adverse effect on the bank. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease\nand desist order to removal of officers and/or directors. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and can amount to\n$25,000 per day, or even $1 million per day in especially egregious cases. In general, regulatory enforcement actions occur with\nrespect to situations involving unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, violations of law or regulation or breaches of fiduciary\nduty. Federal and Pennsylvania laws also establish criminal penalties for certain violations.\nInsurance of Deposit Accounts. The Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured\nfinancial institutions, such as the Bank. Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of\n$250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts. The FDIC\ncharges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the DIF.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target DIF ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The\nDodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC to establish a\nmaximum fund ratio. The FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long-range fund ratio of 2%. The FDIC adopted\na plan to restore the fund to the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2028.\nThe FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the\noperating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the\nfuture.\n62\nInsurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound\npractices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order\nor condition imposed by the FDIC. The Bank does not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to\ntermination of its deposit insurance.\nProhibitions Against Tying Arrangements. State-chartered banks are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from\nextending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service,\non the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a\ncompetitor of the institution.\nFHLB System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of 11 regional FHLBs. The FHLB System\nprovides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending.\nAs a member of the FHLB of Pittsburgh, The Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Bank was in compliance with this requirement. The Bank also is able to borrow from the FHLB of\nPittsburgh, which provides an additional source of liquidity for the Bank.\nFederal Reserve System. The FRB regulations historically required banks to maintain reserves against their transaction\naccounts (primarily Negotiable Order of Withdrawal, or NOW and regular checking accounts). The regulations generally\nprovide that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows for 2024: a 3% reserve ratio is assessed\non net transaction accounts up to and including $644.0 million; a 10% reserve ratio is applied above $644.0 million. The first\n$36.1 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the\nreserve requirements. The Bank complies with the foregoing requirements. However, effective March 26, 2020, the FRB\nreduced reserve requirement ratios on all net transaction accounts to 0%, eliminating reserve requirements for all depository\ninstitutions, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOther Regulations\nInterest and other charges collected or contracted by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning\ninterest rates. The Bank’s operations are also subject to federal and state laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:\n• Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;\n• Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public\nofficials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the\ncommunity it serves;\n• Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in\nextending credit;\n• Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;\n• Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;\n• Truth in Savings Act; and\n• Rules and regulations of the various federal and state agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such\nlaws.\nThe operations of the Bank also are subject to the:\n• Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and\nprescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;\n• Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and\nwithdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller\nmachines and other electronic banking services;\n• Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital\ncheck images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check;\n• The USA PATRIOT Act, which requires banks operating to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money\nlaundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money\nlaundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements, also\napplicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations;\nand\n• The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial\ninstitutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions\noffering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s\n63\nprivacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of certain personal financial\ninformation with unaffiliated third parties.\nHolding Company Regulation\nGeneral. The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as\namended. As such, the Company is registered with the Federal Reserve and is subject to regulations, examinations, supervision\nand reporting requirements applicable to bank holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve has enforcement authority\nover the Company and its non-bank subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve to restrict or\nprohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary banking institution.\nCapital. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve to establish for all depository institution holding companies\nminimum consolidated capital requirements that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries.\nSource of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act requires that all bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to their\nsubsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.\nDividends. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of\nshares of common stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of\ncurrent earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the\norganization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory\nconsultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances, such as where the company’s net income for the past\nfour quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s\noverall rate or earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of\na holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary depository institution becomes undercapitalized. The\npolicy statement also states that a holding company should inform the Federal Reserve supervisory staff before redeeming or\nrepurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the\nrepurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments\noutstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory\npolicies may affect the Company’s ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital\ndistributions.\nAcquisition. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, a federal statute, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve if\nany person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a bank holding\ncompany. Under certain circumstances, a change of control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10%\nor more of the company’s outstanding voting stock, unless the Federal Reserve has found that the acquisition will not result in\ncontrol of the company. A change in control definitively occurs upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the company’s\noutstanding voting stock.\nUnder the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve generally has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to\nact, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the\ncompetitive effects of the acquisition.\nFederal Securities Laws. The Company’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As a result, the Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation,\ninsider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide\nfor enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by\nimproving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the federal securities laws. The Company has\npolicies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and the Company reviews and documents these\npolicies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations.\nTAXATION\nGeneral. The Company and the Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other\ncorporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to\nsummarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the\nCompany and the Bank.\nMethod of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently reports its income and expenses on the\naccrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal and state income tax returns.\nFederal Taxation. The federal income tax laws apply to the Company in the same manner as to other corporations with\nsome exceptions. The Company may exclude from income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as members of the same\naffiliated group of corporations. For federal income tax purposes, corporations may carryforward net operating losses\n64\nindefinitely, but the deduction is limited to 80% of taxable income. For its 2023 and 2022 fiscal year, the Company’s maximum\nfederal income tax rate was 21%.\nState Taxation. The Bank is subject to the Pennsylvania Bank and Trust Company Shares Tax (“Shares Tax”) rate of\n0.95%. The tax is imposed on the Bank’s adjusted equity. The Company and Exchange Underwriters are subject to the\nPennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax, otherwise known as “CNI tax.” The CNI tax rate in 2023 was 8.99% and in 2022 was\n9.99%. The tax is imposed on income or loss from the federal income tax return on a separate-company basis for the Company\nand Exchange Underwriters. The federal return income or loss is adjusted for various items treated differently by the\nPennsylvania Department of Revenue.\nThe Company is subject to additional state tax filing requirements in West Virginia and Ohio. The West Virginia\nCorporation Net Income Tax imposes a state income tax at the rate 6.5% based on the Company's consolidated taxable federal\nnet income or loss on the Company's federal tax return, adjusted for various items treated differently by the West Virginia State\nTax Department. The State of Ohio imposes an equity-based tax similar to the PA Shares Tax called Financial Institutions Tax\n(“FIT”) at a minimum tax of $1,000 or a rate of 0.8% for the first $200 million of Ohio based-equity, and then a declining rate\nthereafter. All state taxation is apportioned to states where nexus exists based on different metrics of the Company's\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Consolidated Statements of Income.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to risks disclosed elsewhere in this Report, the following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that\ncould affect the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Readers should not consider any\ndescriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Company. Any risk factor discussed\nbelow could by itself, or combined with other factors, materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, results of\noperations, financial condition, capital position, liquidity, competitive position or reputation, including by materially increasing\nexpenses or decreasing revenues, which could result in material losses or a decrease in earnings.\nRisks Related to Our Lending Activities\nA large percentage of the Company’s loans are collateralized by real estate, and further disruptions in the real estate\nmarket may result in losses and reduce the Company’s earnings.\nA substantial portion of the Company’s loan portfolio consists of loans collateralized by real estate. Improving economic\nconditions have shifted to an increase in demand for real estate, which has resulted in stabilization of some real estate values in\nthe Company’s markets. Further disruptions in the real estate market could significantly impair the value of the Company’s\ncollateral and its ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source\nof repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. If real\nestate values decline further, it is likely that the Company would be required to increase its allowance for loan losses. If, during\na period of lower real estate values, the Company is required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy debts or to\nincrease its allowance for loan losses, it could materially reduce its profitability and adversely affect its financial condition.\nBecause the Company emphasizes commercial real estate and commercial loan originations, its credit risk may increase,\nand continued downturns in the local real estate market or economy could adversely affect its earnings.\nCommercial real estate and commercial loans generally have more inherent risk than the residential real estate loans.\nBecause the repayment of commercial real estate and commercial loans depends on the successful management and operation\nof the borrower’s properties or related businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the local\nreal estate market or economy. Commercial real estate and commercial loans also may involve relatively large loan balances to\nindividual borrowers or groups of related borrowers. A downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could adversely\naffect the value of properties securing the loan or the revenues from the borrower’s business, thereby increasing the risk of\nnonperforming loans. As the Company’s commercial real estate and commercial loan portfolios increase, the corresponding\nrisks and potential for losses from these loans may also increase. Furthermore, it may be difficult to assess the future\nperformance of newly originated commercial loans, as such loans may have delinquency or charge-off levels above the\nCompany’s historical experience, which could adversely affect the Company’s future performance.\nIf our nonperforming assets increase, our earnings will suffer.\nOur nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonaccrual\nloans or real estate owned. We must reserve for probable losses, which results in additional provisions for loan losses. As\ncircumstances warrant, we must write down the value of properties in our other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing\nmarket values. Additionally, we have legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as additional costs, such\nas taxes, insurance and maintenance related to our other real estate owned. The resolution of nonperforming assets also requires\nthe active involvement of management, which can adversely affect the amount of time we devote to the income-producing\n65\nactivities of the Bank. If our estimate of the allowance for loan losses is inadequate, we will have to increase the allowance\naccordingly.\nIf the Company’s allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual credit losses, the Company’s results of\noperations would be negatively affected.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses which represents management's best estimate of credit losses within the existing\nportfolio of loans. The allowance, in the judgement of management, is appropriate to reserve for estimated credit losses and\nrisks inherent in the loan portfolio. The level of the allowance for credit losses reflects management's continuing evaluation of\nindustry concentrations, specific credit risks, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic conditions\nand unidentified losses in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses\ninherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using\nexisting qualitative and quantitative information, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions\nor forecasts, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within\nand outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for credit losses.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review the Company’s allowance for credit losses and may require it to increase\nthe allowance for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in the allowance for credit losses or loan\ncharge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition\nand results of operations.\nRisk Related to Changes in Market Interest Rates\nChanges in interest rates may reduce the Company’s profits and impair asset values.\nThe Company’s earnings and cash flows depend primarily on its net interest income. Interest rates are highly sensitive to\nmany factors that are beyond the Company’s control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various\ngovernmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. Changes in market interest rates could have an adverse\neffect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. If rates increase rapidly, the Company may have to\nincrease the rates paid on deposits, particularly higher cost time deposits and borrowed funds, more quickly than any changes in\ninterest rates earned on loans and investments, resulting in a negative effect on interest rate spreads and net interest income.\nIncreases in interest rates may also make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans. Conversely, should\nmarket interest rates fall below current levels, the Company’s net interest margin also could be negatively affected if\ncompetitive pressures keep it from further reducing rates on deposits, while the yields on the Company’s interest-earning assets\ndecrease more rapidly through loan prepayments and interest rate adjustments. Decreases in interest rates often result in\nincreased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance their loans to reduce borrowings costs.\nUnder these circumstances, the Company is subject to reinvestment risk to the extent it is unable to reinvest the cash received\nfrom such prepayments in loans or other investments that have interest rates that are comparable to the interest rates on existing\nloans and securities. Changes in interest rates also affect the value of the Company’s interest-earning assets, and in particular its\nsecurities portfolio. Generally, the value of fixed-rate securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Unrealized\ngains and losses on securities available for sale determined to be temporary in nature are reported as a separate component of\nequity. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates therefore could have\nan adverse effect on the Company’s stockholders’ equity.\nRisks Related to Our Acquisition Activity\nImpairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe have recorded goodwill in connection with our recently completed mergers. At December 31, 2023, we had $9.7\nmillion of goodwill on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition after incurring goodwill impairment of $18.7\nmillion in 2020. Any further impairment to goodwill could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial conditions and results of operations. 100% of the goodwill is assigned to the Community Banking reporting unit.\nUnder GAAP, goodwill must be evaluated for impairment annually or on an interim basis when a triggering event occurs. If the\ncarrying value of our reporting unit exceeds its current fair value as determined based on the value of the business, the goodwill\nis considered impaired and is reduced to fair value by a non-cash, non-tax-deductible charge to earnings. The impairment\ntesting required by GAAP involves estimates and significant judgments by management. Although we believe our assumptions\nand estimates are reasonable and appropriate, any changes in key assumptions or other unanticipated events and circumstances\nmay affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates. Events and conditions that could result in impairment in the value of our\ngoodwill include worsening business conditions and economic factors, particularly those that may result from the impact of a\ndownturn in the economy as a result of COVID-19, changes in the industries in which we operate, adverse changes in the\nregulatory environment, or other factors leading to reduction in expected long-term profitability and cash flows.\n66\nRisk Related to Our Liquidity Position\nIf we are unable to borrow funds, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors, creditors,\nand borrowers, or the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.\nLiquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. Our liquidity is used to make loans\nand to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and procedures are\nestablished by the board, with operating limits set based upon the ratio of loans to deposits and percentage of assets funded with\nnon-core or wholesale funding. We regularly monitor our overall liquidity position to ensure various alternative strategies exist\nto cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. We also establish policies and monitor guidelines to diversify our\nwholesale funding sources to avoid concentrations in any one market source. Wholesale funding sources include federal funds\npurchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and debt. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of\nPittsburgh, which provides funding through advances to members that are collateralized with mortgage-related assets.\nWe maintain a portfolio of available-for-sale securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity. There are other\nsources of liquidity available to us should they be needed. These sources include the sale of loans, the ability to acquire national\nmarket, non-core deposits, issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances and federal funds\npurchased, and the issuance of preferred or common securities.\nRisks Related to Our Ability to Pay Dividends\nThe Company’s ability to pay dividends is subject to the ability of Community Bank to make capital distributions to the\nCompany, and also may be limited by Federal Reserve policy.\nThe Company’s long-term ability to pay dividends to its stockholders depends primarily on the ability of the Bank to make\ncapital distributions to the Company and on the availability of cash at the holding company level if the Bank’s earnings are not\nsufficient to pay dividends. In addition, the Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends\nby bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only\nif the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs,\nasset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to\ncapital distributions in certain circumstances, such as where the holding company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of\ndividends paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the holding company’s overall rate or earnings\nretention is inconsistent with its capital needs and overall financial condition. These regulatory policies may adversely affect the\nCompany’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nBecause the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, the Company faces\nsignificant operational risks.\nThe Company operates in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to process a significant\nnumber of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from operations, including the risk of fraud by employees or\npersons outside a company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing\nand technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster\nrecovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits.\nThis risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of\nnoncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition\ndue to potential negative publicity. If a breakdown occurs in the internal controls system, improper operation of systems or\nimproper employee actions, the Company could incur financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation.\nRisks associated with system failures, interruptions, breaches of security or cyber security could negatively affect the\nCompany’s earnings.\nInformation technology systems are critical to the Company’s business. The Company uses various technology systems to\nmanage customer relationships, general ledger, securities, deposits and loans. The Company has established policies and\nprocedures to prevent or limit the effect of system failures, interruptions and security breaches, but such events may still occur\nor may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, any compromise of the Company’s systems could deter\ncustomers from using its products and services. Security systems may not protect systems from security breaches.\nIn addition, the Company outsources some of its data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party\nproviders encounter difficulties, or if the Company has difficulty communicating with them, the Company’s ability to\nadequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and business operations could be adversely affected. Threats\nto information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any system failures, interruption or breach of security could damage the Company’s reputation and\nresult in a loss of customers and business thereby, subjecting it to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose it to litigation\n67\nand possible financial liability. Although the Company has not experienced any system failures, interruption or breach of\nsecurity to date, any of these events could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is constantly relying upon the availability of technology, the Internet and telecommunication systems to\nenable financial transactions by clients, to record and monitor transactions and transmit and receive data to and from clients and\nthird parties. Information security risks have increased significantly due to the use of online, telephone and mobile banking\nchannels by clients and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external\nparties. Our technologies, systems, networks and our clients’ devices have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the\ntarget of, cyberattacks, computer viruses, malware, phishing attacks or information security breaches that could result in the\nunauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our clients’ confidential, proprietary and other\ninformation, the theft of client assets through fraudulent transactions or disruption of our or our clients’ or other third parties’\nbusiness operations. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nThe Company’s risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for\nsignificant losses.\nThe Company’s risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to the company. The Company seeks to\nidentify, measure, monitor, report and control exposure to risk, including strategic, market, liquidity, compliance and\noperational risks. While the Company uses a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, these\ntechniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated\nor unknown risks. Economic conditions and heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry,\namong other developments, have increased the Company’s level of risk. Accordingly, the Company could suffer losses if it fails\nto properly anticipate and manage these risks.\nRisks Related to Accounting Matters\nChanges in the Company’s accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how the Company\nreports its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company’s accounting policies are essential to understanding its financial condition and results of operations. Some of\nthese policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of the Company’s assets, liabilities, and\nfinancial results. Some of the Company’s accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult,\nsubjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and because it is likely that materially different\namounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If such estimates or assumptions\nunderlying the Company’s financial statements are incorrect, it may experience material losses.\nFrom time to time, the FASB and the Securities and Exchange Commission change the financial accounting and reporting\nstandards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s financial statements. These\nchanges are beyond the Company’s control, can be difficult to predict, and could materially affect how the Company reports its\nfinancial condition and results of operations. The Company could also be required to apply a new or revised standard\nretroactively, resulting in restating prior period financial statements in material amounts.\nThe need to account for certain assets at estimated fair value, such as securities, may adversely affect the Company’s\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company reports certain assets, such as securities, at estimated fair value. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair\nvalue, the Company uses quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize observable market inputs to estimate fair value.\nBecause the Company carries these assets on its books at their estimated fair value, it may incur losses even if the asset in\nquestion presents minimal credit risk.\nRisks Related to Competitive Matters\nStrong competition within the Company’s market area could adversely affect the Company’s earnings and slow growth.\nThe Company faces intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. Price competition for loans and\ndeposits might result in the Company earning less on its loans and paying more on its deposits, which reduces net interest\nincome. Some of the Company’s competitors have substantially greater resources than the Company has and may offer services\nthat it does not provide. The Company expects competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and\ntechnological changes and the continuing consolidation in the financial services industry. The Company’s profitability will\ndepend upon its continued ability to compete successfully in its market areas.\n68\nGeneral Risk Factors\nA worsening of economic conditions could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.\nA worsening of economic conditions could significantly affect the markets in which the Company operates, the value of\nloans and investments, ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Further declines in real estate values and sales volumes and\ncontinued elevated unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, increases in nonperforming and\ncriticized classified assets, and a decline in demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, the volatility in\nnatural gas prices, or if prices decline, may depress natural gas exploration and drilling activities in the Marcellus Shale\nFormation. Furthermore, exploration and drilling of natural gas reserves in our market area may be affected by federal, state and\nlocal laws and regulations affecting production, permitting, environmental protection and other matters. Any of these events\nmay negatively affect our customers, and may cause the Company to incur losses, and may adversely affect its financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nInflation can have an adverse impact on our business and on our customers.\nInflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be worth less in the future as inflation\ndecreases the value of money. Recently, there have been market indicators of a pronounced rise in inflation and the FRB has\nraised certain benchmark interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. As inflation increases, the value of our investment\nsecurities, particularly those with longer maturities, would decrease, although this effect can be less pronounced for floating rate\ninstruments. In addition, inflation increases the cost of goods and services we use in our business operations, such as electricity\nand other utilities, which increases our noninterest expenses. Furthermore, our customers are also affected by inflation and the\nrising costs of goods and services used in their households and businesses, which could have a negative impact on their ability\nto repay their loans with us.\nClimate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may materially affect the Company’s financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nThe effects of climate change continue to create a rising level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a\nresult, businesses have increased their political and social awareness surrounding the issue, and the U.S. has entered into\ninternational agreements in an attempt to reduce global temperatures. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and\nfederal and state regulatory agencies continue to propose numerous initiatives to combat climate change. Other expansive\ninitiatives are expected, including potentially increasing supervisory expectations with respect to banks’ risk management\npractices, accounting for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments, revising\nexpectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climate-related factors and encouraging investment by banks in\nclimate-related initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change. The lack of\nempirical data surrounding the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change render it difficult to predict how climate\nchange may impact our financial condition and results of operations; however, the physical effects of climate change may also\ndirectly impact us. Specifically, unpredictable and more frequent weather disasters may adversely impact the value of real\nproperty securing the loans in our portfolios. Additionally, if insurance obtained by our borrowers is insufficient to cover any\nlosses sustained to the collateral, or if insurance coverage is otherwise unavailable to our borrowers, the collateral securing our\nloans may be negatively impacted by climate change, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, the effects of climate change may negatively impact regional and local economic activity, which could lead to an\nadverse effect on our customers and impact the communities in which we operate. Overall, the effects and resulting, unknown\nimpact of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls.\nA failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings, but also on the\nperception that customers, regulators and investors may have of us. We devote a significant amount of effort, time and\nresources to continually strengthening our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and banking\nregulations. Compliance with increased or new standards and regulations applicable to our Company may entail management\nspending increased time addressing such standards and regulations. Further, the Company may be required to expend additional\ncapital resources on professional advisors, which could increase operational expenses and therefore negatively impact our net\nincome.\nITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable\n69\nITEM 1C CYBERSECURITY\nOur risk management program is designed to identify, assess and mitigate risks across our company. When considering\nfinancial, operational, regulatory, reputational and legal risk, our program is well matched for our size and complexity.

We leverage internal and external auditors to review processes, systems and controls related to our\ninformation security program to ensure they are operating effectively. Management proactively responds to all\nrecommendations designed to strengthen or improve our operating environment.\nWe maintain a detailed Incident Response Plan which outlines the steps we would implement in the event of an actual or\npotential cybersecurity event. The Incident Response Plan includes timely notification of an escalation to the appropriate levels\nof management and Board of Directors. The Incident Response Plan is reviewed and updated at least annually and mandates\ncoordination and collaboration across all levels of management and all areas of the Bank.\nThe Board of Directors reviews components of the information security program on annual basis including policies,\nprocedures, risk assessments, table top testing results, attestations, budgets and strategies. These components are presented by\nExecutive Management as part of the regular board meeting schedule and strategic planning process.\n70\nITEM 2.

The adoption resulted in a decrease of $3.4 million to the Company’s ACL related to loans receivable (ACL\n- Loans) and an increase of $718,000 in ACL for unfunded commitments (ACL - Unfunded Commitments). The net impact\nresulted in a $2.1 million increase to retained earnings, net of deferred taxes.\nThe ACL represents the estimated amount considered necessary to cover lifetime expected credit losses inherent in financial\nassets at the balance sheet date. The measurement of expected credit losses is applicable to loans receivable and securities\nmeasured at amortized cost. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures such as loan commitments and unused lines of\ncredit. The allowance is established through a provision for credit losses that is charged against income. The methodology for\ndetermining the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management because of the high degree\nof judgment involved, the subjectivity of the assumptions used, and the potential for changes in the forecasted economic\nenvironment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded ACL. The ACL is reported separately as a contra-asset\non the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. The expected credit loss for unfunded loan commitments is reported on\nthe Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition in other liabilities while the provision for credit losses related to unfunded\ncommitments is reported in provision for credit losses - unfunded commitments in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nACL on Loans Receivable\nThe ACL on loans is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the loan to present the net amount expected to be collected.\nExpected losses are evaluated and calculated on a collective, or pooled, basis for those loans which share similar risk\ncharacteristics. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether loans within a pool continue to exhibit similar risk\ncharacteristics. If the risk characteristics of a loan change, such that they are no longer similar to other loans in the pool, the\nCompany will evaluate the loan with a different pool of loans that share similar risk characteristics. If the loan does not share\nrisk characteristics with other loans, the Company will evaluate the loan on an individual basis. The Company evaluates the\npooling methodology at least annually. Loans are charged off against the ACL when the Company believes the balances to be\nuncollectible. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged\noff.\nThe Company has chosen to segment its portfolio consistent with the manner in which it manages credit risk. Such segments\ninclude residential mortgage, commercial real estate mortgages, construction, commercial business, consumer and other. For\nmost segments, the Company calculates estimated credit losses using a probability of default and loss given default\nmethodology, the results of which are applied to the aggregated discounted cash flow of each individual loan within the\nsegment. The point in time probability of default and loss given default are then conditioned by macroeconomic scenarios to\nincorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.\nThe Company estimates the ACL on loans via a quantitative analysis which considers relevant available information from\ninternal and external sources related to past events and current conditions, as well as the incorporation of reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. The Company evaluates a variety of factors including third party economic forecasts, industry trends and\nother available published economic information in arriving at its forecasts. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period,\nthe Company reverts, on a straight-line basis, to average historical losses. Expected credit losses are estimated over the\ncontractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected\nextensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies: management has a reasonable expectation at the\nreporting date that a restructuring will be executed with an individual borrower or the renewal option is included in the original\nor modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company.\nAlso included in the ACL on loans are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Company’s assessment,\nmay not be adequately represented in the quantitative analysis or the forecasts described above. Factors that the Company\nconsiders include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio\nconcentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, and the effect of external factors such as\ncompetition, legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Furthermore, the Company considers the inherent uncertainty in\nquantitative models that are built upon historical data.\n75\nIndividually Evaluated Loans\nOn a case-by-case basis, the Company may conclude that a loan should be evaluated on an individual basis based on its\ndisparate risk characteristics. When the Company determines that a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with other\nloans in the portfolio, the allowance will be determined on an individual basis using the present value of expected cash flows or,\nfor collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral as of the reporting date, less estimated selling costs, as applicable.\nIf the fair value of the collateral is less than the amortized cost basis of the loan, the Company will charge off the difference\nbetween the fair value of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell at the reporting date, and the amortized cost basis of the loan.\nACL on Off-Balance Sheet Commitments\nThe Company is required to include unfunded commitments that are expected to be funded in the future within the allowance\ncalculation, other than those that are unconditionally cancellable. To arrive at that reserve, the reserve percentage for each\napplicable segment is applied to the unused portion of the expected commitment balance and is multiplied by the expected\nfunding rate. To determine the expected funding rate, the Company uses a historical utilization rate for each segment. As noted\nabove, the ACL on unfunded loan commitments is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial\nCondition and the related credit expense is recorded in provision for credit losses - unfunded commitments in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income.\nACL on Available-for-Sale Securities\nFor available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more\nlikely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria\nregarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income.\nFor securities available-for-sale that do not meet the above criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has\nresulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is\nless than amortized cost, any changes to the rating by a rating agency, and adverse conditions related to the security, among\nother factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from\nthe security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of the cash flows expected to be\ncollected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an ACL is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the\namount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an ACL is\nrecognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The Company elected the practical expedient of zero loss\nestimates for securities issued by U.S. government entities and agencies. These securities are either explicitly or implicitly\nguaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major agencies and have a long history of no credit losses.\nChanges in the ACL are recorded as provision for, or reversal of, credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance\nwhen management believes the uncollectibility of an available for sale security is confirmed or when either of the criteria\nregarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nAccrued Interest Receivable\nThe Company made an accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable from the amortized cost basis of loans\nand available for sale securities. Accrued interest receivable on loans is reported as a component of accrued interest receivable\nand other assets on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition, totaled $4.1 million at December 31, 2023 and is\nexcluded from the estimate of credit losses. Accrued interest receivable on available of sale securities, also a component of\naccrued interest receivable and other assets on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition, totaled $947,000, at\nDecember 31, 2023 and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the Company calculated the allowance for loan losses\n(\"allowance\"), using an incurred loan loss methodology. The following policy related to the allowance in prior periods.\nThe allowance for loan losses (“allowance”) is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be\nreasonably anticipated. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance based on potential losses\nin the current loan portfolio, which includes an assessment of economic conditions, changes in the nature and volume of the\nloan portfolio, loan loss experience, volume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans as well as other loan\nmodifications, quality of the Company’s loan review system, the degree of oversight by the Company’s Board, existence and\neffect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations, effect of external factors, such as\ncompetition and legal and regulatory requirements, and other relevant factors. While management uses the best information\navailable to make such evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ\nsubstantially from the assumptions used in making evaluations. Additions are made to the allowance through periodic\nprovisions charged to income and recovery of principal and interest on loans previously charged-off. Losses of principal are\ncharged directly to the allowance when a loss occurs or when a determination is made that the specific loss is probable. This\nevaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information\nbecomes available.\nThe allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as\nimpaired. A loan is considered impaired when, based upon current information and events, it is probable that the Company will\n76\nbe unable to collect all amounts due for principal and interest according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement.\nGenerally, management considers all substandard, doubtful, and loss-rated loans, nonaccrual loans, and TDRs for impairment.\nManagement determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into\nconsideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for\nthe delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.\nThe maximum period without payment that typically can occur before a loan is considered for impairment is 90 days.\nImpairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at a loan’s effective interest rate,\nor as a practical expedient, the observable market price, or, if the loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of the underlying\ncollateral. When the measurement of an impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the impairment is\nrecorded in a specific valuation allowance. This specific valuation allowance is periodically adjusted for significant changes in\nthe amount or timing of expected future cash flows, observable market price or fair value of the collateral. The specific\nvaluation allowance, or allowance for impaired loans, is part of the total allowance for loan losses. Cash payments received on\nimpaired loans that are considered nonaccrual are recorded as a direct reduction of the recorded investment in the loan. When\nthe recorded investment has been fully collected, receipts are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until the\npreviously charged-off principal is fully recovered. Subsequent amounts collected are recognized as interest income. If no\ncharge-off exists, then once the recorded investment has been fully collected, any future amounts collected would be recognized\nas interest income. Impaired loans are not returned to accrual status until all amounts due, both principal and interest, are\ncurrent and a sustained payment history has been demonstrated.\nThe general allowance component covers pools of homogeneous loans by loan class. Management determines historical\nloss experience for each segment of loans using the five-year rolling average of the net charge-off data within each segment.\nQualitative and environmental factors are also considered that are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with the\nBank’s existing portfolio to differ from historical loss experience, and include levels and trends in delinquency and impaired\nloans; levels and trends in net charge-offs, trends in volume and terms of loans; change in underwriting, policies, procedures,\npractices and key personnel; national and local economic trends; industry conditions, and effects of changes in high-risk credit\ncircumstances. The qualitative and environmental factors are reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure they are reflective of\ncurrent conditions in the portfolio and economy. An unallocated component, which is a part of the general allowance\ncomponent, is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect the Company’s estimate of probable losses.\nOur allowance is sensitive to a number of inputs, most notably the qualitative factors and historical loss experience by loan\nsegment. Given the dynamic relationship between the inputs, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one\nindividual variable on the allowance. Although management believes that it uses the best information available to establish the\nallowance, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if\ncircumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Because future events affecting\nborrowers and collateral value cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance is\nadequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of assets deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed\npreviously. Any increase in the allowance may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in\nfactors underlying the assessment could have a material impact on the amount of the allowance that is necessary and the amount\nof provision to be charged against earnings.\nFair Value Measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or\nliability at the transaction date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs. A three-level of fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 – Fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible to the Company for\nidentical assets. These generally provide the most reliable evidence and are used to measure fair value\nwhenever available.\nLevel 2 – Fair value is based on significant inputs, other than Level 1 inputs, that are observable either directly or\nindirectly for substantially the full term of the asset through corroboration with observable market data. Level\n2 inputs include quoted market prices in active markets for similar assets, quoted market prices in markets\nthat are not active for identical or similar assets, and other observable inputs.\nLevel 3 – Fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs. Examples of valuation methodologies that would result\nin Level 3 classification include option pricing models, discounted cash flows, and other similar techniques.\nThis hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which\nthe fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe Company attempts to maximize observable inputs and limit the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value\nmeasurements, Fair value measurements for assets where there exists limited or no observable market data and that are based\nprimarily upon the Company’s or other third-party’s estimates, are often calculated based on the characteristics of the asset, the\n77\neconomic and competitive environment and other such factors. Therefore, the results cannot be determined with precision and\nmay not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset. Additionally, there may be inherent weaknesses in\nany calculation technique where changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future\ncash flows, could significantly affect the results of current or future valuations.\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired.\nDeemed to have an indefinite life and not subject to amortization, goodwill is instead tested for impairment at the reporting unit\nlevel at least annually on October 31 or more frequently if triggering events occur or impairment indicators exist. The Company\noperates two reporting units – Community Banking segment and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. The Company has\nassigned 100% of the goodwill to the Community Banking reporting unit.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit under the goodwill impairment test is judgmental and often involves the use\nof significant estimates and assumptions. The Company applies a one-step quantitative test and records the amount of goodwill\nimpairment as the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill\nallocated to the reporting unit. The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence\nof events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less\nthan its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than\nnot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing a step one impairment test is\nunnecessary. An entity also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to the\nfirst step of impairment testing.\nTwo basic approaches to determine the fair value of an entity are the income approach and market approach or a\ncombination of the two. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future earnings or cash flows to present\nvalue to arrive at a value that is indicated by market expectations about future amounts. The market approach uses observable\nprices and other relevant information that is generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or\nliabilities. The fair value measure is based on the value that those transactions indicate. These approaches involve significant\nestimates and assumptions.\nIn the application of the income approach, fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow\nanalysis. The income approach relies on Level 3 inputs along with a market-derived cost of capital when measuring fair value.\nFair value is determined by converting anticipated benefits into a present single value. Once the benefit or benefits are selected,\nan appropriate discount or capitalization rate is applied to each benefit. These rates are calculated using the appropriate measure\nfor the size and type of company, using financial models and market data as required. A discount rate may be derived based on\na modified capital asset pricing model. which is comprised of a risk-free rate of return, an equity risk premium, a size premium\nand a factor covering the systemic market risk and a company specific risk premium. The values for the factors applied are\ndetermined primarily using external sources of information. The discounted cash flow model also uses prospective financial\ninformation. Estimating future earnings and capital requirements involves judgment and the consideration of past and current\nperformance and overall macroeconomic and regulatory environments.\nUnder the market approach, Level 1 and 2 inputs are used when measuring fair value. In the application of the market\napproach, the Guideline Public Company method of appraisal is based on the premise that pricing multiples of publicly traded\ncompanies can be used as a tool to be applied in valuing a closely held entity. A value multiple or ratio relates a stock’s market\nprice to the reported accounting data such as revenue, earnings, and book value. These ratios provide an objective basis for\nmeasuring the market’s perception of a stock’s fair value. Value ratios generally reflect the trends in growth, performance and\nstability of the financial results of operations. In this way, the business and financial risks exhibited by an industry or group of\ncompanies can be viewed in relation to market values. Value ratios also reflect the market’s outlook for the economy as a\nwhole. Guideline companies provide a reasonable basis for comparison to the relative investment characteristics of the company\nbeing valued. The Company analyzes the relationships between the guideline companies' asset size, profitability, asset quality\nand capital ratios and applies a control premium to the selected guideline company multiples. The control premium is\nmanagement's estimate of how much a market participant would be willing to pay over the fair market value in consideration of\nsynergies and other benefits that flow from control of the entity. The Guideline Public Company method using trading activity\nof publicly traded companies that are most similar to the Company may also be considered when the banking industry has a\nsufficient level of mergers and acquisitions activity\nThe results of the income and market approaches may be weighted to determine the concluded fair value of the reporting\nunit. The weighting is judgmental and is based on the perceived level of appropriateness of the valuation methodology.\nEstimating the fair value involves the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including\nactual operating results. If current conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and\nestimates described above could change in future periods and require management to further evaluate goodwill for impairment.\nIf the Company determines a triggering event occurs in the future, changes in the judgments, assumptions and inputs noted\nabove could result in additional goodwill impairment.\n78\nDeferred Taxes. Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts\nand tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax\nassets to the amount expected to be realized. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is \"more likely than not\" that the\ntax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized\nis the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not\nmeeting the \"more likely than not\" test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company did not have a deferred tax asset valuation\nallowance as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements and Developments\nNew accounting pronouncements that were adopted in the current period or will be adopted in a future period are discussed\nin Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included\nin Part IV, Item 15 of this Report.\nExplanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to traditional measures presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we\nuse, and this Report contains or references, certain Non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these Non-GAAP financial\nmeasures provide useful information in understanding our underlying results of operations or financial position and our\nbusiness and performance trends as they facilitate comparisons with the performance of other companies in the financial\nservices industry. Although we believe that these Non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding of our business and\nperformance, these Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP or considered to be more\nimportant than financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable with Non-GAAP\nmeasures which may be presented by other companies. Where Non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP\nfinancial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found herein. Refer to the\n\"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP\" within this Item 7 for further information.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2023 and 2022\nAssets. Total assets increased $47.2 million, or 3.4%, to $1.46 billion at December 31, 2023, compared to $1.41 billion at\nDecember 31, 2022.\nCash and Due From Banks. Cash and due from banks decreased $35.5 million, or 34.2%, to $68.2 million at\nDecember 31, 2023, compared to $103.7 million at December 31, 2022. The change is primarily related to net funding of loans.\nSecurities. Securities increased $17.0 million, or 8.9%, to $207.1 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $190.1\nmillion at December 31, 2022. The securities balance was primarily impacted by the purchase of $29.9 million of collateralized\nloan obligation securities, partially offset by $15.8 million of repayments on mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage\nobligation securities and a $110,000 decrease in the market value in the equity securities portfolio, which is primarily\ncomprised of bank stocks. During the period, the Bank implemented a balance sheet repositioning strategy of its portfolio of\navailable-for-sale securities. The Bank sold $69.3 million in market value of its lower-yielding U.S government agency,\nmortgage-backed and municipal securities with an average yield of 1.89% and purchased $69.3 million of higher-yielding\nmortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligation securities with an average yield of 5.49%.\n79\nSecurities Portfolio.

Total loans increased $60.5 million, or 5.8%, to $1.11 billion at December 31, 2023 compared to $1.05 billion at\nDecember 31, 2022. Loan growth was driven by increases in commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans,\nresidential mortgage loans and other loans of $41.2 million, $30.3 million, $17.1 million, and $8.9 million, respectively,\npartially offset by a decrease in consumer loans of $35.3 million. The decrease in consumer loans resulted from a reduction in\nindirect automobile loan production due to rising market interest rates and the discontinuation of this product offering as of\nJune 30, 2023. This portfolio is expected to continue to decline as resources are allocated and production efforts are focused on\nmore profitable commercial products. Excluding the $34.9 million decrease in indirect automobile loans, total loans increased\n$95.4 million, or 9.1%. Average loans, net for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $57.8 million compared to the year\nended December 31, 2022.\nLoan Portfolio Composition.

The following table summarizes the scheduled repayments of our loan portfolio at\nDecember 31, 2023. Demand loans, loans having no stated repayment schedule or maturity, and overdraft loans are reported as\nbeing due in one year or less.

The Company reviews its loans on a regular basis and generally places\nloans on nonaccrual status when either principal or interest is 90 days or more past due. In addition, the Company places loans\non nonaccrual status when we do not expect to receive full payment of interest, principal or both. Interest accrued and unpaid at\nthe time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed from interest income. Loans that are 90 days or more past due may\nstill accrue interest if they are well secured and in the process of collection. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied\nagainst principal. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought\ncurrent, and current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nManagement monitors all past due loans and nonperforming assets. Such loans are placed under close supervision, with\nconsideration given to the need for additions to the allowance for credit losses and (if appropriate) partial or full charge-off.\nManagement believes the volume of nonperforming assets can be partially attributed to unique borrower circumstances as\nwell as the economy in general. We have an experienced chief credit officer, collections and credit departments that monitor the\nloan portfolio and seek to prevent any deterioration of asset quality.\nReal estate acquired through foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time\nas it is sold. When real estate owned is acquired, it is recorded at the lower of the unpaid principal balance of the related loan, or\nits fair market value, less estimated selling expenses. Any further write-down of real estate owned is charged against earnings.\n89\nNonaccrual Loans and Nonperforming Assets.

Nonperforming loans decreased $3.6 million to $2.2 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $5.8\nmillion at December 31, 2022. The respective decreases are primarily attributable to ten loans totaling $1.7 million transferred\nfrom nonaccrual to accrual status during the period and the repayment of a $1.6 million commercial real estate loan that was\npreviously on nonaccrual status.\nThe following table presents the components of the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans at the dates indicated.\n2023 2022\nNonaccrual Nonaccrual\nLoans to Loans to\nNonaccrual Total Total Nonaccrual Total Total\nDecember 31, Loans Loans Loans Loans Loans Loans\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nReal Estate:\nResidential $ 1,476 $ 347,808 0.42 % $ 1,649 $ 330,725 0.50 %\nCommercial 360 467,154 0.08 1,814 436,805 0.42\nConstruction — 43,116 — — 44,923 —\nCommercial and Industrial 316 111,278 0.28 415 70,044 0.59\nConsumer 88 111,643 0.08 120 146,927 0.08\nOther — 29,397 — — 20,449 —\nTotal $ 2,240 $ 1,110,396 0.20 % $ 3,998 $ 1,049,873 0.38 %\nNonaccrual loans decreased $1.8 million to $2.2 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $4.0 million at December 31,\n2022. Nonaccrual commercial real estate loans decreased $1.5 million to $360,000 at December 31, 2023 compared to\n$1.8 million at December 31, 2022 primarily related to the repayment of a $1.6 million commercial real estate loan that was\npreviously on nonaccrual status.\nClassified Assets. Federal regulations provide that loans and other assets of lesser quality should be classified as\n“substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” assets. An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net\nworth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by\nthe “distinct possibility” that the Company will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as\n“doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the\nweaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values,\n“highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value\nthat their continuance as assets is not warranted. The Company designates an asset as “special mention” if the asset has a\npotential weakness that warrants management’s close attention.\nThe Company uses an eight-point internal risk rating system to monitor the credit quality of the overall loan portfolio. The\nfirst four categories are not considered criticized and are aggregated as “pass” rated. The criticized rating categories used by\nmanagement generally follow bank regulatory definitions. The special mention category includes assets that are currently\nprotected but are below average quality, resulting in an undue credit risk, but not to the point of justifying a substandard\nclassification. Loans in the substandard category have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and\nhave a distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the weaknesses are not corrected. Loans classified as doubtful have\nall the weaknesses inherent in loans classified as substandard with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full,\non the basis of current conditions and facts, is highly improbable. Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of\nsuch little value that continuance as an asset is not warranted.\nAs part of the periodic exams of the Bank by the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, the\nstaff of such agencies reviews our classifications and determines whether such classifications are adequate. Such agencies have,\nin the past, and may in the future require us to classify certain assets which management has not otherwise classified or require\na classification more severe than established by management. The following table shows the principal amount of special\nmention and classified loans at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n91\nDecember 31, 2023 2022\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nSpecial Mention $ 54,978 $ 43,804\nSubstandard 14,457 14,499\nDoubtful — 415\nLoss — —\nTotal $ 69,435 $ 58,718\nThe total amount of special mention and classified loans increased $10.7 million, or 18.3%, to $69.4 million at\nDecember 31, 2023, compared to $58.7 million at December 31, 2022. The increase of $11.2 million in the special mention\nloan category is primarily due to construction loan downgrades.\nAllowance for Credit Losses. The allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for\nlosses that can be reasonably anticipated. While management uses the best information available to make such evaluations,\nfuture adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in\nmaking evaluations. Additions are made to the allowance through periodic provisions charged to income and recovery of\nprincipal and interest on loans previously charged-off. Losses of principal are charged directly to the allowance when a loss\noccurs or when a determination is made that the specific loss is probable. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires\nestimates that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available.\nAlthough we maintain our allowance for credit losses at a level that we consider to be adequate to provide for potential\nlosses, there can be no assurance that such losses will not exceed the estimated amounts or that we will not be required to make\nadditions to the allowance for credit losses in the future. Future additions to our allowance for credit losses and changes in the\nrelated ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans are dependent upon the economy, changes in real estate\nvalues and interest rates, the view of the regulatory authorities toward adequate credit loss reserve levels, and inflation.\nManagement will continue to periodically review the entire loan portfolio to determine the extent, if any, to which further\nadditional credit loss provisions may be deemed necessary.\n92\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Credit Losses. The following table summarizes changes in the allowance for credit losses by\nloan categories for each year indicated.\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 2022\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nBalance at Beginning of Year $ 12,819 $ 11,582\nImpact of ASC 326 - Loans (3,385) —\n(Recovery) Provision for Loan Losses (284) 3,784\nCharge-offs:\nReal Estate:\nResidential (219) (32)\nCommercial and Industrial — (2,712)\nConsumer (370) (151)\nTotal Charge-offs (589) (2,895)\nRecoveries:\nReal estate:\nResidential 43 145\nCommercial 32 —\nCommercial and Industrial 876 117\nConsumer 195 86\nTotal Recoveries 1,146 348\nNet Recoveries (Charge-offs) 557 (2,547)\nBalance at End of Year $ 9,707 $ 12,819\nAllowance for Credit Losses to Total Loans 0.87 % 1.22 %\nAllowance for Credit Losses to Nonaccrual Loans 433.35 320.64\nAllowance for Credit Losses to Nonperforming Loans 433.35 221.06\nNet (Recoveries) Charge-offs to Average Loans (0.05) 0.25\nThe allowance for credit losses decreased $3.1 million, or 24.3%, to $9.7 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $12.8\nmillion at December 31, 2022. Allowance for credit losses to total loans decreased 35 basis points to 0.87% at December 31,\n2023 compared to 1.22% at December 31, 2022. The change in the allowance for credit losses was primarily due to the\nCompany's aforementioned adoption of CECL. At adoption, the Company decreased its allowance for credit losses by $3.4\nmillion. During the current year, the Company recorded a recovery of credit losses of $284,000 due to improvements in\nqualitative factors coupled with a decrease in historical loss rates. This compared to $3.8 million in provision for credit losses\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022 due to a $2.7 million charge-off of one loan in the commercial and industrial pool.\nThe ratio of allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans ratio increased to 433.35% at December 31, 2023, compared to\n320.64% at December 31, 2022. Nonaccrual loans decreased $1.8 million to $2.2 million at December 31, 2023 compared to\n$4.0 million at December 31, 2022. Nonaccrual commercial real estate loans decreased $1.5 million to $360,000 at\nDecember 31, 2023 compared to $1.8 million at December 31, 2022 primarily related to the repayment of a $1.6 million\ncommercial real estate loan that was previously on nonaccrual status.\n93\nNet recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $557,000 primarily due to recoveries totaling $750,000 related\nto the prior year $2.7 million charged-off commercial and industrial loan. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31,\n2022 were $2.5 million. The following table presents the ratio of net (recoveries) charge-offs as a percent of average loans for\nthe periods indicated.\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 2022\nReal Estate:\nResidential 0.05 % (0.03) %\nCommercial (0.01) —\nConstruction — —\nCommercial and Industrial (0.89) 3.90\nConsumer 0.14 0.04\nOther — —\nTotal Loans (0.05) % 0.25 %\nAllocation of Allowance for Credit Losses.

The\nallocation of the allowance by category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the\nallowance to absorb losses in any category.\n2023 2022\nPercent Percent\nof of\nTotal Total\nDecember 31, Amount Loans Amount Loans\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nReal Estate:\nResidential $ 3,129 31.3 % $ 2,074 31.5 %\nCommercial 2,630 42.1 5,810 41.6\nConstruction 639 3.9 502 4.3\nCommercial and Industrial 1,693 10.0 2,313 6.7\nConsumer 1,367 10.1 1,517 14.0\nOther 249 2.6 — 1.9\nTotal Allocated Allowance 9,707 100.0 12,216 100.0\nUnallocated — — 603 —\nTotal Allowance for Credit Losses $ 9,707 100.0 % $ 12,819 100.0 %\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this Report to the most directly comparable GAAP financial\nmeasures are included in the following tables.\n94\nInterest income on interest-earning assets, net interest rate spread and net interest margin are presented on a fully tax-\nequivalent (“FTE”) basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and securities using\nthe federal statutory income tax rate of 21 percent. We believe the presentation of net interest income on a FTE basis ensures\ncomparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice.\nThe following table reconciles net interest income, net interest spread and net interest margin on a FTE basis for the periods\nindicated:\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 2022\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nInterest Income per Consolidated Statements of Income (GAAP) $ 62,225 $ 47,716\nAdjustment to FTE Basis 155 134\nInterest Income (Non-GAAP) 62,380 47,850\nInterest Expense per Consolidated Statements of Income (GAAP) 17,672 4,781\nNet Interest Income (Non-GAAP) $ 44,708 $ 43,069\nNet Interest Income (GAAP) $ 44,553 $ 42,935\nDivided by : Average Interest-Earning Assets $ 1,358,579 $ 1,324,875\nNet Interest Margin (GAAP) 3.28 % 3.24 %\nAdjustment to FTE Basis 0.01 0.01\nNet Interest Margin (Non-GAAP) 3.29 % 3.25 %\nNet Interest Rate Spread (GAAP) 2.73 % 3.07 %\nAdjustment to FTE Basis 0.01 0.01\nNet Interest Rate Spread (Non-GAAP) 2.74 % 3.08 %\nTangible book value per common share is a Non-GAAP measure and is calculated based on tangible common equity\ndivided by period-end common shares outstanding. Tangible common equity to tangible assets is a Non-GAAP measure and is\ncalculated based on tangible common equity divided by tangible assets. We believe these Non-GAAP measures serve as useful\ntools to help evaluate the strength and discipline of the Company's capital management strategies and as an additional,\nconservative measure of the Company’s total value.\nDecember 31, 2023 2022\n(Dollars in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data)\nStockholders' Equity (GAAP) (Numerator) $ 139,834 $ 110,155\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net (10,690) (13,245)\nTangible Common Equity or Tangible Book Value (Non-GAAP) (Numerator) $ 129,144 $ 96,910\nCommon Shares Outstanding (Denominator) 5,119,543 5,100,189\nBook Value per Common Share (GAAP) $ 27.31 $ 21.60\nTangible Book Value per Common Share (Non-GAAP) $ 25.23 $ 19.00\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. The Bank’s primary sources\nof funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, and maturities and sales of securities. While maturities and scheduled\namortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced\nby general interest rates, economic conditions and competition.\nThe Bank regularly adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon its assessment of expected loan demand, expected\ndeposit flows, yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities, and the objectives of its asset/liability management\nprogram. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest-earning deposits with other banks and short- and intermediate-\nterm securities. The Bank believes that it had sufficient liquidity at December 31, 2023, to satisfy its short- and long-term\nliquidity needs at that date.\nThe Bank’s most liquid assets are cash and due from banks, which totaled $68.2 million at December 31, 2023. Unpledged\nsecurities, which provide an additional source of liquidity, totaled $49.8 million. In addition, the Bank maintains a credit\n95\narrangement with the FHLB with a maximum borrowing limit of approximately $478.9 million and available borrowing\ncapacity of $438.3 million as of December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2023, $18.9 million of standby letters of credit were\nutilized to collateralize public deposits in excess of the level insured by the FDIC. This arrangement is subject to annual\nrenewal, incurs no service charge, and is secured by a blanket security agreement on $677.2 million of residential and\ncommercial mortgage loans and the Bank’s investment in FHLB stock. The Bank also maintains a Borrower-In-Custody of\nCollateral line of credit agreement with the FRB for $103.8 million that requires monthly certification of collateral, is subject to\nannual renewal, incurs no service charge and is secured by $142.9 million of commercial and consumer indirect auto loans. The\nBank also maintains multiple line of credit arrangements with various unaffiliated banks totaling $50.0 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Bank had funding commitments totaling $146.1 million, consisting primarily of commitments\nto originate loans, unused lines of credit and letters of credit.\nAt December 31, 2023, certificates of deposit due within one year of that date totaled $136.0 million, or 59.0% of total\ncertificates of deposit. While liquidity levels at December 31, 2023 are currently sufficient, if these certificates of deposit do not\nremain with the Bank, the Bank may be required to seek other sources of funds. Depending on market conditions, the Bank may\nbe required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than it currently pays on these certificates of deposit. The\nBank believes, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of its certificates of deposit will remain with it,\neither as certificates of deposit or as other deposit products. The Bank can attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest\nrates offered.\nThe Bank’s primary investing activities are the origination of loans. For the year ended December 31, 2023 the Bank had\nnet loan originations of $63.5 million.\nThe Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity to pay dividends to\nstockholders, to pay principal and interest on its subordinated debt and for other corporate purposes. At December 31, 2023, the\nCompany (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of $16.0 million.\nWe are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position daily and anticipate that we\nwill have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current\npricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained.\nCommitments. As a financial services provider, the Company routinely is a party to various financial instruments with off-\nbalance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit, commitments under unused lines of credit, and commitments under\nletters of credit. While these contractual obligations represent potential future cash requirements, a significant portion of\ncommitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies\nand approval process accorded to loans the Company makes. In addition, the Company enters into commitments to sell\nmortgage loans.\nContractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of its operations, the Company enters into certain contractual obligations.\nSuch obligations include operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit\nliabilities and agreements with respect to investments.\nThe following tables present certain of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2023.\nLess Than More Than More Than\nOr Equal to One to Three to More Than\nTotal One Year Three Years Five Years Five Years\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nCertificates of deposit $ 230,641 $ 136,016 $ 86,600 $ 6,135 $ 1,890\nOther Borrowed Funds 34,678 — 20,000 — 14,678\nOperating Lease Obligations 1,981 355 505 437 684\nTotal $ 267,300 $ 136,371 $ 107,105 $ 6,572 $ 17,252\nCapital Resources\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, the Bank was considered \"well capitalized\" under the regulatory framework\nfor prompt corrective action.\n96\nThe following table presents the Bank’s regulatory capital amounts and ratios, as well as the minimum amounts and ratios\nrequired to be well capitalized at the dates indicated.\n2023 2022\nDecember 31, Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)\nActual $ 143,654 13.64 % $ 121,188 12.33 %\nFor Capital Adequacy Purposes 47,385 4.50 44,221 4.50\nTo Be Well Capitalized 68,445 6.50 63,875 6.50\nTier I Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)\nActual 143,654 13.64 121,188 12.33\nFor Capital Adequacy Purposes 63,180 6.00 58,961 6.00\nTo Be Well Capitalized 84,240 8.00 78,615 8.00\nTotal Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)\nActual 153,861 14.61 133,478 13.58\nFor Capital Adequacy Purposes 84,240 8.00 78,615 8.00\nTo Be Well Capitalized 105,300 10.00 98,269 10.00\nTier I Leverage Capital (to Adjusted Total Assets)\nActual 143,654 10.19 121,188 8.66\nFor Capital Adequacy Purposes 56,385 4.00 55,969 4.00\nTo Be Well Capitalized 70,481 5.00 69,962 5.00\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Price\nThe consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nGAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without\nconsideration of changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is\nreflected in the increased cost of the Company’s operations. Unlike industrial companies, the Company’s assets and liabilities\nare primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the\neffects of inflation.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nManagement of Interest Rate Risk. The majority of the Company’s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature.\nConsequently, the Company’s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk and a principal part of its business\nstrategy is to manage interest rate risk by reducing the exposure of net interest income to changes in market interest rates.\nAccordingly, the Company’s Board has established an Asset/Liability Management Committee, which is responsible for\nevaluating the interest rate risk inherent in the Company’s assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is\nappropriate given the Company’s business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives; and\nfor managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board. Senior management monitors the level of interest\nrate risk and the Asset/Liability Management Committee meets on a quarterly basis to review its asset/liability policies and\nposition and interest rate risk position, and to discuss and implement interest rate risk strategies.\nThe Company monitors interest rate risk through the use of a simulation model. The quarterly reports developed in the\nsimulation model assist the Company in identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling interest rate risk to ensure\ncompliance within the Company’s policy guidelines. This quantitative analysis measures interest rate risk from both a capital\nand earnings perspective. With regard to earnings, movements in interest rates and the shape of the yield curve significantly\ninfluence the amount of net interest income that is recognized. Movements in market interest rates significantly influence the\nspread between the interest earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our\ninternal interest rate risk analysis calculates the sensitivity of our projected net interest income over a one year period utilizing a\nstatic balance sheet assumption through which incoming and outgoing asset and liability cash flows are reinvested into similar\ninstruments. Product pricing and earning asset prepayment speeds are adjusted for each rate scenario.\nWith regard to capital, our internal interest rate risk analysis calculates the sensitivity of our economic value of equity\n(“EVE”) ratio to movements in interest rates. EVE represents the present value of the expected cash flows from our assets less\n97\nthe present value of the expected cash flows arising from our liabilities. EVE attempts to quantify our economic value using a\ndiscounted cash flow methodology while the EVE ratio reflects that value as a form of capital ratio. The degree to which the\nEVE ratio changes for any hypothetical interest rate scenario from its base case measurement is a reflection of an institution’s\nsensitivity to interest rate risk.\nFor both net interset income and capital at risk, our interest rate risk analysis calculates a base case scenario that assumes\nno change in interest rates. The model then measures changes throughout a series of interest rate scenarios representing\nimmediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve up and down 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points with additional\nscenarios modeled where appropriate. The model requires that interest rates remain positive for all points along the yield curve\nfor each rate scenario which may preclude the modeling of certain falling rate scenarios during periods of lower market interest\nrates.\nThe table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2023, the estimated changes in EVE and net interest income at risk that\nwould result from the designated instantaneous changes in market interest rates. Computations of prospective effects of\nhypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, loan\nprepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.\nEVE as a Percent of\nEVE Portfolio Value of Assets Net Interest Income at Risk\nChange in Interest Rates Dollar Dollar Percent NPV Basis Point Dollar Dollar Percent\nin Basis Points Amount Change Change Ratio Change Amount Change Change\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n+400 $ 146,021 $ (39,715) (21.4) % 11.69 % (179) $ 52,306 $ 2,974 6.0 %\n+300 154,756 (30,980) (16.7) 12.11 (137) 51,501 2,169 4.4\n+200 165,195 (20,541) (11.1) 12.61 (87) 50,788 1,456 3.0\n+100 175,901 (9,835) (5.3) 13.09 (39) 50,093 761 1.5\nFlat 185,736 — — 13.48 — 49,332 — —\n-100 193,970 8,234 4.4 13.71 23 47,854 (1,478) (3.0)\n-200 198,490 12,754 6.9 13.69 21 46,039 (3,293) (6.7)\n-300 198,613 12,877 6.9 13.38 (10) 44,067 (5,265) (10.7)\n-400 193,490 7,754 4.2 12.76 (72) 42,267 (7,065) (14.3)\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes\nin EVE and net interest income require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual\nyields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the table presented assumes that the composition of\nthe Company’s interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period\nbeing measured, and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of\nthe duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the table provides an indication of the\nCompany’s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a\nprecise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on EVE and net interest income and will differ from actual\nresults. EVE calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, changes in market interest\nrates can increase the fair values of the Company’s loans, deposits and borrowings.\nITEM 8.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND\nFINANCIAL DISCLOSURES\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023. The term “disclosure controls and\nprocedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n“Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be\n98\ndisclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and\nreported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without\nlimitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that\nit files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its\nprincipal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost\nbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nBased upon their evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of\nthe period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective for the purpose of ensuring that the\ninformation required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act with the SEC\n(1)is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (2) is\naccumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as\nappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n(b) Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. The internal control process has been designed under our supervision to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for external reporting\npurposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nManagement conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023, utilizing the framework established in the 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on management’s assessment, the\nCompany concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023, based\non that framework.\n(c) Changes to Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or\n15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected,\nor are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, none of the Company's directors or executive officers adopted or\nterminated any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of the Company's securities that was intended to\nsatisfy the affirmative defense conditions of SEC rule 10b5-1(c) or any \"non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement\" (as such term is\ndefined in Item 408 of SEC Regulation S-K.\nITEM 9C.

(Company) as\nof December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in\nstockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related notes (collectively\nreferred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,\nin all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2023, the entity changed its method of\naccounting for credit losses on financial instruments due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326:\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s financial statements based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due\nto error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that\nwere communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that\nare material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and\nwe are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAllowance for Credit Losses (ACL) – Qualitative Adjustments\nAs described in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements and referred to in the change in accounting principle\nexplanatory paragraph above, the Company adopted ASC 326 as of January 1, 2023, which among other things, required the\nCompany to recognize expected credit losses over the contractual lives of financial assets carried at amortized costs, including\nloans receivables, utilizing the Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) methodology. As of December 31, 2023, the\nallowance for credit losses (ACL) balance was $9,707,000. Estimates of expected credit losses are based on relevant\ninformation about current conditions, past events, and reasonable and supportable forward-looking forecasts regarding\ncollectability of the reported amounts. The Company utilized a discounted cash-flow model derived from historical data to\nconstruct a loss rate for each identified loan segment. Due to the Company's loss history not being sufficient and relevant\n104\nenough to predict future losses, the Company also utilized peer data from a peer group. The loss rates are then adjusted, for\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of relevant economic indicators as well as other environmental factors based on the risks\npresent for each portfolio segment. The environmental factors (“qualitative adjustments”) include consideration of economic\nconditions and portfolio trends.\nWe have identified auditing the qualitative adjustments as a critical audit matter as management’s determination of the\nqualitative adjustments used in the ACL is subjective and involves significant management judgments; and our audit procedures\nrelated to the qualitative adjustments involved a high degree of auditor judgment and required significant audit effort, including\nthe need to involve more experienced audit personnel.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n• Substantively testing management's determination of the qualitative adjustments used in the ACL estimate, including:\n◦ Testing management’s process for developing the qualitative adjustments, which included assessing the\nrelevance and reliability of data used to develop the qualitative adjustments, including evaluating their\njudgments and assumptions for reasonableness. Among other procedures, our evaluation considered evidence\nfrom internal and external sources.\n◦ Analytically evaluating the qualitative adjustments for directional consistency, testing for reasonableness, and\nobtaining evidence for significant changes.\n◦ Testing the mathematical accuracy of the qualitative adjustments applied to the loan segments in the ACL\ncalculation.\nFORVIS, LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nMarch 13, 2024\n105\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nDecember 31, 2023 2022\n(Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share and Share Data)\nASSETS\nCash and Due From Banks:\nInterest-Earning $ 62,442 $ 82,957\nNoninterest-Earning 5,781 20,743\nTotal Cash and Due From Banks 68,223 103,700\nSecurities:\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities, at Fair Value 204,507 187,360\nEquity Securities, at Fair Value 2,588 2,698\nTotal Securities 207,095 190,058\nLoans (Net of Allowance for Credit Losses of $9,707 and $12,819 at December 31, 2023\nand 2022, Respectively) 1,100,689 1,037,054\nPremises and Equipment, Net 19,704 17,844\nBank-Owned Life Insurance 25,378 25,893\nGoodwill 9,732 9,732\nIntangible Assets, Net 958 3,513\nAccrued Interest Receivable and Other Assets 24,312 21,144\nTOTAL ASSETS $ 1,456,091 $ 1,408,938\nLIABILITIES\nDeposits:\nNoninterest-Bearing Demand Accounts $ 277,747 $ 390,405\nInterest-Bearing Demand Accounts 362,994 311,825\nMoney Market Accounts 201,074 209,125\nSavings Accounts 194,703 248,022\nTime Deposits 230,641 109,126\nTotal Deposits 1,267,159 1,268,503\nShort-Term Borrowings — 8,060\nOther Borrowed Funds 34,678 14,638\nAccrued Interest Payable and Other Liabilities 14,420 7,582\nTOTAL LIABILITIES 1,316,257 1,298,783\nSTOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nPreferred Stock, No Par Value; 5,000,000 Shares Authorized — —\nCommon Stock, $0.4167 Par Value; 35,000,000 Shares Authorized, 5,759,378 and\n5,708,433 Shares Issued and 5,119,543 and 5,100,189 Shares Outstanding, Respectively 2,400 2,379\nCapital Surplus 85,334 83,953\nRetained Earnings 83,392 63,861\nTreasury Stock, at Cost (639,835 and 608,244 Shares, Respectively) (14,545) (13,797)\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (16,747) (26,241)\nTOTAL STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY 139,834 110,155\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY $ 1,456,091 $ 1,408,938\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements\n106\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 2022\n(Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share and Share Data)\nINTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME\nLoans, Including Fees $ 54,650 $ 41,933\nSecurities:\nTaxable 4,017 3,852\nTax-Exempt 157 213\nDividends 106 91\nOther Interest and Dividend Income 3,295 1,627\nTOTAL INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME 62,225 47,716\nINTEREST EXPENSE\nDeposits 16,433 4,025\nShort-Term Borrowings 32 63\nOther Borrowings 1,207 693\nTOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE 17,672 4,781\nNET INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME 44,553 42,935\n(Recovery) Provision For Credit Losses -

(“Exchange\nUnderwriters” or “EU”). CB Financial Services, Inc., Community Bank and Exchange Underwriters, Inc. are collectively\nreferred to as the “Company.” All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nNature of Operations\nThe Company derives substantially all its income from banking and bank-related services which include interest income on\ncommercial, commercial mortgage, residential real estate and consumer loan financing, as well as interest and dividend income\non securities, insurance commissions, and fees generated from deposit services to its customers. The Company provides\nbanking services through its subsidiary, Community Bank, a Pennsylvania-chartered commercial bank headquartered in\nCarmichaels, Pennsylvania. The Bank is a community-oriented institution offering residential and commercial real estate loans,\ncommercial and industrial loans, and consumer loans as well as a variety of deposit products for individuals and businesses in\nits market area. The Bank operates from 10 offices in Greene, Allegheny, Washington, Fayette and Westmoreland Counties in\nsouthwestern Pennsylvania and three offices in Marshall and Ohio Counties in West Virginia.\nOn December 1, 2023, the Company announced that the Bank and EU entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with World\nInsurance Associates, LLC (\"World\") pursuant to which EU sold substantially all of its assets to World for a purchase price of\n$30.5 million cash plus possible additional earn-out payments. The sale of assets was completed on December 8, 2023 and\nresulted in a pre-tax gain of $24.6 million. This transaction did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations reporting.\nThe Company has evaluated events and transactions occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date of December 31, 2023\nthrough the date the consolidated financial statements are being issued for items that should potentially be recognized or\ndisclosed in these consolidated financial statements.\nUse of Estimates\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and with general practice within the banking industry. In preparing\nthe financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities as of the date of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, and income and expenses for the period.\nActual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant\nchange in the near term relate to fair value of securities available for sale, determination of the allowance for credit losses, the\nvaluation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans, impairment evaluations of securities,\nthe valuation of deferred tax assets and the evaluation of goodwill and core deposit intangible impairment.\nRevenue Recognition\nIncome on loans and securities is recognized as earned on the accrual method. Gains and losses on sales of mortgages are based\non the difference between the selling price and the carrying value of the related mortgage sold.\nThe Company generally fully satisfies its performance obligations on its contracts with customers as services are rendered and\nthe transaction prices are typically fixed; charged either on a periodic basis or based on activity. Because performance\nobligations are satisfied as services are rendered and the transaction prices are fixed, there is little judgment involved in\napplying Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606 that significantly affects the determination of the amount and\ntiming of revenue from contracts with customers.\nThe Company’s revenue from contracts with customers within the scope of ASC Topic 606 is recognized within Noninterest\nIncome with the exception of Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) Income, which is accounted for in Noninterest Expense. The\nfollowing narrative describes the Company’s revenue streams accounted for under the guidance of ASC Topic 606:\nService Fees: The Company earns fees from its deposit customers for transaction-based, account maintenance, and\noverdraft services. Transaction-based fees include services fees for ATM usage, stop payment charges, statement\nproduction, ACH and wire transfers, which are recognized into income at the occurrence of an executed transaction and the\npoint in time the Company fulfills the customer’s request. Account maintenance fees, which are primarily based on\nmonthly maintenance activities, are earned over the course of the month, and satisfy the Company’s performance\nobligation. Overdraft fees are recognized as the overdrafts on customer’s accounts are incurred. The services fees are\nautomatically withdrawn from the customer’s account balance per their account agreement with the Company. In addition,\nthe Company earns interchange fees from debit/credit cardholder transactions conducted through the applicable payment\n112\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nnetworks. Interchange fees from cardholder transactions represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are\nrecognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing services provided to the cardholder. The Company currently\ndoes not offer a cardholder rewards program.\nInsurance Commissions: EU derived commission and fee income from direct and agency bill insurance policies. Direct bill\npolicies were invoiced directly from the insurance company provider to the customer. Once the customer remitted payment\nfor the policy, the insurance company provider then remitted the commission or fee income to EU on a monthly basis.\nAgency bill policies were invoiced from EU, the insurance underwriting agency, to the customer. EU recorded the\ninsurance company policy payable and the commission or fee income earned on the policy. As all insurance policies were\ncontracts with customers, each policy had different terms and conditions.\nEU utilized a report from their core insurance data processing program that captured all in-force policies that were active in\nthe system and annualized the commission over the life of each individual contract. The report provided an overall\ncommission and fee income total for the monthly reporting financial statement period. This income was then compared to\nthe amount of direct and agency bill income recorded in the core insurance data processing system for the reporting month\nand an adjustment to income was made according to the report. This was the income recognized for the portion of the\ninsurance contract that had been earned by EU and subsequently the Company.\nOther Commissions: The Company earns other commissions, such as wealth management referral fees, check sales and\nsafe deposit box rentals to customers. The wealth management referral fees are earned as a referral when a bank customer\ninitiates a customer relationship with an associated wealth management firm. These fees fulfill the contract/agreement\nbetween the Company and the wealth management firm. Check sales are recognized as customers contact the Company for\ncheck supplies or the customer initiates the check order through the Company website to our third-party check company.\nThese commissions are recognized as the third-party check company satisfies the contract of providing check stock to our\ncustomers. Safe deposit box rental income is recognized on a monthly basis, per each contract agreement with our\ncustomers. The safe deposit box income is automatically withdrawn from the customer’s deposit account on a monthly\nbasis as this revenue is earned by the contract.\nGains (Losses) on Sales of OREO: The Company records a gain or loss from the sale of OREO when control of the\nproperty transfers to the buyer, which generally occurs at the time of an executed deed. It is not common policy that the\nCompany will finance an OREO property with the buyer. It is the Company’s practice to sell loan collateral recognized as\nan OREO property to free the Company of any additional loss exposure.\nOperating Segments\nAn operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise that engages in business activities which generate revenue and\nincur expense, and the operating results of which are reviewed by management. At December 31, 2023, the Company’s\nbusiness activities are comprised of two operating segments, which are community banking and insurance brokerage services.\nThe Company has evaluated the provisions of ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, and determined that segment reporting\ninformation related to EU (Insurance Brokerage Services segment) is required to be presented because the segment had adopted\na board of directors that conducted board meetings independent from the Company. In addition, the segment comprised a\nsignificant amount to total noninterest income, even though the segment is less than 10% of the combined assets of the\nCompany. See Note 19 – Segment Reporting and Related Information for more information.\nCash and Due From Banks\nThe Company has defined cash and due from banks as cash on hand and those amounts due from depository institutions,\ninterest-bearing deposits with other banks with original maturities of less than 90 days, and federal funds sold. The Company\nmaintains cash deposits in other depository institutions that occasionally exceed the amount of deposit insurance available.\nManagement periodically assesses the financial condition of these institutions and believes that the risk of any possible credit\nloss is minimal.\nGenerally, the Company is required to maintain average reserve balances in vault cash with the Federal Reserve Bank based\nupon outstanding balances of deposit transaction accounts. However, as announced on March 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve\nBoard reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent, effective March 26, 2020, in light of the shift to an ample reserves\nregime. This action eliminates the need to maintain balances in accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank to satisfy reserve\nrequirements, thereby freeing up liquidity in the banking system to support lending. Therefore, at December 31, 2023, and\n2022, there were no reserve requirements with the Federal Reserve Bank.\nSecurities\nSecurities are classified at the time of purchase, based on management’s intentions and ability, as securities held to maturity or\nsecurities available-for-sale. Debt securities acquired with the intent and the ability to hold to maturity are stated at cost\nadjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, which are computed using a level yield method and recognized\n113\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nas adjustments to interest income. Unrealized holding gains and losses for available-for-sale debt securities are reported as a\nseparate component of stockholders’ equity, net of tax, until realized. Equity securities are measured at fair value with the\nchange in fair value recognized in Net Gain (Loss) on Securities within the noninterest income category in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income. Realized securities gains and losses, if any, are computed using the specific identification method.\nInterest and dividends on securities are recognized as income when earned.\nFor available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more\nlikely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria\nregarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income.\nFor securities available-for-sale that do not meet the above criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has\nresulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is\nless than amortized cost, any changes to the rating by a rating agency, and adverse conditions related to the security, among\nother factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from\nthe security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of the cash flows expected to be\ncollected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit loss (\"ACL\") is recorded for the\ncredit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost. Any impairment that has not been recorded\nthrough an ACL is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The Company elected the practical expedient of\nzero loss estimates for securities issued by U.S. government entities and agencies. These securities are either explicitly or\nimplicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major agencies and have a long history of no credit losses.\nChanges in the ACL are recorded as provision for, or reversal of, credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance\nwhen management believes the uncollectibility of an available for sale security is confirmed or when either of the criteria\nregarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nCommon stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) and of Atlantic Community Bankers’ Bank (“ACBB”) represent\nownership in organizations that are wholly owned by other financial institutions. These restricted equity securities are\naccounted for based on industry guidance in ASC Sub-Topic 325-20, which requires the investment to be carried at cost and\nevaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value. Included in accrued interest receivable and other\nassets are FHLB stock of $3.3 million and $2.7 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and ACBB stock of\n$85,000 at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company periodically evaluates its FHLB restricted stock for possible impairment based on, among other things, the\ncapital adequacy of the FHLB and its overall financial condition. The Company believes its holdings in the stock are ultimately\nrecoverable at par value at December 31, 2023, and, therefore, determined that FHLB stock was not impaired. In addition, the\nCompany has ample liquidity and does not require redemption of its FHLB stock in the foreseeable future.\nLoans Receivables\nThe Company grants commercial, residential, and other consumer loans to customers at its branch locations throughout\nsouthwestern Pennsylvania in Greene, Washington, Allegheny, Fayette and Westmoreland Counties and in the panhandle of\nWest Virginia in Marshall and Ohio Counties. Although the Company had a diversified loan portfolio at December 31, 2023\nand 2022, a substantial portion of its debtors’ ability to honor their contracts is determined by the economic environment of\nthese counties within the tri-state region footprint.\nLoans receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are\nstated at the principal amount outstanding, net of deferred loan fees and the allowance for credit losses. The Company’s loan\nportfolio is segmented to enable management to monitor risk and performance. The real estate loans are further segregated into\nthree classes. Residential mortgages include those secured by residential properties and include home equity loans, while\ncommercial mortgages consist of loans to commercial borrowers secured by commercial real estate. Construction loans\ntypically consist of loans to build commercial buildings and acquire and develop residential real estate. The commercial and\nindustrial segment consists of loans to finance the activities of commercial customers. The consumer segment consists primarily\nof indirect auto loans as well as personal installment loans and personal or overdraft lines of credit. Other loan primarily consist\nof municipal loans to local governments.\nResidential mortgage loans are typically longer-term loans and, therefore, generally present greater interest rate risk than the\nconsumer and commercial loans. Under certain economic conditions, housing values may decline, which may increase the risk\nthat the collateral values are not sufficient. Commercial real estate loans generally present a higher level of risk than loans\nsecured by residences. This greater risk is due to several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of\nloans and borrowers, the effect of general economic conditions on income-producing properties, and the increased difficulty in\nevaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Furthermore, the repayment of commercial real estate loans is typically\ndependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate project. If the cash flow from the project is reduced (for\nexample, if leases are not obtained or renewed, a bankruptcy court modifies a lease term, or a major tenant is unable to fulfill its\nlease obligations), the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Construction loans are originated to individuals to\n114\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfinance the construction of residential dwellings and are also originated for the construction of commercial properties, including\nhotels, apartment buildings, housing developments, and owner-occupied properties used for businesses. Construction loans\ngenerally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is usually 12 to 18 months. At the end\nof the construction phase, the loan generally converts to a permanent residential or commercial mortgage loan. Construction\nloan risks include overfunding in comparison to the plans, untimely completion of work, and leasing and stabilization after\nproject completion. Commercial and industrial loans are generally secured by business assets, inventories, accounts receivable,\netc., which present collateral risk. Consumer loans generally have higher interest rates and shorter terms than residential\nmortgage loans; however, they have additional credit risk due to the type of collateral securing the loan.\nAccrual of interest on loans is generally discontinued when it is determined that a reasonable doubt exists as to the collectability\nof principal and interest or when a loan becomes contractually past due by 90 days or more with respect to principal or interest.\nWhen a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, any accrued but uncollected interest is reversed from current income. Payments\nreceived on nonaccrual loans are applied against principal. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and\ninterest amounts contractually due are brought current, and current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nThe Company uses an eight-point internal risk rating system to monitor the credit quality of the overall loan portfolio. The first\nfour categories are not considered criticized and are aggregated as “pass” rated. The criticized rating categories used by\nmanagement generally follow bank regulatory definitions. The special mention category includes assets that are currently\nprotected but are below average quality, resulting in an undue credit risk, but not to the point of justifying a substandard\nclassification. Loans in the substandard category have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and\nhave a distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the weaknesses are not corrected. Loans classified as doubtful have\nall the weaknesses inherent in loans classified as substandard with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full,\non the basis of current conditions and facts, is highly improbable. Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of\nsuch little value that continuance as an asset is not warranted.\nThe performance and credit quality of the loan portfolio are also monitored by analyzing the age of the loans receivable as\ndetermined by the length of time a recorded payment is past due. The past due status of all classes of loans receivable is\ndetermined based on contractual due dates for loan payments.\nFor performing loans acquired in a merger, the excess of expected cash flows over the estimated fair value, at acquisition, is\nreferred to as the accretable discount and is recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan. The difference\nbetween contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to\nas the nonaccretable discount. The nonaccretable discount represents estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over\nthe life of the loan. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows require an evaluation to determine the need for an\nallowance. Subsequent improvements in expected cash flows result in the reversal of a corresponding amount of the\nnonaccretable discount, which is then reclassified as accretable discount that is recognized into interest income over the\nremaining life of the loan using the interest method. The evaluation of the amount of future cash flows that is expected to be\ncollected is performed in a similar manner as that used to determine our allowance. Charge-offs of the principal amount on\nacquired loans would be first applied to the nonaccretable discount portion of the fair value adjustment.\nLoan origination and commitment fees as well as certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and the net amount either\naccreted or amortized as an adjustment to the related loan’s yield over the contractual lives of the related loans.\nAllowance for Credit Losses (ACL)\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of\nCredit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that\nis referred to as the current expected credit loss methodology (\"CECL\"). The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 using a\nmodified retrospective approach. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2023 are presented under Topic 326,\nwhile prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. The adoption resulted in a\ndecrease of $3.4 million to the Company’s ACL related to loans receivable (ACL - Loans) and an increase of $718,000 in ACL\nfor unfunded commitments (ACL - Unfunded Commitments). The net impact resulted in a $2.1 million increase to retained\nearnings, net of deferred taxes.\nThe ACL represents the estimated amount considered necessary to cover lifetime expected credit losses inherent in financial\nassets at the balance sheet date. The measurement of expected credit losses is applicable to loans receivable and securities\nmeasured at amortized cost. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures such as loan commitments and unused lines of\ncredit. The allowance is established through a provision for credit losses that is charged against income. The methodology for\ndetermining the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management because of the high degree\nof judgment involved, the subjectivity of the assumptions used, and the potential for changes in the forecasted economic\nenvironment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded ACL. The ACL is reported separately as a contra-asset\non the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. The expected credit loss for unfunded loan commitments is reported on\n115\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nthe Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition in other liabilities while the provision for credit losses related to unfunded\ncommitments is reported in provision for credit losses - unfunded commitments in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nACL on Loans Receivable\nThe ACL on loans is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the loan to present the net amount expected to be collected.\nExpected losses are evaluated and calculated on a collective, or pooled, basis for those loans which share similar risk\ncharacteristics. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether loans within a pool continue to exhibit similar risk\ncharacteristics. If the risk characteristics of a loan change, such that they are no longer similar to other loans in the pool, the\nCompany will evaluate the loan with a different pool of loans that share similar risk characteristics. If the loan does not share\nrisk characteristics with other loans, the Company will evaluate the loan on an individual basis. The Company evaluates the\npooling methodology at least annually. Loans are charged off against the ACL when the Company believes the balances to be\nuncollectible. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged\noff.\nThe Company has chosen to segment its portfolio consistent with the manner in which it manages credit risk. Such segments\ninclude residential mortgage, commercial real estate mortgages, construction, commercial business, consumer and other. For\nmost segments, the Company calculates estimated credit losses using a probability of default and loss given default\nmethodology, the results of which are applied to the aggregated discounted cash flow of each individual loan within the\nsegment. The point in time probability of default and loss given default are then conditioned by macroeconomic scenarios to\nincorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.\nThe Company estimates the ACL on loans via a quantitative analysis which considers relevant available information from\ninternal and external sources related to past events and current conditions, as well as the incorporation of reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. The Company evaluates a variety of factors including third party economic forecasts, industry trends and\nother available published economic information in arriving at its forecasts. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period,\nthe Company reverts, on a straight-line basis, to average historical losses. Expected credit losses are estimated over the\ncontractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected\nextensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies: management has a reasonable expectation at the\nreporting date that a restructuring will be executed with an individual borrower or the renewal option is included in the original\nor modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company.\nAlso included in the ACL on loans are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Company’s assessment,\nmay not be adequately represented in the quantitative analysis or the forecasts described above. Factors that the Company\nconsiders include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio\nconcentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, and the effect of external factors such as\ncompetition, legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Furthermore, the Company considers the inherent uncertainty in\nquantitative models that are built upon historical data.\nIndividually Evaluated Loans\nOn a case-by-case basis, the Company may conclude that a loan should be evaluated on an individual basis based on its\ndisparate risk characteristics. When the Company determines that a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with other\nloans in the portfolio, the allowance will be determined on an individual basis using the present value of expected cash flows or,\nfor collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral as of the reporting date, less estimated selling costs, as applicable.\nIf the fair value of the collateral is less than the amortized cost basis of the loan, the Company will charge off the difference\nbetween the fair value of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell at the reporting date, and the amortized cost basis of the loan.\nACL on Off-Balance Sheet Commitments\nThe Company is required to include unfunded commitments that are expected to be funded in the future within the allowance\ncalculation, other than those that are unconditionally cancellable. To arrive at that reserve, the reserve percentage for each\napplicable segment is applied to the unused portion of the expected commitment balance and is multiplied by the expected\nfunding rate. To determine the expected funding rate, the Company uses a historical utilization rate for each segment. As noted\nabove, the ACL on unfunded loan commitments is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial\nCondition and the related credit expense is recorded in provision for credit losses - unfunded commitments in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income.\n116\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the Company calculated the allowance for loan losses (\"allowance\"), using an incurred\nloan loss methodology. The following policy related to the allowance in prior periods.\nThe allowance for loan losses (“allowance”) is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be\nreasonably anticipated. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance based on potential losses\nin the current loan portfolio, which includes an assessment of economic conditions, changes in the nature and volume of the\nloan portfolio, loan loss experience, volume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans as well as other loan\nmodifications, quality of the Company’s loan review system, the degree of oversight by the Company’s Board, existence and\neffect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations, effect of external factors, such as\ncompetition and legal and regulatory requirements, and other relevant factors. While management uses the best information\navailable to make such evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ\nsubstantially from the assumptions used in making evaluations. Additions are made to the allowance through periodic\nprovisions charged to income and recovery of principal and interest on loans previously charged-off. Losses of principal are\ncharged directly to the allowance when a loss occurs or when a determination is made that the specific loss is probable. This\nevaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information\nbecomes available.\nThe allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as\nimpaired. A loan is considered impaired when, based upon current information and events, it is probable that the Company will\nbe unable to collect all amounts due for principal and interest according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement.\nGenerally, management considers all substandard, doubtful, and loss-rated loans, nonaccrual loans, and TDRs for impairment.\nManagement determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into\nconsideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for\nthe delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.\nThe maximum period without payment that typically can occur before a loan is considered for impairment is 90 days.\nImpairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at a loan’s effective interest rate,\nor as a practical expedient, the observable market price, or, if the loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of the underlying\ncollateral. When the measurement of an impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the impairment is\nrecorded in a specific valuation allowance. This specific valuation allowance is periodically adjusted for significant changes in\nthe amount or timing of expected future cash flows, observable market price or fair value of the collateral. The specific\nvaluation allowance, or allowance for impaired loans, is part of the total allowance for loan losses. Cash payments received on\nimpaired loans that are considered nonaccrual are recorded as a direct reduction of the recorded investment in the loan. When\nthe recorded investment has been fully collected, receipts are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until the\npreviously charged-off principal is fully recovered. Subsequent amounts collected are recognized as interest income. If no\ncharge-off exists, then once the recorded investment has been fully collected, any future amounts collected would be recognized\nas interest income. Impaired loans are not returned to accrual status until all amounts due, both principal and interest, are\ncurrent and a sustained payment history has been demonstrated.\nThe general allowance component covers pools of homogeneous loans by loan class. Management determines historical loss\nexperience for each segment of loans using the five-year rolling average of the net charge-off data within each segment.\nQualitative and environmental factors are also considered that are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with the\nBank’s existing portfolio to differ from historical loss experience, and include levels and trends in delinquency and impaired\nloans; levels and trends in net charge-offs, trends in volume and terms of loans; change in underwriting, policies, procedures,\npractices and key personnel; national and local economic trends; industry conditions, and effects of changes in high-risk credit\ncircumstances. The qualitative and environmental factors are reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure they are reflective of\ncurrent conditions in the portfolio and economy. An unallocated component, which is a part of the general allowance\ncomponent, is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect the Company’s estimate of probable losses.\nOur allowance is sensitive to a number of inputs, most notably the qualitative factors and historical loss experience by loan\nsegment. Given the dynamic relationship between the inputs, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one\nindividual variable on the allowance. Although management believes that it uses the best information available to establish the\nallowance, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if\ncircumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Because future events affecting\nborrowers and collateral value cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance is\nadequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of assets deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed\npreviously. Any increase in the allowance may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in\nfactors underlying the assessment could have a material impact on the amount of the allowance that is necessary and the amount\nof provision to be charged against earnings.\n117\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is principally computed on the straight-\nline method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from three to seven years for furniture, fixtures\nand equipment, and 27.5 to 40 years for building premises. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their\nestimated useful lives or their respective lease terms, which range from seven to fifteen years. Expenditures for maintenance\nand repairs are charged to expense when incurred while costs of major additions and improvements are capitalized.\nBank-Owned Life Insurance\nThe Company is the owner and beneficiary of bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) policies on certain employees. The earnings\nfrom the BOLI policies are recognized as a component of noninterest income. The BOLI policies are an asset that can be\nliquidated, if necessary, with associated tax costs. However, the Company intends to hold these policies and, accordingly, the\nCompany has not provided for deferred income taxes on the earnings from the increase in cash surrender value.\nReal Estate Owned\nReal estate owned acquired in settlement of foreclosed loans is carried as a component of Other Assets at the lower of cost or\nfair value, less estimated cost to sell. Prior to foreclosure, the estimated collectible value of the collateral is evaluated to\ndetermine if a partial charge-off of the loan balance is necessary. After transfer to real estate owned, any subsequent write-\ndowns are charged against noninterest expense. Direct costs incurred in the foreclosure process and subsequent holding costs\nincurred on such properties are recorded as expenses of current operations. Real estate owned was $162,000 and $0 at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with income tax accounting guidance in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.\nThe income tax accounting guidance results in two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income\ntax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period by applying the provisions of the enacted tax law to the\ntaxable income or excess of deductions over revenues. The Company determines deferred income taxes using the balance sheet\nmethod. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between book and\ntax basis of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nDeferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets\nand liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount\nexpected to be realized. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently\nmeasured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a\ntaxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The determination of whether a tax position has met the\nmore-likely-than-not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date,\nand is subject to management’s judgment. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of\nevidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nThe Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in noninterest income and penalties in\nnoninterest expense.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Deemed to have an\nindefinite life and not subject to amortization, goodwill is instead tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least\nannually on October 31 or more frequently if triggering events occur or impairment indicators exist. The Company operates two\nreporting units – Community Banking segment and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. The Company has assigned 100%\nof the goodwill to the Community Banking reporting unit.\nIn assessing the impairment, the Company has the the option to perform either a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is\nnecessary to perform the goodwill impairment test, or the Company may elect to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment\ntest. Under the qualitative assessment, the Company assesses the existence of events or circumstances to determine whether it is\nmore-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including, goodwill. If this is more\nlikely than not, the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a\ngoodwill impairment loss to be recognized, if any. The estimated fair value of the community banking reporting unit is\ncompared to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount,\nthe goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired, and no impairment loss is recognized. However, if the carrying\n118\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\namount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the a reporting unit's\ncarrying value over its fair value.\nThe Company did not record any goodwill impairment for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nIntangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of\ncontractual or other legal rights. Intangible assets that have finite lives, such as core deposit intangibles acquired in mergers,\ncustomer relationship intangibles and renewal lists, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and subject to periodic\nimpairment testing at last annually. The amortization expense represents the estimated decline in value of the underlying asset.\nCore deposit intangibles are primarily amortized over 6.5 to 9.3 years on the straight-line method. Customer renewal lists are\namortized over their estimated useful lives of 9.5 years. We monitor other intangibles for impairment and evaluate carrying\namounts, as necessary. Estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets. There were\nno events or changes in circumstances indicating impairment of other intangible assets at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nFuture events could cause us to conclude that goodwill or other intangibles have become impaired, which would result in\nrecording an impairment. Any resulting impairment could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition\nand results of operations. Refer to Note 6—Goodwill and Intangible Assets for additional details.\nMortgage Servicing Rights (“MSRs”)\nThe Company has agreements for the express purpose of selling loans in the secondary market. The Company maintains all\nservicing rights for these loans. MSRs are recognized when commitments are made to fund a loan to be sold and are recorded\nby allocating total costs incurred between the loan and servicing rights based on their relative fair values. MSRs are amortized\nin proportion to sold mortgages that are serviced and are included in Accrued Interest Receivable and Other Assets on the\naccompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nServicing fee income is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on contractual percentage of the\noutstanding principal or a fixed amount per loan and are recorded as income when earned. The amortization of MSRs is netted\nagainst servicing fee income in Other Income within the noninterest income category in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nMSRs are evaluated for impairment based on the estimated fair value of the MSRs. MSRs are stratified by certain risk\ncharacteristics, primarily loan term and note rate. If temporary impairment exists within a risk stratification tranche, a valuation\nallowance is established through a charge to income equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair\nvalue. If it is later determined that all or a portion of the temporary impairment no longer exists for a particular tranche, the\nvaluation allowance is reduced.\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\nThe Company accounts for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives\nand Hedging. All derivatives are evaluated at inception as to whether or not they are hedging or non-hedging activities, and\nappropriate documentation is maintained to support the final determination. The Company recognizes all derivatives as either\nassets or liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and measures those instruments at fair value. For\nderivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged\nrisk are recognized in earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness would be recognized in the income statement line item pertaining to\nthe hedged item. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value of the effective portion of the cash flow\nhedges are reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (\"OCI\"). When the cash flows associated with the hedged items are\nrealized, the gain or loss included in OCI is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nWhen the Company purchases a portion of a commercial loan that has an existing interest rate swap, it enters into a Risk\nPurchase Agreement (\"RPA\") with the counterparty and assumes the credit risk of the loan customer related to the swap. Any\nfee paid to the Company as a result of the RPA is offset by credit risk of the counterparties and is recognized in the income\nstatement. Credit risk on the RPA is determined after considering the risk rating, probability of default and loss given default of\nthe counterparties.\nTreasury Stock\nThe purchase of the Company’s common stock is recorded at cost. At the date of subsequent reissue, the treasury stock account\nis reduced by the cost of such stock on the average cost basis, with any excess proceeds being credited to capital surplus.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) consists of net income and OCI. OCI is comprised of unrealized holding gains or losses and\nreclassification adjustment for gains or losses on sale of available-for-sale debt securities, net of tax.\n119\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Company provides dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is calculated utilizing\nthe reported net income as the numerator and weighted average shares outstanding as the denominator. The computation of\ndiluted earnings per share differs in that the denominator is adjusted for the dilutive effects of any options and convertible\nsecurities. Treasury shares are not deemed outstanding for earnings per share calculations.\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn 2021, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). The purpose of the 2021 Plan\nis to provide officers, employees and directors of the Company and the Bank with additional incentives to promote the growth\nand performance of the Company and to further align their interests with those of the Company’s stockholders through the\nownership of additional common stock of the Company. In addition, the 2021 Plan provides the Company with flexibility to\ncontinue to attract and retain highly qualified officers and directors by offering a competitive compensation program that is\nlinked to the performance of the Company's common stock. The effective date of the 2021 Plan was May 19, 2021, which was\nthe date the 2021 Plan satisfied the applicable stockholder approval requirement. The 2021 Plan will remain in effect as long as\nany awards under it are outstanding; however, no awards may be granted under the 2021 Plan on or after the day immediately\nprior to the ten-year anniversary of the effective date of the 2021 Plan.\nAwards may be granted under the 2021 Plan as incentive and non-statutory stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted\nstock units or any combination thereof, The maximum number of shares of Company common stock that may be delivered to\nparticipants under the 2021 Plan is equal to 500,000 shares of Company common stock (the “Share Limit”). Shares of Company\ncommon stock subject to the Share Limit may be issued pursuant to grants of stock options, restricted stock awards or restricted\nstock units, provided, however that the Share Limit is reduced, on a one-for-one basis, for each share of common stock subject\nto a stock option grant, and on a two and one-half-for-one basis for each share of common stock issued pursuant to restricted\nstock awards or restricted stock unit awards. If any award granted under the 2021 Plan expires, terminates, is canceled or is\nforfeited without being settled or exercised or is settled without the issuance of shares of common stock, shares of Company\ncommon stock subject to such award will be made available for future grant under the 2021 Plan. If any shares are surrendered\nor tendered to pay the exercise price of a stock option, such shares will not again be available for grant under the 2021 Plan. In\naddition, shares of common stock withheld in payment for purposes of satisfying tax withholding obligations with respect to an\naward do not become available for re-issuance under the 2021 Plan. Employees and directors of the Company or its subsidiaries\nare eligible to receive awards under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan, except that non-employees may not be granted incentive\nstock options.\nIn 2015, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”), which has similar\ncharacteristics to the 2021 Plan. The effective date of the 2015 Plan was May 20, 2015. The 2015 Plan shall remain in effect as\nlong as any awards are outstanding, but as a result of the approval of the 2021 Plan, no more awards can be granted under the\n2015 Plan. The 2015 Plan reserved an aggregate number of shares, of which two-thirds of the shares (271,431) could be issued\nas stock options and one-third of the shares (135,715) could be be issued as restricted stock awards or units.\nASC Topic 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation, requires recognizing the compensation cost in the financial statements\nfor stock-based payment transactions. Stock option expense is measured based on the grant date fair value of the stock options\nissued. The per share fair value of stock options granted is calculated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model,\nusing assumptions for expected life, expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and an expected volatility. The Company\nuses the simplified method to determine the expected term because it does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide\na reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. The stock option exercise price is equal to the market value on the\ndate of grant. Restricted stock award expense is measured based on the market price of the Company’s common stock at the\ndate of the grant. Unrecognized compensation expense is recognized ratably over the remaining service period, generally\ndefined as the vesting period, for all nonvested restricted stock awards and stock options. Restricted stock awards and stock\noptions are typically granted with a five year vesting period at a vesting rate of 20% per year. The contractual life of stock\noptions is typically 10 years from the date of grant.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company routinely performs assessments of the recoverability of long-lived assets when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable and are in excess of their fair value, less estimated\ncosts to sell. If estimated recoverable amounts are lower than carrying values, assets are considered impaired and reduced to fair\nvalue with the recognized impairment charges recorded in noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n120\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nLong-lived assets are tested for impairment individually or as part of an asset group. An asset group is the unit of accounting for\nlong-lived assets to be held and used, which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely\nindependent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities.\nThe Company follows ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, which requires three steps to identify, recognize and measure\nthe impairment of a long-lived asset (asset group) to be held and used:\nStep 1 – Consider whether Indicators of Impairment are Present.\nThe following are examples of such events or changes in circumstances.\n• A significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset (asset group).\n• A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset (asset group) is being used or in\nits physical condition.\n• A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived\nasset (asset group), including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator.\n• An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or\nconstruction of a long-lived asset (asset group).\n• A current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a\nprojection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset (asset\ngroup).\n• A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset (asset group) will be sold or otherwise disposed\nof significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The term more likely than not refers to a\nlevel of likelihood that is more than 50 percent.\nStep 2—Test for Recoverability\nIf indicators of impairment are present, the Company performs a recoverability test comparing the sum of the estimated\nundiscounted cash flows attributable to the long-lived asset or asset group in question to the carrying amount of the long-\nlived asset or asset group.\nStep 3—Measurement of an Impairment Loss\nIf the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the carrying amount of the long-lived asset (asset\ngroup), the Company estimates the fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group and recognizes an impairment loss when\nthe carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value.\nAn impairment loss is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of\nthose assets, except that the loss allocated to an individual long-lived asset of the group must not reduce the carrying amount of\nthat asset below its fair value whenever the fair value is determinable without undue cost and effort. ASC 360 prohibits the\nsubsequent reversal of an impairment loss for an asset held and used.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nIn December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic\n848 that extends the period of time preparers can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance. In March 2020, the FASB\nissued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial\nReporting, as amended. This ASU provides temporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for\nreference rate reform. The new guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract\nmodifications and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference the London Inter-bank Offered Rate\n(“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The elective guidance in the ASU applies to modifications of\ncontract terms that will directly replace, or have the potential to replace, an affected rate with another interest rate index, as well\nas certain contemporaneous modifications of other contract terms related to the replacement of an affected rate. The ASU notes\nthat changes in contract terms that are made to effect the reference rate reform transition are considered related to the\nreplacement of a reference rate if they are not the result of a business decision that is separate from or in addition to changes to\nthe terms of a contract to effect that transition. The optional expedient allows companies to account for the modification as if it\nwas not substantial (i.e., do not treat as an extinguishment of debt). To ensure the relief in Topic 848 covers the period of time\nduring which a significant number of modifications may take place, ASU 2022-06 defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from\nDecember 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848. For\nall entities, the amendments in ASU 2022-06 are effective upon issuance. As of December 31, 2023, the Company does not\nhave any instruments tied to the LIBOR reference rate. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect\non the Company's consolidated statements of financial statements and results of operations.\n121\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures. This ASU enhances disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments (1) require that a public\nentity disclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating\ndecision maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of profit or loss, (2) require that a public entity disclose, on\nan annual and interim basis, an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition, (3)\nrequire that a public entity provide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment's profit or loss currently required by\nGAAP in interim period as well, (4) clarify that if the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment's profit or loss in\nassessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, an entity may report one or more of those additional\nmeasures of segment profit, (5) require that a public entity disclose the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of\nhow the CODM uses the reported measure of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to\nallocate resources and (6) require that a public entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by\nthe amendments in the ASU and all existing segment disclosures. This ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 31, 2024. The Company does not expect the adoption of the ASU to have a material effect on the\nCompany's consolidated statements of financial statements and results of operations.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This\nASU requires that public entities on an annual basis (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide\nadditional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. The ASU requires all entities to disclose on an\nannual basis (1) the amount of income taxes paid, disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes and (2) the amount of\nincome taxes paid disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid is equal or greater than five percent of\ntotal income taxes paid. The ASU also requires that all entities disclose (1) income (loss) from continuing operations before\nincome tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic or foreign and (2) income tax expense (or benefit) from\ncontinuing operations disaggregated by federal (national), state and foreign. This ASU is effective for public entities for annual\nperiod beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company does not expect the adoption of the ASU to have a material effect on\nthe Company's consolidated statements of financial statements and results of operations.\nNOTE 2—EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThere are no convertible securities, which would affect the numerator in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share;\ntherefore, net income as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Income is used as the numerator.\nThe following table sets forth the composition of the weighted-average common shares (denominator) used in the basic and\ndiluted earnings per share computation.\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 2022\n(Dollars in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data)\nNet Income $ 22,550 $ 11,247\nWeighted-Average Basic Common Shares Outstanding 5,113,978 5,136,670\nDilutive Effect of Common Stock Equivalents (Stock Options and Restricted Stock) 8,938 12,642\nWeighted-Average Diluted Common Shares and Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding 5,122,916 5,149,312\nEarnings Per Share:\nBasic $ 4.41 $ 2.19\nDiluted 4.40 2.18\nThe dilutive effect on weighted average diluted common shares outstanding is the result of outstanding stock options and\nnonvested restricted stock.

The unrealized losses on securities at December 31, 2023 and 2022 relate principally to\nchanges in market interest rates subsequent to the acquisition of the specific securities.

The Company sold $69.3 million in market\nvalue of its lower-yielding U.S government agency, mortgage-backed and municipal securities with an average yield of 1.89%\nand purchased $69.3 million of higher-yielding mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligation securities with an\naverage yield of 5.49%. In 2022, there were no gross realized gains or losses on the sale of debt securities.\nNOTE 4—LOANS AND RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe Company’s loan portfolio is segmented to enable management to monitor risk and performance. Real estate loans are\nfurther segregated into three classes. Residential mortgages include those secured by residential properties and include home\nequity loans, while commercial mortgages consist of loans to commercial borrowers secured by commercial real estate.\nConstruction loans typically consist of loans to build commercial buildings and acquire and develop residential real estate. The\ncommercial and industrial segment consists of loans to finance the activities of commercial customers. The consumer segment\nconsists primarily of indirect auto loans as well as personal installment loans and personal or overdraft lines of credit.\nResidential mortgage loans are typically longer-term loans and, therefore, generally present greater interest rate risk than the\nconsumer and commercial loans. Under certain economic conditions, housing values may decline, which may increase the risk\nthat the collateral values are not sufficient.\nCommercial real estate loans generally present a higher level of credit risk than loans secured by residences. This greater risk is\ndue to several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effect of general\neconomic conditions on income-producing properties, and the increased difficulty in evaluating and monitoring these types of\nloans. Furthermore, the repayment of commercial real estate loans is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the\nrelated real estate project. If the cash flow from the project is reduced (for example, if leases are not obtained or renewed, a\nbankruptcy court modifies a lease term, or a major tenant is unable to fulfill its lease obligations), the borrower’s ability to\nrepay the loan may be impaired.\n125\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nConstruction loans are originated to individuals to finance the construction of residential dwellings and are also originated for\nthe construction of commercial properties, including hotels, apartment buildings, housing developments, and owner-occupied\nproperties used for businesses. Construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction\nphase, which is usually 12 to 18 months. At the end of the construction phase, the loan generally converts to a permanent\nresidential or commercial mortgage loan. Construction loan risks include overfunding in comparison to the plans, untimely\ncompletion of work, and leasing and stabilization after project completion.\nCommercial and industrial loans are generally secured by inventories, accounts receivable, and other business assets, which\npresent collateral risk.\nConsumer loans generally have higher interest rates and shorter terms than residential mortgage loans; however, they have\nadditional credit risk due to the type of collateral securing the loan.\nThe following table summarizes the major classifications of loans as of the dates indicated:\nDecember 31, 2023 2022\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nReal Estate:\nResidential $ 347,808 $ 330,725\nCommercial 467,154 436,805\nConstruction 43,116 44,923\nCommercial and Industrial 111,278 70,044\nConsumer 111,643 146,927\nOther 29,397 20,449\nTotal Loans $ 1,110,396 $ 1,049,873\nAllowance for Credit Losses (9,707) (12,819)\nLoans, Net $ 1,100,689 $ 1,037,054\nTotal unamortized net deferred loan fees were $1.0 million and $1.2 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively.\nThe Company uses an eight-point internal risk rating system to monitor the credit quality of the overall loan portfolio. The first\nfour categories are not considered criticized and are aggregated as “pass” rated. The criticized rating categories used by\nmanagement generally follow bank regulatory definitions. The special mention category includes assets that are currently\nprotected but are below average quality, resulting in an undue credit risk, but not to the point of justifying a substandard\nclassification. Loans in the substandard category have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and\nhave a distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the weaknesses are not corrected. Loans classified as doubtful have\nall the weaknesses inherent in loans classified as substandard with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full,\non the basis of current conditions and facts, is highly improbable. Loans classified as Loss are considered uncollectible and of\nsuch little value that continuance as an asset is not warranted.\nThe following table presents the Company's loans by year of origination, loan segmentation and risk indicator summarized by\nthe aggregate Pass and the criticized categories of Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful within the internal risk rating\nsystem as of December 31, 2023.

2016-13, ASU 2022-02 was adopted and eliminates the troubled debt restructurings\n(\"TDR\") recognition and measurement. With the elimination of TDRs, ASU 2022-02 requires that all modifications and\nrefinancing, including those with borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty are subject to the modification guidance in\nASC 310-20. Loan modifications could meet the definition of a new loan if certain terms of the loan are modified to the benefit\nof the lender and the modification to the terms of the loan are more than minor. Both of these criteria have to be met to define\nthe modification as a new loan. If a loan modification meets the criteria of new loan, then the new loan should include the\nremaining net investment in the original loan, additional funds advanced, fees received, and direct loan origination costs with\nthe refinancing or restructuring. Additionally, the effective interest rate should be recalculated based on the amortized cost basis\nof the new loan and reassess contractual cash flow.

Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess\nof the amount recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The contract amounts of those instruments\nreflect the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments.\nThe Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for\ncommitments to extend credit and standby and performance letters of credit written is represented by the contractual amount of\nthose instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does\nfor on-balance-sheet instruments.\nCommitments and conditional obligations are evaluated the same as on-balance-sheet instruments but do not have a\ncorresponding reserve recorded. The Company’s opinion on not implementing a corresponding reserve for off-balance-sheet\ninstruments is supported by historical factors of no losses recorded due to these items. The Company is continually evaluating\nthese items for credit quality and any future need for the corresponding reserve.\nThe unused and available credit balances of financial instruments whose contracts represent credit risk are as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 2022\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nStandby Letters of Credit $ 110 $ 110\nPerformance Letters of Credit 895 1,064\nConstruction Mortgages 47,034 45,722\nPersonal Lines of Credit 7,185 6,824\nOverdraft Protection Lines 2,025 5,241\nHome Equity Lines of Credit 24,176 22,784\nCommercial Lines of Credit 64,667 74,921\nTotal $ 146,092 $ 156,666\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established\nin the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a\nfee. Because many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not\nnecessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case\nbasis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on\nmanagement’s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory,\nproperty, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.\nPerformance letters of credit represent conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a\ncustomer to a third party. These instruments are issued primarily to support bid or performance-related contracts. The coverage\n140\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nperiod for these instruments is typically a one-year period with an annual renewal option subject to prior approval by\nmanagement. Fees earned from the issuance of these letters are recognized upon expiration of the letter. For secured letters of\ncredit, the collateral is typically Company deposit instruments or customer business assets. The Company recorded no liability\nassociated with standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nNOTE 13—STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND REGULATORY CAPITAL\nIn June 2021, the Company authorized a program to repurchase up to $7.5 million of its outstanding shares of common stock.\nUnder the program, repurchases may be transacted in the open-market or in negotiated private transactions and are conducted\npursuant to a trading plan adopted in accordance with limitations set forth in Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission. The Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Company to repurchase its shares during periods when it would\nnormally not be active in the market due to its internal trading blackout period. Repurchases are made at management’s\ndiscretion at prices management considers to be attractive and in the best interests of both the Company and its stockholders,\nsubject to various factors, including but not limited to, the availability of stock, general market conditions, the trading price of\nthe stock, alternative uses for capital, and the Company’s financial performance. On February 15, 2022, the Company\ncompleted this stock repurchase program. In connection with the program, the Company repurchased a total of 308,996 shares\nof the Company’s common stock at an average price of $24.27 per share.\nIn April 2022, the Company authorized a new repurchase program of $10.0 million of its outstanding shares of common stock.\nThe program expired on May 1, 2023. In connection with the program, the Company repurchased a total of 74,656 shares of the\nCompany's common stock at an average price of $22.38 per share.\nOn January 31, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per outstanding share of common\nstock, which was paid on February 29, 2024.\nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet\nminimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if\nundertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy\nguidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, each must meet specific capital guidelines that involve\nquantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting\npractices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components,\nrisk weightings and other factors.\nUnder the Regulatory Capital Rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and\ncertain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer\ncomprised of common equity Tier I capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in an amount greater than 2.5%\nof total risk-weighted assets.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Bank was considered \"well capitalized\" under the regulatory framework for prompt\ncorrective action.\n141\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents the Bank’s regulatory capital amounts and ratios, as well as the minimum amounts and ratios\nrequired to be well capitalized at the dates indicated.\n2023 2022\nDecember 31, Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)\nActual $ 143,654 13.64 % $ 121,188 12.33 %\nFor Capital Adequacy Purposes 47,385 4.50 44,221 4.50\nTo Be Well Capitalized 68,445 6.50 63,875 6.50\nTier I Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)\nActual 143,654 13.64 121,188 12.33\nFor Capital Adequacy Purposes 63,180 6.00 58,961 6.00\nTo Be Well Capitalized 84,240 8.00 78,615 8.00\nTotal Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)\nActual 153,861 14.61 133,478 13.58\nFor Capital Adequacy Purposes 84,240 8.00 78,615 8.00\nTo Be Well Capitalized 105,300 10.00 98,269 10.00\nTier I Leverage Capital (to Adjusted Total Assets)\nActual 143,654 10.19 121,188 8.66\nFor Capital Adequacy Purposes 56,385 4.00 55,969 4.00\nTo Be Well Capitalized 70,481 5.00 69,962 5.00\nNOTE 14—OPERATING LEASES\nThe Company evaluates all contracts at commencement to determine if a lease is present. In accordance with ASC Topic 842,\nleases are defined as either operating or finance leases. The Company's lease contracts are classified as operating leases and\ncreate operating ROU assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The\nleases are primarily ROU assets of land and building for branch and loan production locations.

The risk participation agreements provide credit protection to the financial institution\nshould the borrower fail to perform on its interest rate derivative contract with the financial institution.\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\nIn October 2023, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract that is designated as a fair value hedge to mitigate the\nrisk of interest rate increases and the subsequent impact on the associated fixed rate mortgages. This contract matures on\nOctober 17, 2026, has a notional amount of $75.0 million and is benchmarked to SOFR. The Company expects the hedge to\nremain effective during the remaining term of the swap.\nThe following table depicts the credit value and fair value adjustments recorded related to the notional amount of derivatives\noutstanding and risk participation agreements with other financial institutions. These adjustments are included in Accrued\nInterest and Other Liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.\n143\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nDerivatives not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nRisk Participation Agreements:\nCredit Value Adjustment $ (94) $ —\nNotional Amount 9,119 —\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\nInterest rate swaps:\nFair Value Adjustment (1,777) —\nNotional Amount 75,000 —\nNOTE 17—FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURE\nASC Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurement” defines fair value and provides the framework for measuring fair value and required\ndisclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal or most advantageous market for the\nasset or liability at the transaction date. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in valuation\nmethods to determine fair value.\nThe three levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows:\nLevel 1 - Fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible to the Company for\nidentical assets. These generally provide the most reliable evidence and are used to measure fair value whenever\navailable.\nLevel 2 - Fair value is based on significant inputs, other than Level 1 inputs, that are observable either directly or\nindirectly for substantially the full term of the asset through corroboration with observable market data. Level 2\ninputs include quoted market prices in active markets for similar assets, quoted market prices in markets that are\nnot active for identical or similar assets, and other observable inputs.\nLevel 3 - Fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs. Examples of valuation methodologies that would result\nin Level 3 classification include option pricing models, discounted cash flows, and other similar techniques.\nThis hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the\nfair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe majority of the Company’s securities are included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair values for Level 2 securities\nwere primarily determined by a third-party pricing service using both quoted prices for similar assets, when available, and\nmodel-based valuation techniques that derive fair value based on market-corroborated data, such as instruments with similar\nprepayment speeds and default interest rates. The standard inputs that are normally used include benchmark yields of like\nsecurities, reportable trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and\nreference data. including market research publications.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and risk participation agreements, and the fair value of\nsuch instruments are calculated using accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected\ncash flows of each derivative, considering the contractual terms of each derivative, and uses observable market-based inputs,\nsuch as interest rate curves and implied volatilities. Credit valuation adjustments are incorporated to appropriately reflect\nnonperformance risk and the respective counterparties' nonperformance risk in calculating fair value measurements. These\ninstruments are clasified as Level 2.\nThere were no transfers from Level 1 to Level 2 and no transfers into or out of Level 3 during the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table presents the financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and reported on the Consolidated\nStatements of Financial Condition as of the dates indicated, by level within the fair value hierarchy.\n144\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFair Value\nDecember 31, Hierarchy 2023 2022\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nASSETS\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities:\nU.S. Government Agencies Level 2 $ 3,949 $ 44,634\nObligations of States and Political Subdivisions Level 2 3,373 13,342\nMortgage-Backed Securities - Government-Sponsored Enterprises Level 2 54,532 41,427\nCollateralized Mortgage Obligations - Government-Sponsored Enterprises Level 2 105,130 79,642\nCollateralized Loan Obligations Level 2 29,804 —\nCorporate Debt Level 2 7,719 8,315\nTotal Available-for-Sale Debt Securities 204,507 187,360\nEquity Securities:\nMutual Funds Level 1 888 875\nOther Level 1 1,700 1,823\nTotal Equity Securities 2,588 2,698\nTotal Securities $ 207,095 $ 190,058\nTotal Assets $ 207,095 $ 190,058\nLIABILITIES\nDerivative Financial Liabilities\nInterest Rate Swaps Level 2 $ 1,777 $ —\nRisk Participation Agreements Level 2 94 —\nTotal Liabilities $ 1,871 $ —\nThe following table presents the financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on the Consolidated Statements\nof Financial Condition as of the dates indicated by level within the fair value hierarchy. The table also presents the significant\nunobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements. Impaired loans that are collateral dependent are written down to fair\nvalue through the establishment of specific reserves. Techniques used to value the collateral that secure the impaired loans\ninclude quoted market prices for identical assets classified as Level 1 inputs or observable inputs, employed by certified\nappraisers, for similar assets classified as Level 2 inputs. In cases where valuation techniques included inputs that are\nunobservable and are based on estimates and assumptions developed by management based on the best information available\nunder each circumstance, the asset valuation is classified as Level 3 inputs.\nFair Significant\nValue December 31, Valuation Unobservable Weighted\nFinancial Asset Hierarchy 2023 Technique Inputs Range Average\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nOREO Level 3 — Appraisal of Liquidation 100% to 100% 100.0%\nCollateral (1) Expenses (2)\nFair Significant\nValue December 31, Valuation Unobservable Weighted\nFinancial Asset Hierarchy 2022 Technique Inputs Range Average\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nImpaired Loans Individually Assessed Level 3 $ 1,591 Appraisal of Appraisal 0% to 8% 7.2%\nCollateral (1) Adjustments (2)\n(1) Fair value is generally determined through independent appraisals of the underlying collateral, which may include various Level 3\ninputs, which are not identifiable.\n(2) Appraisals may be adjusted by management for qualitative factors such as economic conditions and estimated liquidation expenses. The\nrange and weighted average of appraisal adjustments and liquidation expense are presented as a percent of the appraisal.\n145\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nImpaired loans are evaluated and valued at the time the loan is identified as impaired, at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair\nvalue is measured based on the value of the collateral securing the loans and is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any loans that would be required to be remeasured. At December 31, 2022,\nthe fair value of impaired loans consists of the loan balance $1.6 million less a specific valuation allowance of $24,000.\nThe fair value of MSRs is determined by calculating the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, considering\nexpected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs and other economic factors, which are determined\nbased on current market conditions. The expected rate of mortgage loan prepayments is the most significant factor driving the\nvalue of MSRs. MSRs are considered impaired if the carrying value exceeds fair value. Since the valuation model includes\nsignificant unobservable inputs as listed above, MSRs are classified as Level 3. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company\ndid not have any MSRs that would be required to be remeasured.\nOREO properties are evaluated at the time of acquisition and recorded at fair value, less estimated selling costs. After\nacquisition, OREO is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated selling costs. The fair value of an OREO\nproperty is determined from a qualified independent appraisal and is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. At\nDecember 31, 2023, OREO measured at fair value less costs to sell had no carrying value, which consisted of the outstanding\nbalance of $37,000 less write-downs of $37,000. At December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any OREO that would be\nrequired to be remeasured.\nFinancial instruments are defined as cash, evidence of an ownership in an entity, or a contract which creates an obligation or\nright to receive or deliver cash or another financial instrument from/to a second entity on potentially favorable or unfavorable\nterms.\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants at the measurement date. If no readily available market exists, the fair value estimates for financial\ninstruments should be based upon management’s judgment regarding current economic conditions, interest rate risk, expected\ncash flows, future estimated losses and other factors, as determined through various option pricing formulas or simulation\nmodeling. As many of these assumptions result from judgments made by management based upon estimates that are inherently\nuncertain, the resulting estimated fair values may not be indicative of the amount realizable in the sale of a particular financial\ninstrument. In addition, changes in the assumptions on which the estimated fair values are based may have significant impact on\nthe resulting estimated fair values.\nThe estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments at the dates indicated are as follows:\n2023 2022\nFair Value Carrying Carrying\nDecember 31, Hierarchy Value Fair Value Value Fair Value\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nFinancial Assets:\nCash and Due From Banks:\nInterest-Earning Level 1 $ 62,442 $ 62,442 $ 82,957 $ 82,957\nNoninterest-Earning Level 1 5,781 5,781 20,743 20,743\nSecurities See Above 207,095 207,095 190,058 190,058\nLoans, Net Level 3 1,100,689 1,051,722 1,037,054 1,011,098\nRestricted Stock Level 2 3,345 3,345 2,749 2,749\nMortgage Servicing Rights Level 3 540 974 633 1,000\nAccrued Interest Receivable Level 2 5,086 5,086 3,983 3,983\nFinancial Liabilities:\nDeposits Level 2 1,267,159 1,263,574 1,268,503 1,264,846\nShort-Term Borrowings Level 2 — — 8,060 8,060\nOther Borrowed Funds\nFHLB Borrowings Level 2 20,000 19,962 — —\nSubordinated Debt Level 2 14,678 13,378 14,638 13,490\nDerivative Liabilities Level 2 1,871 1,871 — —\nAccrued Interest Payable Level 2 1,814 1,814 355 355\n146\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 18—OTHER NONINTEREST EXPENSE\nThe details for other noninterest expense for the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 2022\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nNon-employee Compensation $ 580 $ 570\nPrinting and Supplies 238 250\nPostage 286 339\nTelephone 524 518\nCharitable Contributions 118 173\nDues and Subscriptions 213 174\nLoan Expenses 257 538\nMeals and Entertainment 155 143\nTravel 236 173\nTraining 72 61\nBank Assessment 192 194\nInsurance 326 275\nMiscellaneous 538 436\nTotal Other Noninterest Expense $ 3,735 $ 3,844\nNOTE 19—CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF PARENT COMPANY\nFinancial information pertaining only to CB Financial Services, Inc., is as follows:\nStatements of Financial Condition\nDecember 31, 2023 2022\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nASSETS\nCash and Due From Banks $ 14,300 $ 14,516\nEquity Securities, at Fair Value 1,700 1,822\nInvestment in Community Bank 137,359 107,727\nOther Assets 1,339 814\nTOTAL ASSETS $ 154,698 $ 124,879\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nOther Borrowed Funds $ 14,678 $ 14,638\nOther Liabilities 186 86\nStockholders' Equity 139,834 110,155\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY $ 154,698 $ 124,879\n147\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nStatements of Income\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 2022\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nInterest and Dividend Income $ 84 $ 78\nDividend from Bank Subsidiary 5,111 4,947\nInterest Expense 622 622\nNet Interest and Dividend Income 4,573 4,403\nNet Loss on Securities (122) (54)\nNoninterest Expense 18 19\nIncome Before Undistributed Net Income of Subsidiary and Income Tax Benefit 4,433 4,330\nUndistributed Net Income of Subsidiary 18,046 6,778\nIncome Before Income Tax Benefit 22,479 11,108\nIncome Tax Benefit (71) (139)\nNET INCOME $ 22,550 $ 11,247\nStatements of Cash Flows\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 2022\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nOPERATING ACTIVITIES\nNet Income $ 22,550 $ 11,247\nAdjustments to Reconcile Net Income to Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities:\nUndistributed Net Income of Subsidiary (18,046) (6,778)\nNoncash Expense for Stock-Based Compensation 1,125 600\nLoss on Equity Securities 122 55\nOther, net (425) 290\nNET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES 5,326 5,414\nFINANCING ACTIVITIES\nNet Proceeds from Other Borrowed Funds 40 37\nCash Dividends Paid (5,111) (4,920)\nTreasury Stock, Purchases at Cost (843) (4,802)\nExercise of Stock Options 372 220\nNET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES (5,542) (9,465)\nDECREASE IN CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS (216) (4,051)\nCASH AND DUE FROM BANKS AT BEGINNING OF THE YEAR 14,516 18,567\nCASH AND DUE FROM BANKS AT END OF THE YEAR $ 14,300 $ 14,516\nThe Parent Company's Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity are\nidentical to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) and the Consolidated Statements of Changes in\nStockholders' Equity and are not presented.\nNOTE 20—SEGMENT REPORTING AND RELATED INFORMATION\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company’s business activities were comprised of two operating segments, which are community\nbanking and insurance brokerage services.
