The primary objective of the study is to characterize the safety and efficacy of NXC-201. NEXICART-1 clinical results are available at [https://immixbio.com/the-science-pipeline-and-publications/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=odfVv8WsT22unlOgM4g23_Wr0rWzsi5Ct8vJOj9j1HVmUwc8pEVXfL-8X9hhA_DF9Bu4nu035EbI9XtZ6iJaBA1AccQFyLdCE7tbtEefPJXLd3OfcEoEShfYZvsD9X8qN8qIco8fLNJt9ee8mrwFVKa310J5KrVXNut9CMkCjXbGOZ2WZDHCVAYNfUNJcGI6) .\n\n**About NEXICART-2** NEXICART-2 (NCT06097832) is an open-label, single-arm, multi-site U.S. Phase 1b/2 dose expansion clinical trial of CAR-T NXC-201 in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis. NEXICART-2 is expected to enroll 40 patients with adequate cardiac function who have not been exposed to prior BCMA-targeted therapy. The study is designed with a standard 6 patient safety-run in to evaluate two doses (three patients each at 150 million CAR+T cells and 450 million CAR+T cells) (both dose levels were evaluated in the NEXICART-1 study and have produced complete responses in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients). The study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NXC-201. Primary endpoints are complete response rate and overall response rate, according to consensus recommendations (Palladini et al. 2012).\n\n**About NXC-201** NXC-201 is a sterically-optimized BCMA-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy. Initial data from Phase 1b/2 ex-U.S. study NEXICART-1 has demonstrated no neurotoxicity of any kind in AL Amyloidosis.\n\nNXC-201 is being studied in a comprehensive clinical development program for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory AL amyloidosis, with the potential to expand into select immune-mediated diseases. The NXC-201 NEXICART-2 (NCT06097832) U.S. clinical trial builds on a robust clinical dataset. NXC-201 has been awarded Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) in AL Amyloidosis by the US FDA and in the EU by the EMA.\n\n**About AL Amyloidosis** AL amyloidosis is caused by abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow, which produce misfolded amyloid proteins that build-up in the heart, kidney, liver, and other organs. This build-up causes progressive and widespread damage to multiple organs, including heart failure, and leads to high mortality rates.\n\nThe U.S. observed prevalence of relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis is estimated to be growing at 12% per year according to Staron, et al Blood Cancer Journal, to approximately 33,277 patients in 2024.\n\nThe Amyloidosis market was $3.6 billion in 2017, and is expected to reach $6 billion in 2025, according to Grand View Research.\n\n**About Immix Biopharma, Inc.** Immix Biopharma, Inc.

(“ImmixBio”, “Company”, “We” or “Us”, “IMMX”) (Nasdaq: IMMX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing cell therapies for AL Amyloidosis and immune-mediated diseases, today announced the addition of three additional clinical trial sites for its U.S. relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis clinical trial NEXICART-2. The newly added centers include some of the leading programs in the world in AL Amyloidosis. New sites expand opportunities for patient access to CAR-T NXC-201 across the U.S. MSKCC remains the lead clinical site.\n\nThe NEXICART-2 study is intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR-T NXC-201 in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients with adequate cardiac function who have not been exposed to prior BCMA-targeted therapy. The study builds on positive data from the initial ex-U.S. study, NEXICART-1, presented at the 27th Annual Meeting of The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT 2024) which showed a 92% overall response rate in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients (12/13). The best responder experienced a 28.0 month duration of response (as reported May 10, 2024).\n\n“In our mission to advance treatment options for relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients, we are proud to expand our NEXICART-2 clinical trial footprint to a national scale with the addition of these world-class sites and exceptional principal investigators,” said Ilya Rachman, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Immix Biopharma. Gabriel Morris, Chief Financial Officer of Immix Biopharma, added, “Working with our outstanding team and partners, these additional sites support upcoming interim and final read-outs of NEXICART-2.”\n\nNXC-201 is the only CAR-T therapy currently in development in AL Amyloidosis, mentioned in a [_review_ _article_ _entitled_ _“Systemic Light Chain Amyloidosis”_ _published in June, 2024_ __New England Journal of Medicine__](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=H7WrJyE7-mO7rCDjaDVUxQLM0HFWEFSluqc_0IQuFszEmEKqx8PmZWi0SlSLYqRVARKXQBujWoimk-pKVXtspUsAa9xsa6BUUddn5fHrYO8UDqAfrHoBoe9ssz96G4dcGEoMHw75uFvDAsc7UY61zO-QTCI_7h86FyTFgEE0aVV8nWGD3qODJ5i4T-7-ak3ldJPg91NW0IRJnhibAAV_ATw3T6X4m9Y-3IdfHQVSFp4GrAsSPIdXHgWad_FjPt2u).\n\n**About NEXICART-2** NEXICART-2 (NCT06097832) is an open-label, single-arm, multi-site U.S. Phase 1b/2 dose expansion clinical trial of CAR-T NXC-201 in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis. NEXICART-2 is expected to enroll 40 patients with adequate cardiac function who have not been exposed to prior BCMA-targeted therapy. The study is designed with a standard 6 patient safety-run in to evaluate two doses (three patients each at 150 million CAR+T cells and 450 million CAR+T cells), with the potential for further escalation to 800 million CAR+T cells (all 3 dose levels were evaluated in the NEXICART-1 study and have produced complete responses in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients). The study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NXC-201 in this patient population. Primary endpoints are complete response rate and overall response rate, according to consensus recommendations (Palladini et al. 2012).\n\n**About NEXICART-1** NEXICART-1 (NCT04720313) is an open-label, ex-U.S. Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of NXC-201 (formerly HBI0101) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and relapsed/refractory AL amyloidosis (including AL Amyloidosis patients with impaired cardiac function and including AL Amyloidosis patients exposed to prior BCMA-targeted therapy). The primary objective of the study is to characterize the safety and efficacy, as well as confirm the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of NXC-201 (which has already been confirmed). NEXICART-1 clinical results, most recently from ASGCT 2024, are available at [https://immixbio.com/pipeline/#publications](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=WXLVL3IKFv-OY417tS0iCPu8PZR5eK-KYPCANPYoN1d2cJ2uqpyJJwPa4hOuBcro1dAqwJUQ8oDRgg3wrKPcUvFLkETaTtF_Uhz0PZqg2M1wt7PtYiYtkj3JIRy5Gz6iF5vCTQaTtp-5KHQPlpmqBw==).\n\n**About NXC-201** NXC-201 is a sterically-optimized BCMA-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy.

NXC-201 has been awarded Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) in AL Amyloidosis by the US FDA and in the EU by the EMA. \n\n**About AL Amyloidosis** AL amyloidosis is caused by abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow, which produce misfolded amyloid proteins that build-up in the heart, kidney, liver, and other organs. This build-up causes progressive and widespread damage to multiple organs, including heart failure, and leads to high mortality rates.\n\nThe U.S. observed prevalence of relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis is estimated to be growing at 12% per year according to Staron, et al Blood Cancer Journal, to approximately 33,277 patients in 2024.\n\nThe Amyloidosis market was $3.6 billion in 2017, and is expected to reach $6 billion in 2025, according to Grand View Research.\n\n**About Immix Biopharma, Inc.** Immix Biopharma, Inc.

(“ImmixBio”, “Company”, “We” or “Us”, “IMMX”) (Nasdaq: IMMX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing cell therapies for AL Amyloidosis and select immune-mediated diseases, today announced advances in the NEXICART-2 clinical study of its CAR-T NXC-201 for relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis, a plasma cell disorder that leads to progressive damage to the heart, kidney and liver, which currently affects approximately 33,000 patients in the U.S. Immix Biopharma’s sterically-optimized CAR-T NXC-201 is the only one-time CAR-T treatment option being studied for relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis in U.S. clinical trials.\n\n“We are pleased to report that the NEXICART-2 study is making excellent progress. We are now one step closer to providing a new treatment option for patients with relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis, where no FDA drugs are approved today,” said Ilya Rachman, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Immix Biopharma. “Robust enrollment reflects the enthusiasm of clinical investigators for CAR-T NXC-201.”\n\n“Positive data from our ex-US study of NXC-201, the largest CAR-T clinical study in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis to-date, showed a 92% overall response rate (12/13) and a 28.0 month duration of response (best responder), presented at ASGCT 2024,” said Gabriel Morris, Chief Financial Officer of Immix Biopharma. “We credit the resolute efforts of our investigators, sites, and team as we continue on track for interim and final read-outs.”\n\nThe NEXICART-2 study is intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NXC-201 in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients with adequate cardiac function who have not been exposed to prior BCMA-targeted therapy. Advancement to the second dosing cohort of three patients at 450 million CAR-T cells will dose one patient with NXC-201 every 28-days, subsequently enabling multiple patients to be dosed per month in NEXICART-2.\n\nEach of the NEXICART-2 dose levels have produced complete responses in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients in the ex-U.S. NEXICART-1 study presented at ASGCT 2024.\n\nNXC-201 is the only CAR-T therapy currently in development in AL Amyloidosis, mentioned in a [_review article entitled “Systemic Light Chain Amyloidosis” published in June, 2024_ __New England Journal of Medicine__](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=sFYkGHZyYGde2fDo17oD4a8KQqnI-aHTWF598B7ykPKtHsGTYjeJ7PAhz1oNyC4_v2iLpTYP1mwBnD081X52uKcAeVyQjdcf10O7M392LLznGkV2wVWu1OlpdJkzo4hAVwUoZP5ZV36Mx9Se0VQ9-9-gCI3pKAStms-eFddg0L-fnsJU-SMQzBxRx81OK3PjM-yHeZ2Xv0DdyaGFQ3Q-EaAgyuL7iQ7grGrm3OY8zHqgjDn4xWKkjK5ztojC3rXb).\n\n**About NEXICART-2** NEXICART-2 (NCT06097832) is an open-label, single-arm, multi-site U.S. Phase 1b/2 dose expansion clinical trial of CAR-T NXC-201 in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis. NEXICART-2 is expected to enroll 40 patients with adequate cardiac function who have not been exposed to prior BCMA-targeted therapy. The study is designed with a standard 6 patient safety run-in to evaluate two doses (three patients each at 150 million CAR+T cells and 450 million CAR+T cells), with dose expansion at 450 million CAR+T cells following. During dose expansion, multiple patients are allowed to be dosed per month. The NXC-201 dosing levels being evaluated in NEXICART-2 study have been evaluated in the NEXICART-1 study and have produced complete responses in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients. The study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NXC-201 in this patient population. Primary endpoints are complete response rate and overall response rate, according to consensus recommendations (Palladini et al. 2012).\n\n**About NXC-201** NXC-201 is a sterically-optimized BCMA-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy. Initial NXC-201 clinical data in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis from Phase 1b/2 ex-U.S. study NEXICART-1 has demonstrated a high overall and complete response rate, as well as no neurotoxicity of any kind and short duration of cytokine release syndrome, presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) and the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) annual meetings. \n\nNXC-201 is being studied in a comprehensive clinical development program for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory AL amyloidosis, with the potential to expand into select immune mediated diseases. The NXC-201 NEXICART-2 U.S. clinical trial builds on an existing robust clinical dataset. NXC-201 has been awarded Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) in the US by the FDA and in the EU by the EMA in AL Amyloidosis.\n\n**About AL Amyloidosis** AL amyloidosis is caused by abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow, which produce misfolded amyloid proteins that build-up in the heart, kidney, liver, and other organs. This build-up causes progressive and widespread damage to multiple organs, including heart failure, and leads to high mortality rates.\n\nThe U.S. observed prevalence of relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis is estimated to be growing at 12% per year according to Staron, et al Blood Cancer Journal, to approximately 33,277 patients in 2024. \n\nThe Amyloidosis market was $3.6 billion in 2017, and is expected to reach $6 billion in 2025, according to Grand View Research.\n\n**About Immix Biopharma, Inc.** Immix Biopharma, Inc.

(the \"Company”) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical pharmaceutical company organized as a Delaware corporation on January 7, 2014, which is focused on\ndeveloping cell therapies in AL Amyloidosis and select immune-mediated diseases. In August 2016, the Company established a wholly-owned Australian subsidiary, Immix\nBiopharma Australia Pty Ltd. (\"IBAPL”), in order to conduct various preclinical and clinical activities for its development candidates. In November 2022, the Company established\na majority-owned subsidiary, Nexcella, Inc. (\"Nexcella”), its cell therapy division, which subsequently merged into the Company in May 2024, with the Company continuing as the\nsurviving entity. To ensure continuity of operations, the Company re-established Nexcella in 2024 as a wholly-owned subsidiary\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation - The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP”) and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC”).\nThe Company’s fiscal year end is December 31.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures as of September 30, 2024, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are\nunaudited, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with\nU.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the Company’s opinion, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\ninclude all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for the fair statement of the results for the interim periods. These unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 which are\nincluded in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nare not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024.\nRisk and Uncertainties - The Company operates in a dynamic and highly competitive industry and is subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the\nbiotechnology industry, including, but not limited to, development by competitors of new technological innovations, protection of proprietary technology, dependence on key\npersonnel, contract manufacturers and contract research organizations, compliance with government regulations and the need to obtain additional financing to fund operations.\nProduct candidates currently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials and\nregulatory approval, prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel infrastructure and extensive compliance and\nreporting. The Company believes that changes in any of the following areas could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future financial position, results of operations,\nor cash flows; ability to obtain future financing; advances and trends in new technologies and industry standards; results of clinical trials; regulatory approval and market\nacceptance of the Company’s products; development of sales channels; certain strategic relationships; litigation or claims against the Company based on intellectual property,\npatent, product, regulatory, or other factors; and the Company’s ability to attract and retain employees necessary to support its growth.\nProducts developed by the Company require approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA”) or other international regulatory agencies prior to commercial sales.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company’s research and development will be successfully completed, that adequate protection for the Company’s intellectual property will be\nobtained or maintained, that the products will receive the necessary approvals, or that any approved products will be commercially viable. If the Company is denied approval,\napproval is delayed, or the Company is unable to maintain approval, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company. Even if the Company’s product development efforts\nare successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will generate revenue from product sales. The Company operates in an environment of rapid change in technology and\nsubstantial competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In addition, the Company is dependent upon the services of its employees, consultants and\nother third parties.\n8\nThe Company has expended and plans to continue to expend substantial funds to complete the research, development and clinical testing of product candidates. The Company\nalso will be required to expend additional funds to establish commercial-scale manufacturing arrangements and to provide for the marketing and distribution of products that\nreceive regulatory approval. The Company may require additional funds to commercialize its products. The Company is unable to entirely fund these efforts with its current\nfinancial resources and will need to raise additional funding in the future. If adequate funds are unavailable on a timely basis from operations or additional sources of financing, the\nCompany may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of its research or development programs which may materially and adversely affect its business, financial\ncondition and operations.\nUse of Estimates – The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.\nThe Company uses significant judgments when making estimates related to the valuation of deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances, accrual and prepayment of\nresearch and development expenses, and the valuation of stock-based compensation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nPrinciples of Consolidation – The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Immix Biopharma, Inc. and the accounts of its 100% owned\nsubsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. For previously consolidated entities where the Company owned less than 100% of\nthe subsidiary, the Company recorded net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in its condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss equal to\nthe percentage of the economic or ownership interest retained in such entities by the respective non-controlling parties.\nSegment Reporting - The Company manages its operations as a single segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions. The Company’s Chief\nOperating Decision Maker (\"CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer. The CODM allocates resources and evaluates the performance of the Company at the consolidated level using\ninformation about its revenues, gross profit, income from operations, and other key financial data. All significant operating decisions are based upon an analysis of the Company\nas one operating segment, which is the same as its reporting segment.\nLiquidity and Going Concern – These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will continue to realize its\nassets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. Since the initial public offering of its common stock in December 2021, the Company has financed its operations\nthrough various equity financing. On July 14, 2023, the Company entered into an additional ATM Sales Agreement (the \"July Sales Agreement”) with ThinkEquity LLC (the \"Sales\nAgent”), pursuant to which the Company, could, from time to time, issue and sell through the Sales Agent shares of the Company’s common stock in sales deemed to be \"at-the-\nmarket offerings” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"July ATM Facility”) (see Note 7). Initially, the Company is eligible to\nsell up to $4,200,000 worth of shares of its common stock as the aggregate market value of the Company’s shares of common stock eligible for sale under the July Sales Agreement\nis subject to the limitations of General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 until such time that the Company’s public float equals or exceeds $75.0 million. In the event the aggregate\nmarket value of the Company’s outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $75.0 million, then the one-third limitation on sales set forth in General\nInstruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 shall not apply to additional sales made pursuant to the July Sales Agreement.\nFrom July 14, 2023 through February 5, 2024, the Company has sold 328,136 common shares pursuant to the July ATM Facility for net proceeds of $1,091,887, after offering\nexpenses. On February 5, 2024, the Company suspended, and is not offering any shares of its common stock pursuant to, the prospectus supplement dated July 14, 2023, relating\nto the July Sales Agreement by and between the Company and the Sales Agent. The Company will not make any sales of common stock pursuant to the July Sales Agreement\nunless and until a new prospectus supplement is filed with the SEC; however, the July Sales Agreement remains in full force and effect.\nIn February 2024, the Company conducted an underwritten public offering of 5,535,055 shares of its common stock at the public offering price of $2.71 per share, for net proceeds of\n$13,565,760, after underwriter discounts and offering expenses (the \"Offering”). Pursuant to the underwriting agreement, the Company granted the underwriter a 30-day over-\nallotment option to purchase up to an additional 783,970 shares of the Company’s common stock, which was exercised in full on March 1, 2024, for net proceeds of $1,954,594, after\nunderwriting discounts and offering expenses (see Note 7).\n9\nOn July 25, 2024, the Company was awarded an $8 million grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine to support the clinical development of chimeric antigen\nreceptor T-cell therapy NXC-201 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis. The award is payable to the Company upon achievement of milestones that are primarily\nbased on patient enrollment in the Company’s clinical trials. Additionally, if CIRM determines, in its sole discretion, that the Company has not complied with the terms and\nconditions of the grant, CIRM may suspend or permanently cease disbursements. Funds received under this grant may only be used for allowable project costs specifically\nidentified with the CIRM-funded project. Such costs can include, but are not limited to, salary for personnel, itemized supplies, consultants, and itemized clinical study costs. Under\nthe terms of the grant, both CIRM and the Company will co-fund the research project and the amount of the Company’s co-funding requirement is predetermined as a part of the\naward. The Company signed the grant agreement in November 2024 and expects to begin receiving funds from the grant beginning in November of 2024.\nThe Company has a history of, and expects to continue to report, negative cash flows from operations and net losses. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash as of September 30, 2024 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nConcentration of Credit Risk – Periodically, the Company may carry cash and cash equivalents balances at financial institutions in excess of the federally insured limit of $250,000,\nor the Australian insured limit of AUD 250,000. At times, deposits held with financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided. The Company has not experienced\nlosses on these accounts and management believes that the credit risk with regard to these deposits is not significant.\nCash and Cash Equivalents – The Company’s cash equivalents include short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less when purchased and are\ncarried at fair value.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments – The carrying value of short-term instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, tax receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses,\napproximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments.\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset\nor liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs\nand minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company utilizes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurements, defined as follows:\nLevel 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability,\neither directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.\nLevel 3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.\n10\nThe following fair value hierarchy table presents information about the Company’s asset measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nFair Value Measurements at September 30, 2024\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nCash equivalents (money market funds) $ 18,650,711 $ - $ -\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had no liabilities required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nCash equivalents (money market funds) $ 16,113,006 $ - $ -\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had no liabilities required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nAustralian Tax Incentive – IBAPL is eligible to receive a cash refund from the Australian Taxation Office for eligible research and development (\"R&D”) expenditures under the\nAustralian R&D Tax Incentive Program (the \"Australian Tax Incentive”). The Australian Tax Incentive is recognized as a reduction to R&D expense when there is reasonable\nassurance that the relevant expenditure has been incurred, the amount can be reliably measured and that the Australian Tax Incentive will be received. The Company recognized\nadditional R&D expense of $66,594 and reductions to R&D expense of $378,390 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recognized\nreductions to R&D expense of $1,076,193 and $599,926 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDeferred Offering Costs – The Company had capitalized qualified legal, accounting and other direct costs related to its efforts to raise capital through the sale of its common stock\nunder the July ATM Facility. Deferred offering costs were deferred and being amortized ratably upon sales under the July ATM Facility to additional paid-in capital as a reduction\nof the July ATM proceeds. As a result of the Company pausing the July ATM Facility, all of the remaining deferred offering costs were immediately amortized to additional paid-in\ncapital as a reduction to the proceeds received in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, no remaining amounts of deferred offering costs were\ncapitalized related to the July ATM Facility.\nStock-Based Compensation – Stock-based compensation expense represents the estimated grant date fair value of the Company’s equity awards, consisting of stock options\nissued under the Company’s stock option plan and restricted common stock (see Note 7). The fair value of equity awards is recognized over the requisite service period of such\nawards (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the date of\ngrant and recognizes forfeitures as they occur. For stock awards for which vesting is subject to performance-based milestones, the expense is recorded over the remaining service\nperiod after the point when the achievement of the milestone is probable, or the performance condition has been achieved.\nResearch and Development Costs – R&D costs are expensed as incurred. R&D costs consist primarily of clinical research fees paid to consultants and outside service providers,\nother expenses relating to design, development and testing of the Company’s therapy candidates, and for license and milestone costs related to in-licensed products and\ntechnology. Costs incurred in obtaining technology licenses are charged to R&D expense if the technology licensed has not reached commercial feasibility and has no alternative\nfuture use. Such licenses purchased by the Company require substantial completion of research and development, regulatory and marketing approval efforts in order to reach\ncommercial feasibility and have no alternative future use.\nClinical trial costs are a component of R&D expenses. The Company estimates expenses incurred for clinical trials that are in process based on services performed under\ncontractual agreements with clinical research organizations and actual clinical investigators. Included in the estimates are (1) the fee per patient enrolled as specified in the clinical\ntrial contract with each institution participating in the clinical trial and (2) progressive data on patient enrollments obtained from participating clinical trial sites and the actual\nservices performed. Changes in clinical trial assumptions, such as the length of time estimated to enroll all patients, rate of screening failures, patient drop-out rates, number and\nnature of adverse event reports, and the total number of patients enrolled can impact the average and expected cost per patient and the overall cost of the clinical trial. The\nCompany monitors the progress of the trials and their related activities and adjusts expense accruals, when applicable. Adjustments to accruals are charged to expense in the\nperiod in which the facts give rise to the adjustments become known.\n11\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss) – Other comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation gains and losses. The cumulative amount of translation gains and\nlosses are reflected as a separate component of stockholders’ equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, as accumulated other comprehensive income.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transaction Gains (Losses) – The Company, and its wholly-owned subsidiary Nexcella, maintain their accounting records in U.S. Dollars. The\nCompany’s operating subsidiary, IBAPL, is located in Australia and maintains its accounting records in Australian Dollars, which is its functional currency. Assets and liabilities\nof the subsidiary are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates at the balance sheet date, equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rate and revenues and expenses\nare translated by using the average exchange rates for the period. Translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) in the\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Foreign currency denominated transactions are translated at exchange rates approximating those in effect at the\ntransaction dates. Gains (losses) resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations and comprehensive loss and were $(2,849) and $8,095 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $(22,326) and $6,372 for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nLoss Per Common Share - Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares\noutstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share is determined using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the\ndilutive effect of common stock equivalents. In periods when losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding excludes common stock\nequivalents because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. Basic weighted average shares outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include 1,913,661\nshares underlying Pre-Funded warrants to purchase common shares (See Note 7). As the shares underlying these Pre-Funded warrants can be issued for nominal consideration (an\nexercise price per share equal to $0.0001 per share), these shares are deemed to be issued for purposes of basic loss per common share. For the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s potentially dilutive shares, which were not included in the calculation of net loss per share, included stock options and warrants\nexercisable for 4,408,488 and 2,911,412 shares of common stock, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment - Included in property and equipment is construction-in-progress which consists of manufacturing space improvements and includes the costs of\nconstruction, machinery and equipment, and any interest charges arising from borrowings used to finance these assets during the period of construction or installation of the\nassets. No provision for depreciation is made on construction-in-progress until such time as the relevant assets are completed and ready for their intended use.\nEstimated useful lives of the Company’s assets are as follows:\nUseful Life\nOperating equipment 3-10 years\nElectronic equipment 3-5 years\nOffice equipment 3-5 years\nThe cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts, and any gain or loss are included in the Company’s results of\noperations. The costs of maintenance and repairs are recognized to expenses as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are capitalized.\nLeases - At the inception of a contract the Company determines if the arrangement is, or contains a lease. Operating lease right-of-use (\"ROU”) assets represent the Company’s\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and\nliabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nlease term.\nThe Company has made certain accounting policy elections whereby it (i) does not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for short-term leases (those with original terms of 12-\nmonths or less) and (ii) separates lease and non-lease elements of its operating leases as separate lease components. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nCompany did not have any finance leases.\n12\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures, which requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, on a retrospective basis. The Company has implemented this ASU effective\nJanuary 1, 2024, and determined no retrospective changes were necessary.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which expands the disclosures required for income taxes.\nThis ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis while\nretrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this pronouncement on its disclosures.\nNote 3 – Prior Agreements with Nexcella Subsidiary\nNexcella Absorption\nOn May 20, 2024, Nexcella, was merged (the \"Merger”) with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation (the \"Nexcella Absorption”). The Merger was\neffected pursuant to Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\"DGCL”) when the Company filed a Certificate of Ownership and Merger (\"Certificate of Merger”) with\nthe Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. Immediately prior to the Merger, the Company owned greater than 95% of outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis of\nNexcella, par value $0.0001 per share (the \"Nexcella Shares”), and 100% of the outstanding shares of each other class of capital stock of Nexcella. Under the DGCL, the only\napproval required was that of the Company’s Board of Directors for the Merger to become effective. As a result of the Merger, Nexcella ceased to exist and all assets, operations\nand other property and rights of Nexcella have been succeeded to by the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Merger, as a result of the Merger, each of the\noutstanding Nexcella Shares (other than Nexcella Shares held by the Company) were converted into common stock of the Company (\"Company Merger Shares”). In connection\nwith the Merger, the Company issued 989,876 shares of its common stock to the former stockholders of Nexcella (other than shares held by the Company) (including Company\ncommon stock issued to third-party cash investors in Nexcella) (the \"Merger Shares”). The shares were issued on a pro-rata basis and as such resulted in no change in fair value.\nIn addition, the Company issued to the former participants in the Nexcella 2022 Equity Incentive Plan, 275,759 restricted stock awards to receive common stock in the Company and\noptions to purchase up to 595,676 shares of Company common stock at an exercise price of $2.47 per share (the closing price on May 17, 2024), under the Company’s Amended and\nRestated 2021 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan. As such, as of May 20, 2024, the Founders Agreement and Management Services Agreement agreements listed below with Nexcella\nare no longer in effect.\nFounders Agreement\nEffective December 8, 2022, the Company entered into a Founders Agreement with Nexcella (the \"Nexcella Founders Agreement”).\nThe Nexcella Founders Agreement provided that prior to a Qualified IPO (as defined in Nexcella’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the \"Nexcella\nCOI”)) or Qualified Change in Control (as defined in the Nexcella COI), the Company shall provide funds to Nexcella as requested by Nexcella, in good faith, to be evidenced by a\nsenior unsecured promissory note. In exchange for the time and capital expended in the formation of Nexcella and the identification of specific assets, the acquisition of which\nbenefit Nexcella, on December 21, 2022, the Company loaned Nexcella approximately $2.1 million, evidenced by a senior unsecured promissory note, representing the up-front fee\nrequired to acquire Nexcella’s license agreement with Hadasit Medical Research Services & Development, Ltd. (\"HADASIT”) and BIRAD Research and Development Company\nLtd. (\"BIRAD”), and for use as working capital for its research and development activities. The note, which had a maturity date of January 31, 2030, accrued interest at a rate of\n7.875% per annum and was convertible into shares of common stock of Nexcella at a conversion price of $2.00 per share, subject to adjustment; provided, however, that such note\nshall automatically convert into shares of Nexcella common stock immediately prior to certain conversion triggers set forth in the note. Nexcella may not prepay the note without\nthe Company’s prior written consent. The note and accrued interest were converted in full prior to the Nexcella Absorption. The Nexcella Founders Agreement had a term of 15\nyears, which, upon expiration, would automatically renew for successive one-year periods unless terminated by the Company upon notice at least six months prior to the end of the\nterm or upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Nexcella Founders Agreement). In connection with the Nexcella Founders Agreement, the Company was\nissued 250,000 shares of Nexcella’s Class A Preferred Stock, 1,000,000 shares of Nexcella’s Class A Common Stock, and 5,000,000 shares of Nexcella’s common stock. The Class A\nPreferred Stock was identical to the common stock other than as to conversion rights, the PIK Dividend right (as defined below) and voting rights.\n13\nEach share of Class A Preferred Stock was convertible, at the Company’s option, into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Nexcella’s common stock, subject to certain\nadjustments. As a holder of Nexcella’s Class A Preferred Stock, the Company received on each March 13 (each a \"PIK Dividend Payment Date”) until the date all outstanding Class\nA Preferred Stock was converted into Nexcella’s common stock or redeemed (and the purchase price is paid in full), pro rata per share dividends paid in additional fully paid and\nnonassessable shares of Nexcella common stock (\"PIK Dividends”) such that the aggregate number of shares of common stock issued pursuant to such PIK Dividend was equal\nto 2.5% of Nexcella’s fully-diluted outstanding capitalization on the date that was one business day prior to any PIK Dividend Payment Date. In addition, as a holder of Class A\nPreferred Stock, the Company was entitled to cast for each share of Class A Preferred Stock held as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on matters\npresented to the stockholders of Nexcella, the number of votes that was equal to 1.1 times a fraction, the numerator of which was the sum of (A) the shares of outstanding Nexcella\ncommon stock and (B) the whole shares of Nexcella common stock into which the shares of outstanding Nexcella Class A Common Stock and the Class A Preferred Stock were\nconvertible and the denominator of which was the number of shares of outstanding Nexcella Class A Preferred Stock.\nEach share of Class A Common Stock was convertible, at the Company’s option, into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Nexcella’s common stock, subject to certain\nadjustments. In addition, upon a Qualified IPO (as defined in the Nexcella COI) or Qualified Change in Control (as defined in the Nexcella COI), each share of Class A Common\nStock would automatically convert into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Nexcella’s common stock; provided however, if at that time, the Class A Common Stock was not\nthen convertible into a number of shares of Nexcella common stock (or such other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Class A Common\nStock) that have a value of: (a) in the case of a Qualified IPO, at least $5,000,000 based on the initial offering price in such initial public offering, or (b) in the case of a Qualified\nChange in Control, at least $5,000,000 in cash or at least $5,000,000 of equity based on the implied value of a share of Nexcella common stock resulting from the price paid upon the\nconsummation of such Qualified Change of Control, the Class A Common Stock would automatically convert into such number of shares of Nexcella common stock (or such other\ncapital stock or securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Class A Common Stock) that have a value of $5,000,000 based on the initial offering price in such initial\npublic offering or the implied value of a share of Nexcella common stock resulting from the price paid upon the consummation of such Qualified Change of Control (or if such\nQualified Change of Control results in the Class A Shares being exchanged solely for cash, then $5,000,000 in cash). The Company was entitled to cast such number of votes equal\nto the number of whole shares of Nexcella common stock into which the Company’s Class A Common Stock was convertible as of the record date for determining stockholders\nentitled to vote on matters presented to the stockholders of Nexcella.\nIn addition to the foregoing, the Company was entitled to one vote for each share of Nexcella common stock held by it. Except as provided by law or by the Nexcella COI, holders\nof Nexcella Class A Common Stock and Class A Preferred Stock shall vote together with the holders of Nexcella common stock, as a single class.\nAs additional consideration under the Nexcella Founders Agreement, Nexcella also agreed to: (i) pay an equity fee in shares of common stock, payable within five business days of\nthe closing of any equity or debt financing for Nexcella or any of its respective subsidiaries that occurs after the effective date of the Nexcella Founders Agreement and ending on\nthe date when the Company no longer has majority voting control in Nexcella’s voting equity, equal to 2.5% of the gross amount of any such equity or debt financing; and (ii) pay\na cash fee equal to 4.5% of Nexcella’s annual Net Sales (as defined in the Nexcella Founders Agreement), payable on an annual basis, within 90 days of the end of each calendar\nyear. In the event of a Change of Control, Nexcella agreed to pay a one-time change in control fee equal to five times the product of (A) Net Sales for the 12 months immediately\npreceding the Change of Control and (B) 4.5%.\n14\nManagement Services Agreement\nEffective as of December 8, 2022, the Company entered into a Management Services Agreement (the \"Nexcella MSA”) with Nexcella. Pursuant to the terms of the Nexcella MSA,\nthe Company rendered management, advisory and consulting services to Nexcella. Services provided under the Nexcella MSA may include, without limitation, (i) advice and\nassistance concerning any and all aspects of Nexcella’s operations, clinical trials, financial planning and strategic transactions and financings and (ii) conducting relations on\nbehalf of Nexcella with accountants, attorneys, financial advisors and other professionals (collectively, the \"Services”). At the request of the Company, Nexcella utilized clinical\nresearch services, medical education, communication and marketing services and investor relations/public relation services of companies or individuals designated by the\nCompany, provided those services are offered at market prices. In consideration for the Services, Nexcella paid the Company an annual base management and consulting fee of\n$500,000 (the \"Annual Consulting Fee”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the first Annual Consulting Fee payment was not due until the first business day of the calendar quarter\nimmediately following the completion of the first equity financing for Nexcella that was in excess of $10 million in gross proceeds, which did not occur. Actual and direct out-of-\npocket expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in performing the Services were reimbursed to the Company by Nexcella.\nThe Nexcella MSA was terminated on May 20, 2024 in connection with the Nexcella Absorption. In addition, as a result of the Nexcella Absorption, the Class A Preferred Stock,\nClass A Common Stock, and the Founders Agreement cease to exist.\nNote 4 – Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets consist of the following as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nPrepaid research and development expenses $ 486,912 $ 412,773\nPrepaid insurance expense 73,813 263,927\nPrepaid investor relations expense 492,391 384,494\nOther current assets 36,521 44,582\nTotal prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 1,089,637 $ 1,105,776\nNote 5 – Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses consist of the following as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAccounts payable $ 3,288,579 $ 1,433,022\nAccrued research and development expenses 2,878,386 1,571,261\nAccrued professional services 93,385 38,639\nAccrued compensation and related expenses 198,095 577,854\nOther accrued expenses 43,341 101,007\nTotal accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 6,501,786 $ 3,721,783\n15\nNote 6 – Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nOperating equipment $ 534,162 $ 60,599\nOffice equipment 3,895 3,896\n538,057 64,495\nLess: Accumulated depreciation (26,652) (14,314)\n511,405 50,181\nConstruction in progress 844,019 -\n$ 1,355,424 $ 50,181\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, depreciation expense amounted to $12,338 and $2,392, respectively.

Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with\ncertainty, the Company does not currently have any pending litigation to which it is a party or to which its property is subject that it believes to be material. Regardless of the\noutcome, litigation can be costly and time consuming, and it can divert management’s attention from important business matters and initiatives, negatively impacting the\nCompany’s overall operations.\nEmployment Agreements\nOn June 18, 2021, the Company entered into an Employment Agreement with Ilya Rachman (as amended, the \"Rachman Employment Agreement”), effective for a three-year term,\nsubject to the terms of the agreement which provide that unless the Company and Dr. Rachman have otherwise agreed in writing, if Dr. Rachman continues to work for the\nCompany after the expiration of the term (which he has), his employment shall be under the same terms and conditions provided for in the Rachman Employment Agreement, except\nthat his employment will be on an \"at will” basis and the provisions of the agreement allowing for Dr. Rachman to terminate the agreement for \"good reason” and for Dr. Rachman\nto be paid severance in the event his employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by Dr. Rachman for good reason will no longer apply, and the Rachman\nEmployment Agreement currently remains in effect pursuant to such terms.

Our lead cell therapy candidate is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA”) investigational new drug (\"IND”) cleared CAR-\nT NXC-201, currently being evaluated in our ongoing United States Phase 1b/2 NEXICART-2 (NCT06097832) clinical trial and our ex-U.S. phase 1b/2a NEXICART-1 (NCT04720313)\nclinical trial.\nNXC-201 has been awarded Orphan Drug Designation (\"ODD”) by both the FDA and European Commission (\"EMA”) in AL Amyloidosis.\n25\nOur mission is to harness the immune system through innovative cell therapies and other modalities to deliver widely accessible cures in select immune-mediated diseases\nand other indications, as we believe patients are waiting.\nOur strategy is to:\n● Develop our lead candidate CAR-T NXC-201 in AL Amyloidosis and select immune-mediated diseases; and\n● Pursue development of NXC-201 and additional cell therapy candidates in other applicable indications where CAR-T is not an approved therapy today.\nOur N-GENIUS platform has produced our clinical-stage lead candidate NXC-201, a next-generation CAR-T for AL Amyloidosis and select immune-mediated diseases.\nFigure 1: ImmixBio Pipeline\nNXC-201 is in clinical trials to treat relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis.\nAL amyloidosis is a life-threatening immunological disorder in which an abnormal protein called amyloid builds up in tissues and organs. This abnormal protein is\nproduced by long-lived plasma cells (\"LLPCs”), a type of immune B-cell. The signs and symptoms of AL amyloidosis vary among patients because build-up may occur in the heart\n(most frequent cause of mortality), liver, kidneys, intestines, muscles, joints, nerves, or spleen, according to the National Institutes of Health (\"NIH”). Diagnosis is frequently\ndelayed, due to varied and non-specific symptoms including: fatigue, weight loss, shortness of breath, dizziness, and numbness in hands and feet. Upon diagnosis, many patients\nalready have late-stage disease, and are not aware of available treatment options and clinical trials.\nAs of September 2024, there are no FDA approved drugs for relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis.\nThe U.S. observed prevalence of relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis is growing 12% per year according to Staron, et al Blood Cancer Journal 2021, estimated to reach\n33,277 patients in 2024. Untreated patients with AL amyloidosis and cardiac involvement have a median survival of less than 1 year, according to Quock, et al. Journal of\nComparative Effective Research, 2023. The current market size for amyloidosis therapies is estimated at $3.6 billion, expected to reach $6 billion in 2027, according to Grand View\nResearch.\n26\nAs of September 2024, we have treated 3 relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients in the United States in our ongoing Phase 1b/2 multi-site NEXICART-2\n(NCT06097832) U.S. clinical trial. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center is the lead NEXICART-2 clinical site.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we have treated 13 relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients in our ongoing Phase 1b/2a NEXICART-1 (NCT04720313) ex-U.S. clinical trial.\nIn September 2023, the FDA granted ODD to NXC-201 for the treatment of AL Amyloidosis. If a product that has ODD subsequently receives the first FDA approval for\nthe disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other\napplications to market the same drug for the same indication for 7 years (except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug\nexclusivity).\nIn November 2023, the FDA cleared an IND application for NXC-201 to enroll U.S. patients into NXC-201 clinical trials.\nIn December 2023, NXC-201 clinical data in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis was presented in an oral presentation at the 65th annual American Society of Hematology\n(\"ASH”) meeting, covering 10 relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients treated with NXC-201, indicating an overall response rate of 100% (10/10) and a complete response rate\nof 70% (7/10).\nIn February 2024, the European Commission (\"EC”) granted orphan drug designation to NXC-201 for the treatment of AL Amyloidosis. Benefits of European ODD include:\n10 years of market exclusivity once authorized in the EU; Access to the EU centralized authorization procedure; and reduced fees for EU protocol assistance, marketing\nauthorization applications, inspections before authorization, applications for changes to marketing authorizations made after approval, and reduced annual fees.\nOur Other Programs\nOur other programs include NXC-201 for select immune-mediated diseases, a $25 billion combined annual market size according to Grand View Research and Fortune\nBusiness Insights and other preclinical candidates.\nWhile our focus is NXC-201 in AL Amyloidosis and select immune-mediated diseases, we continue to collect and organize IMX-110 data in monotherapy for soft tissue\nsarcoma, a $3 billion market size according to Medgadget, and in combination with anti-PD-1 for colorectal cancer, a $27 billion market size according to IndustryARC, to evaluate\nnext steps.\nSince inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing product and technology rights, conducting research and development, organizing and\nstaffing our Company, business planning and raising capital. We operate as one business segment and have incurred recurring losses, the majority of which are attributable to\nresearch and development activities and negative cash flows from operations. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities. Currently, our primary\nuse of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures, and to a lesser extent, general and administrative expenditures. We\nexpect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates through all stages of development and\nclinical trials and, ultimately, seek regulatory approval. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant\ncommercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. Furthermore, we incur costs associated with operating as a public company,\nincluding significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the\ntiming of our clinical trials and our expenses on other research and development activities.\n27\nAbsorption of Nexcella Subsidiary\nOn May 20, 2024, Nexcella, was merged (the \"Merger”) with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation. The Merger was effected pursuant to\nSection 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\"DGCL”) when the Company filed a Certificate of Ownership and Merger (\"Certificate of Merger”) with the Secretary of State\nof the State of Delaware. Immediately prior to the Merger, the Company owned greater than 95% of the outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis of Nexcella, par value\n$0.0001 per share (the \"Nexcella Shares”), and 100% of the outstanding shares of each other class of capital stock of Nexcella. Under the DGCL, the only approval required was that\nof the Company’s Board of Directors for the Merger to become effective. As a result of the Merger, Nexcella ceased to exist and all assets, operations and other property and rights\nof Nexcella have been succeeded to by the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Merger, as a result of the Merger, each of the outstanding Nexcella Shares (other\nthan Nexcella Shares held by the Company) were converted, into common stock of the Company (\"Company Merger Shares”). In connection with the Merger, the Company issued\n989,876 shares of its common stock to the former stockholders of Nexcella (other than shares held by the Company) (including Company common stock issued to third-party cash\ninvestors in Nexcella) (the \"Merger Shares”). In addition, the Company issued to the former participants in the Nexcella 2022 Equity Incentive Plan, 275,759 restricted stock awards\nto receive common stock in the Company and options to purchase up to 595,676 shares of Company common stock at an exercise price of $2.47 per share (the closing price on May\n17, 2024), under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2021 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan.\nResearch and License Agreement with Hadasit and BIRAD\nOn December 8, 2022, our subsidiary Nexcella entered into a Research and License Agreement (the \"Agreement”) with Hadasit Medical Research Services &\nDevelopment, Ltd. and BIRAD – Research and Development Company Ltd. (collectively, the \"Licensors”) pursuant to which the Licensors granted to Nexcella an exclusive,\nworldwide, royalty-bearing license throughout the world, except Israel, Cyprus and other countries in the Middle East (the \"Territory”) to an invention entitled \"Anti-BCMA CAR-\nT cells to target plasma cell” to develop, manufacture, have manufactured, use, market, offer for sale, sell, have sold, export and import Licensed Product (as defined in the\nAgreement). Pursuant to the Agreement, Nexcella paid the Licensors an upfront fee of $1,500,000 in December 2022. Additional quarterly payments totaling approximately $13.0\nmillion are due through September 2026 along with an annual license fee of $50,000. Nexcella has agreed to pay royalties to the Licensors equal to 5% of Net Sales (as defined in the\nAgreement) during the Royalty Period. \"Royalty Period” means for each Licensed Product, on a country-to-country basis, the period commencing on December 8, 2022, and ending\non the later of (a) the expiration of the last to expire Valid Claim (as defined in the Agreement) under a Licensed Patent (as defined in the Agreement), if any, in such country, (b) the\ndate of expiration of any other Exclusivity Right (as defined in the Agreement) or data protection period granted by a regulatory or other governmental authority with respect to a\nLicensed Product, or (c) 15 years from the date of First Commercial Sale (as defined in the Agreement) of a Licensed Product in such country.\nIn addition, Nexcella is required to pay sales milestone payments of up to $20 million for Net Sales exceeding $700 million and Nexcella has committed to funding NXC-201\nclinical trials in Israel over four years for an estimated total cost of approximately $13 million, spread out on a quarterly basis over that period, which Nexcella believes will generate\nclinical trial data owned by Nexcella. The term of the Agreement commenced on December 8, 2022 and, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms thereof, will continue in full\nforce and effect until the later of the expiration of the last Valid Claim under a Licensed Patent or a Joint Patent (as defined in the Agreement) or Exclusivity Right covering a\nLicensed Product or the expiration of a continuous period of 15 years during which there shall not have been a First Commercial Sale of any Licensed Product in any country in the\nworld. Licensors may terminate the Agreement immediately if Nexcella or its affiliates or sublicensees commences an action in which it challenges the validity, enforceability or\nscope of any of the Licensed Patents or Joint Patents. In addition, either party may terminate the Agreement if the other party materially breaches the Agreement and fails to cure\nsuch breach within 30 days. Additionally, Licensors may terminate the Agreement if Nexcella becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy.\nThe license remains with the Company after the Nexcella Absorption.\n28\nJuly 2023 ATM Offering\nOn July 14, 2023, we entered into an ATM Sales Agreement (the \"July Sales Agreement”) with the Sales Agent pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time,\nthrough the Sales Agent, shares of our common stock, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the July Sales Agreement. Initially, we are eligible to sell up to $4,200,000\nworth of shares of our common stock as the aggregate market value of our shares of common stock eligible for sale under the July Sales Agreement is subject to the limitations of\nGeneral Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 until such time that our public float equals or exceeds $75.0 million. In the event the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock\nheld by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $75.0 million, then the one-third limitation on sales set forth in General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 will not apply to additional sales made\npursuant to the July Sales Agreement. We agreed to pay the Sales Agent a commission rate of 3.75% of the aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of the shares of our common\nstock pursuant to the July Sales Agreement and have paid an expense deposit of $15,000 to the Sales Agent, which will be applied against the actual out-of-pocket accountable\nexpenses. In addition, we have agreed to reimburse the Sales Agent for all expenses related to the offering including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of the Sales Agent’s\nlegal counsel up to $50,000, and to reimburse the Sales Agent, upon request, for such costs, fees and expenses in an amount not to exceed $7,500 on a quarterly basis for the first\nthree fiscal quarters of each year and $10,000 for the fiscal fourth quarter of each year. The offering pursuant to the July Sales Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the\nsale of all of the shares of common stock subject to the July Sales Agreement and (ii) termination of the July Sales Agreement as permitted therein. We may terminate the July Sales\nAgreement in our sole discretion at any time by giving ten days’ prior notice to the Sales Agent. The Sales Agent may terminate the July Sales Agreement under the circumstances\nspecified in the July Sales Agreement and in its sole discretion at any time by giving ten days’ prior notice to us. In addition, the July Sales Agreement may be terminated upon\nmutual agreement by us and the Sales Agent.\nFrom July 14, 2023 through February 5, 2024, the Company has sold 328,136 common shares pursuant to the July ATM Facility for net proceeds of $1,091,887, after\noffering expenses. On February 5, 2024, the Company suspended, and is not offering any shares of its common stock pursuant to, the prospectus supplement dated July 14, 2023,\nrelating to the July Sales Agreement by and between the Company and ThinkEquity LLC. The Company will not make any sales of common stock pursuant to the July Sales\nAgreement unless and until a new prospectus supplement is filed with the SEC; however, the Sales Agreement remains in full force and effect.\nPublic Offering\nOn February 5, 2024, the Company entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the \"Agreement”) with Titan Partners Group LLC, a division of American Capital Partners,\nLLC (the \"Underwriter”), relating to an underwritten offering (the \"Offering”) of 5,535,055 shares of common stock of the Company. The public offering price was $2.71 per share of\nCommon Stock and the Underwriter agreed to purchase the Common Stock pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement at a price of $2.5203 per share. On February 8, 2024, the\nCompany closed the offering and received net proceeds of $13,565,760, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. Pursuant to the\nAgreement, the Company granted the Underwriter a 30-day over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 783,970 shares of Common Stock which was exercised in full on\nMarch 1, 2024 for net proceeds of $1,954,594, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.\nResults of Operations\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $2,949,403 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2,417,776 for the three months ended September 30,\n2023.\nThe expenses incurred in both periods were related to salaries, patent maintenance costs and general accounting and other general consulting expenses, which were\nhigher for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to increased investor relations services of $543,383, increased compensation expense of $355,670, due to hiring of\nadditional employees; and increased other general expenses of $11,227, offset by decreased professional services of $309,561 primarily driven by a significant decrease in legal fees\nrelated to the Nexcella subsidiary and decreased stock-based compensation of $69,092 from a reduction in equity awards issued.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense was $4,445,528 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2,106,020 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe increased research and development expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, were\nrelated to our ongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical trial and our CAR-T clinical trial, including, but not limited to, CRO and related costs for maintaining and treating patients in the clinical\ntrial, as well as site onboarding costs and license fees.\n29\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $256,680 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $186,691 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income in the\ncurrent period was related to interest received on investments in a money market fund and increased from the prior period as a result of the Company maintaining higher balances\nin money market funds during the current period.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $11,144, compared to $6,807 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to\nwithholding taxes relating to our Australian subsidiary.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $7,149,395, compared to $4,343,912 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which increase was due\nprimarily to the increase in general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses, as discussed in greater detail above.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $7,769,224 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5,130,977 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe expenses incurred in both periods were related to salaries, patent maintenance costs and general accounting and other general consulting expenses, which were\nhigher for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to increased investor relations services of $1,199,230, increased professional services of $65,764, both due to service\nscope expansion and price increases, increased compensation of $548,112 due to hiring additional employees, increased stock-based compensation of $462,645 from additional\nequity awards issued, and increased other general expenses of $362,496.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense was $9,918,336 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5,634,284 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe increased research and development expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were\nrelated to our ongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical trial and our CAR-T clinical trial, including, but not limited to, CRO and related costs for maintaining and treating patients in the clinical\ntrial, as well as site onboarding costs and license fees.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $831,503 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $343,431 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income in the\ncurrent period was related to interest received on investments in a money market fund, which increased as a result of the Company maintaining higher balances in money market\nfunds during the current period.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $30,252 compared to $18,326 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to\nwithholding taxes relating to our Australian subsidiary.\n30\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $16,886,309 compared to $10,440,156 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which increase was due\nprimarily to the increase in general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses, each as discussed in greater detail above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist of research and development expenditures and various general and administrative expenses. Cash\nused to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable, accrued expenses and\nprepaid expenses.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the\nexact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n● the scope, timing, progress and results of discovery, pre-clinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates;\n● the costs of manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials and in preparation for regulatory approval and commercialization;\n● the extent to which we enter into collaborations or other arrangements with additional third parties in order to further develop our product candidates;\n● the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related\nclaims;\n● the costs and fees associated with the discovery, acquisition or in-license of additional product candidates or technologies;\n● expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n● the costs associated with being a public company;\n● the costs required to scale up our clinical, regulatory and manufacturing capabilities;\n● the costs of future commercialization activities, if any, including establishing sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, for any of our product\ncandidates for which we receive regulatory approval; and\n● revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $16.2 million of working capital.\nOn July 25, 2024, the Company was awarded an $8 million grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) to support the clinical development of\nchimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy NXC-201 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis. The award is payable to the Company upon achievement of milestones\nthat are primarily based on patient enrollment in the Company’s clinical trials. Additionally, if CIRM determines, in its sole discretion, that the Company has not complied with the\nterms and conditions of the grant, CIRM may suspend or permanently cease disbursements. Funds received under this grant may only be used for allowable project costs\nspecifically identified with the CIRM-funded project. Such costs can include, but are not limited to, salary for personnel, itemized supplies, consultants, and itemized clinical study\ncosts. Under the terms of the grant, both CIRM and the Company will co-fund the research project and the amount of the Company’s co-funding requirement is predetermined as a\npart of the award. The Company signed the grant agreement in November 2024 and expects to begin receiving funds from the grant beginning in November of 2024.\n31\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at\nleast the next 12 months. However, we may need additional funds depending on our operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials, other research and development\nexpenditures, and general and administrative expenses. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings,\ngovernment or other third-party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements, other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the\nextent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, which dilution may be significant, and the\nterms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. If we raise additional funds through\ncollaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future\nrevenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or\ndebt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research, product development or future commercialization efforts,\nor grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nCash used in operating activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $13,118,904 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $8,694,001 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net\ncash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to our net loss of $16,886,309, offset by non-cash items of stock-based\ncompensation expense of $2,314,920, depreciation expense of $12,338 and right of use asset amortization of $61,713. Operating activities also included an increase in accounts\npayable and accrued expenses of $2,120,531, an increase in the tax receivable of $746,748, and an increase in prepaid expenses of $7,932. Net cash used in operating activities for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily related to our net loss of $10,440,156, offset by non-cash items of stock-based compensation expense of $1,514,900 and\ndepreciation expense of $2,392. Operating activities also included an increase in accounts payable of $1,580,248, an increase in the tax receivable of $427,476 and an increase in\nprepaid expenses of $923,909.\nCash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $670,529 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting solely of purchase of property and operating equipment,\ncompared to $38,912 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nCash provided by financing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $15,948,567 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $14,876,820 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2024 was related to proceeds of $15,946,078 from the sale of common shares through a public offering. Net cash provided by financing\nactivities in 2023 was related to proceeds of $5,002,284 from the sale of common shares through the at-the-market offerings, proceeds of $9,934,153 from the sale of common shares\nand pre-funded warrants in a private placement offering, and proceeds of $175,000 from the sale of common shares of our former majority-owned (now wholly-owned) subsidiary,\nNexcella, offset by payments of deferred offering costs of $234,617.\nOur continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain necessary financing to continue operations and the attainment of profitable operations. As\nof September 30, 2024, we have incurred an accumulated deficit of $70,212,617 and have not yet generated any revenue from operations. Management anticipates that our cash on\nhand and funds that may be raised pursuant to the July Sales Agreement and $8 million grant from CIRM will be sufficient to fund planned operations for at least 12 months from\nthe filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n32\nWe will have additional capital requirements going forward and may need to seek additional financing, which may or may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at\nall.\nJOBS Act\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \"JOBS Act”) was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \"emerging growth company” can\ntake advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an\n\"emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nWe have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying with new or revised\naccounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable\nto those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nSubject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an \"emerging growth company,” we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions, including, without limitation,\n(i) providing an auditor’s attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and (ii)\ncomplying with the requirement adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor’s report on\nfinancial statements. We will remain an \"emerging growth company” until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.235\nbillion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering (December 31, 2026); (iii) the date on which\nwe have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of\nthe SEC.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management regularly evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue\nrecognition, intangible assets, long-lived assets valuation, variable interest entities, and legal matters. Actual results may differ from these estimates which may be material. \"Note 2\n– Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the \"2022 Form 10-K”), and \"Critical Accounting Policies” in Part II, Item 7 of the 2023 Form 10-K describe the\nsignificant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical\naccounting policies and estimates since the 2023 Form 10-K.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nWe are not required to provide the information required by this Item as we are a \"smaller reporting company,” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.\n33\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our \"disclosure controls and\nprocedures” (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term\n\"disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to\nensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to a company’s management, including its principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and\nprocedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the\ncontrols system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.\nBased on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer has concluded that, based on such evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures\nwere not effective due to the material weakness described below.\nMaterial Weakness in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that existed as of December 31, 2023. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a\ncombination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial\nstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We determined that we had a material weakness because, due to our small size, and our limited number of personnel,\nwe did not have in place an effective internal control environment with formal processes and procedures, including adequate segregation of duties within account processes and\nsystems, and journal entry processing and review, to allow for a detailed review of accounting transactions that would identify errors in a timely manner. Based on our assessment,\nour management concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the material weakness still exists.\nNotwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we have concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements\nincluded in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nManagement’s Plan to Remediate the Material Weakness\nWe are committed to continually improving our internal controls over financial reporting. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, we appointed a new vice president of finance\nand accounting and director of corporate strategy, as part of our program to develop and implement effective internal controls over financial reporting. Additionally, management is\ncurrently working on the plan to address the material weaknesses noted above.\nThe material weaknesses will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period and management has concluded, through\ntesting, that these controls are operating effectively. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may decide that additional\nmeasures are necessary to address these identified control deficiencies.\nChanges in Internal Control\nOther than the remediation actions noted above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter\nthat have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n34\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent\nuncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or\nclaims that will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nRisk factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed in Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2023 (\"Annual Report”) as filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024 and below. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those previously disclosed in our\nAnnual Report, except as set forth below. You should carefully consider the risks described in our Annual Report and below, which could materially affect our business, financial\ncondition or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we\ncurrently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. If any of the risks actually occur, our business,\nfinancial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively affected.\nEconomic uncertainty may affect our access to capital and/or increase the costs of such capital.\nGlobal economic conditions continue to be volatile and uncertain due to, among other things, consumer confidence in future economic conditions, fears of recession and\ntrade wars, the price of energy, fluctuating interest rates, the availability and cost of consumer credit, the availability and timing of government stimulus programs, levels of\nunemployment, increased inflation, tax rates, and the war between Ukraine and Russia which began in February 2022, and Israel and Hamas, which began in October 2023 and\nwhich threatens to spread to other Middle Eastern countries. These conditions remain unpredictable and create uncertainties about our ability to raise capital in the future. In the\nevent required capital becomes unavailable in the future, or more costly, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, future results of operations, and financial\ncondition.\nOur outstanding options and warrants may adversely affect the trading price of our securities.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had (i) outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of 4,010,988 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of\n$2.03 per share; (ii) outstanding Pre-Funded warrants to purchase 1,913,661 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.0001; and (iii) outstanding warrants to purchase\n397,500 shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $4.11 per share (when not including the Pre-Funded warrants). For the life of the options and warrants,\nthe holders have the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock without assuming the risk of ownership. The issuance of shares upon the exercise of\noutstanding securities will also dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.\nThe availability of these shares for public resale, as well as any actual resales of these shares, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We cannot\npredict the size of future issuances of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of outstanding options or warrants or conversion of other securities, or the effect, if any, that\nfuture issuances and sales of shares of our common stock may have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our common stock\n(including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIn addition, the common stock issuable upon exercise/conversion of outstanding convertible securities may represent overhang that may also adversely affect the market\nprice of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a company’s stock in the market than there is demand for that stock. When this happens the price of\nour stock will decrease, and any additional shares which stockholders attempt to sell in the market will only further decrease the share price. If the share volume of our common\nstock cannot absorb shares sold by holders of our outstanding convertible securities, then the value of our common stock will likely decrease.\n35\nA significant number of our shares are eligible for sale and their sale or potential sale may depress the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock. Most of our common stock is available\nfor resale in the public market, including (a) outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of 4,010,988 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $2.03\nper share; (b) Pre-Funded warrants to purchase 1,913,661 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.0001; and (c) 3,241,076 shares of common stock, the resale of which\nhas been registered under the Securities Act. We have also filed certain Form S-8 Registration Statements pursuant to which we can issue unregistered stock in connection with\nawards under our equity plans. If a significant number of shares were sold, such sales would increase the supply of our common stock, thereby potentially causing a decrease in its\nprice. Some or all of our shares of common stock, including those discussed above, may be offered from time to time in the open market pursuant to effective registration\nstatements and/or compliance with Company insider trading policy, Exchange Act Section 16 and/or Rule 144, which sales could have a depressive effect on the market for our\nshares of common stock. Subject to certain restrictions, a person who has held restricted shares for a period of six months may generally sell common stock into the market. The\nsale of a significant portion of such shares when such shares are eligible for public sale may cause the value of our common stock to decline in value.\nWe may not receive the $8 million which we recently learned was granted to us by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine.\nOn July 25, 2024, the Company learned that it was awarded an $8 million grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) to support the clinical\ndevelopment of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy NXC-201 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis. The award is payable to the Company upon\nachievement of milestones that are primarily based on patient enrollment in the Company’s clinical trials. Additionally, if CIRM determines, in its sole discretion, that the Company\nhas not complied with the terms and conditions of the grant, CIRM may suspend or permanently cease disbursements. Funds received under this grant may only be used for\nallowable project costs specifically identified with the CIRM-funded project. Such costs can include, but are not limited to, salary for personnel, itemized supplies, consultants, and\nitemized clinical study costs. Under the terms of the grant, both CIRM and the Company will co-fund the research project and the amount of the Company’s co-funding\nrequirement is predetermined as a part of the award. The Company signed the grant agreement in November 2024 and expects to begin receiving funds from the grant beginning in\nNovember of 2024. The Company has not yet received any funds in connection with such award and may not receive funds on a timely basis, or at all, and such award may come\nwith conditions. The Company is required to complete certain requirements and agree to certain terms and conditions in connection with such grant, which have not been\ncompleted or agreed to as of the date of this Report. In the event the award was not received on a timely basis, or at all, or subject to conditions, the Company could be forced to\nseek out alternative funding which may not be on as favorable terms as such currently expected grant.\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 19,737 shares of restricted common stock valued at $37,500 for investor relations services based\non the closing price on the date of the agreement pursuant to a marketing services agreement entered into on September 20, 2024.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 31,641 shares of restricted common stock valued at $67,500 for investor relations services based\non the average closing price for the prior 10 trading days pursuant to a marketing services agreement entered into on July 25, 2023.\nSubsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company issued 27,062 shares of restricted common stock valued at $45,000 for investor relations services based on the average\nclosing price for the prior 10 trading days pursuant to a marketing services agreement entered into on July 25, 2023.\nThe issuances described above were exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2), and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act, since the foregoing\nissuances did not involve a public offering, the recipient took the securities for investment and not resale, we took take appropriate measures to restrict transfer, and the recipient\nwas (a) an \"accredited investor”; and/or (b) had access to similar documentation and information as would be required in a Registration Statement under the Securities Act. The\nsecurities are subject to transfer restrictions, and the securities contain an appropriate legend stating that such securities have not been registered under the Securities Act and\nmay not be offered or sold absent registration or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. The securities were not registered under the Securities Act and such securities may not be\noffered or sold in the United States absent registration or an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws.\n36\nITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION.\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of the Company’s directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f)) adopted or terminated\nany contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any\n\"non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement”.\nITEM 6.

(the \"Company”) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical pharmaceutical company organized as a Delaware corporation on January 7, 2014, which is focused on\ndeveloping cell therapies in AL Amyloidosis and select immune-mediated diseases. In August 2016, the Company established a wholly-owned Australian subsidiary, Immix\nBiopharma Australia Pty Ltd. (\"IBAPL”), in order to conduct various preclinical and clinical activities for its development candidates. In November 2022, the Company established\na majority-owned subsidiary, Nexcella, Inc. (\"Nexcella”), its cell therapy division, which subsequently merged into the Company in May 2024, with the Company continuing as the\nsurviving entity. To ensure continuity of operations, the Company re-established Nexcella in 2024 as a wholly-owned subsidiary\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation - The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP”) and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC”).\nThe Company’s fiscal year end is December 31.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures as of September 30, 2024, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are\nunaudited, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with\nU.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the Company’s opinion, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\ninclude all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for the fair statement of the results for the interim periods. These unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 which are\nincluded in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nare not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024.\nRisk and Uncertainties - The Company operates in a dynamic and highly competitive industry and is subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the\nbiotechnology industry, including, but not limited to, development by competitors of new technological innovations, protection of proprietary technology, dependence on key\npersonnel, contract manufacturers and contract research organizations, compliance with government regulations and the need to obtain additional financing to fund operations.\nProduct candidates currently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials and\nregulatory approval, prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel infrastructure and extensive compliance and\nreporting. The Company believes that changes in any of the following areas could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future financial position, results of operations,\nor cash flows; ability to obtain future financing; advances and trends in new technologies and industry standards; results of clinical trials; regulatory approval and market\nacceptance of the Company’s products; development of sales channels; certain strategic relationships; litigation or claims against the Company based on intellectual property,\npatent, product, regulatory, or other factors; and the Company’s ability to attract and retain employees necessary to support its growth.\nProducts developed by the Company require approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA”) or other international regulatory agencies prior to commercial sales.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company’s research and development will be successfully completed, that adequate protection for the Company’s intellectual property will be\nobtained or maintained, that the products will receive the necessary approvals, or that any approved products will be commercially viable. If the Company is denied approval,\napproval is delayed, or the Company is unable to maintain approval, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company. Even if the Company’s product development efforts\nare successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will generate revenue from product sales. The Company operates in an environment of rapid change in technology and\nsubstantial competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In addition, the Company is dependent upon the services of its employees, consultants and\nother third parties.\n8\nThe Company has expended and plans to continue to expend substantial funds to complete the research, development and clinical testing of product candidates. The Company\nalso will be required to expend additional funds to establish commercial-scale manufacturing arrangements and to provide for the marketing and distribution of products that\nreceive regulatory approval. The Company may require additional funds to commercialize its products. The Company is unable to entirely fund these efforts with its current\nfinancial resources and will need to raise additional funding in the future. If adequate funds are unavailable on a timely basis from operations or additional sources of financing, the\nCompany may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of its research or development programs which may materially and adversely affect its business, financial\ncondition and operations.\nUse of Estimates – The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.\nThe Company uses significant judgments when making estimates related to the valuation of deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances, accrual and prepayment of\nresearch and development expenses, and the valuation of stock-based compensation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nPrinciples of Consolidation – The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Immix Biopharma, Inc. and the accounts of its 100% owned\nsubsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. For previously consolidated entities where the Company owned less than 100% of\nthe subsidiary, the Company recorded net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in its condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss equal to\nthe percentage of the economic or ownership interest retained in such entities by the respective non-controlling parties.\nSegment Reporting - The Company manages its operations as a single segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions. The Company’s Chief\nOperating Decision Maker (\"CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer. The CODM allocates resources and evaluates the performance of the Company at the consolidated level using\ninformation about its revenues, gross profit, income from operations, and other key financial data. All significant operating decisions are based upon an analysis of the Company\nas one operating segment, which is the same as its reporting segment.\nLiquidity and Going Concern – These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will continue to realize its\nassets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. Since the initial public offering of its common stock in December 2021, the Company has financed its operations\nthrough various equity financing. On July 14, 2023, the Company entered into an additional ATM Sales Agreement (the \"July Sales Agreement”) with ThinkEquity LLC (the \"Sales\nAgent”), pursuant to which the Company, could, from time to time, issue and sell through the Sales Agent shares of the Company’s common stock in sales deemed to be \"at-the-\nmarket offerings” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"July ATM Facility”) (see Note 7). Initially, the Company is eligible to\nsell up to $4,200,000 worth of shares of its common stock as the aggregate market value of the Company’s shares of common stock eligible for sale under the July Sales Agreement\nis subject to the limitations of General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 until such time that the Company’s public float equals or exceeds $75.0 million. In the event the aggregate\nmarket value of the Company’s outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $75.0 million, then the one-third limitation on sales set forth in General\nInstruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 shall not apply to additional sales made pursuant to the July Sales Agreement.\nFrom July 14, 2023 through February 5, 2024, the Company has sold 328,136 common shares pursuant to the July ATM Facility for net proceeds of $1,091,887, after offering\nexpenses. On February 5, 2024, the Company suspended, and is not offering any shares of its common stock pursuant to, the prospectus supplement dated July 14, 2023, relating\nto the July Sales Agreement by and between the Company and the Sales Agent. The Company will not make any sales of common stock pursuant to the July Sales Agreement\nunless and until a new prospectus supplement is filed with the SEC; however, the July Sales Agreement remains in full force and effect.\nIn February 2024, the Company conducted an underwritten public offering of 5,535,055 shares of its common stock at the public offering price of $2.71 per share, for net proceeds of\n$13,565,760, after underwriter discounts and offering expenses (the \"Offering”). Pursuant to the underwriting agreement, the Company granted the underwriter a 30-day over-\nallotment option to purchase up to an additional 783,970 shares of the Company’s common stock, which was exercised in full on March 1, 2024, for net proceeds of $1,954,594, after\nunderwriting discounts and offering expenses (see Note 7).\n9\nOn July 25, 2024, the Company was awarded an $8 million grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine to support the clinical development of chimeric antigen\nreceptor T-cell therapy NXC-201 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis. The award is payable to the Company upon achievement of milestones that are primarily\nbased on patient enrollment in the Company’s clinical trials. Additionally, if CIRM determines, in its sole discretion, that the Company has not complied with the terms and\nconditions of the grant, CIRM may suspend or permanently cease disbursements. Funds received under this grant may only be used for allowable project costs specifically\nidentified with the CIRM-funded project. Such costs can include, but are not limited to, salary for personnel, itemized supplies, consultants, and itemized clinical study costs. Under\nthe terms of the grant, both CIRM and the Company will co-fund the research project and the amount of the Company’s co-funding requirement is predetermined as a part of the\naward. The Company signed the grant agreement in November 2024 and expects to begin receiving funds from the grant beginning in November of 2024.\nThe Company has a history of, and expects to continue to report, negative cash flows from operations and net losses. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash as of September 30, 2024 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nConcentration of Credit Risk – Periodically, the Company may carry cash and cash equivalents balances at financial institutions in excess of the federally insured limit of $250,000,\nor the Australian insured limit of AUD 250,000. At times, deposits held with financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided. The Company has not experienced\nlosses on these accounts and management believes that the credit risk with regard to these deposits is not significant.\nCash and Cash Equivalents – The Company’s cash equivalents include short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less when purchased and are\ncarried at fair value.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments – The carrying value of short-term instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, tax receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses,\napproximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments.\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset\nor liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs\nand minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company utilizes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurements, defined as follows:\nLevel 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability,\neither directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.\nLevel 3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.\n10\nThe following fair value hierarchy table presents information about the Company’s asset measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nFair Value Measurements at September 30, 2024\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nCash equivalents (money market funds) $ 18,650,711 $ - $ -\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had no liabilities required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nCash equivalents (money market funds) $ 16,113,006 $ - $ -\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had no liabilities required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nAustralian Tax Incentive – IBAPL is eligible to receive a cash refund from the Australian Taxation Office for eligible research and development (\"R&D”) expenditures under the\nAustralian R&D Tax Incentive Program (the \"Australian Tax Incentive”). The Australian Tax Incentive is recognized as a reduction to R&D expense when there is reasonable\nassurance that the relevant expenditure has been incurred, the amount can be reliably measured and that the Australian Tax Incentive will be received. The Company recognized\nadditional R&D expense of $66,594 and reductions to R&D expense of $378,390 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recognized\nreductions to R&D expense of $1,076,193 and $599,926 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDeferred Offering Costs – The Company had capitalized qualified legal, accounting and other direct costs related to its efforts to raise capital through the sale of its common stock\nunder the July ATM Facility. Deferred offering costs were deferred and being amortized ratably upon sales under the July ATM Facility to additional paid-in capital as a reduction\nof the July ATM proceeds. As a result of the Company pausing the July ATM Facility, all of the remaining deferred offering costs were immediately amortized to additional paid-in\ncapital as a reduction to the proceeds received in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, no remaining amounts of deferred offering costs were\ncapitalized related to the July ATM Facility.\nStock-Based Compensation – Stock-based compensation expense represents the estimated grant date fair value of the Company’s equity awards, consisting of stock options\nissued under the Company’s stock option plan and restricted common stock (see Note 7). The fair value of equity awards is recognized over the requisite service period of such\nawards (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the date of\ngrant and recognizes forfeitures as they occur. For stock awards for which vesting is subject to performance-based milestones, the expense is recorded over the remaining service\nperiod after the point when the achievement of the milestone is probable, or the performance condition has been achieved.\nResearch and Development Costs – R&D costs are expensed as incurred. R&D costs consist primarily of clinical research fees paid to consultants and outside service providers,\nother expenses relating to design, development and testing of the Company’s therapy candidates, and for license and milestone costs related to in-licensed products and\ntechnology. Costs incurred in obtaining technology licenses are charged to R&D expense if the technology licensed has not reached commercial feasibility and has no alternative\nfuture use. Such licenses purchased by the Company require substantial completion of research and development, regulatory and marketing approval efforts in order to reach\ncommercial feasibility and have no alternative future use.\nClinical trial costs are a component of R&D expenses. The Company estimates expenses incurred for clinical trials that are in process based on services performed under\ncontractual agreements with clinical research organizations and actual clinical investigators. Included in the estimates are (1) the fee per patient enrolled as specified in the clinical\ntrial contract with each institution participating in the clinical trial and (2) progressive data on patient enrollments obtained from participating clinical trial sites and the actual\nservices performed. Changes in clinical trial assumptions, such as the length of time estimated to enroll all patients, rate of screening failures, patient drop-out rates, number and\nnature of adverse event reports, and the total number of patients enrolled can impact the average and expected cost per patient and the overall cost of the clinical trial. The\nCompany monitors the progress of the trials and their related activities and adjusts expense accruals, when applicable. Adjustments to accruals are charged to expense in the\nperiod in which the facts give rise to the adjustments become known.\n11\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss) – Other comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation gains and losses. The cumulative amount of translation gains and\nlosses are reflected as a separate component of stockholders’ equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, as accumulated other comprehensive income.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transaction Gains (Losses) – The Company, and its wholly-owned subsidiary Nexcella, maintain their accounting records in U.S. Dollars. The\nCompany’s operating subsidiary, IBAPL, is located in Australia and maintains its accounting records in Australian Dollars, which is its functional currency. Assets and liabilities\nof the subsidiary are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates at the balance sheet date, equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rate and revenues and expenses\nare translated by using the average exchange rates for the period. Translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) in the\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Foreign currency denominated transactions are translated at exchange rates approximating those in effect at the\ntransaction dates. Gains (losses) resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations and comprehensive loss and were $(2,849) and $8,095 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $(22,326) and $6,372 for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nLoss Per Common Share - Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares\noutstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share is determined using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the\ndilutive effect of common stock equivalents. In periods when losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding excludes common stock\nequivalents because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. Basic weighted average shares outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include 1,913,661\nshares underlying Pre-Funded warrants to purchase common shares (See Note 7). As the shares underlying these Pre-Funded warrants can be issued for nominal consideration (an\nexercise price per share equal to $0.0001 per share), these shares are deemed to be issued for purposes of basic loss per common share. For the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s potentially dilutive shares, which were not included in the calculation of net loss per share, included stock options and warrants\nexercisable for 4,408,488 and 2,911,412 shares of common stock, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment - Included in property and equipment is construction-in-progress which consists of manufacturing space improvements and includes the costs of\nconstruction, machinery and equipment, and any interest charges arising from borrowings used to finance these assets during the period of construction or installation of the\nassets. No provision for depreciation is made on construction-in-progress until such time as the relevant assets are completed and ready for their intended use.\nEstimated useful lives of the Company’s assets are as follows:\nUseful Life\nOperating equipment 3-10 years\nElectronic equipment 3-5 years\nOffice equipment 3-5 years\nThe cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts, and any gain or loss are included in the Company’s results of\noperations. The costs of maintenance and repairs are recognized to expenses as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are capitalized.\nLeases - At the inception of a contract the Company determines if the arrangement is, or contains a lease. Operating lease right-of-use (\"ROU”) assets represent the Company’s\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and\nliabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nlease term.\nThe Company has made certain accounting policy elections whereby it (i) does not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for short-term leases (those with original terms of 12-\nmonths or less) and (ii) separates lease and non-lease elements of its operating leases as separate lease components. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nCompany did not have any finance leases.\n12\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures, which requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, on a retrospective basis. The Company has implemented this ASU effective\nJanuary 1, 2024, and determined no retrospective changes were necessary.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which expands the disclosures required for income taxes.\nThis ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis while\nretrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this pronouncement on its disclosures.\nNote 3 – Prior Agreements with Nexcella Subsidiary\nNexcella Absorption\nOn May 20, 2024, Nexcella, was merged (the \"Merger”) with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation (the \"Nexcella Absorption”). The Merger was\neffected pursuant to Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\"DGCL”) when the Company filed a Certificate of Ownership and Merger (\"Certificate of Merger”) with\nthe Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. Immediately prior to the Merger, the Company owned greater than 95% of outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis of\nNexcella, par value $0.0001 per share (the \"Nexcella Shares”), and 100% of the outstanding shares of each other class of capital stock of Nexcella. Under the DGCL, the only\napproval required was that of the Company’s Board of Directors for the Merger to become effective. As a result of the Merger, Nexcella ceased to exist and all assets, operations\nand other property and rights of Nexcella have been succeeded to by the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Merger, as a result of the Merger, each of the\noutstanding Nexcella Shares (other than Nexcella Shares held by the Company) were converted into common stock of the Company (\"Company Merger Shares”). In connection\nwith the Merger, the Company issued 989,876 shares of its common stock to the former stockholders of Nexcella (other than shares held by the Company) (including Company\ncommon stock issued to third-party cash investors in Nexcella) (the \"Merger Shares”). The shares were issued on a pro-rata basis and as such resulted in no change in fair value.\nIn addition, the Company issued to the former participants in the Nexcella 2022 Equity Incentive Plan, 275,759 restricted stock awards to receive common stock in the Company and\noptions to purchase up to 595,676 shares of Company common stock at an exercise price of $2.47 per share (the closing price on May 17, 2024), under the Company’s Amended and\nRestated 2021 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan. As such, as of May 20, 2024, the Founders Agreement and Management Services Agreement agreements listed below with Nexcella\nare no longer in effect.\nFounders Agreement\nEffective December 8, 2022, the Company entered into a Founders Agreement with Nexcella (the \"Nexcella Founders Agreement”).\nThe Nexcella Founders Agreement provided that prior to a Qualified IPO (as defined in Nexcella’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the \"Nexcella\nCOI”)) or Qualified Change in Control (as defined in the Nexcella COI), the Company shall provide funds to Nexcella as requested by Nexcella, in good faith, to be evidenced by a\nsenior unsecured promissory note. In exchange for the time and capital expended in the formation of Nexcella and the identification of specific assets, the acquisition of which\nbenefit Nexcella, on December 21, 2022, the Company loaned Nexcella approximately $2.1 million, evidenced by a senior unsecured promissory note, representing the up-front fee\nrequired to acquire Nexcella’s license agreement with Hadasit Medical Research Services & Development, Ltd. (\"HADASIT”) and BIRAD Research and Development Company\nLtd. (\"BIRAD”), and for use as working capital for its research and development activities. The note, which had a maturity date of January 31, 2030, accrued interest at a rate of\n7.875% per annum and was convertible into shares of common stock of Nexcella at a conversion price of $2.00 per share, subject to adjustment; provided, however, that such note\nshall automatically convert into shares of Nexcella common stock immediately prior to certain conversion triggers set forth in the note. Nexcella may not prepay the note without\nthe Company’s prior written consent. The note and accrued interest were converted in full prior to the Nexcella Absorption. The Nexcella Founders Agreement had a term of 15\nyears, which, upon expiration, would automatically renew for successive one-year periods unless terminated by the Company upon notice at least six months prior to the end of the\nterm or upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Nexcella Founders Agreement). In connection with the Nexcella Founders Agreement, the Company was\nissued 250,000 shares of Nexcella’s Class A Preferred Stock, 1,000,000 shares of Nexcella’s Class A Common Stock, and 5,000,000 shares of Nexcella’s common stock. The Class A\nPreferred Stock was identical to the common stock other than as to conversion rights, the PIK Dividend right (as defined below) and voting rights.\n13\nEach share of Class A Preferred Stock was convertible, at the Company’s option, into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Nexcella’s common stock, subject to certain\nadjustments. As a holder of Nexcella’s Class A Preferred Stock, the Company received on each March 13 (each a \"PIK Dividend Payment Date”) until the date all outstanding Class\nA Preferred Stock was converted into Nexcella’s common stock or redeemed (and the purchase price is paid in full), pro rata per share dividends paid in additional fully paid and\nnonassessable shares of Nexcella common stock (\"PIK Dividends”) such that the aggregate number of shares of common stock issued pursuant to such PIK Dividend was equal\nto 2.5% of Nexcella’s fully-diluted outstanding capitalization on the date that was one business day prior to any PIK Dividend Payment Date. In addition, as a holder of Class A\nPreferred Stock, the Company was entitled to cast for each share of Class A Preferred Stock held as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on matters\npresented to the stockholders of Nexcella, the number of votes that was equal to 1.1 times a fraction, the numerator of which was the sum of (A) the shares of outstanding Nexcella\ncommon stock and (B) the whole shares of Nexcella common stock into which the shares of outstanding Nexcella Class A Common Stock and the Class A Preferred Stock were\nconvertible and the denominator of which was the number of shares of outstanding Nexcella Class A Preferred Stock.\nEach share of Class A Common Stock was convertible, at the Company’s option, into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Nexcella’s common stock, subject to certain\nadjustments. In addition, upon a Qualified IPO (as defined in the Nexcella COI) or Qualified Change in Control (as defined in the Nexcella COI), each share of Class A Common\nStock would automatically convert into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Nexcella’s common stock; provided however, if at that time, the Class A Common Stock was not\nthen convertible into a number of shares of Nexcella common stock (or such other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Class A Common\nStock) that have a value of: (a) in the case of a Qualified IPO, at least $5,000,000 based on the initial offering price in such initial public offering, or (b) in the case of a Qualified\nChange in Control, at least $5,000,000 in cash or at least $5,000,000 of equity based on the implied value of a share of Nexcella common stock resulting from the price paid upon the\nconsummation of such Qualified Change of Control, the Class A Common Stock would automatically convert into such number of shares of Nexcella common stock (or such other\ncapital stock or securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Class A Common Stock) that have a value of $5,000,000 based on the initial offering price in such initial\npublic offering or the implied value of a share of Nexcella common stock resulting from the price paid upon the consummation of such Qualified Change of Control (or if such\nQualified Change of Control results in the Class A Shares being exchanged solely for cash, then $5,000,000 in cash). The Company was entitled to cast such number of votes equal\nto the number of whole shares of Nexcella common stock into which the Company’s Class A Common Stock was convertible as of the record date for determining stockholders\nentitled to vote on matters presented to the stockholders of Nexcella.\nIn addition to the foregoing, the Company was entitled to one vote for each share of Nexcella common stock held by it. Except as provided by law or by the Nexcella COI, holders\nof Nexcella Class A Common Stock and Class A Preferred Stock shall vote together with the holders of Nexcella common stock, as a single class.\nAs additional consideration under the Nexcella Founders Agreement, Nexcella also agreed to: (i) pay an equity fee in shares of common stock, payable within five business days of\nthe closing of any equity or debt financing for Nexcella or any of its respective subsidiaries that occurs after the effective date of the Nexcella Founders Agreement and ending on\nthe date when the Company no longer has majority voting control in Nexcella’s voting equity, equal to 2.5% of the gross amount of any such equity or debt financing; and (ii) pay\na cash fee equal to 4.5% of Nexcella’s annual Net Sales (as defined in the Nexcella Founders Agreement), payable on an annual basis, within 90 days of the end of each calendar\nyear. In the event of a Change of Control, Nexcella agreed to pay a one-time change in control fee equal to five times the product of (A) Net Sales for the 12 months immediately\npreceding the Change of Control and (B) 4.5%.\n14\nManagement Services Agreement\nEffective as of December 8, 2022, the Company entered into a Management Services Agreement (the \"Nexcella MSA”) with Nexcella. Pursuant to the terms of the Nexcella MSA,\nthe Company rendered management, advisory and consulting services to Nexcella. Services provided under the Nexcella MSA may include, without limitation, (i) advice and\nassistance concerning any and all aspects of Nexcella’s operations, clinical trials, financial planning and strategic transactions and financings and (ii) conducting relations on\nbehalf of Nexcella with accountants, attorneys, financial advisors and other professionals (collectively, the \"Services”). At the request of the Company, Nexcella utilized clinical\nresearch services, medical education, communication and marketing services and investor relations/public relation services of companies or individuals designated by the\nCompany, provided those services are offered at market prices. In consideration for the Services, Nexcella paid the Company an annual base management and consulting fee of\n$500,000 (the \"Annual Consulting Fee”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the first Annual Consulting Fee payment was not due until the first business day of the calendar quarter\nimmediately following the completion of the first equity financing for Nexcella that was in excess of $10 million in gross proceeds, which did not occur. Actual and direct out-of-\npocket expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in performing the Services were reimbursed to the Company by Nexcella.\nThe Nexcella MSA was terminated on May 20, 2024 in connection with the Nexcella Absorption. In addition, as a result of the Nexcella Absorption, the Class A Preferred Stock,\nClass A Common Stock, and the Founders Agreement cease to exist.\nNote 4 – Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets consist of the following as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nPrepaid research and development expenses $ 486,912 $ 412,773\nPrepaid insurance expense 73,813 263,927\nPrepaid investor relations expense 492,391 384,494\nOther current assets 36,521 44,582\nTotal prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 1,089,637 $ 1,105,776\nNote 5 – Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses consist of the following as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAccounts payable $ 3,288,579 $ 1,433,022\nAccrued research and development expenses 2,878,386 1,571,261\nAccrued professional services 93,385 38,639\nAccrued compensation and related expenses 198,095 577,854\nOther accrued expenses 43,341 101,007\nTotal accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 6,501,786 $ 3,721,783\n15\nNote 6 – Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nOperating equipment $ 534,162 $ 60,599\nOffice equipment 3,895 3,896\n538,057 64,495\nLess: Accumulated depreciation (26,652) (14,314)\n511,405 50,181\nConstruction in progress 844,019 -\n$ 1,355,424 $ 50,181\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, depreciation expense amounted to $12,338 and $2,392, respectively.

Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with\ncertainty, the Company does not currently have any pending litigation to which it is a party or to which its property is subject that it believes to be material. Regardless of the\noutcome, litigation can be costly and time consuming, and it can divert management’s attention from important business matters and initiatives, negatively impacting the\nCompany’s overall operations.\nEmployment Agreements\nOn June 18, 2021, the Company entered into an Employment Agreement with Ilya Rachman (as amended, the \"Rachman Employment Agreement”), effective for a three-year term,\nsubject to the terms of the agreement which provide that unless the Company and Dr. Rachman have otherwise agreed in writing, if Dr. Rachman continues to work for the\nCompany after the expiration of the term (which he has), his employment shall be under the same terms and conditions provided for in the Rachman Employment Agreement, except\nthat his employment will be on an \"at will” basis and the provisions of the agreement allowing for Dr. Rachman to terminate the agreement for \"good reason” and for Dr. Rachman\nto be paid severance in the event his employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by Dr. Rachman for good reason will no longer apply, and the Rachman\nEmployment Agreement currently remains in effect pursuant to such terms.

Our lead cell therapy candidate is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA”) investigational new drug (\"IND”) cleared CAR-\nT NXC-201, currently being evaluated in our ongoing United States Phase 1b/2 NEXICART-2 (NCT06097832) clinical trial and our ex-U.S. phase 1b/2a NEXICART-1 (NCT04720313)\nclinical trial.\nNXC-201 has been awarded Orphan Drug Designation (\"ODD”) by both the FDA and European Commission (\"EMA”) in AL Amyloidosis.\n25\nOur mission is to harness the immune system through innovative cell therapies and other modalities to deliver widely accessible cures in select immune-mediated diseases\nand other indications, as we believe patients are waiting.\nOur strategy is to:\n● Develop our lead candidate CAR-T NXC-201 in AL Amyloidosis and select immune-mediated diseases; and\n● Pursue development of NXC-201 and additional cell therapy candidates in other applicable indications where CAR-T is not an approved therapy today.\nOur N-GENIUS platform has produced our clinical-stage lead candidate NXC-201, a next-generation CAR-T for AL Amyloidosis and select immune-mediated diseases.\nFigure 1: ImmixBio Pipeline\nNXC-201 is in clinical trials to treat relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis.\nAL amyloidosis is a life-threatening immunological disorder in which an abnormal protein called amyloid builds up in tissues and organs. This abnormal protein is\nproduced by long-lived plasma cells (\"LLPCs”), a type of immune B-cell. The signs and symptoms of AL amyloidosis vary among patients because build-up may occur in the heart\n(most frequent cause of mortality), liver, kidneys, intestines, muscles, joints, nerves, or spleen, according to the National Institutes of Health (\"NIH”). Diagnosis is frequently\ndelayed, due to varied and non-specific symptoms including: fatigue, weight loss, shortness of breath, dizziness, and numbness in hands and feet. Upon diagnosis, many patients\nalready have late-stage disease, and are not aware of available treatment options and clinical trials.\nAs of September 2024, there are no FDA approved drugs for relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis.\nThe U.S. observed prevalence of relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis is growing 12% per year according to Staron, et al Blood Cancer Journal 2021, estimated to reach\n33,277 patients in 2024. Untreated patients with AL amyloidosis and cardiac involvement have a median survival of less than 1 year, according to Quock, et al. Journal of\nComparative Effective Research, 2023. The current market size for amyloidosis therapies is estimated at $3.6 billion, expected to reach $6 billion in 2027, according to Grand View\nResearch.\n26\nAs of September 2024, we have treated 3 relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients in the United States in our ongoing Phase 1b/2 multi-site NEXICART-2\n(NCT06097832) U.S. clinical trial. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center is the lead NEXICART-2 clinical site.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we have treated 13 relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients in our ongoing Phase 1b/2a NEXICART-1 (NCT04720313) ex-U.S. clinical trial.\nIn September 2023, the FDA granted ODD to NXC-201 for the treatment of AL Amyloidosis. If a product that has ODD subsequently receives the first FDA approval for\nthe disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other\napplications to market the same drug for the same indication for 7 years (except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug\nexclusivity).\nIn November 2023, the FDA cleared an IND application for NXC-201 to enroll U.S. patients into NXC-201 clinical trials.\nIn December 2023, NXC-201 clinical data in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis was presented in an oral presentation at the 65th annual American Society of Hematology\n(\"ASH”) meeting, covering 10 relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients treated with NXC-201, indicating an overall response rate of 100% (10/10) and a complete response rate\nof 70% (7/10).\nIn February 2024, the European Commission (\"EC”) granted orphan drug designation to NXC-201 for the treatment of AL Amyloidosis. Benefits of European ODD include:\n10 years of market exclusivity once authorized in the EU; Access to the EU centralized authorization procedure; and reduced fees for EU protocol assistance, marketing\nauthorization applications, inspections before authorization, applications for changes to marketing authorizations made after approval, and reduced annual fees.\nOur Other Programs\nOur other programs include NXC-201 for select immune-mediated diseases, a $25 billion combined annual market size according to Grand View Research and Fortune\nBusiness Insights and other preclinical candidates.\nWhile our focus is NXC-201 in AL Amyloidosis and select immune-mediated diseases, we continue to collect and organize IMX-110 data in monotherapy for soft tissue\nsarcoma, a $3 billion market size according to Medgadget, and in combination with anti-PD-1 for colorectal cancer, a $27 billion market size according to IndustryARC, to evaluate\nnext steps.\nSince inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing product and technology rights, conducting research and development, organizing and\nstaffing our Company, business planning and raising capital. We operate as one business segment and have incurred recurring losses, the majority of which are attributable to\nresearch and development activities and negative cash flows from operations. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities. Currently, our primary\nuse of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures, and to a lesser extent, general and administrative expenditures. We\nexpect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates through all stages of development and\nclinical trials and, ultimately, seek regulatory approval. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant\ncommercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. Furthermore, we incur costs associated with operating as a public company,\nincluding significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the\ntiming of our clinical trials and our expenses on other research and development activities.\n27\nAbsorption of Nexcella Subsidiary\nOn May 20, 2024, Nexcella, was merged (the \"Merger”) with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation. The Merger was effected pursuant to\nSection 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\"DGCL”) when the Company filed a Certificate of Ownership and Merger (\"Certificate of Merger”) with the Secretary of State\nof the State of Delaware. Immediately prior to the Merger, the Company owned greater than 95% of the outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis of Nexcella, par value\n$0.0001 per share (the \"Nexcella Shares”), and 100% of the outstanding shares of each other class of capital stock of Nexcella. Under the DGCL, the only approval required was that\nof the Company’s Board of Directors for the Merger to become effective. As a result of the Merger, Nexcella ceased to exist and all assets, operations and other property and rights\nof Nexcella have been succeeded to by the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Merger, as a result of the Merger, each of the outstanding Nexcella Shares (other\nthan Nexcella Shares held by the Company) were converted, into common stock of the Company (\"Company Merger Shares”). In connection with the Merger, the Company issued\n989,876 shares of its common stock to the former stockholders of Nexcella (other than shares held by the Company) (including Company common stock issued to third-party cash\ninvestors in Nexcella) (the \"Merger Shares”). In addition, the Company issued to the former participants in the Nexcella 2022 Equity Incentive Plan, 275,759 restricted stock awards\nto receive common stock in the Company and options to purchase up to 595,676 shares of Company common stock at an exercise price of $2.47 per share (the closing price on May\n17, 2024), under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2021 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan.\nResearch and License Agreement with Hadasit and BIRAD\nOn December 8, 2022, our subsidiary Nexcella entered into a Research and License Agreement (the \"Agreement”) with Hadasit Medical Research Services &\nDevelopment, Ltd. and BIRAD – Research and Development Company Ltd. (collectively, the \"Licensors”) pursuant to which the Licensors granted to Nexcella an exclusive,\nworldwide, royalty-bearing license throughout the world, except Israel, Cyprus and other countries in the Middle East (the \"Territory”) to an invention entitled \"Anti-BCMA CAR-\nT cells to target plasma cell” to develop, manufacture, have manufactured, use, market, offer for sale, sell, have sold, export and import Licensed Product (as defined in the\nAgreement). Pursuant to the Agreement, Nexcella paid the Licensors an upfront fee of $1,500,000 in December 2022. Additional quarterly payments totaling approximately $13.0\nmillion are due through September 2026 along with an annual license fee of $50,000. Nexcella has agreed to pay royalties to the Licensors equal to 5% of Net Sales (as defined in the\nAgreement) during the Royalty Period. \"Royalty Period” means for each Licensed Product, on a country-to-country basis, the period commencing on December 8, 2022, and ending\non the later of (a) the expiration of the last to expire Valid Claim (as defined in the Agreement) under a Licensed Patent (as defined in the Agreement), if any, in such country, (b) the\ndate of expiration of any other Exclusivity Right (as defined in the Agreement) or data protection period granted by a regulatory or other governmental authority with respect to a\nLicensed Product, or (c) 15 years from the date of First Commercial Sale (as defined in the Agreement) of a Licensed Product in such country.\nIn addition, Nexcella is required to pay sales milestone payments of up to $20 million for Net Sales exceeding $700 million and Nexcella has committed to funding NXC-201\nclinical trials in Israel over four years for an estimated total cost of approximately $13 million, spread out on a quarterly basis over that period, which Nexcella believes will generate\nclinical trial data owned by Nexcella. The term of the Agreement commenced on December 8, 2022 and, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms thereof, will continue in full\nforce and effect until the later of the expiration of the last Valid Claim under a Licensed Patent or a Joint Patent (as defined in the Agreement) or Exclusivity Right covering a\nLicensed Product or the expiration of a continuous period of 15 years during which there shall not have been a First Commercial Sale of any Licensed Product in any country in the\nworld. Licensors may terminate the Agreement immediately if Nexcella or its affiliates or sublicensees commences an action in which it challenges the validity, enforceability or\nscope of any of the Licensed Patents or Joint Patents. In addition, either party may terminate the Agreement if the other party materially breaches the Agreement and fails to cure\nsuch breach within 30 days. Additionally, Licensors may terminate the Agreement if Nexcella becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy.\nThe license remains with the Company after the Nexcella Absorption.\n28\nJuly 2023 ATM Offering\nOn July 14, 2023, we entered into an ATM Sales Agreement (the \"July Sales Agreement”) with the Sales Agent pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time,\nthrough the Sales Agent, shares of our common stock, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the July Sales Agreement. Initially, we are eligible to sell up to $4,200,000\nworth of shares of our common stock as the aggregate market value of our shares of common stock eligible for sale under the July Sales Agreement is subject to the limitations of\nGeneral Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 until such time that our public float equals or exceeds $75.0 million. In the event the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock\nheld by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $75.0 million, then the one-third limitation on sales set forth in General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 will not apply to additional sales made\npursuant to the July Sales Agreement. We agreed to pay the Sales Agent a commission rate of 3.75% of the aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of the shares of our common\nstock pursuant to the July Sales Agreement and have paid an expense deposit of $15,000 to the Sales Agent, which will be applied against the actual out-of-pocket accountable\nexpenses. In addition, we have agreed to reimburse the Sales Agent for all expenses related to the offering including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of the Sales Agent’s\nlegal counsel up to $50,000, and to reimburse the Sales Agent, upon request, for such costs, fees and expenses in an amount not to exceed $7,500 on a quarterly basis for the first\nthree fiscal quarters of each year and $10,000 for the fiscal fourth quarter of each year. The offering pursuant to the July Sales Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the\nsale of all of the shares of common stock subject to the July Sales Agreement and (ii) termination of the July Sales Agreement as permitted therein. We may terminate the July Sales\nAgreement in our sole discretion at any time by giving ten days’ prior notice to the Sales Agent. The Sales Agent may terminate the July Sales Agreement under the circumstances\nspecified in the July Sales Agreement and in its sole discretion at any time by giving ten days’ prior notice to us. In addition, the July Sales Agreement may be terminated upon\nmutual agreement by us and the Sales Agent.\nFrom July 14, 2023 through February 5, 2024, the Company has sold 328,136 common shares pursuant to the July ATM Facility for net proceeds of $1,091,887, after\noffering expenses. On February 5, 2024, the Company suspended, and is not offering any shares of its common stock pursuant to, the prospectus supplement dated July 14, 2023,\nrelating to the July Sales Agreement by and between the Company and ThinkEquity LLC. The Company will not make any sales of common stock pursuant to the July Sales\nAgreement unless and until a new prospectus supplement is filed with the SEC; however, the Sales Agreement remains in full force and effect.\nPublic Offering\nOn February 5, 2024, the Company entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the \"Agreement”) with Titan Partners Group LLC, a division of American Capital Partners,\nLLC (the \"Underwriter”), relating to an underwritten offering (the \"Offering”) of 5,535,055 shares of common stock of the Company. The public offering price was $2.71 per share of\nCommon Stock and the Underwriter agreed to purchase the Common Stock pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement at a price of $2.5203 per share. On February 8, 2024, the\nCompany closed the offering and received net proceeds of $13,565,760, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. Pursuant to the\nAgreement, the Company granted the Underwriter a 30-day over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 783,970 shares of Common Stock which was exercised in full on\nMarch 1, 2024 for net proceeds of $1,954,594, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.\nResults of Operations\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $2,949,403 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2,417,776 for the three months ended September 30,\n2023.\nThe expenses incurred in both periods were related to salaries, patent maintenance costs and general accounting and other general consulting expenses, which were\nhigher for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to increased investor relations services of $543,383, increased compensation expense of $355,670, due to hiring of\nadditional employees; and increased other general expenses of $11,227, offset by decreased professional services of $309,561 primarily driven by a significant decrease in legal fees\nrelated to the Nexcella subsidiary and decreased stock-based compensation of $69,092 from a reduction in equity awards issued.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense was $4,445,528 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2,106,020 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe increased research and development expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, were\nrelated to our ongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical trial and our CAR-T clinical trial, including, but not limited to, CRO and related costs for maintaining and treating patients in the clinical\ntrial, as well as site onboarding costs and license fees.\n29\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $256,680 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $186,691 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income in the\ncurrent period was related to interest received on investments in a money market fund and increased from the prior period as a result of the Company maintaining higher balances\nin money market funds during the current period.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $11,144, compared to $6,807 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to\nwithholding taxes relating to our Australian subsidiary.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $7,149,395, compared to $4,343,912 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which increase was due\nprimarily to the increase in general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses, as discussed in greater detail above.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $7,769,224 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5,130,977 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe expenses incurred in both periods were related to salaries, patent maintenance costs and general accounting and other general consulting expenses, which were\nhigher for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to increased investor relations services of $1,199,230, increased professional services of $65,764, both due to service\nscope expansion and price increases, increased compensation of $548,112 due to hiring additional employees, increased stock-based compensation of $462,645 from additional\nequity awards issued, and increased other general expenses of $362,496.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense was $9,918,336 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5,634,284 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe increased research and development expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were\nrelated to our ongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical trial and our CAR-T clinical trial, including, but not limited to, CRO and related costs for maintaining and treating patients in the clinical\ntrial, as well as site onboarding costs and license fees.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $831,503 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $343,431 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income in the\ncurrent period was related to interest received on investments in a money market fund, which increased as a result of the Company maintaining higher balances in money market\nfunds during the current period.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $30,252 compared to $18,326 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to\nwithholding taxes relating to our Australian subsidiary.\n30\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $16,886,309 compared to $10,440,156 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which increase was due\nprimarily to the increase in general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses, each as discussed in greater detail above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist of research and development expenditures and various general and administrative expenses. Cash\nused to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable, accrued expenses and\nprepaid expenses.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the\nexact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n● the scope, timing, progress and results of discovery, pre-clinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates;\n● the costs of manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials and in preparation for regulatory approval and commercialization;\n● the extent to which we enter into collaborations or other arrangements with additional third parties in order to further develop our product candidates;\n● the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related\nclaims;\n● the costs and fees associated with the discovery, acquisition or in-license of additional product candidates or technologies;\n● expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n● the costs associated with being a public company;\n● the costs required to scale up our clinical, regulatory and manufacturing capabilities;\n● the costs of future commercialization activities, if any, including establishing sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, for any of our product\ncandidates for which we receive regulatory approval; and\n● revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $16.2 million of working capital.\nOn July 25, 2024, the Company was awarded an $8 million grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) to support the clinical development of\nchimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy NXC-201 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis. The award is payable to the Company upon achievement of milestones\nthat are primarily based on patient enrollment in the Company’s clinical trials. Additionally, if CIRM determines, in its sole discretion, that the Company has not complied with the\nterms and conditions of the grant, CIRM may suspend or permanently cease disbursements. Funds received under this grant may only be used for allowable project costs\nspecifically identified with the CIRM-funded project. Such costs can include, but are not limited to, salary for personnel, itemized supplies, consultants, and itemized clinical study\ncosts. Under the terms of the grant, both CIRM and the Company will co-fund the research project and the amount of the Company’s co-funding requirement is predetermined as a\npart of the award. The Company signed the grant agreement in November 2024 and expects to begin receiving funds from the grant beginning in November of 2024.\n31\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at\nleast the next 12 months. However, we may need additional funds depending on our operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials, other research and development\nexpenditures, and general and administrative expenses. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings,\ngovernment or other third-party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements, other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the\nextent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, which dilution may be significant, and the\nterms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. If we raise additional funds through\ncollaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future\nrevenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or\ndebt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research, product development or future commercialization efforts,\nor grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nCash used in operating activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $13,118,904 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $8,694,001 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net\ncash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to our net loss of $16,886,309, offset by non-cash items of stock-based\ncompensation expense of $2,314,920, depreciation expense of $12,338 and right of use asset amortization of $61,713. Operating activities also included an increase in accounts\npayable and accrued expenses of $2,120,531, an increase in the tax receivable of $746,748, and an increase in prepaid expenses of $7,932. Net cash used in operating activities for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily related to our net loss of $10,440,156, offset by non-cash items of stock-based compensation expense of $1,514,900 and\ndepreciation expense of $2,392. Operating activities also included an increase in accounts payable of $1,580,248, an increase in the tax receivable of $427,476 and an increase in\nprepaid expenses of $923,909.\nCash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $670,529 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting solely of purchase of property and operating equipment,\ncompared to $38,912 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nCash provided by financing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $15,948,567 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $14,876,820 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2024 was related to proceeds of $15,946,078 from the sale of common shares through a public offering. Net cash provided by financing\nactivities in 2023 was related to proceeds of $5,002,284 from the sale of common shares through the at-the-market offerings, proceeds of $9,934,153 from the sale of common shares\nand pre-funded warrants in a private placement offering, and proceeds of $175,000 from the sale of common shares of our former majority-owned (now wholly-owned) subsidiary,\nNexcella, offset by payments of deferred offering costs of $234,617.\nOur continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain necessary financing to continue operations and the attainment of profitable operations. As\nof September 30, 2024, we have incurred an accumulated deficit of $70,212,617 and have not yet generated any revenue from operations. Management anticipates that our cash on\nhand and funds that may be raised pursuant to the July Sales Agreement and $8 million grant from CIRM will be sufficient to fund planned operations for at least 12 months from\nthe filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n32\nWe will have additional capital requirements going forward and may need to seek additional financing, which may or may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at\nall.\nJOBS Act\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \"JOBS Act”) was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \"emerging growth company” can\ntake advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an\n\"emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nWe have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying with new or revised\naccounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable\nto those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nSubject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an \"emerging growth company,” we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions, including, without limitation,\n(i) providing an auditor’s attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and (ii)\ncomplying with the requirement adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor’s report on\nfinancial statements. We will remain an \"emerging growth company” until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.235\nbillion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering (December 31, 2026); (iii) the date on which\nwe have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of\nthe SEC.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management regularly evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue\nrecognition, intangible assets, long-lived assets valuation, variable interest entities, and legal matters. Actual results may differ from these estimates which may be material. \"Note 2\n– Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the \"2022 Form 10-K”), and \"Critical Accounting Policies” in Part II, Item 7 of the 2023 Form 10-K describe the\nsignificant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical\naccounting policies and estimates since the 2023 Form 10-K.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nWe are not required to provide the information required by this Item as we are a \"smaller reporting company,” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.\n33\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our \"disclosure controls and\nprocedures” (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term\n\"disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to\nensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to a company’s management, including its principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and\nprocedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the\ncontrols system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.\nBased on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer has concluded that, based on such evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures\nwere not effective due to the material weakness described below.\nMaterial Weakness in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that existed as of December 31, 2023. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a\ncombination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial\nstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We determined that we had a material weakness because, due to our small size, and our limited number of personnel,\nwe did not have in place an effective internal control environment with formal processes and procedures, including adequate segregation of duties within account processes and\nsystems, and journal entry processing and review, to allow for a detailed review of accounting transactions that would identify errors in a timely manner. Based on our assessment,\nour management concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the material weakness still exists.\nNotwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we have concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements\nincluded in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nManagement’s Plan to Remediate the Material Weakness\nWe are committed to continually improving our internal controls over financial reporting. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, we appointed a new vice president of finance\nand accounting and director of corporate strategy, as part of our program to develop and implement effective internal controls over financial reporting. Additionally, management is\ncurrently working on the plan to address the material weaknesses noted above.\nThe material weaknesses will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period and management has concluded, through\ntesting, that these controls are operating effectively. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may decide that additional\nmeasures are necessary to address these identified control deficiencies.\nChanges in Internal Control\nOther than the remediation actions noted above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter\nthat have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n34\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent\nuncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or\nclaims that will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nRisk factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed in Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2023 (\"Annual Report”) as filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024 and below. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those previously disclosed in our\nAnnual Report, except as set forth below. You should carefully consider the risks described in our Annual Report and below, which could materially affect our business, financial\ncondition or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we\ncurrently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. If any of the risks actually occur, our business,\nfinancial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively affected.\nEconomic uncertainty may affect our access to capital and/or increase the costs of such capital.\nGlobal economic conditions continue to be volatile and uncertain due to, among other things, consumer confidence in future economic conditions, fears of recession and\ntrade wars, the price of energy, fluctuating interest rates, the availability and cost of consumer credit, the availability and timing of government stimulus programs, levels of\nunemployment, increased inflation, tax rates, and the war between Ukraine and Russia which began in February 2022, and Israel and Hamas, which began in October 2023 and\nwhich threatens to spread to other Middle Eastern countries. These conditions remain unpredictable and create uncertainties about our ability to raise capital in the future. In the\nevent required capital becomes unavailable in the future, or more costly, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, future results of operations, and financial\ncondition.\nOur outstanding options and warrants may adversely affect the trading price of our securities.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had (i) outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of 4,010,988 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of\n$2.03 per share; (ii) outstanding Pre-Funded warrants to purchase 1,913,661 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.0001; and (iii) outstanding warrants to purchase\n397,500 shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $4.11 per share (when not including the Pre-Funded warrants). For the life of the options and warrants,\nthe holders have the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock without assuming the risk of ownership. The issuance of shares upon the exercise of\noutstanding securities will also dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.\nThe availability of these shares for public resale, as well as any actual resales of these shares, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We cannot\npredict the size of future issuances of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of outstanding options or warrants or conversion of other securities, or the effect, if any, that\nfuture issuances and sales of shares of our common stock may have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our common stock\n(including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIn addition, the common stock issuable upon exercise/conversion of outstanding convertible securities may represent overhang that may also adversely affect the market\nprice of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a company’s stock in the market than there is demand for that stock. When this happens the price of\nour stock will decrease, and any additional shares which stockholders attempt to sell in the market will only further decrease the share price. If the share volume of our common\nstock cannot absorb shares sold by holders of our outstanding convertible securities, then the value of our common stock will likely decrease.\n35\nA significant number of our shares are eligible for sale and their sale or potential sale may depress the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock. Most of our common stock is available\nfor resale in the public market, including (a) outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of 4,010,988 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $2.03\nper share; (b) Pre-Funded warrants to purchase 1,913,661 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.0001; and (c) 3,241,076 shares of common stock, the resale of which\nhas been registered under the Securities Act. We have also filed certain Form S-8 Registration Statements pursuant to which we can issue unregistered stock in connection with\nawards under our equity plans. If a significant number of shares were sold, such sales would increase the supply of our common stock, thereby potentially causing a decrease in its\nprice. Some or all of our shares of common stock, including those discussed above, may be offered from time to time in the open market pursuant to effective registration\nstatements and/or compliance with Company insider trading policy, Exchange Act Section 16 and/or Rule 144, which sales could have a depressive effect on the market for our\nshares of common stock. Subject to certain restrictions, a person who has held restricted shares for a period of six months may generally sell common stock into the market. The\nsale of a significant portion of such shares when such shares are eligible for public sale may cause the value of our common stock to decline in value.\nWe may not receive the $8 million which we recently learned was granted to us by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine.\nOn July 25, 2024, the Company learned that it was awarded an $8 million grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) to support the clinical\ndevelopment of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy NXC-201 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis. The award is payable to the Company upon\nachievement of milestones that are primarily based on patient enrollment in the Company’s clinical trials. Additionally, if CIRM determines, in its sole discretion, that the Company\nhas not complied with the terms and conditions of the grant, CIRM may suspend or permanently cease disbursements. Funds received under this grant may only be used for\nallowable project costs specifically identified with the CIRM-funded project. Such costs can include, but are not limited to, salary for personnel, itemized supplies, consultants, and\nitemized clinical study costs. Under the terms of the grant, both CIRM and the Company will co-fund the research project and the amount of the Company’s co-funding\nrequirement is predetermined as a part of the award. The Company signed the grant agreement in November 2024 and expects to begin receiving funds from the grant beginning in\nNovember of 2024. The Company has not yet received any funds in connection with such award and may not receive funds on a timely basis, or at all, and such award may come\nwith conditions. The Company is required to complete certain requirements and agree to certain terms and conditions in connection with such grant, which have not been\ncompleted or agreed to as of the date of this Report. In the event the award was not received on a timely basis, or at all, or subject to conditions, the Company could be forced to\nseek out alternative funding which may not be on as favorable terms as such currently expected grant.\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 19,737 shares of restricted common stock valued at $37,500 for investor relations services based\non the closing price on the date of the agreement pursuant to a marketing services agreement entered into on September 20, 2024.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 31,641 shares of restricted common stock valued at $67,500 for investor relations services based\non the average closing price for the prior 10 trading days pursuant to a marketing services agreement entered into on July 25, 2023.\nSubsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company issued 27,062 shares of restricted common stock valued at $45,000 for investor relations services based on the average\nclosing price for the prior 10 trading days pursuant to a marketing services agreement entered into on July 25, 2023.\nThe issuances described above were exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2), and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act, since the foregoing\nissuances did not involve a public offering, the recipient took the securities for investment and not resale, we took take appropriate measures to restrict transfer, and the recipient\nwas (a) an \"accredited investor”; and/or (b) had access to similar documentation and information as would be required in a Registration Statement under the Securities Act. The\nsecurities are subject to transfer restrictions, and the securities contain an appropriate legend stating that such securities have not been registered under the Securities Act and\nmay not be offered or sold absent registration or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. The securities were not registered under the Securities Act and such securities may not be\noffered or sold in the United States absent registration or an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws.\n36\nITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION.\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of the Company’s directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f)) adopted or terminated\nany contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any\n\"non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement”.\nITEM 6.

These statements may be identified by such forward-\nlooking terminology as \"may,” \"should,” \"expects,” \"intends,” \"plans,” \"anticipates,” \"believes,” \"estimates,” \"predicts,” \"potential,” \"continue” or the negative of these terms or\nother comparable terminology. Our forward-looking statements are based on a series of expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about our company, are not\nguarantees of future results or performance and involve substantial risks and uncertainty. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in these\nforward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in these forward-looking statements. Our\nbusiness and our forward-looking statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties inherent in our statements\nregarding:\n● our projected financial position and estimated cash burn rate;\n● our estimates regarding expenses, future revenues and capital requirements;\n● our ability to continue as a going concern;\n● our need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations, the availability and terms of such funding, and dilution caused thereby;\n● the success, cost and timing of our clinical trials;\n● our dependence on third parties in the conduct of our clinical trials;\n● our ability to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to market and commercialize our product candidates;\n● the ultimate impact of a health epidemic, on our business, our clinical trials, our research programs, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole;\n● the potential that results of pre-clinical and clinical trials indicate our current product candidates or any future product candidates we may seek to develop are unsafe or\nineffective;\n● the results of market research conducted by us or others;\n● our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our current and future product candidates;\n● our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and the potential for us to incur substantial costs from lawsuits to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights;\n● the possibility that a third party may claim we or our third-party licensors have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights and that\nwe may incur substantial costs and be required to devote substantial time defending against claims against us;\n● our reliance on third-party suppliers and manufacturers;\n● the success of competing therapies and products that are or become available;\n● our ability to expand our organization to accommodate potential growth and our ability to retain and attract key personnel;\n● the potential for us to incur substantial costs resulting from product liability lawsuits against us and the potential for these product liability lawsuits to cause us to limit\nour commercialization of our product candidates;\n● market acceptance of our product candidates, the size and growth of the potential markets for our current product candidates and any future product candidates we may\nseek to develop, and our ability to serve those markets; and\n● the successful development of our commercialization capabilities, including sales and marketing capabilities.\nAll of our forward-looking statements are as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q only. In each case, actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking\ninformation. We can give no assurance that such expectations or forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. An occurrence of, or any material adverse change in, one or\nmore of the risk factors or risks and uncertainties referred to in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024, this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q or included in our other public disclosures or our other periodic reports or other documents or filings filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission (the \"SEC”) could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Except as required by law, we\ndo not undertake or plan to update or revise any such forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in plans, assumptions, estimates or projections or other\ncircumstances affecting such forward-looking statements occurring after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, even if such results, changes or circumstances make it\nclear that any forward-looking information will not be realized. Any public statements or disclosures by us following this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that modify or impact any\nof the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will be deemed to modify or supersede such statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may include market data and certain industry data and forecasts, which we may obtain from internal company surveys, market research,\nconsultant surveys, publicly available information, reports of governmental agencies and industry publications, articles and surveys.

(the \"Company”) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical pharmaceutical company organized as a Delaware corporation on January 7, 2014, which is focused on\ndeveloping cell therapies in AL Amyloidosis and autoimmune disease. In August 2016, the Company established a wholly-owned Australian subsidiary, Immix Biopharma\nAustralia Pty Ltd. (\"IBAPL”), in order to conduct various preclinical and clinical activities for its development candidates. In November 2022, the Company established a majority-\nowned subsidiary, Nexcella, Inc. (\"Nexcella”), its cell therapy division, which subsequently merged into the Company in May 2024, with the Company continuing as the surviving\nentity. To ensure continuity of operations, the Company re-established Nexcella in 2024 as a wholly-owned subsidiary.\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation - The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP”) and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC”).\nThe Company’s fiscal year end is December 31.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures as of June 30, 2024, and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 are unaudited,\npursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP\nhave been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the Company’s opinion, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all\nadjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for the fair statement of the results for the interim periods. These unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 which are included in the\nCompany’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024. The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, are not necessarily\nindicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024.\nRisk and Uncertainties - The Company operates in a dynamic and highly competitive industry and is subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the\nbiotechnology industry, including, but not limited to, development by competitors of new technological innovations, protection of proprietary technology, dependence on key\npersonnel, contract manufacturers and contract research organizations, compliance with government regulations and the need to obtain additional financing to fund operations.\nProduct candidates currently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials and\nregulatory approval, prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel infrastructure and extensive compliance and\nreporting. The Company believes that changes in any of the following areas could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future financial position, results of operations,\nor cash flows; ability to obtain future financing; advances and trends in new technologies and industry standards; results of clinical trials; regulatory approval and market\nacceptance of the Company’s products; development of sales channels; certain strategic relationships; litigation or claims against the Company based on intellectual property,\npatent, product, regulatory, or other factors; and the Company’s ability to attract and retain employees necessary to support its growth.\n8\nProducts developed by the Company require approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA”) or other international regulatory agencies prior to commercial sales.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company’s research and development will be successfully completed, that adequate protection for the Company’s intellectual property will be\nobtained or maintained, that the products will receive the necessary approvals, or that any approved products will be commercially viable. If the Company is denied approval,\napproval is delayed, or the Company is unable to maintain approval, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company. Even if the Company’s product development efforts\nare successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will generate revenue from product sales. The Company operates in an environment of rapid change in technology and\nsubstantial competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In addition, the Company is dependent upon the services of its employees, consultants and\nother third parties.\nThe Company has expended and plans to continue to expend substantial funds to complete the research, development and clinical testing of product candidates. The Company\nalso will be required to expend additional funds to establish commercial-scale manufacturing arrangements and to provide for the marketing and distribution of products that\nreceive regulatory approval. The Company may require additional funds to commercialize its products. The Company is unable to entirely fund these efforts with its current\nfinancial resources and will need to raise additional funding in the future. If adequate funds are unavailable on a timely basis from operations or additional sources of financing, the\nCompany may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of its research or development programs which may materially and adversely affect its business, financial\ncondition and operations.\nUse of Estimates – The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.\nThe Company uses significant judgments when making estimates related to the valuation of deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances, accrual and prepayment of\nresearch and development expenses, and the valuation of stock-based compensation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nPrinciples of Consolidation – The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Immix Biopharma, Inc. and the accounts of its 100% owned\nsubsidiaries, IBAPL and Nexcella. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. For previously consolidated entities where the Company\nowned less than 100% of the subsidiary, the Company recorded net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in its condensed consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive loss equal to the percentage of the economic or ownership interest retained in such entities by the respective non-controlling parties.\nSegment Reporting - The Company manages its operations as a single segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions. The Company’s Chief\nOperating Decision Maker (\"CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer. The CODM allocates resources and evaluates the performance of the Company at the consolidated level using\ninformation about its revenues, gross profit, income from operations, and other key financial data. All significant operating decisions are based upon an analysis of the Company\nas one operating segment, which is the same as its reporting segment.\nLiquidity and Going Concern – These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will continue to realize its\nassets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to obtain\nfinancing to continue operations. Since the initial public offering of its common stock in December 2021, the Company has financed its operations through various equity\nfinancing. On July 14, 2023, the Company entered into an additional ATM Sales Agreement (the \"July Sales Agreement”) with the Sales Agent, pursuant to which the Company,\nmay, from time to time, issue and sell through the Sales Agent shares of the Company’s common stock in sales deemed to be \"at-the-market offerings” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4)\npromulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"July ATM Facility”) (see Note 7). Initially, the Company is eligible to sell up to $4,200,000 worth of shares of its\ncommon stock as the aggregate market value of the Company’s shares of common stock eligible for sale under the July Sales Agreement is subject to the limitations of General\nInstruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 until such time that the Company’s public float equals or exceeds $75.0 million. In the event the aggregate market value of the Company’s outstanding\ncommon stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $75.0 million, then the one-third limitation on sales set forth in General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 shall not apply to\nadditional sales made pursuant to the July Sales Agreement.\n9\nFrom July 14, 2023 through February 5, 2024, the Company has sold 328,136 common shares pursuant to the July ATM Facility for net proceeds of $1,091,887, after offering\nexpenses. On February 5, 2024, the Company suspended, and is not offering any shares of its common stock pursuant to, the prospectus supplement dated July 14, 2023, relating\nto the July Sales Agreement by and between the Company and ThinkEquity LLC. The Company will not make any sales of common stock pursuant to the July Sales Agreement\nunless and until a new prospectus supplement is filed with the SEC; however, the Sales Agreement remains in full force and effect.\nIn February 2024, the Company conducted an underwritten public offering of 5,535,055 shares of its common stock at the public offering price of $2.71 per share, for net proceeds of\n$13,565,760, after underwriter discounts and offering expenses (the \"Offering”). Pursuant to the underwriting agreement, the Company granted the underwriter a 30-day over-\nallotment option to purchase up to an additional 783,970 shares of the Company’s common stock, which was exercised in full on March 1, 2024, for net proceeds of $1,954,594, after\nunderwriting discounts and offering expenses (see Note 7).\nOn July 25, 2024, the Company was awarded an $8 million grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine to support the clinical development of chimeric antigen\nreceptor T-cell therapy NXC-201 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis. The award is payable to the Company upon achievement of milestones that are primarily\nbased on patient enrollment in the Company’s clinical trials. Additionally, if CIRM determines, in its sole discretion, that the Company has not complied with the terms and\nconditions of the grant, CIRM may suspend or permanently cease disbursements. Funds received under this grant may only be used for allowable project costs specifically\nidentified with the CIRM-funded project. Such costs can include, but are not limited to, salary for personnel, itemized supplies, consultants, and itemized clinical study costs. Under\nthe terms of the grant, both CIRM and the Company will co-fund the research project and the amount of the Company’s co-funding requirement is predetermined as a part of the\naward. The Company expects to begin receiving funds from the grant beginning in September of 2024.\nThe Company has a history of, and expects to continue to report, negative cash flows from operations and net losses. While the Company’s estimates of its operating expenses\nand working capital requirements could change significantly based on feedback from the FDA, test results, changes to the nature or timing of future studies or other research and\ndevelopment activities and the Company may use its cash resources faster than it anticipates, management believes that its cash and cash equivalents on hand at June 30, 2024 will\nbe sufficient to meet the Company’s working capital requirements through at least August 12, 2025.\nConcentration of Credit Risk – Periodically, the Company may carry cash and cash equivalents balances at financial institutions in excess of the federally insured limit of $250,000,\nor the Australian insured limit of AUD 250,000. At times, deposits held with financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided. The Company has not experienced\nlosses on these accounts and management believes that the credit risk with regard to these deposits is not significant.\nCash and Cash Equivalents – The Company’s cash equivalents include short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less when purchased and are\ncarried at fair value.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments – The carrying value of short-term instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, tax receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses,\napproximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments.\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset\nor liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs\nand minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company utilizes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurements, defined as follows:\nLevel 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability,\neither directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.\nLevel 3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.\n10\nThe following fair value hierarchy table presents information about the Company’s asset measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nFair Value Measurements at June 30, 2024\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nCash equivalents (money market funds) $ 22,400,473 $ - $ -\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had no liabilities required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nCash equivalents (money market funds) $ 16,113,006 $ - $ -\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had no liabilities required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nAustralian Tax Incentive – IBAPL is eligible to receive a cash refund from the Australian Taxation Office for eligible research and development (\"R&D”) expenditures under the\nAustralian R&D Tax Incentive Program (the \"Australian Tax Incentive”). The Australian Tax Incentive is recognized as a reduction to R&D expense when there is reasonable\nassurance that the relevant expenditure has been incurred, the amount can be reliably measured and that the Australian Tax Incentive will be received. The Company recognized\nreductions to R&D expense of $231,247 and $149,349 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recognized reductions to R&D expense of\n$1,142,787 and $221,537 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDeferred Offering Costs – The Company had capitalized qualified legal, accounting and other direct costs related to its efforts to raise capital through the sale of its common stock\nunder the July ATM Facility. Deferred offering costs were deferred and being amortized ratably upon sales under the July ATM Facility to additional paid-in capital as a reduction\nof the July ATM proceeds. As a result of the Company pausing the July ATM Facility, all of the remaining deferred offering costs were immediately amortized to additional paid-in\ncapital as a reduction to the proceeds received in the six months ended June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2024, no remaining amounts of deferred offering costs were capitalized related\nto the July ATM Facility.\nStock-Based Compensation – Stock-based compensation expense represents the estimated grant date fair value of the Company’s equity awards, consisting of stock options\nissued under the Company’s stock option plan and restricted common stock (see Note 7). The fair value of equity awards is recognized over the requisite service period of such\nawards (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the date of\ngrant and recognizes forfeitures as they occur. For stock awards for which vesting is subject to performance-based milestones, the expense is recorded over the remaining service\nperiod after the point when the achievement of the milestone is probable, or the performance condition has been achieved.\nResearch and Development Costs – R&D costs are expensed as incurred. R&D costs consist primarily of clinical research fees paid to consultants and outside service providers,\nother expenses relating to design, development and testing of the Company’s therapy candidates, and for license and milestone costs related to in-licensed products and\ntechnology. Costs incurred in obtaining technology licenses are charged to R&D expense if the technology licensed has not reached commercial feasibility and has no alternative\nfuture use. Such licenses purchased by the Company require substantial completion of research and development, regulatory and marketing approval efforts in order to reach\ncommercial feasibility and have no alternative future use.\n11\nClinical trial costs are a component of R&D expenses. The Company estimates expenses incurred for clinical trials that are in process based on services performed under\ncontractual agreements with clinical research organizations and actual clinical investigators. Included in the estimates are (1) the fee per patient enrolled as specified in the clinical\ntrial contract with each institution participating in the clinical trial and (2) progressive data on patient enrollments obtained from participating clinical trial sites and the actual\nservices performed. Changes in clinical trial assumptions, such as the length of time estimated to enroll all patients, rate of screening failures, patient drop-out rates, number and\nnature of adverse event reports, and the total number of patients enrolled can impact the average and expected cost per patient and the overall cost of the clinical trial. The\nCompany monitors the progress of the trials and their related activities and adjusts expense accruals, when applicable. Adjustments to accruals are charged to expense in the\nperiod in which the facts give rise to the adjustments become known.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss) – Other comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation gains and losses. The cumulative amount of translation gains and\nlosses are reflected as a separate component of stockholders’ equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, as accumulated other comprehensive income.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transaction Gains (Losses) – The Company, and its wholly-owned subsidiary Nexcella, maintain their accounting records in U.S. Dollars. The\nCompany’s operating subsidiary, IBAPL, is located in Australia and maintains its accounting records in Australian Dollars, which is its functional currency. Assets and liabilities\nof the subsidiary are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates at the balance sheet date, equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rate and revenues and expenses\nare translated by using the average exchange rates for the period. Translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) in the\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Foreign currency denominated transactions are translated at exchange rates approximating those in effect at the\ntransaction dates. Gains (losses) resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations and comprehensive loss and were $18,705 and $(1,449) for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $(19,477) and $(1,723) for the\nsix months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nLoss Per Common Share - Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares\noutstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share is determined using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the\ndilutive effect of common stock equivalents. In periods when losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding excludes common stock\nequivalents because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. Basic weighted average shares outstanding for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 include 1,913,661 shares\nunderlying Pre-Funded warrants to purchase common shares (See Note 7). As the shares underlying these Pre-Funded warrants can be issued for nominal consideration (an\nexercise price per share equal to $0.0001 per share), these shares are deemed to be issued for purposes of basic loss per common share. For the three and six months ended June 30,\n2024 and 2023, the Company’s potentially dilutive shares, which were not included in the calculation of net loss per share, included stock options and warrants exercisable for\n4,397,488 and 2,168,742 shares of common stock, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment - Included in property and equipment is construction-in-progress which consists of manufacturing space improvements and includes the costs of\nconstruction, machinery and equipment, and any interest charges arising from borrowings used to finance these assets during the period of construction or installation of the\nassets. No provision for depreciation is made on construction-in-progress until such time as the relevant assets are completed and ready for their intended use.\nEstimated useful lives of the Company’s assets are as follows:\nUseful Life\nOperating equipment 3-10 years\nElectronic equipment 3-5 years\nOffice equipment 3-5 years\nThe cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts, and any gain or loss are included in the Company’s results of\noperations. The costs of maintenance and repairs are recognized to expenses as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are capitalized.\n12\nLeases - At the inception of a contract the Company determines if the arrangement is, or contains a lease. Operating lease right-of-use (\"ROU”) assets represent the Company’s\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and\nliabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nlease term.\nThe Company has made certain accounting policy elections whereby it (i) does not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for short-term leases (those with original terms of 12-\nmonths or less) and (ii) separates lease and non-lease elements of its operating leases as separate lease components. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did\nnot have any finance leases.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures, which requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, on a retrospective basis. The Company has implemented this ASU effective\nJanuary 1, 2024, and determined no retrospective changes were necessary.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which expands the disclosures required for income taxes.\nThis ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis while\nretrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this pronouncement on its disclosures.\nNote 3 – Prior Agreements with Nexcella Subsidiary\nNexcella Absorption\nOn May 20, 2024, Nexcella, was merged (the \"Merger”) with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation (the \"Nexcella Absorption”). The Merger was\neffected pursuant to Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\"DGCL”) when the Company filed a Certificate of Ownership and Merger (\"Certificate of Merger”) with\nthe Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. Immediately prior to the Merger, the Company owned greater than 95% of outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis of\nNexcella, par value $0.0001 per share (the \"Nexcella Shares”), and 100% of the outstanding shares of each other class of capital stock of Nexcella. Under the DGCL, the only\napproval required was that of the Company’s Board of Directors for the Merger to become effective. As a result of the Merger, Nexcella ceased to exist and all assets, operations\nand other property and rights of Nexcella have been succeeded to by the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Merger, as a result of the Merger, each of the\noutstanding Nexcella Shares (other than Nexcella Shares held by the Company) were converted, into common stock of the Company (\"Company Merger Shares”). In connection\nwith the Merger, the Company issued 989,876 shares of its common stock to the former stockholders of Nexcella (other than shares held by the Company) (including Company\ncommon stock issued to third-party cash investors in Nexcella) (the \"Merger Shares”). The shares were issued on a pro-rata basis and as such resulted in no change in fair value.\nIn addition, the Company issued to the former participants in the Nexcella 2022 Equity Incentive Plan, 275,759 restricted stock awards to receive common stock in the Company and\noptions to purchase up to 595,676 shares of Company common stock at an exercise price of $2.47 per share (the closing price on May 17, 2024), under the Company’s Amended and\nRestated 2021 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan. As such, as of May 20, 2024, the Founders Agreement and Management Services Agreement agreements listed below with Nexcella\nare no longer in effect.\nFounders Agreement\nEffective December 8, 2022, the Company entered into a Founders Agreement with Nexcella (the \"Nexcella Founders Agreement”).\n13\nThe Nexcella Founders Agreement provided that prior to a Qualified IPO (as defined in Nexcella’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the \"Nexcella\nCOI”)) or Qualified Change in Control (as defined in the Nexcella COI), the Company shall provide funds to Nexcella as requested by Nexcella, in good faith, to be evidenced by a\nsenior unsecured promissory note. In exchange for the time and capital expended in the formation of Nexcella and the identification of specific assets, the acquisition of which\nbenefit Nexcella, on December 21, 2022, the Company loaned Nexcella approximately $2.1 million, evidenced by a senior unsecured promissory note, representing the up-front fee\nrequired to acquire Nexcella’s license agreement with Hadasit Medical Research Services & Development, Ltd. (\"HADASIT”) and BIRAD Research and Development Company\nLtd. (\"BIRAD”), and for use as working capital for its research and development activities. The note, which had a maturity date of January 31, 2030, accrued interest at a rate of\n7.875% per annum and was convertible into shares of common stock of Nexcella at a conversion price of $2.00 per share, subject to adjustment; provided, however, that such note\nshall automatically convert into shares of Nexcella common stock immediately prior to certain conversion triggers set forth in the note. Nexcella may not prepay the note without\nthe Company’s prior written consent. The note and accrued interest were converted in full prior to the Nexcella Absorption The Nexcella Founders Agreement had a term of 15\nyears, which, upon expiration, would automatically renew for successive one-year periods unless terminated by the Company upon notice at least six months prior to the end of the\nterm or upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Nexcella Founders Agreement). In connection with the Nexcella Founders Agreement, the Company was\nissued 250,000 shares of Nexcella’s Class A Preferred Stock, 1,000,000 shares of Nexcella’s Class A Common Stock, and 5,000,000 shares of Nexcella’s common stock. The Class A\nPreferred Stock was identical to the common stock other than as to conversion rights, the PIK Dividend right (as defined below) and voting rights.\nEach share of Class A Preferred Stock was convertible, at the Company’s option, into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Nexcella’s common stock, subject to certain\nadjustments. As a holder of Nexcella’s Class A Preferred Stock, the Company received on each March 13 (each a \"PIK Dividend Payment Date”) until the date all outstanding Class\nA Preferred Stock was converted into Nexcella’s common stock or redeemed (and the purchase price is paid in full), pro rata per share dividends paid in additional fully paid and\nnonassessable shares of Nexcella common stock (\"PIK Dividends”) such that the aggregate number of shares of common stock issued pursuant to such PIK Dividend was equal\nto 2.5% of Nexcella’s fully-diluted outstanding capitalization on the date that was one business day prior to any PIK Dividend Payment Date. In addition, as a holder of Class A\nPreferred Stock, the Company was entitled to cast for each share of Class A Preferred Stock held as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on matters\npresented to the stockholders of Nexcella, the number of votes that was equal to 1.1 times a fraction, the numerator of which was the sum of (A) the shares of outstanding Nexcella\ncommon stock and (B) the whole shares of Nexcella common stock into which the shares of outstanding Nexcella Class A Common Stock and the Class A Preferred Stock were\nconvertible and the denominator of which was the number of shares of outstanding Nexcella Class A Preferred Stock.\nEach share of Class A Common Stock was convertible, at the Company’s option, into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Nexcella’s common stock, subject to certain\nadjustments. In addition, upon a Qualified IPO (as defined in the Nexcella COI) or Qualified Change in Control (as defined in the Nexcella COI), each share of Class A Common\nStock would automatically convert into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Nexcella’s common stock; provided however, if at that time, the Class A Common Stock was not\nthen convertible into a number of shares of Nexcella common stock (or such other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Class A Common\nStock) that have a value of: (a) in the case of a Qualified IPO, at least $5,000,000 based on the initial offering price in such initial public offering, or (b) in the case of a Qualified\nChange in Control, at least $5,000,000 in cash or at least $5,000,000 of equity based on the implied value of a share of Nexcella common stock resulting from the price paid upon the\nconsummation of such Qualified Change of Control, the Class A Common Stock would automatically convert into such number of shares of Nexcella common stock (or such other\ncapital stock or securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Class A Common Stock) that have a value of $5,000,000 based on the initial offering price in such initial\npublic offering or the implied value of a share of Nexcella common stock resulting from the price paid upon the consummation of such Qualified Change of Control (or if such\nQualified Change of Control results in the Class A Shares being exchanged solely for cash, then $5,000,000 in cash). The Company was entitled to cast such number of votes equal\nto the number of whole shares of Nexcella common stock into which the Company’s Class A Common Stock was convertible as of the record date for determining stockholders\nentitled to vote on matters presented to the stockholders of Nexcella.\n14\nIn addition to the foregoing, the Company was entitled to one vote for each share of Nexcella common stock held by it. Except as provided by law or by the Nexcella COI, holders\nof Nexcella Class A Common Stock and Class A Preferred Stock shall vote together with the holders of Nexcella common stock, as a single class.\nAs additional consideration under the Nexcella Founders Agreement, Nexcella would also: (i) pay an equity fee in shares of common stock, payable within five business days of\nthe closing of any equity or debt financing for Nexcella or any of its respective subsidiaries that occurs after the effective date of the Nexcella Founders Agreement and ending on\nthe date when the Company no longer has majority voting control in Nexcella’s voting equity, equal to 2.5% of the gross amount of any such equity or debt financing; and (ii) pay\na cash fee equal to 4.5% of Nexcella’s annual Net Sales (as defined in the Nexcella Founders Agreement), payable on an annual basis, within 90 days of the end of each calendar\nyear. In the event of a Change of Control, Nexcella would pay a one-time change in control fee equal to five times the product of (A) Net Sales for the 12 months immediately\npreceding the Change of Control and (B) 4.5%.\nManagement Services Agreement\nEffective as of December 8, 2022, the Company entered into a Management Services Agreement (the \"Nexcella MSA”) with Nexcella. Pursuant to the terms of the Nexcella MSA,\nthe Company rendered management, advisory and consulting services to Nexcella. Services provided under the Nexcella MSA may include, without limitation, (i) advice and\nassistance concerning any and all aspects of Nexcella’s operations, clinical trials, financial planning and strategic transactions and financings and (ii) conducting relations on\nbehalf of Nexcella with accountants, attorneys, financial advisors and other professionals (collectively, the \"Services”). At the request of the Company, Nexcella utilized clinical\nresearch services, medical education, communication and marketing services and investor relations/public relation services of companies or individuals designated by the\nCompany, provided those services are offered at market prices. In consideration for the Services, Nexcella paid the Company an annual base management and consulting fee of\n$500,000 (the \"Annual Consulting Fee”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the first Annual Consulting Fee payment was not due until first business day of the calendar quarter\nimmediately following the completion of the first equity financing for Nexcella that was in excess of $10 million in gross proceeds, which did not occur. Actual and direct out-of-\npocket expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in performing the Services were reimbursed to the Company by Nexcella.\nThe Nexcella MSA was terminated on May 20, 2024 in connection with the Nexcella Absorption. In addition, as a result of the Nexcella Absorption, the Class A Preferred Stock,\nClass A Common Stock, and the Founders Agreement ceased to exist.\nNote 4 – Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets consist of the following as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nPrepaid research and development expenses $ 495,219 $ 412,773\nPrepaid insurance expense 149,835 263,927\nPrepaid investor relations expense 624,629 384,494\nOther current assets 105,778 44,582\nTotal prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 1,375,461 $ 1,105,776\n15\nNote 5 – Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses consist of the following as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAccounts payable $ 2,346,649 $ 1,433,022\nAccrued research and development expenses 1,170,049 1,571,261\nAccrued professional services 98,425 38,639\nAccrued compensation and related expenses 170,632 577,854\nOther accrued expenses 67,806 101,007\nTotal accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 3,853,561 $ 3,721,783\nNote 6 – Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of:\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nOperating equipment $ 112,729 $ 60,599\nOffice equipment 3,896 3,896\n116,625 64,495\nLess: Accumulated depreciation (21,203) (14,314)\n95,422 50,181\nConstruction in progress 358,607 -\n$ 454,029 $ 50,181\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, depreciation expense amounted to $6,889 and $1,011, respectively. Depreciation is not taken during the period of construction or\nequipment installation. Upon completion of the installation of manufacturing equipment or any construction in progress, balances will be classified to their respective property and\nequipment category.\nThe construction in progress of $358,607 as of June 30, 2024, represents the investment in building a biopharmaceutical processing facility inside the leased property. The\nCompany expects to complete the processing facility by the end of 2024.\nNote 7 – Stockholders’ Equity\nThe Company has authorized 200,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock each with a par value of $0.0001 per share.\nJuly 2023 ATM Sales Agreement\nOn July 14, 2023, the Company entered into the July Sales Agreement with the Sales Agent pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, through the Sales\nAgent, shares (the \"July Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Sales Agreement.

Our lead cell therapy candidate is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA”) investigational new drug (\"IND”) cleared CAR-T NXC-201,\ncurrently being evaluated in our ongoing Phase 1b/2a NEXICART-1 (NCT04720313) clinical trial. Based on early clinical data, we believe NXC-201 has the potential to be the\nworld’s first \"Single-Day Cytokine Release Syndrome”, or \"Single-Day CRS” CAR-T (CRS median onset day 1, median duration 1 day), enabling the potential for a faster return\nhome for patients. NXC-201 has been awarded Orphan Drug Designation (\"ODD”) by the FDA in both AL Amyloidosis and multiple myeloma, and ODD by the European\nCommission (\"EMA”) in AL Amyloidosis.\nOur mission is to harness the immune system through innovative cell therapies and other modalities to deliver widely accessible cures in autoimmune and other\nindications, as we believe patients are waiting.\nOur strategy is to:\n● Develop our lead candidate CAR-T NXC-201 in AL Amyloidosis and other autoimmune diseases; and\n● Pursue development of NXC-201 and additional cell therapy candidates in other applicable indications where CAR-T is not an approved therapy today.\nOur N-GENIUS platform has produced our clinical-stage lead candidate NXC-201, a next-generation CAR-T for AL Amyloidosis and autoimmune disease, complemented\nby emerging programs.\n25\nFigure 1: ImmixBio Pipeline\nNXC-201 is in clinical trials to treat relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis.\nAL amyloidosis is a life-threatening immunological disorder in which an abnormal protein called amyloid builds up in tissues and organs. This abnormal protein is\nproduced by long-lived plasma cells (\"LLPCs”), a type of immune B-cell. The signs and symptoms of AL amyloidosis vary among patients because build-up may occur in the heart\n(most frequent cause of mortality), liver, kidneys, intestines, muscles, joints, nerves, or spleen, according to the National Institutes of Health (\"NIH”). Diagnosis is frequently\ndelayed, due to varied and non-specific symptoms including: fatigue, weight loss, shortness of breath, dizziness, and numbness in hands and feet. Upon diagnosis, many patients\nalready have late-stage disease, and are not aware of available treatment options and clinical trials.\nThe U.S. observed prevalence of relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis is growing 12% per year according to Staron, et al Blood Cancer Journal 2021, estimated to\nreach 29,712 patients in 2023. Untreated patients with AL amyloidosis and cardiac involvement have a median survival of less than 1 year, according to Quock, et al. Journal of\nComparative Effective Research, 2023. The current market size for amyloidosis therapies is estimated at $3.6 billion, expected to reach $6 billion in 2027, according to Grand View\nResearch.\nAs of June 2024, we have treated 76 patients in our ongoing Phase 1b/2a NEXICART-1 (NCT04720313), of which 63 were relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients,\nand 13 were relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients.\nAs of February 2024, there are no FDA approved drugs for AL Amyloidosis.\nIn September 2023, the FDA granted ODD to NXC-201 for the treatment of AL Amyloidosis. If a product that has ODD subsequently receives the first FDA approval for\nthe disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other\napplications to market the same drug for the same indication for 7 years (except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug\nexclusivity).\nIn November 2023, the FDA cleared an IND application for NXC-201 to enroll U.S. patients into NXC-201 clinical trials.\nIn December 2023, NXC-201 clinical data in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis was presented in an oral presentation at the 65th annual American Society of Hematology\n(\"ASH”) meeting, covering 10 relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients treated with NXC-201, indicating an overall response rate of 100% (10/10) and a complete response rate\nof 70% (7/10).\n26\nIn February 2024, the European Commission (\"EC”) granted orphan drug designation to NXC-201 for the treatment of AL Amyloidosis. Benefits of European ODD include:\n10 years of market exclusivity once authorized in the EU; Access to the EU centralized authorization procedure; and reduced fees for EU protocol assistance, marketing\nauthorization applications, inspections before authorization, applications for changes to marketing authorizations made after approval, and reduced annual fees.\nOur Other Programs\nOur other programs include NXC-201 for autoimmune diseases, a $25 billion combined annual market size according to Grand View Research and Fortune Business\nInsights and other preclinical candidates.\nWhile our focus is NXC-201 in AL Amyloidosis and autoimmune disease, we continue to collect and organize IMX-110 data in monotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma, a $3\nbillion market size according to Medgadget, and in combination with anti-PD-1 for colorectal cancer, a $27 billion market size according to IndustryARC, to evaluate next steps.\nSince inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing product and technology rights, conducting research and development, organizing and\nstaffing our Company, business planning and raising capital. We operate as one business segment and have incurred recurring losses, the majority of which are attributable to\nresearch and development activities and negative cash flows from operations. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities. Currently, our primary\nuse of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures, and to a lesser extent, general and administrative expenditures. We\nexpect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates through all stages of development and\nclinical trials and, ultimately, seek regulatory approval. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant\ncommercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. Furthermore, we incur costs associated with operating as a public company,\nincluding significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the\ntiming of our clinical trials and our expenses on other research and development activities.\nAbsorption of Nexcella Subsidiary\nOn May 20, 2024, Nexcella, was merged (the \"Merger”) with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation. The Merger was effected pursuant to\nSection 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\"DGCL”) when the Company filed a Certificate of Ownership and Merger (\"Certificate of Merger”) with the Secretary of State\nof the State of Delaware. Immediately prior to the Merger, the Company owned greater than 95% of the outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis of Nexcella, par value\n$0.0001 per share (the \"Nexcella Shares”), and 100% of the outstanding shares of each other class of capital stock of Nexcella. Under the DGCL, the only approval required was that\nof the Company’s Board of Directors for the Merger to become effective. As a result of the Merger, Nexcella ceased to exist and all assets, operations and other property and rights\nof Nexcella have been succeeded to by the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Merger, as a result of the Merger, each of the outstanding Nexcella Shares (other\nthan Nexcella Shares held by the Company) were converted, into common stock of the Company (\"Company Merger Shares”). In connection with the Merger, the Company issued\n989,876 shares of its common stock to the former stockholders of Nexcella (other than shares held by the Company) (including Company common stock issued to third-party cash\ninvestors in Nexcella) (the \"Merger Shares”). In addition, the Company issued to the former participants in the Nexcella 2022 Equity Incentive Plan, 275,759 restricted stock awards\nto receive common stock in the Company and options to purchase up to 595,676 shares of Company common stock at an exercise price of $2.47 per share (the closing price on May\n17, 2024), under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2021 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan.\n27\nResearch and License Agreement with Hadasit and BIRAD\nOn December 8, 2022, our subsidiary Nexcella entered into a Research and License Agreement (the \"Agreement”) with Hadasit Medical Research Services &\nDevelopment, Ltd. and BIRAD – Research and Development Company Ltd. (collectively, the \"Licensors”) pursuant to which the Licensors granted to Nexcella an exclusive,\nworldwide, royalty-bearing license throughout the world, except Israel, Cyprus and other countries in the Middle East (the \"Territory”) to an invention entitled \"Anti-BCMA CAR-\nT cells to target plasma cell” to develop, manufacture, have manufactured, use, market, offer for sale, sell, have sold, export and import Licensed Product (as defined in the\nAgreement). Pursuant to the Agreement, Nexcella paid the Licensors an upfront fee of $1,500,000 in December 2022. Additional quarterly payments totaling approximately $13.0\nmillion are due through September 2026 along with an annual license fee of $50,000. Nexcella has agreed to pay royalties to the Licensors equal to 5% of Net Sales (as defined in the\nAgreement) during the Royalty Period. \"Royalty Period” means for each Licensed Product, on a country-to-country basis, the period commencing on December 8, 2022, and ending\non the later of (a) the expiration of the last to expire Valid Claim (as defined in the Agreement) under a Licensed Patent (as defined in the Agreement), if any, in such country, (b) the\ndate of expiration of any other Exclusivity Right (as defined in the Agreement) or data protection period granted by a regulatory or other governmental authority with respect to a\nLicensed Product, or (c) 15 years from the date of First Commercial Sale (as defined in the Agreement) of a Licensed Product in such country.\nIn addition, Nexcella is required to pay sales milestone payments of up to $20 million for Net Sales exceeding $700 million and Nexcella has committed to funding NXC-201\nclinical trials in Israel over four years for an estimated total cost of approximately $13 million, spread out on a quarterly basis over that period, which Nexcella believes will generate\nclinical trial data owned by Nexcella. The term of the Agreement commenced on December 8, 2022 and, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms thereof, will continue in full\nforce and effect until the later of the expiration of the last Valid Claim under a Licensed Patent or a Joint Patent (as defined in the Agreement) or Exclusivity Right covering a\nLicensed Product or the expiration of a continuous period of 15 years during which there shall not have been a First Commercial Sale of any Licensed Product in any country in the\nworld. Licensors may terminate the Agreement immediately if Nexcella or its affiliates or sublicensees commences an action in which it challenges the validity, enforceability or\nscope of any of the Licensed Patents or Joint Patents. In addition, either party may terminate the Agreement if the other party materially breaches the Agreement and fails to cure\nsuch breach within 30 days. Additionally, Licensors may terminate the Agreement if Nexcella becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy.\nThe license remains with the Company after the Nexcella Absorption.\nJuly 2023 ATM Offering\nOn July 14, 2023, we entered into an ATM Sales Agreement (the \"July Sales Agreement”) with the Sales Agent pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time,\nthrough the Sales Agent, shares of our common stock, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the July Sales Agreement. Initially, we are eligible to sell up to $4,200,000\nworth of shares of our common stock as the aggregate market value of our shares of common stock eligible for sale under the July Sales Agreement is subject to the limitations of\nGeneral Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 until such time that our public float equals or exceeds $75.0 million. In the event the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock\nheld by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $75.0 million, then the one-third limitation on sales set forth in General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 will not apply to additional sales made\npursuant to the July Sales Agreement. We agreed to pay the Sales Agent a commission rate of 3.75% of the aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of the shares of our common\nstock pursuant to the July Sales Agreement and have paid an expense deposit of $15,000 to the Sales Agent, which will be applied against the actual out-of-pocket accountable\nexpenses. In addition, we have agreed to reimburse the Sales Agent for all expenses related to the offering including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of the Sales Agent’s\nlegal counsel up to $50,000, and to reimburse the Sales Agent, upon request, for such costs, fees and expenses in an amount not to exceed $7,500 on a quarterly basis for the first\nthree fiscal quarters of each year and $10,000 for the fiscal fourth quarter of each year. The offering pursuant to the July Sales Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the\nsale of all of the shares of common stock subject to the July Sales Agreement and (ii) termination of the July Sales Agreement as permitted therein. We may terminate the July Sales\nAgreement in our sole discretion at any time by giving ten days’ prior notice to the Sales Agent. The Sales Agent may terminate the July Sales Agreement under the circumstances\nspecified in the July Sales Agreement and in its sole discretion at any time by giving ten days’ prior notice to us. In addition, the July Sales Agreement may be terminated upon\nmutual agreement by us and the Sales Agent.\nFrom July 14, 2023 through February 5, 2024, the Company has sold 328,136 common shares pursuant to the July ATM Facility for net proceeds of $1,091,887, after\noffering expenses. On February 5, 2024, the Company suspended, and is not offering any shares of its common stock pursuant to, the prospectus supplement dated July 14, 2023,\nrelating to the July Sales Agreement by and between the Company and ThinkEquity LLC. The Company will not make any sales of common stock pursuant to the July Sales\nAgreement unless and until a new prospectus supplement is filed with the SEC; however, the Sales Agreement remains in full force and effect.\n28\nPublic Offering\nOn February 5, 2024, the Company entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the \"Agreement”) with Titan Partners Group LLC, a division of American Capital Partners,\nLLC (the \"Underwriter”), relating to an underwritten offering (the \"Offering”) of 5,535,055 shares of common stock of the Company. The public offering price was $2.71 per share of\nCommon Stock and the Underwriter agreed to purchase the Common Stock pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement at a price of $2.5203 per share. On February 8, 2024, the\nCompany closed the offering and received net proceeds of $13,565,760, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. Pursuant to the\nAgreement, the Company granted the Underwriter a 30-day over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 783,970 shares of Common Stock which was exercised in full on\nMarch 1, 2024 for net proceeds of $1,954,594, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.\nResults of Operations\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024 compared to the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $2,478,357 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $1,511,467 for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nThe expenses incurred in both periods were related to salaries, patent maintenance costs and general accounting and other general consulting expenses, which were\nhigher for the three months ended June 30, 2024, due to increased professional services of $31,667, increased investor relations services of $322,692 both due to service scope\nexpansion and price increases, increased compensation expense of $189,291 due to hiring of additional employees, and increased stock-based compensation of $236,176 from\nadditional equity awards issued.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense was $2,224,139 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $2,209,244 for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nThe increased research and development expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, were related to our\nongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical trial and our CAR-T clinical trial, including, but not limited to, contract research organization (\"CRO”) and related costs for maintaining and treating\npatients in the clinical trial, as well as costs related to opening U.S. clinical sites.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $306,915 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $128,848 for the three months ended June 30, 2023. Interest income in the current\nperiod was related to interest received on investments in a money market fund and increased from the prior period as a result of the Company maintaining higher balances in money\nmarket funds during the current period.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $10,269 compared to $6,349 for the three months ended June 30, 2023, due to withholding taxes\nrelating to our Australian subsidiary.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $4,405,850, compared to $3,598,212 for the three months ended June 30, 2023, which increase was due primarily to\nthe increase in general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses, as discussed in greater detail above.\n29\nSix Months Ended June 30, 2024 compared to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $4,819,821 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $2,713,201 for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nThe expenses incurred in both periods were related to salaries, patent maintenance costs and general accounting and other general consulting expenses, which were\nhigher for the six months ended June 30, 2024, due to increased professional services of $375,325, increased investor relations services of $655,847, both due to service scope\nexpansion and price increases, of which $271,801 was an increase in non-cash from shares issued for services, increased compensation of $192,442 due to hiring additional\nemployees and increased stock-based compensation of $531,737 from additional equity awards issued.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense was $5,472,808 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $3,528,264 for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nThe increased research and development expenses during the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, were related to our\nongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical trial and our CAR-T clinical trial, including, but not limited to, contract research organization (\"CRO”) and related costs for maintaining and treating\npatients in the clinical trial.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $574,823 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $156,740 for the six months ended June 30, 2023.

Cash\nused to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable, accrued expenses and\nprepaid expenses.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the\nexact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n● the scope, timing, progress and results of discovery, pre-clinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates;\n● the costs of manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials and in preparation for regulatory approval and commercialization;\n30\n● the extent to which we enter into collaborations or other arrangements with additional third parties in order to further develop our product candidates;\n● the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related\nclaims;\n● the costs and fees associated with the discovery, acquisition or in-license of additional product candidates or technologies;\n● expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n● the costs associated with being a public company;\n● the costs required to scale up our clinical, regulatory and manufacturing capabilities;\n● the costs of future commercialization activities, if any, including establishing sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, for any of our product\ncandidates for which we receive regulatory approval; and\n● revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had $23.4 million of total working capital.\nOn July 25, 2024, the Company was awarded an $8 million grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine to support the clinical development of chimeric\nantigen receptor T-cell therapy NXC-201 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis. The award is payable to the Company upon achievement of milestones that are\nprimarily based on patient enrollment in the Company’s clinical trials. Additionally, if CIRM determines, in its sole discretion, that the Company has not complied with the terms\nand conditions of the grant, CIRM may suspend or permanently cease disbursements. Funds received under this grant may only be used for allowable project costs specifically\nidentified with the CIRM-funded project. Such costs can include, but are not limited to, salary for personnel, itemized supplies, consultants, and itemized clinical study costs. Under\nthe terms of the grant, both CIRM and the Company will co-fund the research project and the amount of the Company’s co-funding requirement is predetermined as a part of the\naward. The Company expects to begin receiving funds from the grant beginning in September of 2024.\nWe will need additional funds to meet our operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials, other research and development expenditures, and general and\nadministrative expenses. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings,\ngovernment or other third-party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements, other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the\nextent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, which dilution may be significant, and the\nterms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. If we raise additional funds through\ncollaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future\nrevenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or\ndebt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research, product development or future commercialization efforts,\nor grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nCash used in operating activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $9,082,817 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and $5,607,342 for the six months ended June 30, 2023.

Net cash provided\nby financing activities in 2024 was related to proceeds of $425,724 from the sale of common shares through an at-the-market offering and proceeds of $15,520,354 from the sale of\ncommon shares through a public offering. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2023 was related to proceeds of $4,811,393 from the sale of common shares through an at-\nthe-market offering and proceeds of $175,000 from the sale of common shares of our majority-owned subsidiary, Nexcella, offset by payments of deferred offering costs of $175,817.\nOur continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain necessary financing to continue operations and the attainment of profitable operations. As\nof June 30, 2024, we have incurred an accumulated deficit of $63,063,222 and have not yet generated any revenue from operations. Management anticipates that our cash on hand\nand funds that may be raised pursuant to the Sales Agreement will be sufficient to fund planned operations for at least 12 months from the filing date of this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q.\nWe will have additional capital requirements going forward and may need to seek additional financing, which may or may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at\nall.\nJOBS Act\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \"JOBS Act”) was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \"emerging growth company” can\ntake advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an\n\"emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nWe have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying with new or revised\naccounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable\nto those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nSubject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an \"emerging growth company,” we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions, including, without limitation,\n(i) providing an auditor’s attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and (ii)\ncomplying with the requirement adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor’s report on\nfinancial statements. We will remain an \"emerging growth company” until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.235\nbillion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering (December 31, 2026); (iii) the date on which\nwe have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of\nthe SEC.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management regularly evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue\nrecognition, intangible assets, long-lived assets valuation, variable interest entities, and legal matters. Actual results may differ from these estimates which may be material. \"Note 2\n– Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the \"2022 Form 10-K”), and \"Critical Accounting Policies” in Part II, Item 7 of the 2023 Form 10-K describe the\nsignificant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical\naccounting policies and estimates since the 2023 Form 10-K.\n32\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nWe are not required to provide the information required by this Item as we are a \"smaller reporting company,” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our \"disclosure controls and\nprocedures” (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of June 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term\n\"disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to\nensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to a company’s management, including its principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and\nprocedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the\ncontrols system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.\nBased on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer has concluded that, based on such evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures\nwere not effective due to the material weakness described below.\nMaterial Weakness in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that exists as of June 30, 2024. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of\ndeficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not\nbe prevented or detected on a timely basis. We determined that we had a material weakness because, due to our small size, and our limited number of personnel, we did not have in\nplace an effective internal control environment with formal processes and procedures, including journal entry processing and review, to allow for a detailed review of accounting\ntransactions that would identify errors in a timely manner.\nNotwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we have concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements\nincluded in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nManagement’s Plan to Remediate the Material Weakness\nWith the oversight of senior management, we continue to work to remediate our material weaknesses, including the addition of accounting consultants. We will continue\nto evaluate and implement procedures that will strengthen our internal controls. We are committed to continuing to improve our internal control processes and will continue to\ndiligently review our financial reporting controls and procedures.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n33\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent\nuncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or\nclaims that will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nRisk factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed in Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2023 (\"Annual Report”) as filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024 and below. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those previously disclosed in our\nAnnual Report, except as set forth below. You should carefully consider the risks described in our Annual Report and below, which could materially affect our business, financial\ncondition or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we\ncurrently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. If any of the risks actually occur, our business,\nfinancial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively affected.\nEconomic uncertainty may affect our access to capital and/or increase the costs of such capital.\nGlobal economic conditions continue to be volatile and uncertain due to, among other things, consumer confidence in future economic conditions, fears of recession and\ntrade wars, the price of energy, fluctuating interest rates, the availability and cost of consumer credit, the availability and timing of government stimulus programs, levels of\nunemployment, increased inflation, tax rates, and the war between Ukraine and Russia which began in February 2022, and Israel and Hamas, which began in October 2023 and\nwhich threatens to spread to other Middle Eastern countries. These conditions remain unpredictable and create uncertainties about our ability to raise capital in the future. In the\nevent required capital becomes unavailable in the future, or more costly, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, future results of operations, and financial\ncondition.\nOur outstanding options and warrants may adversely affect the trading price of our securities.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had (i) outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of 3,999,988 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $2.03 per\nshare; (ii) outstanding Pre-Funded warrants to purchase 1,913,661 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.0001; and (iii) outstanding warrants to purchase 397,500\nshares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $4.11 per share (when not including the Pre-Funded warrants). For the life of the options and warrants, the\nholders have the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock without assuming the risk of ownership. The issuance of shares upon the exercise of\noutstanding securities will also dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.\nThe availability of these shares for public resale, as well as any actual resales of these shares, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We cannot\npredict the size of future issuances of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of outstanding options or warrants or conversion of other securities, or the effect, if any, that\nfuture issuances and sales of shares of our common stock may have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our common stock\n(including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\n34\nIn addition, the common stock issuable upon exercise/conversion of outstanding convertible securities may represent overhang that may also adversely affect the market\nprice of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a company’s stock in the market than there is demand for that stock. When this happens the price of\nour stock will decrease, and any additional shares which stockholders attempt to sell in the market will only further decrease the share price. If the share volume of our common\nstock cannot absorb shares sold by holders of our outstanding convertible securities, then the value of our common stock will likely decrease.\nA significant number of our shares are eligible for sale and their sale or potential sale may depress the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock. Most of our common stock is available\nfor resale in the public market, including (a) outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of 3,999,988 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $2.03\nper share; (b) Pre-Funded warrants to purchase 1,913,661 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.0001; and (c) 3,241,076 shares of common stock, the resale of which\nhas been registered under the Securities Act. We have also filed certain Form S-8 Registration Statements pursuant to which we can issue unregistered stock in connection with\nawards under our equity plans. If a significant number of shares were sold, such sales would increase the supply of our common stock, thereby potentially causing a decrease in its\nprice. Some or all of our shares of common stock, including those discussed above, may be offered from time to time in the open market pursuant to effective registration\nstatements and/or compliance with Company insider trading policy, Exchange Act Section 16 and/or Rule 144, which sales could have a depressive effect on the market for our\nshares of common stock. Subject to certain restrictions, a person who has held restricted shares for a period of six months may generally sell common stock into the market. The\nsale of a significant portion of such shares when such shares are eligible for public sale may cause the value of our common stock to decline in value.\nWe may not receive the $8 million which we recently learned was granted to us by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine.\nOn July 25, 2024, the Company learned that it was awarded an $8 million grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine to support the clinical development\nof chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy NXC-201 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis. The Company has not yet received any funds in connection with\nsuch award and may not receive funds on a timely basis, or at all, and such award may come with conditions. The Company is required to complete certain requirements and agree\nto certain terms and conditions in connection with such grant, which have not been completed or agreed to as of the date of this Report. In the event the award was not received\non a timely basis, or at all, or subject to conditions, the Company could be forced to seek out alternative funding which may not be on as favorable terms as such currently\nexpected grant.\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company issued 27,880 shares of restricted common stock valued at $67,500 for investor relations services based on the\naverage closing price for the prior 10 trading days pursuant to a marketing services agreement entered into on July 25, 2023.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company issued 15,021 shares of restricted common stock valued at $35,000 for investor relations services based on the\nclosing price pursuant to the extension of a marketing services agreement entered into on May 6, 2024.\nSubsequent to June 30, 2024, the Company issued 21,282 shares of restricted common stock valued at $45,000 for investor relations services based on the average closing\nprice for the prior 10 trading days pursuant to a marketing services agreement entered into on July 25, 2023.\nThe issuances described above were exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2), and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act, since the foregoing\nissuances did not involve a public offering, the recipients took the securities for investment and not resale, we took take appropriate measures to restrict transfer, and the recipients\nwere (a) \"accredited investors”; and/or (b) had access to similar documentation and information as would be required in a Registration Statement under the Securities Act. The\nsecurities are subject to transfer restrictions, and the securities contain an appropriate legend stating that such securities have not been registered under the Securities Act and\nmay not be offered or sold absent registration or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. The securities were not registered under the Securities Act and such securities may not be\noffered or sold in the United States absent registration or an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws.\nITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION.\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, none of the Company’s directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f)) adopted or terminated any\ncontract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any \"non-\nRule 10b5-1 trading arrangement”.\n35\nITEM 6.

(“ImmixBio”, “Company”, “We” or “Us”, “IMMX”) (Nasdaq: IMMX), a clinical-stage\nbiopharmaceutical company trailblazing cell therapies in AL Amyloidosis and autoimmune disease, today announced that the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine\n(CIRM) has awarded Immix Biopharma cell therapy division Nexcella an $8 million CLIN2 grant award to support clinical development of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T)\ntherapy NXC-201 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis.\n“AL amyloidosis is an unmet medical need, and current approved therapies for this rare disease are mostly not well tolerated and have not led to sustained remissions,” said Dr.\nAbla Creasey, PhD, Vice President of Therapeutics Development at CIRM. “This one-time therapy would be an innovative treatment for patients with AL Amyloidosis, and the\npreliminary data are encouraging.”\n“We are grateful for the recognition from CIRM of the importance of NXC-201 in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis, for which there are no FDA approved drugs today,” said Ilya\nRachman, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Immix Biopharma. Gabriel Morris, Chief Financial Officer of Immix Biopharma, added: “We are excited to join California’s thriving\nCIRM biotechnology innovation ecosystem as we proceed on-plan with NEXICART-2.”\nThe NEXICART-2 U.S. study is intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NXC-201 in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients with adequate cardiac function who have\nnot been exposed to prior BCMA-targeted therapy. The study builds on positive data from the initial ex-U.S. study, NEXICART-1, presented at the 27th Annual Meeting of The\nAmerican Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT 2024) which showed a 92% overall response rate in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients (12/13). The best responder\nexperienced a 28.0 month duration of response (as reported May 10, 2024, with ongoing follow-up).\nNXC-201 is the only CAR-T therapy currently in development in AL Amyloidosis, mentioned in a review article entitled “Systemic Light Chain Amyloidosis” published in June,\n2024 New England Journal of Medicine .\nAbout the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM)\nAt CIRM, we never forget that we were created by the people of California to accelerate stem cell treatments to patients with unmet medical needs, and act with a sense of urgency\nto succeed in that mission. To meet this challenge, our team of highly trained and experienced professionals actively partners with both academia and industry in a hands-on,\nentrepreneurial environment to fast track the development of today’s most promising stem cell technologies.\nWith $5.5 billion in funding and more than 150 active stem cell programs in our portfolio, CIRM is one of the world’s largest institutions dedicated to helping people by bringing\nthe future of cellular medicine closer to reality.\nAbout NEXICART-2\nNEXICART-2 (NCT06097832) is an open-label, single-arm, multi-site U.S. Phase 1b/2 dose expansion clinical trial of CAR-T NXC-201 in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis.\nNEXICART-2 is expected to enroll 40 patients with adequate cardiac function who have not been exposed to prior BCMA-targeted therapy. The study is designed with a standard\n6 patient safety-run in to evaluate two doses (three patients each at 150 million CAR+T cells and 450 million CAR+T cells), with the potential for further escalation to 800 million\nCAR+T cells (all 3 dose levels were evaluated in the NEXICART-1 study and have produced complete responses in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients). The study aims\nto evaluate the safety and efficacy of NXC-201 in this patient population. Primary endpoints are complete response rate and overall response rate, according to consensus\nrecommendations (Palladini et al. 2012).\nAbout NEXICART-1\nNEXICART-1 (NCT04720313) is an open-label, ex-U.S. Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of NXC-201 (formerly HBI0101) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and\nrelapsed/refractory AL amyloidosis (including AL Amyloidosis patients with impaired cardiac function and including AL Amyloidosis patients exposed to prior BCMA-targeted\ntherapy). The primary objective of the study is to characterize the safety and efficacy, as well as confirm the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of NXC-201 (which has already\nbeen confirmed). NEXICART-1 clinical results, most recently from ASGCT 2024, are available at https://immixbio.com/pipeline/#publications.\nAbout NXC-201\nNXC-201 is a sterically-optimized BCMA-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy. Initial data from Phase 1b/2a ex-U.S. study NEXICART-1 has demonstrated\nshort duration of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and no grade 3 or delayed neurotoxicity in high-volume disease, as well as short duration CRS and no neurotoxicity of any kind\nin AL Amyloidosis.\nNXC-201 is being studied in a comprehensive clinical development program for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory AL amyloidosis, with the potential to expand into\nautoimmune indications. The NXC-201 NEXICART-2 U.S. clinical trial builds on a robust clinical dataset. NXC-201 has been awarded Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) in the US by\nthe FDA and in the EU by the EMA in AL Amyloidosis.\nAbout AL Amyloidosis\nAL amyloidosis is caused by abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow, which produce misfolded amyloid proteins that build-up in the heart, kidney, liver, and other organs. This\nbuild-up causes progressive and widespread damage to multiple organs, including heart failure, and leads to high mortality rates.\nThe U.S. observed prevalence of relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis is estimated to be growing at 12% per year according to Staron, et al Blood Cancer Journal, to approximately\n33,277 patients in 2024.\nThe Amyloidosis market was $3.6 billion in 2017, and is expected to reach $6 billion in 2025, according to Grand View Research.\nAbout Immix Biopharma, Inc.\nImmix Biopharma, Inc. (ImmixBio) (Nasdaq: IMMX) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company trailblazing cell therapies in AL Amyloidosis and autoimmune diseases. Our lead\ncandidate is sterically-optimized BCMA-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy NXC-201. NXC-201 is being evaluated in the U.S. Phase 1b/2a trial NEXICART-2\n(NCT06097832) as well as the ex-U.S. study NEXICART-1 (NCT04720313).

          "content": "IMMIX BIOPHARMA, INC.\nCODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS\n(Effective September 10, 2021)\nImmix Biopharma, Inc. (the “Company”) has adopted the following Code of Business Conduct\nand Ethics (this “Code”) for directors, executive officers and employees of the Company. This\nCode is intended to focus the directors, executive officers and employees on areas of ethical risk,\nprovide guidance to directors, executive officers and employees to help them recognize and deal\nwith ethical issues, provide mechanisms to report unethical conduct, and help foster a culture of\nhonesty and accountability. Each director, executive officer and employee must comply with the\nletter and spirit of this Code.\nNo code or policy can anticipate every situation that may arise. Accordingly, this Code is intended\nto serve as a source of guiding principles for directors, executive officers and employees. Directors,\nexecutive officers and employees are encouraged to bring questions about particular circumstances\nthat may implicate one or more of the provisions of this Code to the attention of the Chairman of\nthe Audit Committee, who may consult with inside or outside legal counsel as appropriate.\n1. Maintain Fiduciary Duties.\nDirectors and executive officers must be loyal to the Company and must act at all times in the best\ninterest of the Company and its stockholders and subordinate self-interest to the corporate and\nstockholder good. Directors and executive officers should never use their position to make a\npersonal profit. Directors and executive officers must perform their duties in good faith, with sound\nbusiness judgment and with the care of a prudent person.\n2. Conflict of Interest.\nAs an employee of the Company, you are expected to act at all times in the Company’s best\ninterests and to exercise sound judgment unclouded by personal interests or divided loyalties. Both\nin performing your duties at the Company and in your outside activities, you should avoid the\nappearance as well as the reality of a conflict of interest.\nA conflict of interest exists if your circumstances would lead a reasonable person to question\nwhether your motivations are aligned with the Company’s best interests. If, for example, you are\ninvolved in an outside activity or have a financial or other personal interest that might interfere\nwith your objectivity in performing your Company duties and responsibilities, you may have, or\nappear to have, a conflict of interest.\nWhile it is impractical to describe all situations that may create a conflict of interest, the following\nprovides policy guidance about some of the most common conflict of interest situations:\n• Use of Company Information for Private Gain\n• Friends and Family Stock\n• Outside Activities – Non-Profit and Civic Organizations\n• Employment Outside Company - Moonlighting\n• Service on a Board of Directors of a for Profit Company\n• Scientific Advisory Boards\n1\n• Family and Romantic Relationships\n• Family Members or Relatives as Suppliers and other Business Partners\n• Kickbacks and Rebates by Suppliers\n• Gifts from Vendors, Suppliers or Customers\n• Honorariums\nPlease note that the above is not an exhaustive list of examples. There are many other situations\nthat may also create a potential for a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest.\nIt is up to you to be aware of the potential for a conflict of interest in your own particular situation\nand to resolve the issue in accordance with this policy.\nService on a Board of Directors of a For Profit Company:\nDirectors owe a duty of loyalty to the company on whose board they serve. You should carefully\nconsider all potential conflict of interest issues before agreeing to serve on the board of a for profit\ncompany.\nIf your position on the board of directors of another company becomes potentially relevant to a\nCompany decision or action, you must promptly disclose your relationship with the other company\nto the Company employees responsible for the decision or action and you must not participate in\nthat decision or action on behalf of either the Company or the other company. For example, if a\nCompany business unit is considering a transaction with the company on whose board you serve,\nyou must disclose your relationship with the other company, to the decision makers in your\nbusiness unit and you must refrain from any discussions about or involvement in the transaction\non behalf of either the Company or the other company.\nAny employee considering service on another company’s board should understand that such\nservice can lead to personal liability, particularly with financially troubled companies. As your\nboard service is outside the scope of your employment, the Company will not defend or indemnify\nyou if you are sued in your capacity as a board member of another company. The Company’s\napproval of your request to serve on an outside board does not constitute any endorsement\nor ratification of any action you take as a board member of another company.\nThe Company may at times ask an employee to serve on the board of directors of a for- profit\norganization pursuant to a Company investment in, or strategic partnership with, that\norganization. The Company may also request that an employee serve on the board of a non-profit\norganization, such as a standards body. Service on such boards as a representative of the Company\nis outside the scope of this policy.\nScientific Advisory Boards\nBefore accepting appointment to or service on a scientific advisory board for a company other than\nthe Company, you should consider whether the entity is offering you this opportunity in order to\nleverage your relationship with the Company to gain a special advantage for itself with the\nCompany, whether serving on this board will interfere with your ability to exercise your\nindependent judgment in the best interest of the Company, and whether the products and\n2\ntechnologies you work on at the Company are so similar to those of the company on whose board\nyou wish to serve that it would be difficult to serve as a scientific advisor without using or\ndisclosing Company confidential information and trade secrets. If, after considering these\nquestions, you still wish to serve on the scientific advisory board, you must obtain prior written\napproval from your manager.\nIf any decision is to be made or action taken by the Company concerning a company for which\nyou serve as a member of a scientific advisory board, you must disclose to the Company employees\nresponsible for the decision or action your, relationship to the entity and not participate in that\ndecision or action on behalf of either party.\nEmployees who are asked by the Company to serve on a scientific advisory board of another\ncompany as part of the Company’s job duties are not required to obtain approval under this policy.\nOutside Activities – Non-Profit Organizations\nThe Company may encourage its employees to be active in their communities and to volunteer\ntheir time to bona fide charitable, educational, civic, and trade organizations, provided of course\nthat such activities do not detract from their job performance. Participation in these types of\nactivities does not generally require prior approval.\nIn taking on outside obligations, however, you should guard against possible conflicts of interest\nor the appearance of such conflicts. If participation in an outside activity has the potential to cloud\nyour judgment, prevent you from acting in the Company’s best interests, or create an appearance\nthat you will not act objectively, you must refrain from participation in the activity unless you\nobtain prior written approval.\nYou must also honor your non-disclosure obligation in all your outside activities. If an outside\norganization’s interests are so closely related to your work at the Company that you might\ninadvertently use or disclose Company confidential information in the course of that outside work,\nyou must not participate in the organization.\nEmployees who are asked by the Company to serve on the board of non-profit organizations, such\nas public standards bodies, as part of their Company job, are not required to obtain conflict of\ninterest approval.\n3. Corporate Opportunities.\nDirectors, executive officers and employees owe a duty to the Company to advance its legitimate\ninterests when the opportunity to do so arises. Directors, executive officers and employees are\nprohibited from: (a) taking for themselves personally opportunities that are discovered through the\nuse of corporate property, information or the director’s or executive officer’s position; (b) using\nthe Company’s property, information, or position for personal gain; or (c) competing with the\nCompany, directly or indirectly, for business opportunities; provided, however, if the Company’s\ndisinterested directors determine that the Company will not pursue an opportunity that relates to\nthe Company’s business, a director, executive officer or employee may do so.\n3\n4. Confidentiality.\nDirectors, executive officers and employees must maintain the confidentiality of information\nentrusted to them by the Company or its customers, and any other confidential information about\nthe Company that comes to them, from whatever source, in their capacity as a director, executive\nofficer or employee, except when disclosure is authorized or required by laws or regulations.\nConfidential information includes all non-public information that might be of use to competitors,\nor harmful to the Company or its customers, if disclosed.\n5. Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets.\nDirectors, executive officers and employees must protect the Company’s assets and ensure their\nefficient use. Theft, loss, misuse, carelessness and waste of assets have a direct impact on the\nCompany’s profitability. Directors, executive officers and employees must not use Company time,\nemployees, supplies, equipment, tools, buildings or other assets for personal benefit without prior\nauthorization from the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or as\npart of a compensation or expense reimbursement program available to all directors or executive\nofficers.\n6. Fair Dealing.\nDirectors, executive officers and employees shall deal fairly and directors and executive officers\nshall oversee fair dealing by employees and officers with the Company’s directors, officers,\nemployees, customers, suppliers and competitors. None should take unfair advantage of anyone\nthrough manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material\nfacts or any other unfair dealing practices.\n7. Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations.\nDirectors and executive officers shall comply, and oversee compliance by employees, officers and\nother directors, with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Company, including insider-\ntrading laws. Transactions in Company securities are governed by Company Policy entitled\n“Insider Trading Policy.”\n8. Accuracy of Records.\nThe integrity, reliability and accuracy in all material respects of the Company’s books, records and\nfinancial statements is fundamental to the Company’s continued and future business success. No\ndirector, executive officer or employee may cause the Company to enter into a transaction with\nthe intent to document or record it in a deceptive or unlawful manner. In addition, no director,\nexecutive officer or employee may create any false or artificial documentation or book entry for\nany transaction entered into by the Company. Similarly, executive officers and employees who\nhave responsibility for accounting and financial reporting matters have a responsibility to\naccurately record all funds, assets and transactions on the Company’s books and records.\n9. Quality of Public Disclosures.\nThe Company is committed to providing its stockholders with information about its financial\ncondition and results of operations as required by the securities laws of the United States. It is the\n4\nCompany’s policy that the reports and documents it files with or submits to the Securities and\nExchange Commission, and its earnings releases and similar public communications made by the\nCompany, include fair, timely and understandable disclosure. Executive officers and employees\nwho are responsible for these filings and disclosures, including the Company’s principal executive,\nfinancial and accounting officers, must use reasonable judgment and perform their responsibilities\nhonestly, ethically and objectively in order to ensure that this disclosure policy is fulfilled. The\nCompany’s senior management are primarily responsible for monitoring the Company’s public\ndisclosure.\n10. Waivers and Amendments of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.\nNo waiver of any provisions of the Code for the benefit of a director or an executive officer (which\nincludes, without limitation, for purposes of this Code, the Company’s principal executive,\nfinancial and accounting officers) shall be effective unless (i) approved by the Board of Directors\nor, if permitted, a committee thereof, and (ii) if applicable, such a waiver is promptly disclosed to\nthe Company’s stockholders in accordance with applicable United States securities laws and/or\nthe rules and regulations of the exchange or system on which the Company’s shares are traded or\nquoted, as the case may be.\nAny waivers of this Code for the other employees may be made by the Board of Directors, or, if\npermitted, a committee thereof.\nAll amendments to this Code must be approved by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof\nand, if applicable, must be promptly disclosed to the Company’s stockholders in accordance with\napplicable United States securities laws and/or the rules and regulations of the exchange or system\non which the Company’s shares are traded or quoted, as the case may be.\n11. Encouraging the Reporting of any Illegal or Unethical Behavior.\nDirectors and executive officers should promote ethical behavior and take steps to ensure the\nCompany (a) encourages employees to talk to supervisors, managers and other appropriate\npersonnel when in doubt about the best course of action in a particular situation; (b) encourages\nemployees to report violations of laws, rules or regulations to appropriate personnel; and (c)\ninforms employees that the Company will not permit retaliation for reports made in good faith.\nAny executive officer or employee who in good faith reports a suspected violation under this Code\nby the Company, or its agents acting on behalf of the Company, or who in good faith raises issues\nor concerns regarding the Company’s business or operations, may not be fired, demoted,\nreprimanded or otherwise harmed for, or because of, the reporting of the suspected violation, issues\nor concerns, regardless of whether the suspected violation involves the executive officer or\nemployee, the executive officer’s or employee’s supervisor or senior management of the\ncompany.\nIn addition, any executive officer or employee who in good faith reports a suspected violation\nunder this Code which the executive officer or employee reasonably believes constitutes a\nviolation of a federal statute by the Company, or its agents acting on behalf of the Company, to a\nfederal regulatory or law enforcement agency, may not be reprimanded, discharged, demoted,\n5\nsuspended, threatened, harassed or in any manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions\nof the executive officer’s or employee’s employment for, or because of, the reporting of the\nsuspected violation, regardless of whether the suspected violation involves the executive officer\nor employee, the executive officer’s or employee’s supervisor or senior management of the\nCompany.\nTo report any violations under this Code or concerns regarding the Company’s business or\noperations, please contact the Chairman of the Audit Committee.\n12.
