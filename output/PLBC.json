Diluted earnings per share decreased to $1.31 per share during the three months ended September 30, 2024 down from $1.34 per share during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. An increase of $1.1 million in net interest income and a decline of $200,000 in the provision for credit losses were offset by increases of $1.4 million in non-interest expense and a decline of $76,000 in the non-interest income. Included in non-interest expense were nonrecurring costs related to a litigation matter totaling $376,000. The annualized return on average assets was 1.84% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, down from 2.00% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The annualized return on average equity decreased from 24.4% during the third quarter of 2023 to 18.1% during the current quarter.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of $20.9 million or $3.54 per share, a decrease of $1.4 million from $22.3 million or $3.80 per share earned during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Earnings per diluted share decreased to $3.50 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down $0.25 from $3.75 during the first nine months of 2023. An increase of $2.6 million in net interest income and declines of $1.3 million in the provision for credit losses and $336,000 in the provision for income taxes were offset by a decline of $1.8 million in non-interest income and an increase of $3.9 million in non-interest expense. The annualized return on average assets was 1.69% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down from 1.88% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The annualized return on average equity decreased from 23.3% during the first nine months of 2023 to 17.2% during the current period. \n\n**Balance Sheet Highlights**\n\n**September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023**\n\n  * Cash and due from banks increased by $27 million to $118 million.\n  * Gross loans increased by $45 million, or 5%, to $1.0 billion.\n  * Total equity increased by $62 million, or 52%, to $182 million.\n  * Book value per share increased by $10.41, or 51%, to $30.85.\n  * Borrowings increased by $65 million to $75 million.\n\n\n\n**President’s Comments**\n\nAndrew J. Ryback, director, president, and chief executive officer of Plumas Bancorp and Plumas Bank, commented on the third quarter of 2024, stating, “We anticipate increased deposit retention as a result of the Fed's decision to cut rates by 50bp in the third quarter as rate seeking funds movement activity will likely be tempered. Additionally, lower rates will likely ease potential challenges for variable rate borrowers.”\n\n“In the third quarter of 2024 we released our 2024 Corporate Citizenship Report, highlighting employee, community, and client engagement and support. Efforts include ongoing technological developments to enhance efficiency and reduce environmental impacts, employee development through leadership training and educational support, formalization of certain fee waivers and other forms of client support, and involvement of staff in non-equity incentives and stock option awards in addition to paying livable wages in excess of California minimum wage requirements. These efforts describe Plumas’ intention and promise to be Here. For Good.,” concluded Ryback.\n\n**Loans, Deposits, Investments and Cash**\n\nGross loans increased by $45 million, or 5%, from $959 million at September 30, 2023, to $1.0 billion at September 30, 2024. Increases in loans included $88 million in commercial real estate loans and $5 million in commercial loans, these items were partially offset by decreases of $33 million in automobile loans, $10 million in agricultural loans and $5 million in construction loans.\n\nOn September 30, 2024, approximately 77% of the Company's loan portfolio was comprised of variable rate loans. The rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments in relation to the Company's lending rate or other indexes such as the published prime interest rate or U.S. Treasury rates and vary with changes in these indexes. The frequency at which variable rate loans are repriced can vary from one day to several years. Most of our commercial real estate portfolio reprices every five years. Approximately 75% of the variable rate loans are indexed to the five year T-Bill rate and reprice every five years. Loans indexed to the prime interest rate were approximately 22% of the Company’s variable rate loan portfolio; these loans reprice within one day to three months of a change in the prime rate.\n\nTotal deposits decreased by $51 million from $1.40 billion at September 30, 2023 to $1.35 billion at September 30, 2024. The decrease in deposits includes decreases of $34 million in demand deposits, and $41 million in savings deposits. Partially offsetting these declines were increases of $12 million in both money market accounts and time deposits. While deposits decreased during the 12 month period, we experienced an increase in deposits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of $46 million. At September 30, 2024, 52% of the Company’s deposits were in the form of non-interest-bearing demand deposits. The Company has no brokered deposits.\n\nTotal investment securities increased by $18 million from $438 million at September 30, 2023, to $457 million at September 30, 2024 related to a decline in the unrealized loss on investment securities. The Bank’s investment security portfolio consists of debt securities issued by US Government agencies, US Government sponsored agencies and municipalities. All investment securities are classified as available for sale. The unrealized loss on investment securities decreased from $76 million at September 30, 2023 to $21 million at September 30, 2024. Cash and due from banks increased by $27 million from $91 million at September 30, 2023, to $118 million at September 30, 2024.\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nNonperforming assets (which are comprised of nonperforming loans, other real estate owned (“OREO”) and repossessed vehicle holdings) were $4.8 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets decreased slightly to 0.29% at September 30, 2024 down from 0.31% at September 30, 2023. OREO decreased by $299 thousand from $440 thousand at September 30, 2023 to $141 thousand at September 30, 2024. Nonperforming loans were $4.5 million at September 30, 2024 and $4.3 million at September 30, 2023. Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans decreased slightly to 0.44% at September 30, 2024, down from 0.45% at September 30, 2023.\n\nDuring the first nine months of 2024 we recorded a provision for credit losses of $1,346,000 consisting of a provision for credit losses on loans of $1,475,000 and a decrease in the reserve for unfunded commitments of $129 thousand. The provision includes growth in the loan portfolio, and net losses during the nine-month period. This compares to a provision for credit losses of $2,675,000 consisting of a provision for credit losses - loans of $2,425,000 and an increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments of $250,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nNet charge-offs, mostly related to our automobile loan portfolio, totaled $736 thousand and $724 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The allowance for credit losses totaled $13.6 million at September 30, 2024 and $12.9 million at September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.35% at September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\nThe following tables present the activity in the allowance for credit losses and the reserve for unfunded commitments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands).\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses| September 30, 2024| September 30, 2023  \n---|---|---  \nBalance, beginning of period| $| 12,867| $| 10,717  \nImpact of CECL adoption| -| 529  \nProvision charged to operations| 1,475| 2,425  \nLosses charged to allowance| (1,422| )| (1,252| )  \nRecoveries| 686| 528  \nBalance, end of period| $| 13,606| $| 12,947  \n  \nReserve for Unfunded Commitments| September 30, 2024| September 30, 2023  \n---|---|---  \nBalance, beginning of period| $| 799| $| 341  \nImpact of CECL adoption| -| 258  \nProvision charged to operations| (129| )| 250  \nBalance, end of period| $| 670| $| 849  \n  \n**Shareholders’ Equity**\n\nTotal shareholders’ equity increased by $62 million from $120 million at September 30, 2023, to $182 million at September 30, 2024. The $62 million includes earnings during the twelve-month period of $28.4 million, a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $38.9 million and restricted stock and stock option activity totaling $0.9 million. These items were partially offset by the payment of cash dividends totaling $6.2 million.\n\n**Borrowings**\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) totaling $80 million. In January 2024, the Company borrowed an additional $25 million under the BTFP and during September 2024 we made a $45 million payment resulting in a balance of $60 million outstanding at September 30, 2024. This borrowing bears interest at the rate of 4.85% and is payable on January 17, 2025. Borrowings under the BTFP can be prepaid without penalty. There were no borrowings under the BTFP at September 30, 2023. Interest expense recognized on the BTFP borrowings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $3.7 million.\n\nIn addition to the BTFP borrowings, Plumas Bancorp has outstanding borrowings of $15 million with a correspondent bank. This loan matures on January 25, 2035 and can be prepaid at any time. During the initial three years the loan functions as an interest only revolving line of credit. Beginning on year four the loan converts into a term loan requiring semi-annual principal and interest payments and no further advances can be made. This borrowing bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.85% for the first 5 years and then at a floating interest rate linked to WSJ Prime Rate for the remaining eight year term.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nThe Company manages its liquidity to provide the ability to generate funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals (both anticipated and unanticipated), fund customers' borrowing needs and satisfy maturity of short-term borrowings. The Company’s liquidity needs are managed using assets or liabilities, or both. On the asset side, in addition to cash and due from banks, the Company maintains an investment portfolio which includes unpledged U.S. Government-sponsored agency securities that are classified as available-for-sale. On the liability side, liquidity needs are managed by offering competitive offering rates on deposit products and the use of established lines of credit.\n\nThe Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $240 million from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $426 million. In addition to its FHLB borrowing line, the Company has unsecured short-term borrowing agreements with two of its correspondent banks in the amounts of $50 million and $20 million. There were no outstanding borrowings from the FHLB or the correspondent banks at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\n\nThe Company estimates that it has approximately $456 million in uninsured deposits. Of this amount, $104 million represents deposits that are collateralized such as deposits of states, municipalities and tribal accounts.\n\nCustomer deposits are the Company’s primary source of funds. Total deposits decreased by $51 million from $1.40 billion at September 30, 2023 to $1.35 billion at September 30, 2024. Deposits are held in various forms with varying maturities.\n\nThe Company’s securities portfolio, Federal funds sold, FHLB advances, and cash and due from banks serve as the primary sources of liquidity, providing adequate funding for loans during periods of high loan demand. During periods of decreased lending, funds obtained from the maturing or sale of investments, loan payments, and new deposits are invested in short-term earning assets, such as cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Federal funds sold and investment securities, to serve as a source of funding for future loan growth. Management believes that the Company’s available sources of funds, including borrowings, will provide adequate liquidity for its operations in the foreseeable future.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin – Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nNet interest income was $18.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $1.1 million from the same period in 2023. The increase in net interest income includes an increase of $2.8 million in interest income partially offset by an increase of $1.7 million in interest expense.\n\nInterest and fees on loans increased by $1.4 million related to growth in the loan portfolio and an increase in yield on the portfolio. Average loan balances increased by $58 million, while the average yield on these loans increased by 21 basis points from 6.00% during the third quarter of 2023 to 6.21% during the current quarter. The increase in loan yield includes an increase in SBA fixed rate loans which currently yield approximately 8.1% and the repricing of loans that are priced off the 5 year Treasury. These loans are primarily commercial real estate loans and are repriced every five years.\n\nInterest on investment securities increased by $670 thousand related to an increase in yield of 71 basis points to 3.99%. The increase in investment yields is consistent with the increase in market rates and the partial restructuring of the investment portfolio during the first quarter of 2024. Average investment securities declined from $462 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $447 million during the current quarter. Interest on cash balances increased by $791 thousand related to an increase in average balance of $57 million and an increase in rate earned on these balances of 7 basis points from 5.37% during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.44% during the current quarter. Cash balances primarily relate to cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRB). The average rate earned on FRB balances was 5.33% during both the third quarter of 2024 and 2023.\n\nInterest expense increased by $1.7 million from $1.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $3.0 million during the current period related to increase in rate paid on interest bearing liabilities and an increase in borrowings. The average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased from 0.73% during the 2023 quarter to 1.52% in 2024 related mainly to an increase in market interest rates, and an increase in borrowings.\n\nInterest paid on deposits increased by $391 thousand and is broken down by product type as follows: money market accounts - $266 thousand and time deposits - $146 thousand. Related to a decline in average balance of $43 million, interest on savings deposits declined by $21 thousand. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased from 0.69% during the third quarter of 2023 to 0.97% during the current quarter.\n\nMostly related to an increase in average borrowings outstanding from $10 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $117 million during the current quarter, interest incurred on borrowings increased by $1.3 million from $114 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $1.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. \n\nNet interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.76%, down slightly from 4.77% for the same period in 2023.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin – Nine months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nNet interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $54.7 million, an increase of $2.6 million from the $52.1 million earned during the same period in 2023. The increase in net interest income includes an increase of $8.0 million in interest income partially offset by an increase of $5.4 million in interest expense.\n\nInterest and fees on loans increased by $5.3 million related to an increase in average balance and yield. The average balance of loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $982 million, an increase of $56 million from $926 million during the same period in 2023. The average yield on loans increased by 38 basis points from 5.83% during the first nine months of 2023 to 6.21% during the current period.\n\nInterest on investment securities increased by $2.0 million related to an increase in yield of 67 basis points to 3.92%. The increase in investment yields is consistent with the increase in market rates and the partial restructuring of the investment portfolio. Average investment securities declined from $469 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $457 million during the current period. Interest on cash balances increased by $712 thousand related to an increase in yield of 54 basis points and an increase in average balance of $8.4 million from $88.8 million during the first nine months of 2023 to $97.2 million in the current period.\n\nInterest expense increased from $2.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $8.3 million during the current period related to an increase in rate paid on interest bearing liabilities and an increase in borrowings. The average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased from 0.55% during the 2023 period to 1.43% in 2024 related to an increase in borrowings and an increase in market interest rates. The average balance of borrowings increased by $107 million from $10 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $117 million during the current period.\n\nInterest paid on deposits increased by $1.6 million and is broken down by product type as follows: money market accounts - $556 thousand and time deposits - $1.1 million. Related to a decline in average balance of $57 million, interest on savings deposits declined by $75 thousand. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased from 0.49% during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.85% during the current period.\n\nInterest incurred on borrowings totaled $4.2 million and $396 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nNet interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6 basis points to 4.76%, up from 4.70% for the same period in 2023.\n\n**Non-Interest Income/Expense – Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nNon-interest income decreased by $76 thousand to $2.2 million during the current quarter. Increases of $29 thousand in service charge income, $21 thousand in Federal Home Loan Bank dividends and $6 thousand in other non-interest income were offset by declines in interchange income of $101 thousand, loan servicing fees of $27 thousand and earnings on insurance policies of $4 thousand. Interchange income can fluctuate period to period based on the volume of debit card transactions.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, total non-interest expense increased by $1.4 million from $9.4 million during the third quarter of 2023 to $10.8 million during the current quarter. The largest components of this increase were an increase in salary and benefit expense of $367 thousand, an increase in occupancy and equipment costs of $636 thousand, an increase in professional fees of $117 thousand and an increase in other non-interest expense of $262 thousand. The increase in salary and benefit expense primarily relates to an increase in salary expense and a decrease in the deferral of loan origination costs. Salary expenses increased by $138 thousand, which we attribute primarily to merit and promotional salary increases and an increase in employees. Our full time equivalent employee count has increased from 180 at September 30, 2023 to 189 at September 30, 2024. Deferred loan origination cost declined by $95 thousand from $694 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $599 thousand during the current period. The amount of loan origination costs deferred is primarily related to loan volume, both new originations and renewals, during the period. Occupancy and equipment costs increased by $636 thousand related to an increase in rent expense of $705 thousand mostly related to the sales/leaseback transaction completed during the first quarter of 2024. This increase in rent expense was offset by additional income resulting from the partial restructuring of our investment portfolio which also took place during the first quarter of 2024. Other expenses and professional fees include non-recurring expenses totaling $376 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $565 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to a litigation matter. While portions of this matter are still being litigated these amounts represent our best estimate of potential costs to Plumas Bank related to this matter.\n\n**Non-Interest Income/Expense – Nine months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest income totaled $6.6 million, a decrease of $1.8 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The largest component of this decrease was a $1.7 million gain on termination of our interest rate swaps during 2023. Related to the sale/leaseback transaction during the first quarter of 2024 and the partial restructuring of our investment portfolio, a $19.9 million gain on sale of buildings was offset by a $19.8 million loss on investment securities.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 non-interest expense increased by $3.9 million to $31.6 million. The largest components of this increase were a $1.1 million increase in salary and benefit expenses, a $1.7 million increase in occupancy and equipment expenses and a $618 thousand increase in other non-interest expenses. The largest increases in salary and benefit expense were $524 thousand in salary expense and $404 thousand in commission expense. These were partially offset by an increase in the deferral of loan origination costs of $297 thousand related to an increase in SBA production. The increase in occupancy and equipment costs relates to a $1.7 million increase in rent expense related to the sales/leaseback transaction. The increase in other non-interest expense includes expenses related to the litigation matter discussed earlier.\n\nPlumas Bancorp is headquartered in Reno, Nevada.

Diluted earnings per share decreased to $1.31 per share during the three months ended September 30, 2024 down from $1.34 per share during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. An increase of $1.1 million in net interest income and a decline of $200,000 in the provision for credit losses were offset by increases of $1.4 million in non-interest expense and a decline of $76,000 in the non-interest income. Included in non-interest expense were nonrecurring costs related to a litigation matter totaling $376,000. The annualized return on average assets was 1.84% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, down from 2.00% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The annualized return on average equity decreased from 24.4% during the third quarter of 2023 to 18.1% during the current quarter.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of $20.9 million or $3.54 per share, a decrease of $1.4 million from $22.3 million or $3.80 per share earned during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Earnings per diluted share decreased to $3.50 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down $0.25 from $3.75 during the first nine months of 2023. An increase of $2.6 million in net interest income and declines of $1.3 million in the provision for credit losses and $336,000 in the provision for income taxes were offset by a decline of $1.8 million in non-interest income and an increase of $3.9 million in non-interest expense. The annualized return on average assets was 1.69% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down from 1.88% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The annualized return on average equity decreased from 23.3% during the first nine months of 2023 to 17.2% during the current period. \n\n**Balance Sheet Highlights**\n\n**September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023**\n\n  * Cash and due from banks increased by $27 million to $118 million.\n  * Gross loans increased by $45 million, or 5%, to $1.0 billion.\n  * Total equity increased by $62 million, or 52%, to $182 million.\n  * Book value per share increased by $10.41, or 51%, to $30.85.\n  * Borrowings increased by $65 million to $75 million.\n\n\n\n**President’s Comments**\n\nAndrew J. Ryback, director, president, and chief executive officer of Plumas Bancorp and Plumas Bank, commented on the third quarter of 2024, stating, “We anticipate increased deposit retention as a result of the Fed's decision to cut rates by 50bp in the third quarter as rate seeking funds movement activity will likely be tempered. Additionally, lower rates will likely ease potential challenges for variable rate borrowers.”\n\n“In the third quarter of 2024 we released our 2024 Corporate Citizenship Report, highlighting employee, community, and client engagement and support. Efforts include ongoing technological developments to enhance efficiency and reduce environmental impacts, employee development through leadership training and educational support, formalization of certain fee waivers and other forms of client support, and involvement of staff in non-equity incentives and stock option awards in addition to paying livable wages in excess of California minimum wage requirements. These efforts describe Plumas’ intention and promise to be Here. For Good.,” concluded Ryback.\n\n**Loans, Deposits, Investments and Cash**\n\nGross loans increased by $45 million, or 5%, from $959 million at September 30, 2023, to $1.0 billion at September 30, 2024. Increases in loans included $88 million in commercial real estate loans and $5 million in commercial loans, these items were partially offset by decreases of $33 million in automobile loans, $10 million in agricultural loans and $5 million in construction loans.\n\nOn September 30, 2024, approximately 77% of the Company's loan portfolio was comprised of variable rate loans. The rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments in relation to the Company's lending rate or other indexes such as the published prime interest rate or U.S. Treasury rates and vary with changes in these indexes. The frequency at which variable rate loans are repriced can vary from one day to several years. Most of our commercial real estate portfolio reprices every five years. Approximately 75% of the variable rate loans are indexed to the five year T-Bill rate and reprice every five years. Loans indexed to the prime interest rate were approximately 22% of the Company’s variable rate loan portfolio; these loans reprice within one day to three months of a change in the prime rate.\n\nTotal deposits decreased by $51 million from $1.40 billion at September 30, 2023 to $1.35 billion at September 30, 2024. The decrease in deposits includes decreases of $34 million in demand deposits, and $41 million in savings deposits. Partially offsetting these declines were increases of $12 million in both money market accounts and time deposits. While deposits decreased during the 12 month period, we experienced an increase in deposits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of $46 million. At September 30, 2024, 52% of the Company’s deposits were in the form of non-interest-bearing demand deposits. The Company has no brokered deposits.\n\nTotal investment securities increased by $18 million from $438 million at September 30, 2023, to $457 million at September 30, 2024 related to a decline in the unrealized loss on investment securities. The Bank’s investment security portfolio consists of debt securities issued by US Government agencies, US Government sponsored agencies and municipalities. All investment securities are classified as available for sale. The unrealized loss on investment securities decreased from $76 million at September 30, 2023 to $21 million at September 30, 2024. Cash and due from banks increased by $27 million from $91 million at September 30, 2023, to $118 million at September 30, 2024.\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nNonperforming assets (which are comprised of nonperforming loans, other real estate owned (“OREO”) and repossessed vehicle holdings) were $4.8 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets decreased slightly to 0.29% at September 30, 2024 down from 0.31% at September 30, 2023. OREO decreased by $299 thousand from $440 thousand at September 30, 2023 to $141 thousand at September 30, 2024. Nonperforming loans were $4.5 million at September 30, 2024 and $4.3 million at September 30, 2023. Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans decreased slightly to 0.44% at September 30, 2024, down from 0.45% at September 30, 2023.\n\nDuring the first nine months of 2024 we recorded a provision for credit losses of $1,346,000 consisting of a provision for credit losses on loans of $1,475,000 and a decrease in the reserve for unfunded commitments of $129 thousand. The provision includes growth in the loan portfolio, and net losses during the nine-month period. This compares to a provision for credit losses of $2,675,000 consisting of a provision for credit losses - loans of $2,425,000 and an increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments of $250,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nNet charge-offs, mostly related to our automobile loan portfolio, totaled $736 thousand and $724 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The allowance for credit losses totaled $13.6 million at September 30, 2024 and $12.9 million at September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.35% at September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\nThe following tables present the activity in the allowance for credit losses and the reserve for unfunded commitments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands).\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses| September 30, 2024| September 30, 2023  \n---|---|---  \nBalance, beginning of period| $| 12,867| $| 10,717  \nImpact of CECL adoption| -| 529  \nProvision charged to operations| 1,475| 2,425  \nLosses charged to allowance| (1,422| )| (1,252| )  \nRecoveries| 686| 528  \nBalance, end of period| $| 13,606| $| 12,947  \n  \nReserve for Unfunded Commitments| September 30, 2024| September 30, 2023  \n---|---|---  \nBalance, beginning of period| $| 799| $| 341  \nImpact of CECL adoption| -| 258  \nProvision charged to operations| (129| )| 250  \nBalance, end of period| $| 670| $| 849  \n  \n**Shareholders’ Equity**\n\nTotal shareholders’ equity increased by $62 million from $120 million at September 30, 2023, to $182 million at September 30, 2024. The $62 million includes earnings during the twelve-month period of $28.4 million, a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $38.9 million and restricted stock and stock option activity totaling $0.9 million. These items were partially offset by the payment of cash dividends totaling $6.2 million.\n\n**Borrowings**\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) totaling $80 million. In January 2024, the Company borrowed an additional $25 million under the BTFP and during September 2024 we made a $45 million payment resulting in a balance of $60 million outstanding at September 30, 2024. This borrowing bears interest at the rate of 4.85% and is payable on January 17, 2025. Borrowings under the BTFP can be prepaid without penalty. There were no borrowings under the BTFP at September 30, 2023. Interest expense recognized on the BTFP borrowings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $3.7 million.\n\nIn addition to the BTFP borrowings, Plumas Bancorp has outstanding borrowings of $15 million with a correspondent bank. This loan matures on January 25, 2035 and can be prepaid at any time. During the initial three years the loan functions as an interest only revolving line of credit. Beginning on year four the loan converts into a term loan requiring semi-annual principal and interest payments and no further advances can be made. This borrowing bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.85% for the first 5 years and then at a floating interest rate linked to WSJ Prime Rate for the remaining eight year term.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nThe Company manages its liquidity to provide the ability to generate funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals (both anticipated and unanticipated), fund customers' borrowing needs and satisfy maturity of short-term borrowings. The Company’s liquidity needs are managed using assets or liabilities, or both. On the asset side, in addition to cash and due from banks, the Company maintains an investment portfolio which includes unpledged U.S. Government-sponsored agency securities that are classified as available-for-sale. On the liability side, liquidity needs are managed by offering competitive offering rates on deposit products and the use of established lines of credit.\n\nThe Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $240 million from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $426 million. In addition to its FHLB borrowing line, the Company has unsecured short-term borrowing agreements with two of its correspondent banks in the amounts of $50 million and $20 million. There were no outstanding borrowings from the FHLB or the correspondent banks at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\n\nThe Company estimates that it has approximately $456 million in uninsured deposits. Of this amount, $104 million represents deposits that are collateralized such as deposits of states, municipalities and tribal accounts.\n\nCustomer deposits are the Company’s primary source of funds. Total deposits decreased by $51 million from $1.40 billion at September 30, 2023 to $1.35 billion at September 30, 2024. Deposits are held in various forms with varying maturities.\n\nThe Company’s securities portfolio, Federal funds sold, FHLB advances, and cash and due from banks serve as the primary sources of liquidity, providing adequate funding for loans during periods of high loan demand. During periods of decreased lending, funds obtained from the maturing or sale of investments, loan payments, and new deposits are invested in short-term earning assets, such as cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Federal funds sold and investment securities, to serve as a source of funding for future loan growth. Management believes that the Company’s available sources of funds, including borrowings, will provide adequate liquidity for its operations in the foreseeable future.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin – Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nNet interest income was $18.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $1.1 million from the same period in 2023. The increase in net interest income includes an increase of $2.8 million in interest income partially offset by an increase of $1.7 million in interest expense.\n\nInterest and fees on loans increased by $1.4 million related to growth in the loan portfolio and an increase in yield on the portfolio. Average loan balances increased by $58 million, while the average yield on these loans increased by 21 basis points from 6.00% during the third quarter of 2023 to 6.21% during the current quarter. The increase in loan yield includes an increase in SBA fixed rate loans which currently yield approximately 8.1% and the repricing of loans that are priced off the 5 year Treasury. These loans are primarily commercial real estate loans and are repriced every five years.\n\nInterest on investment securities increased by $670 thousand related to an increase in yield of 71 basis points to 3.99%. The increase in investment yields is consistent with the increase in market rates and the partial restructuring of the investment portfolio during the first quarter of 2024. Average investment securities declined from $462 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $447 million during the current quarter. Interest on cash balances increased by $791 thousand related to an increase in average balance of $57 million and an increase in rate earned on these balances of 7 basis points from 5.37% during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.44% during the current quarter. Cash balances primarily relate to cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRB). The average rate earned on FRB balances was 5.33% during both the third quarter of 2024 and 2023.\n\nInterest expense increased by $1.7 million from $1.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $3.0 million during the current period related to increase in rate paid on interest bearing liabilities and an increase in borrowings. The average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased from 0.73% during the 2023 quarter to 1.52% in 2024 related mainly to an increase in market interest rates, and an increase in borrowings.\n\nInterest paid on deposits increased by $391 thousand and is broken down by product type as follows: money market accounts - $266 thousand and time deposits - $146 thousand. Related to a decline in average balance of $43 million, interest on savings deposits declined by $21 thousand. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased from 0.69% during the third quarter of 2023 to 0.97% during the current quarter.\n\nMostly related to an increase in average borrowings outstanding from $10 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $117 million during the current quarter, interest incurred on borrowings increased by $1.3 million from $114 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $1.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. \n\nNet interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.76%, down slightly from 4.77% for the same period in 2023.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin – Nine months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nNet interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $54.7 million, an increase of $2.6 million from the $52.1 million earned during the same period in 2023. The increase in net interest income includes an increase of $8.0 million in interest income partially offset by an increase of $5.4 million in interest expense.\n\nInterest and fees on loans increased by $5.3 million related to an increase in average balance and yield. The average balance of loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $982 million, an increase of $56 million from $926 million during the same period in 2023. The average yield on loans increased by 38 basis points from 5.83% during the first nine months of 2023 to 6.21% during the current period.\n\nInterest on investment securities increased by $2.0 million related to an increase in yield of 67 basis points to 3.92%. The increase in investment yields is consistent with the increase in market rates and the partial restructuring of the investment portfolio. Average investment securities declined from $469 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $457 million during the current period. Interest on cash balances increased by $712 thousand related to an increase in yield of 54 basis points and an increase in average balance of $8.4 million from $88.8 million during the first nine months of 2023 to $97.2 million in the current period.\n\nInterest expense increased from $2.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $8.3 million during the current period related to an increase in rate paid on interest bearing liabilities and an increase in borrowings. The average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased from 0.55% during the 2023 period to 1.43% in 2024 related to an increase in borrowings and an increase in market interest rates. The average balance of borrowings increased by $107 million from $10 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $117 million during the current period.\n\nInterest paid on deposits increased by $1.6 million and is broken down by product type as follows: money market accounts - $556 thousand and time deposits - $1.1 million. Related to a decline in average balance of $57 million, interest on savings deposits declined by $75 thousand. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased from 0.49% during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.85% during the current period.\n\nInterest incurred on borrowings totaled $4.2 million and $396 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nNet interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6 basis points to 4.76%, up from 4.70% for the same period in 2023.\n\n**Non-Interest Income/Expense – Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nNon-interest income decreased by $76 thousand to $2.2 million during the current quarter. Increases of $29 thousand in service charge income, $21 thousand in Federal Home Loan Bank dividends and $6 thousand in other non-interest income were offset by declines in interchange income of $101 thousand, loan servicing fees of $27 thousand and earnings on insurance policies of $4 thousand. Interchange income can fluctuate period to period based on the volume of debit card transactions.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, total non-interest expense increased by $1.4 million from $9.4 million during the third quarter of 2023 to $10.8 million during the current quarter. The largest components of this increase were an increase in salary and benefit expense of $367 thousand, an increase in occupancy and equipment costs of $636 thousand, an increase in professional fees of $117 thousand and an increase in other non-interest expense of $262 thousand. The increase in salary and benefit expense primarily relates to an increase in salary expense and a decrease in the deferral of loan origination costs. Salary expenses increased by $138 thousand, which we attribute primarily to merit and promotional salary increases and an increase in employees. Our full time equivalent employee count has increased from 180 at September 30, 2023 to 189 at September 30, 2024. Deferred loan origination cost declined by $95 thousand from $694 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $599 thousand during the current period. The amount of loan origination costs deferred is primarily related to loan volume, both new originations and renewals, during the period. Occupancy and equipment costs increased by $636 thousand related to an increase in rent expense of $705 thousand mostly related to the sales/leaseback transaction completed during the first quarter of 2024. This increase in rent expense was offset by additional income resulting from the partial restructuring of our investment portfolio which also took place during the first quarter of 2024. Other expenses and professional fees include non-recurring expenses totaling $376 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $565 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to a litigation matter. While portions of this matter are still being litigated these amounts represent our best estimate of potential costs to Plumas Bank related to this matter.\n\n**Non-Interest Income/Expense – Nine months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest income totaled $6.6 million, a decrease of $1.8 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The largest component of this decrease was a $1.7 million gain on termination of our interest rate swaps during 2023. Related to the sale/leaseback transaction during the first quarter of 2024 and the partial restructuring of our investment portfolio, a $19.9 million gain on sale of buildings was offset by a $19.8 million loss on investment securities.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 non-interest expense increased by $3.9 million to $31.6 million. The largest components of this increase were a $1.1 million increase in salary and benefit expenses, a $1.7 million increase in occupancy and equipment expenses and a $618 thousand increase in other non-interest expenses. The largest increases in salary and benefit expense were $524 thousand in salary expense and $404 thousand in commission expense. These were partially offset by an increase in the deferral of loan origination costs of $297 thousand related to an increase in SBA production. The increase in occupancy and equipment costs relates to a $1.7 million increase in rent expense related to the sales/leaseback transaction. The increase in other non-interest expense includes expenses related to the litigation matter discussed earlier.\n\nPlumas Bancorp is headquartered in Reno, Nevada.

THE BUSINESS OF PLUMAS BANCORP\nDuring 2002, Plumas Bancorp (the \"Company\") was incorporated as a bank holding company for the purpose of acquiring Plumas Bank (the \"Bank\") in a one\nbank holding company reorganization. This corporate structure gives the Company and the Bank greater flexibility in terms of operation, expansion and\ndiversification. The Company formed Plumas Statutory Trust I (\"Trust I\") for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities on September 26, 2002. The\nCompany formed Plumas Statutory Trust II (\"Trust II\") for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities on September 28, 2005. In March 2023 the\nTrusts were dissolved. Plumas Bancorp's Principal Executive Office is located in Reno, Nevada.\nThe Bank operates thirteen branches in California, including branches in Alturas, Chester, Chico, Fall River Mills, Greenville, Kings Beach, Portola, Quincy,\nRedding, Susanville, Tahoe City, Truckee and Yuba City. The Bank's newest branch was opened in April 2023 and is located in Chico, California. The Bank’s\nadministrative headquarters are in Quincy, California. In December 2015 the Bank opened a branch in Reno, Nevada, its first branch outside of California, and\nin 2018 the Bank purchased a branch located in Carson City, Nevada. In addition, the Bank operates a lending office specializing in government-guaranteed\nlending in Auburn, California, and a commercial/agricultural lending office in Klamath Falls, Oregon. The Bank's primary source of revenue is generated from\nproviding loans to customers who are predominately small and middle market businesses and individuals residing in the surrounding areas.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nConsolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the consolidated accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Plumas Bank. All\nsignificant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nThe accounting and reporting policies of Plumas Bancorp and subsidiary conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica and prevailing practices within the banking industry. In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\ncontain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position at September 30, 2024\nand the results of its operations and its cash flows for the three and nine-month periods. Our condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 is\nderived from audited financial statements.\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission (“SEC”) for interim reporting on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, certain disclosures normally presented in the notes to the annual\nconsolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) have been\nomitted. The Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information not misleading. These interim financial statements should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's 2023 Annual Report to Shareholders on Form 10-K. The\nresults of operations for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. In preparing\nsuch financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of\nthe balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the periods reported. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\nSegment Information\nManagement has determined that since all of the banking products and services offered by the Company are available in each branch of the Bank, all branches\nare located within the same economic environment and management does not allocate resources based on the performance of different lending or transaction\nactivities, it is appropriate to aggregate the Bank branches and report them as a single operating segment. No customer accounts for more than 10 percent of\nrevenues for the Company or the Bank.\nReclassification\nSome items in the prior year consolidated financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Reclassifications had no effect on prior\nyear net income or shareholders' equity.\n7\n3. INVESTMENT SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE\nThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of the following, in thousands:\nAvailable-for-Sale September 30, 2024\nGross Gross\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair\nCost Gains Losses Value\nDebt securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities $ 3,998 $ - $ (7) $ 3,991\nU.S. Government-sponsored agencies collateralized by mortgage obligations -\nresidential 243,643 2,287 (10,244) 235,686\nU.S. Government-agencies collateralized by mortgage obligations - commercial 134,642 1,609 (8,867) 127,384\nObligations of states and political subdivisions 95,330 1,137 (6,808) 89,659\n$ 477,613 $ 5,033 $ (25,926) $ 456,720\nUnrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $20,893,000 were recorded, net of $6,176,000 in tax benefit, as accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss within shareholders' equity at September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 157 available-\nfor-sale investment securities for proceeds of $116,285,000 recording a $19,817,000 net loss on sale. The Company realized a gain on sale from ten of these\nsecurities totaling $115,000 and a loss on sale of 147 securities totaling $19,932,000. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold\ntwo available-for-sale investment securities for proceeds of $1,447,000 recording a $9,000 net gain on sale. The Company realized a gain on sale from one of\nthese securities totaling $29,000 and a loss on sale of one security totaling $20,000.\nAvailable-for-Sale December 31, 2023\nGross Gross\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair\nCost Gains Losses Value\nDebt securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities $ 6,978 $ - $ (98) $ 6,880\nU.S. Government-sponsored agencies collateralized by mortgage obligations -\nresidential 256,694 351 (21,114) 235,931\nU.S. Government-agencies collateralized by mortgage obligations - commercial 129,321 465 (13,834) 115,952\nObligations of states and political subdivisions 142,276 1,067 (12,925) 130,418\n$ 535,269 $ 1,883 $ (47,971) $ 489,181\nUnrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $46,088,000 were recorded, net of $13,624,000 in tax benefit, as accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss within shareholders' equity at December 31, 2023. No securities were sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThere were no transfers of available-for-sale investment securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and twelve months ended December 31,\n2023. There were no securities classified as held-to-maturity at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\n8\nInvestment securities with unrealized losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are summarized and classified according to the duration of the loss\nperiod as follows, in thousands:\nSeptember 30, 2024 Less than 12 Months 12 Months or More Total\nFair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized\nValue Losses Value Losses Value Losses\nDebt securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities $ - $ - $ 3,991 $ 7 $ 3,991 $ 7\nU.S. Government-sponsored agencies collateralized by mortgage\nobligations - residential 4,357 2 101,187 10,242 105,544 10,244\nU.S. Government-agencies collateralized by mortgage obligations -\ncommercial 9,310 106 60,454 8,761 69,764 8,867\nObligations of states and political subdivisions 1,941 11 50,544 6,797 52,485 6,808\n$ 15,608 $ 119 $216,176 $ 25,807 $231,784 $ 25,926\nDecember 31, 2023 Less than 12 Months 12 Months or More Total\nFair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized\nValue Losses Value Losses Value Losses\nDebt securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities $ - $ - $ 6,880 $ 98 $ 6,880 $ 98\nU.S. Government-sponsored agencies collateralized by mortgage\nobligations - residential 43,924 279 160,383 20,835 204,307 21,114\nU.S. Government-agencies collateralized by mortgage obligations -\ncommercial 16,533 295 71,782 13,539 88,315 13,834\nObligations of states and political subdivisions 9,306 151 82,764 12,774 92,070 12,925\n$ 69,763 $ 725 $321,809 $ 47,246 $391,572 $ 47,971\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company held 309 securities of which six were in a loss position for less than twelve months and 180 were in a loss position for\ntwelve months or more. Of the 309 securities one is a U.S. Treasury security, 92 are U.S. Government-sponsored agencies collateralized by residential\nmortgage obligations, 46 were U.S. Government agencies collateralized by commercial mortgage obligations and 170 were obligations of states and political\nsubdivisions. The unrealized losses relate principally to market rate conditions. All of the securities continue to pay as scheduled. For available-for-sale debt\nsecurities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the\nsecurity before recovery of its amortized costs basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security's amortized cost basis is\nwritten down to fair value through income. At September 30, 2024, neither of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell was met for any of\nthe securities in an unrealized loss position.\nUnrealized losses on investments in obligations of U.S. government agencies and U.S. government sponsored agencies are caused by interest rate increases.\nBecause the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because the Company does not intend to sell and more\nlikely than not will not be required to sell, there is no allowance for credit losses recorded.\nObligations of states and political subdivisions: The unrealized losses on investments in obligations of states and political subdivisions were caused by\nincreases in required yields by investors in these types of securities. Because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit\nquality, and because the Company does not intend to sell and more likely than not will not be required to sell, there is no allowance for credit losses recorded.\nThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment in debt securities at September 30, 2024 by contractual maturity are shown below, in thousands.\nAmortized Cost Estimated Fair Value\nWithin one year $ 4,818 $ 4,809\nAfter one year through five years 5,793 5,824\nAfter five years through ten years 17,544 17,765\nAfter ten years 71,173 65,252\nInvestment securities not due at a single maturity date:\nGovernment- agencies commercial mortgage-backed securities 134,642 127,384\nGovernment-sponsored agencies residential mortgage-backed securities 243,643 235,686\n$ 477,613 $ 456,720\nExpected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without\ncall or prepayment penalties.\nInvestment securities with amortized costs totaling $327,379,000 and $316,733,000 and estimated fair values totaling $314,662,000 and $285,534,000 at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were pledged to secure deposits, repurchase agreements and Federal Reserve Bank borrowings.\n9\n4.

Salaries and employee benefits totaling $599,000 and $694,000 have been deferred as loan origination costs during the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company assigns a risk rating to all loans and periodically, but not less than annually, performs detailed reviews of all criticized and classified loans over\n$100,000 to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of the portfolio. These risk ratings are also subject to examination by independent\nspecialists engaged by the Company and the Company’s regulators. During these internal reviews, management monitors and analyzes the financial condition\nof borrowers and guarantors, trends in the industries in which borrowers operate and the fair values of collateral securing these loans. These credit quality\nindicators are used to assign a risk rating to each individual loan.\nThe risk ratings can be grouped into three major categories, defined as follows:\nSpecial Mention – Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these\npotential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution’s credit position at some future date.\nSubstandard – A substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral\npledged, if any. Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Well defined\nweaknesses include a project's lack of marketability, inadequate cash flow or collateral support, failure to complete construction on time or the project's\nfailure to fulfill economic expectations. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not\ncorrected.\nDoubtful – Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses\nmake collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.\nLoans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above-described process are considered to be pass-rated loans.\nFor other loans, which are primarily consumer loans and automobile loans the Company evaluates credit quality based on the aging status of the loan and by\npayment activity. Non-performing loans consist of nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned relates to real estate acquired in full or partial settlement of loan obligations. At September 30, 2024 other real estate owned totaled\n$141,000, consisting of one single family residential real estate (SFR) property. At December 31, 2023 other real estate owned totaled $357,000 also consisting\nof one SFR property. There was one commercial real estate loan with a balance of $53,000 secured by a SFR property for which formal foreclosure proceedings\nwere in process at September 30, 2024 and one consumer mortgage loan with a balance of $122,000 secured by a SFR property for which formal foreclosure\nproceedings were in process at December 31, 2023.\n10\nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis of the loan portfolio allocated by management's internal risk ratings or payment activity at the dates\nindicated, in thousands:\nAmortized Cost Basis by Origination Year and Risk Grades -

Generally, this collection\nperiod would not exceed 90 days.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe Company is party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the amount of\nultimate liability with respect to such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or result of operations of the Company\ntaken as a whole. In the normal course of business, there are various outstanding commitments to extend credit, which are not reflected in the financial\nstatements, including loan commitments of $158.7 million and $174.6 million and stand-by letters of credit of $0 and $108,000 at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.\nOf the loan commitments outstanding at September 30, 2024, $23.9 million are real estate construction loan commitments that are expected to fund within the\nnext twelve months. The remaining commitments primarily relate to revolving lines of credit or other commercial loans, and many of these are expected to\nexpire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each loan commitment and the\namount and type of collateral obtained, if any, are evaluated on an individual basis. Collateral held varies, but may include real property, bank deposits, debt or\nequity securities or business assets. The reserve for unfunded commitments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled $670,000 and $799,000,\nrespectively.\nStand-by letters of credit are conditional commitments written to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily\nrelated to the purchases of inventory by commercial customers and are typically short-term in nature. Credit risk is similar to that involved in extending loan\ncommitments to customers and accordingly, evaluation and collateral requirements similar to those for loan commitments are used.\n17\n6. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding\nfor the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as stock\noptions, result in the issuance of common stock which shares in the earnings of the Company. The treasury stock method has been applied to determine the\ndilutive effect of stock options in computing diluted earnings per share.\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands, except per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet Income:\nNet income $ 7,830 $ 7,970 $ 20,870 $ 22,255\nEarnings Per Share:\nBasic earnings per share $ 1.33 $ 1.36 $ 3.54 $ 3.80\nDiluted earnings per share $ 1.31 $ 1.34 $ 3.50 $ 3.75\nWeighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding:\nBasic shares 5,896 5,866 5,893 5,861\nEffect of dilutive of stock options and restricted stock 72 66 63 71\nDiluted shares 5,968 5,932 5,956 5,932\nThere were no stock options having an antidilutive effect during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023.\n7. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nIn May 2022, the Company’s shareholders approved the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2022 Plan”), which provides for the grant of up to 576,550 shares of\ncommon stock, including 126,550 shares that remained available for grant under the 2013 Stock Option Plan when the 2022 Plan was adopted. The 2022 Plan\nprovides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-\nbased awards. The frequency, amount and terms of stock-based awards may be determined by the Board of Directors or its compensation committee, consistent\nwith the terms and purposes of the 2022 plan.\nIn May 2013, the Company established the 2013 Stock Option Plan for which 139,847 shares of common stock are reserved. With the establishment of the\nCompany’s 2022 Equity Incentive Plan, no further options may be issued under the 2013 Stock Option Plan, though options previously granted continue to be\noutstanding and governed by the 2013 Stock Option Plan.\n107,200 options were granted under the 2022 Plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Compensation costs related to these units during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $26,000 and $63,000, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was $40,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock units. That cost is expected to be recognized\nover a weighted average period of 0.4 years.\nDuring 2022, the Company granted 1,650 shares of restricted stock with a fair value of $31 per share and a one-year vesting period. Compensation costs related\nto these shares during the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2023 totaled $(21,000) and $4,000, respectively. There were no compensation costs\nrelated to these shares in 2024.\n8. INCOME TAXES\nThe Company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary. Income tax expense is the total of current year income tax due or refundable\nand the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and\ntheir tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. A valuation allowance is\nrecognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will\nnot be realized. On the consolidated balance sheet, net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.\nWhen tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject\nto uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized\nin the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be\nsustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other\npositions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent\nlikely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the\namount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated\ninterest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.\nInterest expense and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are classified as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.\nThere have been no significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023.\n19\n9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\nThe Company measures fair value under the fair value hierarchy described below.\nLevel 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active exchange markets.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not\nactive and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3: Model based techniques that use one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect the\nCompany’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use on pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include management\njudgment and estimation which may be significant.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy\nwithin which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment\nand considers factors specific to the asset or liability.\nManagement monitors the availability of observable market data to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy.\nChanges in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another. In\nsuch instances, the transfer is reported at the beginning of the reporting period.\nManagement evaluates the significance of transfers between levels based upon the nature of the financial instrument and size of the transfer relative to total\nassets, total liabilities or total earnings.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments, at September 30, 2024 follows, in thousands:\nFair Value Measurements at September 30, 2024, Using:\nCarrying Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Fair Value\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 117,959 $ 117,959 $ - $ - $ 117,959\nInvestment securities 456,720 - 456,720 - 456,720\nLoans, net 993,070 - - 973,768 973,768\nFHLB stock 6,234 - - - N/A\nFRB Stock 1,377 - - - N/A\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits 1,350,996 1,248,755 102,354 - 1,351,109\nRepurchase agreements 16,992 - 16,992 - 16,992\nBorrowings 75,000 - - 72,734 72,734\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments, at December 31, 2023 follows, in thousands:\nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2023 Using:\nFinancial assets: Carrying Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Fair Value\nCash and cash equivalents $ 85,655 $ 85,655 $ 85,655\nInvestment securities 489,181 489,181 489,181\nLoans, net 948,604 $ 923,500 $ 923,500\nFHLB stock 6,234 N/A\nFRB Stock 1,371 N/A\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits 1,333,655 1,242,003 92,311 1,334,314\nRepurchase agreements 23,054 23,054 23,054\nBorrowings 90,000 86,100 86,100\nBecause no market exists for a significant portion of the Company's financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding current\neconomic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. Those estimates that are subjective in nature and involve\nuncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision are included in Level 3. Changes in assumptions could\nsignificantly affect the fair values presented.\n20\nThese estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering the Company's entire holdings of a particular financial instrument for\nsale at one time, nor do they attempt to estimate the value of anticipated future business related to the instruments. In addition, the tax ramifications related to\nthe realization of unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of these estimates.\nThe following tables present information about the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair\nvalue:\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2024 are summarized below, in thousands:\nFair Value Measurements at\nSeptember 30, 2024 Using\nQuoted\nPrices in\nActive Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nAssets Inputs Inputs\nTotal Fair\nValue (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nU.S. Treasury securities $ 3,991 $ - $ 3,991 $ -\nU.S. Government-sponsored agencies collateralized by mortgage obligations-\nresidential 235,686 - 235,686 -\nU.S. Government agencies collateralized by mortgage obligations-commercial 127,384 - 127,384 -\nObligations of states and political subdivisions 89,659 - 89,659 -\n$ 456,720 $ - $ 456,720 $ -\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2023 are summarized below, in thousands:\nFair Value Measurements at\nDecember 31, 2023 Using\nQuoted\nPrices in\nActive Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nAssets Inputs Inputs\nTotal Fair\nValue (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nU.S. Treasury securities $ 6,880 $ - $ 6,880 $ -\nU.S. Government-sponsored agencies collateralized by mortgage obligations -\nresidential 235,931 - 235,931 -\nU.S. Government-agencies collateralized by mortgage obligations - commercial 115,952 - 115,952 -\nObligations of states and political subdivisions 130,418 - 130,418 -\n$ 489,181 $ - $ 489,181 $ -\nThe fair value of securities available-for-sale equals quoted market price, if available.

However, from time to time, fair value adjustments are recorded\non these loans to reflect partial write-downs, through charge-offs or specific reserve allowances, that are based on fair value estimates of the underlying\ncollateral. The fair value estimates for collateral-dependent loans are generally based on recent real estate appraisals or broker opinions, obtained from\nindependent third parties, which are frequently adjusted by management to reflect current conditions and estimated selling costs (Level 3). No impairment\ncharges were recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, related to the above collateral-dependent loan. Impairment charges of $28,000\nwere recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, related to the above collateral dependent loans. The collateral-dependent loans at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consist solely of loans which have been allocated a specific credit reserve. Collateral-dependent loans consisted of\none loan on September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.\nOther Real Estate: Nonrecurring adjustments to certain real estate properties classified as other real estate owned are measured at the lower of carrying amount\nor fair value, less costs to sell. In cases where the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values are\ngenerally based on third party appraisals of the property which are commonly adjusted by management to reflect current conditions and selling costs (Level 3).\nAppraisals for both collateral-dependent loans and other real estate are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified\nresidential appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company. Once received, a member\nof the Loan Administration Department reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value in\ncomparison with independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics. On a quarterly basis, the Company compares the actual selling\nprice of similar collateral that has been liquidated to the most recent appraised value for unsold properties to determine what additional adjustment, if any,\nshould be made to the appraisal value to arrive at fair value. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for\ndifferences between the comparable sales and income data available.\n22\nThe following table presents quantitative information about Level 3 fair value measurements for financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-\nrecurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\nRange Range\n(Weighted (Weighted\nFair Value Fair Value Valuation Average) Average)\nDescription 9/30/2024 12/31/2023 Technique Significant Unobservable Input 9/30/2024 12/31/2023\nCollateral-dependent loans\nThird Party Management Adjustments to Reflect\nCommercial $ 28 $ 27 appraisals Current Conditions and Selling Costs 48% 48%\nOther Real Estate:\nThird Party Management Adjustments to Reflect\nRE – Residential $ 141 $ 357 appraisals Current Conditions and Selling Costs 39% 11%\n10.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCertain matters discussed in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to\ndiffer materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, (1) significant increases in\ncompetitive pressures in the financial services industry; (2) changes in the interest rate environment resulting in reduced margins; (3) general economic\nconditions, either nationally or regionally, may be less favorable than expected, resulting in, among other things, a deterioration in credit quality; (4) changes in\nregulatory environment; (5) loss of key personnel; (6) fluctuations in the real estate market; (7) changes in business conditions and inflation; (8) operational\nrisks including data processing systems failures or fraud; and (9) changes in securities markets. Therefore, the information set forth herein should be carefully\nconsidered when evaluating the business prospects of Plumas Bancorp (the “Company”).\nWhen the Company uses in this Quarterly Report the words “anticipate”, “estimate”, “expect”, “project”, “intend”, “commit”, “believe” and similar\nexpressions, the Company intends to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are not guarantees of performance and are subject to certain risks,\nuncertainties and assumptions, including those described in this Quarterly Report. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should\nunderlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, expected, projected, intended, committed or\nbelieved. The future results and stockholder values of the Company may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Many of\nthe factors that will determine these results and values are beyond the Company’s ability to control or predict. For those statements, the Company claims the\nprotection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe following discussion and analysis sets forth certain statistical information relating to the Company as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and\nfor the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto\nincluded in Plumas Bancorp’s Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nPlumas Bancorp trades on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbol “PLBC”.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThere have been no changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies from those disclosed in the Company’s 2023 Annual Report to Shareholders on\nForm 10-K.\nSALES/LEASEBACK AND INVESTMENT RESTRUCTURING\nOn January 19, 2024, Plumas Bank entered into two agreements for the purchase and sale of real property (the “Sale Agreements”). One Sale Agreement\nprovided for the sale to MountainSeed of nine properties owned and operated by Plumas Bank as branches (the “Branches”) for an aggregate cash purchase\nprice of approximately $25.7 million. The branch portion of the sale was completed on February 14, 2024 resulting in a net gain on sale of $19.9 million,\nrecording of right-of-use assets totaling $22.3 million and recording a lease liability of $22.3 million. The second Sale Agreement provided for the sale to\nMountainSeed of up to three properties operated as non-branch administrative offices (the “Non-Branch Offices”). This agreement was terminated in August\n2024. We continue to review opportunities for the sale of the Non-Branch Offices.\nConcurrently with the closing of the sale of the branch properties, we entered into triple net lease agreements (the “Lease Agreements”) pursuant to which\nPlumas Bank leased back each of the properties sold. Each Lease Agreement has an initial term of fifteen years with one 15-year renewal option. The Lease\nAgreements provide for an annual rent of approximately $2.4 million in the aggregate for the nine properties increased by two percent (2%) per annum for each\nyear during the initial Term. During the renewal term, the initial rent will be the basic rent during the last year of the initial term, increased by two percent (2%)\nper annum for each year during the renewal term.\nThe gain on sales of the branches was offset by losses on the sale of approximately $115 million in investment securities. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 we sold $115 million in investment securities having a weighted average tax equivalent yield of 2.24% recording a $19.8 million loss on\nthe sales. As part of the restructuring, beginning in December 2023 and ending on March 27, 2024, we purchased $120 million in investment securities having a\nweighted average tax equivalent yield of 5.25%.\n24\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024\nNet Income. The Company recorded net income of $20.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down from net income of $22.3 million for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023. An increase of $2.6 million in net interest income and declines of $1.3 million in the provision for credit losses and\n$336,000 in the provision for income taxes were offset by a decline of $1.8 million in non-interest income and an increase of $3.9 million in non-interest\nexpense. The annualized return on average assets was 1.69% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down from 1.88% for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The annualized return on average equity decreased from 23.3% during the first nine months of 2023 to 17.2% during the current period.\nThe following is a detailed discussion of each component of the change in net income.\nNet interest income before provision for credit losses. Driven by an increase in market rates, growth in the loan portfolio, growth in cash balances and the\nrestructuring of a portion of our investment portfolio partially offset by an increase in interest expense, net interest income increased by $2.6 million from\n$52.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $54.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in net interest\nincome includes an increase of $8.0 million in interest income partially offset by an increase of $5.4 million in interest expense.\nInterest and fees on loans increased by $5.3 million related to an increase in average balance and yield. The average balance of loans during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 was $982 million, an increase of $56 million from $926 million during the same period in 2023. The average yield on loans\nincreased by 38 basis points from 5.83% during the first nine months of 2023 to 6.21% during the current period.\nInterest on investment securities increased by $2.0 million related to an increase in yield of 67 basis points to 3.92%. The increase in investment yields is\nconsistent with an increase in market rates and the restructuring of the investment portfolio during the first quarter of 2024. Average investment securities\ndeclined from $469 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $457 million during the current period. Interest on cash balances increased by\n$712 thousand related to an increase in yield of 54 basis points and an increase in average balance of $8.4 million from $88.8 million during the first nine\nmonths of 2023 to $97.2 million in the current period. Cash balances primarily relate to cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRB). The\naverage rate earned on FRB balances was 5.38% during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 4.99% during the nine months ended September\n30, 2023.\nInterest expense increased from $2.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $8.3 million during the current period related to an increase\nin rate paid on interest bearing liabilities and an increase in borrowings. The average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased from 0.55% during the\n2023 period to 1.43% in 2024 related to an increase in borrowings and an increase in market interest rates. The average balance of borrowings increased by\n$107 million from $10 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $117 million during the current period. Interest incurred on borrowings\ntotaled $4.2 million and $396 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nInterest paid on deposits increased by $1.6 million and is broken down by product type as follows: money market accounts - $556 thousand, and time deposits -\n$1.1 million. Related to a decline in average balance of $57 million, interest on savings deposits declined by $75 thousand. The average rate paid on interest-\nbearing deposits increased from 0.49% during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.85% during the current period.\nNet interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6 basis points to 4.76%, up from 4.70% for the same period in 2023.\n25\nThe following table presents for the nine-month periods indicated the distribution of consolidated average assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity. It also\npresents the amounts of interest income from interest earning assets and the resultant annualized yields expressed in both dollars and annualized yield\npercentages, as well as the amounts of interest expense on interest bearing liabilities and the resultant cost expressed in both dollars and annualized rate\npercentages. Average balances are based on daily averages. Nonaccrual loans are included in the calculation of average loans while nonaccrued interest thereon\nis excluded from the computation of yields earned.\nFor the Nine Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nAverage Average\nBalance Interest Yield/ Balance Interest Yield/\n(in thousands) (in thousands) Rate (in thousands) (in thousands) Rate\nInterest-earning assets:\nLoans (2) (3) $ 982,191 $ 45,639 6.21% $ 926,148 $ 40,363 5.83%\nTaxable investment securities 369,893 11,423 4.13% 343,868 8,641 3.36%\nNon-taxable investment securities (1) 87,051 1,989 3.05% 124,879 2,763 2.96%\nInterest-bearing deposits 97,196 3,998 5.49% 88,819 3,286 4.95%\nTotal interest-earning assets 1,536,331 63,049 5.48% 1,483,714 55,053 4.96%\nCash and due from banks 26,978 25,943\nOther assets 85,536 75,771\nTotal assets $ 1,648,845 $ 1,585,428\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nMoney market deposits $ 216,699 $ 1,501 0.93% $ 229,914 $ 945 0.55%\nSavings deposits 327,263 532 0.22% 383,790 607 0.21%\nTime deposits 95,350 2,041 2.86% 69,256 959 1.85%\nTotal deposits 639,312 4,074 0.85% 682,960 2,511 0.49%\nJunior subordinated debentures - - -% 3,033 141 6.22%\nOther borrowings 117,136 4,210 4.80% 7,143 255 4.77%\nRepurchase agreements & other 18,820 33 0.23% 18,230 18 0.13%\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 775,268 8,317 1.43% 711,366 2,925 0.55%\nNon-interest-bearing deposits 678,057 729,044\nOther liabilities 33,845 17,293\nShareholders' equity 161,675 127,725\nTotal liabilities & equity $ 1,648,845 $ 1,585,428\nCost of funding interest-earning assets (4) 0.72% 0.26%\nNet interest income and margin (5) $ 54,732 4.76% $ 52,128 4.70%\n(1) Not computed on a tax-equivalent basis.\n(2) Average nonaccrual loan balances of $4.4 million for 2024 and $3.1 million for 2023 are included in average loan balances for computational\npurposes.\n(3) Net costs included in loan interest income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $1,090,000 and $927,000, respectively.\n(4) Total annualized interest expense divided by the average balance of total earning assets.\n(5) Annualized net interest income divided by the average balance of total earning assets.\n26\nThe following table sets forth changes in interest income and interest expense for the nine-month periods indicated and the amount of change attributable to\nvariances in volume, rates and the combination of volume and rates based on the relative changes of volume and rates:\n2024 over 2023 change in net interest income\nfor the nine months ended September 30,\n(in thousands)\nVolume (1) Rate (2) Mix (3) Total\nInterest-earning assets:\nLoans $ 2,445 $ 2,635 $ 196 $ 5,276\nTaxable investment securities 655 1,970 157 2,782\nNon-taxable investment securities (838) 88 (24) (774)\nInterest-bearing deposits 310 364 38 712\nTotal interest income 2,572 5,057 367 7,996\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nMoney market deposits (54) 646 (36) 556\nSavings deposits (90) 16 (1) (75)\nTime deposits 362 523 197 1,082\nJunior subordinated debentures (141) - - (141)\nOther borrowings 3,930 2 23 3,955\nRepurchase agreements & other 1 14 - 15\nTotal interest expense 4,008 1,201 183 5,392\nNet interest income $ (1,436) $ 3,856 $ 184 $ 2,604\n(1) The volume change in net interest income represents the change in average balance divided by the previous year’s rate.\n(2) The rate change in net interest income represents the change in rate divided by the previous year’s average balance.\n(3) The mix change in net interest income represents the change in average balance multiplied by the change in rate.\n27\nProvision for credit losses. During the first nine months of 2024 we recorded a provision for credit losses of $1,346,000 consisting of a provision for credit\nlosses on loans of $1,475,000 and a decrease in the reserve for unfunded commitments of $129,000. This compares to a provision for credit losses of\n$2,675,000 consisting of a provision for credit losses on loans of $2,425,000 and an increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments of $250,000 during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. As time progresses the results of economic conditions will require CECL model assumption inputs to change and\nfurther refinements to the estimation process may also be identified. See “Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses” for a discussion of loan\nquality trends and the provision for credit losses.\nThe following tables present the activity in the allowance for credit losses and the reserve for unfunded commitments during the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands).\nAllowance for Credit Losses September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nBalance, beginning of period $ 12,867 $ 10,717\nImpact of CECL adoption - 529\nProvision charged to operations 1,475 2,425\nLosses charged to allowance (1,422) (1,252)\nRecoveries 686 528\nBalance, end of period $ 13,606 $ 12,947\nReserve for Unfunded Commitments September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nBalance, beginning of period $ 799 $ 341\nImpact of CECL adoption - 258\nProvision charged to operations (129) 250\nBalance, end of period $ 670 $ 849\nNon-interest income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest income totaled $6.6 million, a decrease of $1.8 million from the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The largest component of this decrease was a $1.7 million gain on termination of our interest rate swaps during 2023. As\ndiscussed earlier, during the first quarter of 2024, a $19.9 million gain on the sale of buildings was offset by a $19.8 million loss on sale of investment\nsecurities.\nThe following table describes the components of non-interest income for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, dollars in thousands:\nFor the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nPercentage\n2024 2023 Dollar Change Change\nGain on sale of buildings $ 19,854 $ - $ 19,854 100.0%\nInterchange income 2,340 2,458 (118) (4.8)%\nService charges on deposit accounts 2,224 2,051 173 8.4%\nLoan servicing fees 564 678 (114) (16.8)%\nFHLB Dividends 409 289 120 41.5%\nEarnings on life insurance policies 305 313 (8) (2.6)%\nGain on termination of interest rate swaps - 1,707 (1,707) (100.0)%\nLoss on sale of investment securities (19,817) - (19,817) (100.0)%\nOther 700 884 (184) (20.8)%\nTotal non-interest income $ 6,579 $ 8,380 $ (1,801) (21.5)%\n28\nNon-interest expense. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 non-interest expense increased by $3.9 million to $31.6 million. The largest\ncomponents of this increase were a $1.1 million increase in salary and benefit expenses and a $1.7 million increase in occupancy and equipment expenses. The\nlargest increases in salary and benefit expense were $524 thousand in salary expense and $404 thousand in commission expense. These were partially offset by\nan increase in the deferral of loan origination costs of $297 thousand related to an increase in SBA production. The increase in occupancy and equipment costs\nrelates to a $1.7 million increase in rent expense associated with the sales/leaseback transaction. The increase in other non-interest expense includes a $300\nthousand accrual related to a litigation matter. In addition, professional fees include $265 thousand related to this matter, mostly legal fees. While portions of\nthis matter are still being litigated these amounts represent our best estimate of potential costs to Plumas Bank related to this matter.\nThe following table describes the components of non-interest expense for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, dollars in thousands:\nFor the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nPercentage\n2024 2023 Dollar Change Change\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 16,129 $ 15,047 $ 1,082 7.2%\nOccupancy and equipment 5,627 3,945 1,682 42.6%\nOutside service fees 3,430 3,345 85 2.5%\nProfessional fees 1,113 854 259 30.3%\nAdvertising and shareholder relations 706 693 13 1.9%\nArmored car and courier 651 558 93 16.7%\nTelephone and data communication 614 606 8 1.3%\nDirector compensation and expense 569 603 (34) (5.6)%\nDeposit insurance 562 552 10 1.8%\nBusiness development 506 457 49 10.7%\nLoan collection expenses 323 308 15 4.9%\nAmortization of Core Deposit Intangible 153 180 (27) (15.0)%\nOther 1,234 616 618 100.3%\nTotal non-interest expense $ 31,617 $ 27,764 $ 3,853 13.9%\nProvision for income taxes. The Company recorded an income tax provision of $7.5 million, or 26.4% of pre-tax income, for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. This compares to an income tax provision of $7.8 million, or 26.0% of pre-tax income, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe percentages for 2024 and 2023 differ from statutory rates as tax exempt items of income such as earnings on Bank owned life insurance and municipal\nsecurities interest decrease taxable income.\n29\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024\nNet Income. The Company recorded net income of $7.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, down from net income of $8.0 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023. An increase of $1.1 million in net interest income and a decline of $200,000 in the provision for credit\nlosses were offset by increases of $1.4 million in non-interest expense and a decline of $76,000 in non-interest income. Included in non-interest expense were\nnonrecurring costs related to a litigation matter totaling $376,000. The annualized return on average assets was 1.84% for the three months ended September\n30, 2024, down from 2.00% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The annualized return on average equity decreased from 24.4% during the third\nquarter of 2023 to 18.1% during the current quarter.\nThe following is a detailed discussion of each component of the change in net income.\nNet interest income before provision for credit losses. Net interest income was $18.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of\n$1.1 million from the same period in 2023. The increase in net interest income includes an increase of $2.8 million in interest income partially offset by an\nincrease of $1.7 million in interest expense.\nInterest and fees on loans increased by $1.4 million related to growth in the loan portfolio and an increase in yield on the portfolio. Average loan balances\nincreased by $58 million, while the average yield on these loans increased by 21 basis points from 6.00% during the third quarter of 2023 to 6.21% during the\ncurrent quarter. The increase in loan yield includes an increase in SBA fixed rate loans which currently yield approximately 8.1% and the repricing of loans that\nare priced off the 5 year Treasury. These loans are primarily commercial real estate loans and are repriced every five years.\nInterest on investment securities increased by $670 thousand related to an increase in yield of 71 basis points to 3.99%. The increase in investment yields is\nconsistent with the increase in market rates and the restructuring of the investment portfolio during the first quarter of 2024. Average investment securities\ndeclined from $462 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $447 million during the current quarter. Interest on cash balances increased\nby $791 thousand related to an increase in average balance of $57 million and an increase in rate earned on these balances of 7 basis points from 5.37% during\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.44% during the current quarter. Cash balances primarily relate to cash held at the FRB. The average rate\nearned on FRB balances was 5.33% during both the third quarter of 2024 and 2023.\nInterest expense increased by $1.7 million from $1.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $3.0 million during the current period\nrelated to an increase in rate paid on interest bearing liabilities and an increase in borrowings. The average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased from\n0.73% during the 2023 quarter to 1.52% in 2024 related mainly to an increase in market interest rates, and an increase in borrowings.\nInterest paid on deposits increased by $391 thousand and is broken down by product type as follows: money market accounts - $266 thousand, and time\ndeposits - $146 thousand. Related to a decline in average balance of $43 million, interest on savings deposits declined by $21 thousand. The average rate paid\non interest-bearing deposits increased from 0.69% during the third quarter of 2023 to 0.97% during the current quarter.\nMostly related to an increase in average borrowings outstanding from $10 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $117 million during the\ncurrent quarter, interest incurred on borrowings increased by $1.3 million from $114 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $1.4\nmillion during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nNet interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.76%, down slightly from 4.77% for the same period in 2023.\n30\nThe following table presents for the three-month periods indicated the distribution of consolidated average assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity.

During the third quarter of 2024 we recorded a provision for credit losses of ($400,000) consisting of a provision for credit losses\non loans of ($350,000) and a decrease in the reserve for unfunded commitments of $50,000. This compares to a provision for credit losses of ($200,000) during\nthe 2023 quarter consisting of a provision for credit losses on loans of ($125,000) and a decrease in the reserve for unfunded commitments of $75,000. As time\nprogresses the results of economic conditions will require CECL model assumption inputs to change and further refinements to the estimation process may also\nbe identified. See “Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses” for a discussion of loan quality trends and the provision for credit losses.\nNon-interest income. Non-interest income decreased by $76 thousand to $2.2 million during the current quarter. Increases of $29 thousand in service charge\nincome, $21 thousand in Federal Home Loan Bank dividends and $6 thousand in other non-interest income were offset by declines in interchange income of\n$101 thousand, loan servicing fees of $27 thousand and earnings on insurance policies of $4 thousand. Interchange income can fluctuate period to period\nmostly based on the volume of debit card transactions.\n32\nThe following table describes the components of non-interest income for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, dollars in thousands:\nFor the Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nPercentage\n2024 2023 Dollar Change Change\nInterchange income $ 818 $ 919 $ (101) (11.0)%\nService charges on deposit accounts 766 737 29 3.9%\nLoan servicing fees 176 203 (27) (13.3)%\nFHLB Dividends 136 115 21 18.3%\nEarnings on life insurance policies 104 108 (4) (3.7)%\nOther 237 231 6 2.6%\nTotal non-interest income $ 2,237 $ 2,313 $ (76) (3.3)%\nNon-interest expense. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, total non-interest expense increased by $1.4 million from $9.4 million during the\nthird quarter of 2023 to $10.8 million during the current quarter. The largest components of this increase were an increase in salary and benefit expense of $367\nthousand, an increase in occupancy and equipment costs of $636 thousand, an increase in professional fees of $117 thousand and an increase in other non-\ninterest expense of $262 thousand. The increase in salary and benefit expense primarily relates to an increase in salary expense and a decrease in the deferral of\nloan origination costs. Salary expenses increased by $138 thousand, which we attribute primarily to merit and promotional salary increases and an increase in\nemployees. Our full time equivalent employee count has increased from 180 at September 30, 2023 to 189 at September 30, 2024. Deferred loan origination\ncost declined by $95 thousand from $694 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $599 thousand during the current period. The amount\nof loan origination costs deferred is primarily related to loan volume, both new originations and renewals, during the period. Occupancy and equipment costs\nincreased by $636 thousand related to an increase in rent expense of $705 thousand mostly related to the sales/leaseback transaction completed during the first\nquarter of 2024. This increase in rent expense was offset by additional income resulting from the restructuring of our investment portfolio which also took\nplace during the first quarter of 2024. The increase in other non-interest expense includes a $300 thousand accrual related to a litigation matter. In addition,\nprofessional fees include $76 thousand related to this matter, mostly legal fees. While portions of this matter are still being litigated these amounts represent\nour best estimate of potential costs to Plumas Bank related to this matter.\nThe following table describes the components of non-interest expense for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, dollars in thousands:\nFor the Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nPercentage\n2024 2023 Dollar Change Change\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 5,481 $ 5,114 $ 367 7.2%\nOccupancy and equipment 1,988 1,352 636 47.0%\nOutside service fees 1,114 1,170 (56) (4.8)%\nProfessional fees 345 228 117 51.3%\nAdvertising and shareholder relations 247 233 14 6.0%\nArmored car and courier 228 211 17 8.1%\nDirector compensation and expense 203 165 38 23.0%\nDeposit insurance 191 182 9 4.9%\nTelephone and data communication 188 203 (15) (7.4)%\nBusiness development 143 152 (9) (5.9)%\nLoan collection expenses 102 91 11 12.1%\nAmortization of Core Deposit Intangible 51 60 (9) (15.0)%\nOther 543 281 262 93.2%\nTotal non-interest expense $ 10,824 $ 9,442 $ 1,382 14.6%\nProvision for income taxes. The Company recorded an income tax provision of $2.9 million, or 26.7% of pre-tax income, for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. This compares to an income tax provision of $2.8 million, or 26.3% of pre-tax income, for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe percentages for 2024 and 2023 differ from statutory rates as tax exempt items of income such as earnings on Bank owned life insurance and municipal\nsecurities interest decrease taxable income.\n33\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nTotal assets on September 30, 2024, were $1.6 billion, an increase of $54 million from December 31, 2023. Net loans increased by $44 million from\n$949 million on December 31, 2023, to $993 million at September 30, 2024. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $32 million to $118 million on September\n30, 2024. Related to the sales/leaseback transaction right-of use assets increased by $22 million. These increases were offset by declines of $32 million in\ninvestment securities, $6 million in property and equipment and $6 million in all other assets.\nDeposits totaled $1.4 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $17 million from December 31, 2023. Lease liabilities increased by $22 million and other\nliabilities increased by $1 million. Partially offsetting these increases in liabilities were decreases in borrowings and repurchase agreements. Borrowings\ndecreased by $15 million from $90 million on December 31, 2023, to $75 million on September 30, 2024. Repurchase agreements decreased by $6 million to\n$17 million. Shareholders’ equity increased by $35 million from $147 million on December 31, 2023, to $182 million on September 30, 2024. A detailed\ndiscussion of each of these changes follows.\nLoan Portfolio. Gross loans increased by $45 million, or 4%, from $959 million at December 31, 2023, to $1 billion at September 30, 2024. Increases in loans\nincluded $74 million in commercial real estate loans and $8 million in commercial loans. These items were offset by declines of $26 million in automobile\nloans, $8 million in agricultural loans and $3 million in all other categories. Although the Company offers a broad array of financing options, it continues to\nconcentrate its focus on small to medium sized commercial businesses. These loans offer diversification as to industries and types of businesses, thus limiting\nmaterial exposure in any industry concentrations. The Company offers both fixed and floating rate loans and obtains collateral in the form of real property,\nbusiness assets and deposit accounts, but looks to business and personal cash flows as its primary source of repayment. In the fourth quarter of 2023 we\nterminated our indirect auto loan program. Ending this program, which was our lowest yielding loan segment, also improved our loan loss risk profile since this\nprogram had historically higher charge-off rates. Terminating this program also improved our consumer compliance risk profile.\nAs shown in the following table the Company's largest lending categories are commercial real estate loans, agricultural loans, commercial loans and auto loans.\nPercent of Percent of\nLoans in Each Loans in Each\nBalance at End Category to Balance at End Category to\n(dollars in thousands) of Period Total Loans of Period Total Loans\n09/30/2024 09/30/2024 12/31/2023 12/31/2023\nCommercial $ 82,192 8.2% $ 74,271 7.8%\nAgricultural 121,709 12.1% 129,389 13.5%\nReal estate – residential 11,672 1.2% 11,914 1.2%\nReal estate – commercial 618,236 61.6% 544,339 56.8%\nReal estate – construction & land 54,287 5.4% 57,717 6.0%\nEquity Lines of Credit 37,652 3.8% 37,871 4.0%\nAuto 72,388 7.2% 98,132 10.2%\nOther 5,352 0.5% 4,931 0.5%\nTotal Gross Loans $ 1,003,488 100% $ 958,564 100%\nThe Company’s real estate related loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction and land development loans, consumer equity lines of\ncredit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate, comprised 80% of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2024. Moreover, the business activities of the\nCompany currently are focused in the California counties of Butte, Lassen, Modoc, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Shasta and Sutter and in Washoe and Carson City\nCounties in Northern Nevada. Consequently, the results of operations and financial condition of the Company are dependent upon the general trends in these\neconomies and, in particular, the commercial real estate markets. In addition, the concentration of the Company's operations in these areas of Northeastern\nCalifornia and Northwestern Nevada exposes it to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as\nearthquakes, fires and floods in these regions.\n34\nCommercial real estate loans (“CRE”), which comprised 61% of the lending portfolio at September 30, 2024, included 26% investor-owned, 26% owner-\noccupied, and 9% multi-family. Concentrations by real estate type within the CRE portfolio included 15% multi-family, 11% retail, 11% office, 10% mixed\ncommercial real estate, 8% hospitality, 6% industrial, 6% special purpose, 6% gas stations and 5% mini storage facilities, with all remaining concentrations\nbelow 5%. There were no rent-controlled properties within the multi-family category. Office facilities are typically small and located in more rural areas. 28%\nof CRE loans were located in northern Nevada and 47% were located in northern California, including the Sacramento area. Of the $4.5 million in non-accrual\nbalances at September 30, 2024, approximately 39% were CRE. Of the $22.4 million in substandard balances at September 30, 2024, 17% were CRE.\nCRE loans consist of term loans secured by a mortgage lien on real property and include both owner occupied CRE loans as well as investor-owned loans.\nInvestor-owned CRE loans consist of mortgage loans to finance investments in real property that may include, but are not limited to, multi-family, industrial,\noffice, retail and other specific use properties. The primary risk characteristics in the investor-owned portfolio include impacts of overall leasing rates,\nabsorption timelines, levels of vacancy rates and operating expenses. The Company requires collateral values in excess of the loan amounts, cash flows in\nexcess of expected debt service requirements and equity investment in the project. The expected cash flows from all significant new or renewed income\nproducing property commitments are stress tested to reflect the risks in varying interest rates, vacancy rates and rental rates. Inherent lending risks are\nmonitored on a continuous basis through quarterly monitoring and the Bank’s annual underwriting process, incorporating an analysis of cash flow, collateral,\nmarket conditions and guarantor liquidity, if applicable. CRE loan policies are specific to individual product types and underwriting parameters vary depending\non the risk profile of each asset class. CRE loan policies are reviewed no less than annually by management and approved by the Company’s Board of Directors\nto ensure they align with current market conditions and the Company’s moderate risk appetite. CRE concentration limits have been established by product type\nand are monitored quarterly by the Company’s Board of Directors.\nThe rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments in relation to the Company's lending rate or other indexes such as the published\nprime interest rate or U.S. Treasury rates and vary with changes in these indexes. The frequency in which variable rate loans reprice can vary from one day to\nseveral years. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 77% and 78%, respectively, of the Company's loan portfolio was comprised of\nvariable rate loans. Loans indexed to the prime interest rate were approximately 22% of the Company’s variable rate loan portfolio on September 30, 2024;\nthese loans reprice within one day to three months of a change in the prime rate. The remainder of the Company's variable rate loans mostly consist of\ncommercial real estate loans tied to U.S. Treasury rates and reprice every five years. Approximately 75% of the variable rate loans are indexed to the five-year\nT-Bill rate and reprice every five years. While real estate mortgage, agricultural, commercial and consumer lending remain the foundation of the Company's\nhistorical loan mix, some changes in the mix have occurred due to the changing economic environment and the resulting change in demand for certain loan\ntypes.\nAnalysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses. The Company attempts to minimize credit risk through its underwriting and credit review\npolicies. The Company’s credit review process includes internally prepared credit reviews as well as contracting with an outside firm to conduct periodic credit\nreviews. The Company’s management and lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and nonaccrual loans on a quarterly basis, or more\nfrequently as loan conditions change. The Management Asset Resolution Committee (MARC) reviews the asset quality of criticized and past due loans\nmonthly and reports the findings to the full Board of Directors. In management's opinion, this loan review system helps facilitate the early identification of\npotential criticized loans. MARC also provides guidance for the maintenance and timely disposition of OREO properties including developing financing and\nmarketing programs to incent individuals to purchase OREO. MARC consists of the Bank’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Credit\nOfficer, and the activities are governed by a formal written charter. The MARC meets monthly and reports to the Board of Directors.\nThe allowance for credit losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of the provision for credit losses. Loan losses are charged to, and\nrecoveries are credited to, the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to\nprovide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio.\nTo estimate expected losses the Company generally utilizes historical loss trends and the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios to determine\nestimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period. Individual loan credit quality indicators including loan grade and borrower\nrepayment performance have been statistically correlated with historical credit losses and various economic metrics including California unemployment rates,\nCalifornia Housing Prices and California gross domestic product. Model forecasts may be adjusted for inherent limitations or biases that have been identified\nthrough independent validation and back-testing of model performance to actual realized results. At both December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, the\nCompany utilized a reasonable and supportable forecast period of approximately four quarters and obtained the forecast data from publicly available sources.\nThe Company also considered the impact of portfolio concentrations, changes in underwriting practices, imprecision in its economic forecasts, and other risk\nfactors that might influence its loss estimation process. Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024, appropriately reflected\nexpected credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date.\nIn determining the allowance for credit losses, accruing loans with similar risk characteristics are generally evaluated collectively. The Company's policy is that\nloans designated as nonaccrual no longer share risk characteristics similar to other loans evaluated collectively and as such, all nonaccrual loans are\nindividually evaluated for reserves. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank's nonaccrual loans comprised the entire population of loans individually evaluated. The\nCompany's policy is that nonaccrual loans also represent the subset of loans in which borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty such that an evaluation of\nthe source of repayment is required to determine if the nonaccrual loans should be categorized as collateral dependent.\n35\nThe following table provides certain information for the dates indicated with respect to the Company's allowance for credit losses as well as charge-off and\nrecovery activity.\nFor the Nine Months\nEnded For the Year Ended\n(dollars in thousands) September 30, December 31,\n2024 2023 2023 2022 2021\nBalance at beginning of period $ 12,867 $ 10,717 $ 10,717 $ 10,352 $ 9,902\nImpact of CECL Adoption - 529 529 - -\nAdjusted balance 12,867 11,246 11,246 10,352 9,902\nCharge-offs:\nCommercial 65 108 123 207 188\nAgricultural - - - - -\nReal estate – residential - - - - -\nReal estate – commercial - - - 19 -\nReal estate – construction & land - - - - -\nEquity Lines of Credit - - - - -\nAuto 1,292 1,042 1,550 1,195 703\nOther 65 102 129 40 47\nTotal charge-offs 1,422 1,252 1,802 1,461 938\nRecoveries:\nCommercial 21 17 44 27 72\nAgricultural - - - - -\nReal estate – residential 3 2 3 3 3\nReal estate – commercial - 2 1 2 8\nReal estate – construction & land - - - - -\nEquity Lines of Credit - - - - 4\nAuto 642 458 746 482 136\nOther 20 49 54 12 40\nTotal recoveries 686 528 848 526 263\nNet charge-offs 736 724 954 935 675\nProvision for credit losses - loans 1,475 2,425 2,575 1,300 1,125\nBalance at end of period $ 13,606 $ 12,947 $ 12,867 $ 10,717 $ 10,352\nNet charge-offs during the period to average loans (annualized for the nine-month\nperiods) 0.10% 0.10% 0.10% 0.11% 0.09%\nAllowance for credit losses to total loans 1.35% 1.35% 1.34% 1.18% 1.23%\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nPercent of Percent of\nLoans in Each Loans in Each\nBalance at End Category to Balance at End Category to\n(dollars in thousands) of Period Total Loans of Period Total Loans\n9/30/2024 9/30/2024 12/31/2023 12/31/2023\nCommercial $ 1,359 8.2% $ 1,134 7.8%\nAgricultural 1,770 12.1% 1,738 13.5%\nReal estate – residential 110 1.2% 137 1.2%\nReal estate – commercial 7,508 61.6% 6,678 56.8%\nReal estate – construction & land development 848 5.4% 797 6.0%\nEquity Lines of Credit 456 3.8% 439 4.0%\nAuto 1,468 7.2% 1,865 10.2%\nOther 87 0.5% 79 0.5%\nTotal $ 13,606 100% $ 12,867 100%\nThe allowance for credit losses totaled $13.6 million at September 30, 2024, and $12.9 million at December 31, 2023. At least quarterly, the Company\nevaluates each specific reserve and if it determines that the loss represented by the specific reserve is uncollectable it records a charge-off for the uncollectable\nportion. Specific reserves related to collateral dependent loans totaled $26,000 and $28,000 at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The\nallowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.35% on September 30, 2024, and 1.34% on December 31, 2023.\n36\nThe following table sets forth the amount of the Company's nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated.\nAt\nSeptember 30, At December 31,\n2024 2023 2022 2021\n(dollars in thousands)\nNonaccrual loans $ 4,455 $ 4,820 $ 1,172 $ 4,863\nLoans past due 90 days or more and still accruing - - - -\nTotal nonperforming loans 4,455 4,820 1,172 4,863\nOther real estate owned 141 357 - 487\nOther vehicles owned 157 138 18 47\nTotal nonperforming assets $ 4,753 $ 5,315 $ 1,190 $ 5,397\nInterest income forgone on nonaccrual loans $ 251 $ 257 $ 121 $ 381\nInterest income recorded on a cash basis on nonaccrual loans $ - $ - $ - $ -\nNonperforming loans to total loans 0.44% 0.50% 0.13% 0.58%\nNonperforming assets to total assets 0.29% 0.33% 0.07% 0.33%\nThe Company places loans 90 days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. A loan is considered\nto be in the process of collection if, based on a probable specific event, it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current. Generally, this collection\nperiod would not exceed 90 days. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the Company's general policy is to reverse and charge against current income\npreviously accrued but unpaid interest. Interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and future collection of\nprincipal is deemed by management to be probable. Where the collectability of the principal or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management,\nit is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming 90 days delinquent.\nNonperforming loans at September 30, 2024 were $4.5 million, a decrease of $0.3 million from $4.8 million at December 31, 2023.\nA substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any.\nTotal substandard loans increased by $0.7 million from $21.7 million on December 31, 2023, to $22.4 million on September 30, 2024. Loans classified as\nspecial mention increased by $4.8 million from $9.3 million on December 31, 2023, to $14.1 million on September 30, 2024.\nIt is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance for credit losses so that it remains appropriate to absorb the inherent risk of loss in the\nportfolio. Management believes that the allowance on September 30, 2024, is appropriate. However, the determination of the amount of the allowance is\njudgmental and subject to economic conditions which cannot be predicted with certainty. Accordingly, the Company cannot predict whether charge-offs of\nloans in excess of the allowance may occur in future periods.\n37\nOREO represent real property acquired by the Bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower. Repossessed assets include\nvehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers. OREO holdings represented one property totaling $141,000 on\nSeptember 30, 2024, and one property totaling $357,000 at December 31, 2023.\nNonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.29% at September 30, 2024 and 0.33% at December 31, 2023.\nThe following table provides a summary of the change in the number and balance of OREO properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\n(dollars in thousands):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n# 2024 # 2023\nBeginning Balance 1 $ 357 - $ -\nAdditions 1 141 2 440\nDispositions 1 (357) - -\nProvision from change in OREO valuation - - - -\nEnding Balance 1 $ 141 2 $ 440\nInvestment Portfolio and Federal Funds Sold. Total investment securities were $456.7 million as of September 30, 2024, and $489.2 million at December\n31, 2023. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $20.9 million were recorded, net of $6.2 million in tax benefit, as accumulated\nother comprehensive loss within shareholders' equity at September 30, 2024. Net unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $46.1\nmillion were recorded, net of $13.6 million in tax benefit, as accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders' equity at December 31, 2023. During\nthe first quarter of 2024 we sold $116 million in investment securities having a weighted average tax equivalent yield of 2.24% recording a $19.8 million loss\non sale. Beginning in December 2023 and ending on March 27, 2024 we purchased $120 million in investment securities having a weighted average tax\nequivalent yield of 5.25%. These sales and purchases were made as part of the investment restructure described earlier. No securities were sold during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\nThe investment portfolio at September 30, 2024, consisted of $4.0 million in U.S. Treasury securities, $363.1 million in securities of U.S. Government-\nsponsored agencies and U.S. Government agencies, and 170 municipal securities totaling $89.6 million. The investment portfolio at December 31, 2023\nconsisted of $6.9 million in U.S. Treasury securities, $351.9 million in securities of U.S. Government-sponsored agencies and U.S. Government agencies and\n244 municipal securities totaling $130.4 million.\nThere were no Federal funds sold at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023; however, the Bank maintained interest earning balances at the Federal\nReserve Bank totaling $82.3 million at September 30, 2024 and $52.9 million at December 31, 2023. The balance, on September 30, 2024, earns interest at the\nrate of 4.90%.\nThe Company classifies its investment securities as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Currently all securities are classified as available-for-sale. Securities\nclassified as available-for-sale may be sold to implement the Company's asset/liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates,\nprepayment rates and similar factors.\n38\nThe following table shows the distribution of deposits by type at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nPercent of Percent of\nDeposits in Deposits in\nEach Each\nBalance at End Category to Balance at End Category to\n(dollars in thousands) of Period Total Deposits of Period Total Deposits\nDistribution of Deposits by Type 09/30/2024 09/30/2024 12/31/2023 12/31/2023\nNon-interest bearing $ 703,005 52.0% $ 692,768 51.9%\nMoney Market 229,267 17.0% 214,185 16.1%\nSavings 316,483 23.4% 335,050 25.1%\nTime 102,241 7.6% 91,652 6.9%\nTotal Deposits $ 1,350,996 100% $ 1,333,655 100%\nDeposits totaled $1.4 billion September 30, 2024, an increase of $17 million from December 31, 2023. The increase in deposits includes increases of $15\nmillion in money market accounts, $11 million in time deposits and $10 million in demand deposits. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in\nsavings deposits of $19 million. At September 30, 2024, 52% of the Company’s deposits were in the form of non-interest-bearing demand deposits. The\nCompany has no brokered deposits.\nDeposits represent the Bank's primary source of funds. Deposits are primarily core deposits in that they are demand, savings and time deposits generated from\nlocal businesses and individuals. These sources are considered to be relatively stable, long-term relationships thereby enhancing steady growth of the deposit\nbase without major fluctuations in overall deposit balances. The Company experiences, to a small degree, some seasonality with the slower growth period\nbetween November through April, and the higher growth period from May through October. To assist in meeting any funding demands, the Company maintains\nseveral borrowing agreements as described below.\nEstimated uninsured deposits totaled $456 million and $416 million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Uninsured amounts are\nestimated based on the portion of the account balances in excess of FDIC insurance limits.\nThe following table presents the maturity distribution of the portion of time deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limit.\nMaturity Distribution of Estimated Uninsured Time Deposits\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nRemaining maturity:\nThree months or less $ 4,491 $ 6,044\nAfter three through nine months 10,921 10,097\nAfter six through twelve months 9,107 5,428\nAfter twelve months 14 757\nTotal $ 24,533 $ 22,326\nRepurchase Agreements. The Bank offers a repurchase agreement product for its larger customers which use securities sold under agreements to repurchase\nas an alternative to interest-bearing deposits. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaling $17.0 million and $23.1 million at September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, respectively, are secured by U.S. Government agency securities with a carrying amount of $30.4 million and $34.1 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Interest paid on this product is similar to, but less than, that which is paid on the Bank’s money\nmarket accounts; however, these are not deposits and are not FDIC insured.\nShort-term Borrowing Arrangements. The Company is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB) and can borrow up to $240\nmillion from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $426 million. The Company is required to hold\nFHLB stock as a condition of membership. At September 30, 2024, the Company held $6.2 million of FHLB stock which is recorded as a component of other\nassets.\nThe Federal Reserve Board, on March 12, 2023, announced the creation of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). The BTFP offers loans of up to one year\nin length to banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other eligible depository institutions pledging U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed\nsecurities, and other qualifying assets as collateral. These assets will be valued at par. At December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding borrowings under\nthe Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) totaling $80 million. In January 2024, the Company borrowed an additional $25 million under the BTFP and during\nSeptember 2024 we made a $45 million payment resulting in a balance of $60 million outstanding at September 30, 2024. This borrowing bears interest at the\nrate of 4.85% and is payable on January 17, 2025. Borrowings under the BTFP can be prepaid without penalty. There were no borrowings under the BTFP\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense recognized on the BTFP borrowings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled\n$3.7 million. In addition to its FHLB borrowing line and the BTFP, the Company has unsecured short-term borrowing agreements with two of its\ncorrespondent banks in the amounts of $50 million and $20 million. There were no outstanding borrowings from the FHLB or the correspondent banks at\nSeptember 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.\n39\nNote Payable. On January 25, 2022 the Company replaced its existing $15 million line of credit facility with a $15 million Loan Agreement (the “Loan\nAgreement”) and Promissory Note (the “Term Note”). The Term Note matures on January 25, 2035 and can be prepaid at any time. During the initial three\nyears of the Loan Agreement the Term Note functions as an interest only revolving line of credit. Beginning on year four the Term Note converts into a term\nloan requiring semi-annual principal and interest payments and no further advances can be made. The proceeds of this lending facility shall be used by the\nCompany for general corporation purposes, and to provide capital injections into the Bank. The Term Note bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.85% for the first 5\nyears and then at a floating interest rate linked to WSJ Prime Rate for the remaining eight year term. The Loan Agreement provides for a $187,500 loan fee.\nThe Note is secured by the common stock of the Bank. The Loan Agreement contains certain financial and non-financial covenants, which include, but are not\nlimited to, a minimum leverage ratio at the Bank, a minimum total risk-based capital ratio at the Bank, a maximum Texas Ratio at the Bank, a minimum level\nof Tier 1 capital at the Bank and a return on average assets needed to generate a 1.25X debt service coverage ratio. The Loan Agreement also contains\ncustomary events of default, including, but not limited to, failure to pay principal or interest, the commencement of certain bankruptcy proceedings, and certain\nadverse regulatory events affecting the Company or the Bank. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Loan Agreement, the Company’s\nobligations under the Loan Agreement may be accelerated. In March 2023 the Company borrowed $10 million on this note and used the proceeds to redeem its\nTrust Preferred securities. During January of 2024 the Company borrowed an additional $5 million under this note for general corporate purposes. The\nCompany was in compliance with all covenants related to the Term Note at September 30, 2024. Interest expense recognized on the Term Note for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled $477,000 and $255,000, respectively.\nCapital Resources\nShareholders’ equity increased by $34.6 million from $147.3 million at December 31, 2023 to $181.9 million at September 30, 2024. The $34.6 million\nincrease was related to net income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of $20.9 million, stock option activity of $780,000 and a decrease of\nother comprehensive loss of $17.7 million related to the investment portfolio restructuring and a decline in market interest rates. These items were partially\noffset by shareholder dividends of $4.8 million.\nIt is the policy of the Company to periodically distribute excess retained earnings to the shareholders through the payment of cash dividends. Such dividends\nhelp promote shareholder value and capital adequacy by enhancing the marketability of the Company’s stock. All authority to provide a return to the\nshareholders in the form of a cash or stock dividend or split rests with the Board of Directors. The Board will periodically, but on no regular schedule, review\nthe appropriateness of a cash dividend payment. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory\nagencies. The Company is subject to various restrictions on the payment of dividends. The Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.27 per share on\nAugust 15, 2024, May 15, 2024 and February 15, 2024, and a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share on November 15, 2023, August 15, 2023, May 15,\n2023, and February 15, 2023.\nCapital Standards. The Company uses a variety of measures to evaluate its capital adequacy. Management reviews these capital measurements on a monthly\nbasis and takes appropriate action to ensure that they are within established internal and external guidelines. The FDIC has promulgated risk-based capital\nguidelines for all state non-member banks such as the Bank. These guidelines establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and\noff-balance sheet exposures.\nIn July, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s capital guidelines for U.S.\ndepository organizations, sometimes called “Basel III,” that increased the minimum regulatory capital requirements for bank holding companies and depository\ninstitutions and implemented strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments. The Basel III capital rules include a minimum common equity Tier 1\nratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% (calculated as Tier 1 capital to\naverage consolidated assets). The minimum capital levels required to be considered “well capitalized” include a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1\nrisk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% and a leverage ratio of 5.0%. In addition, the Basel III capital rules require that\nbanking organizations maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above the minimum capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on their ability to\npay dividends, repurchase stock or pay discretionary bonuses. Including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, the Basel III capital rules require the following\nminimum ratios for a bank holding company or bank to be considered well capitalized: a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; a Tier 1 capital ratio of\n8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 10.5%. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank’s capital ratios exceeded the thresholds necessary to be\nconsidered “well capitalized” under the Basel III framework.\nUnder the FRB’s Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement (the “Policy Statement”), qualifying bank holding\ncompanies with less than $3 billion in consolidated assets are exempt from the Basel III consolidated capital rules. The Company qualifies for treatment under\nthe Policy Statement and is not currently subject to the Basel III consolidated capital rules at the bank holding company level. The Basel III capital rules\ncontinue to apply to the Bank.\n40\nIn 2019, the federal bank regulators issued a rule establishing a “community bank leverage ratio” (the ratio of a bank’s tier 1 capital to average total\nconsolidated assets) that qualifying institutions with less than $10 billion in assets may elect to use in lieu of the generally applicable leverage and risk-based\ncapital requirements under Basel III. A qualifying banking organization that elects to use the new ratio will be considered to have met all applicable federal\nregulatory capital and leverage requirements, including the minimum capital levels required to be considered “well capitalized” if it maintains a community\nbank leverage ratio exceeding 9%. The new rule became effective on January 1, 2020. Plumas Bank has chosen not to opt into the community bank leverage\nratio at this time.\nThe following table sets forth the Bank's actual capital amounts and ratios (dollar amounts in thousands):\nMinimum Amount of Capital Required\nTo be Well-Capitalized\nFor Capital Under Prompt\nActual Adequacy Purposes (1) Corrective Provisions\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nSeptember 30, 2024\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Ratio $ 193,710 16.9% $ 51,481 4.5% $ 74,362 6.5%\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio 193,710 11.3% 68,498 4.0% 85,622 5.0%\nTier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio 193,710 16.9% 68,642 6.0% 91,522 8.0%\nTotal Risk-Based Capital Ratio 207,986 18.2% 91,522 8.0% 114,403 10.0%\nDecember 31, 2023\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Ratio $ 179,194 15.7% $ 51,294 4.5% $ 74,092 6.5%\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio 179,194 10.8% 66,348 4.0% 82,935 5.0%\nTier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio 179,194 15.7% 68,392 6.0% 91,190 8.0%\nTotal Risk-Based Capital Ratio 192,860 16.9% 91,190 8.0% 113,987 10.0%\n(1) Does not include amounts required to maintain the capital conservation buffer under the new capital rules.\nManagement believes that Plumas Bank currently meets all its capital adequacy requirements.\nThe current and projected capital positions of the Bank and the impact of capital plans and long-term strategies are reviewed regularly by management. The\nCompany policy is to maintain the Bank’s ratios above the prescribed well-capitalized ratios at all times.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nLoan Commitments. In the normal course of business, there are various commitments outstanding to extend credits that are not reflected in the financial\nstatements. Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established\nin the contract. Annual review of commercial credit lines, letters of credit and ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances reduces the risk of loss associated\nwith these commitments. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $158.7 million in unfunded loan commitments and no letters of credit. This compares to\n$174.6 million in unfunded loan commitments and $108,000 in letters of credit at December 31, 2023. Of the $158.7 million in unfunded loan commitments,\n$95.7 million and $63.0 million represent commitments to commercial and consumer customers, respectively. Of the total unfunded commitments at\nSeptember 30, 2024, $94.4 million were secured by real estate, of which $40.4 million was secured by commercial real estate and $54.0 million was secured by\nresidential real estate mostly in the form of equity lines of credit. The commercial loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent business\nlines of credit, while the consumer loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent revolving credit card lines and overdraft protection lines.\nSince some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash\nrequirements.\nLiquidity\nThe Company manages its liquidity to provide the ability to generate funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals (both anticipated and\nunanticipated), fund customers' borrowing needs and satisfy maturity of short-term borrowings. The Company’s liquidity needs are managed using assets or\nliabilities, or both. On the asset side, in addition to cash and due from banks, the Company maintains an investment portfolio which includes unpledged U.S.\nGovernment-sponsored agency securities that are classified as available-for-sale. On the liability side, liquidity needs are managed by offering competitive rates\non deposit products and the use of established lines of credit.\nThe Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $240 million from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with\ncarrying values totaling $426 million. In addition to its FHLB borrowing line, the Company has unsecured short-term borrowing agreements with two of its\ncorrespondent banks in the amounts of $50 million and $20 million. There were no outstanding borrowings to the FHLB, or the correspondent banks at\nSeptember 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.\nCustomer deposits are the Company’s primary source of funds. Deposits totaled $1.4 billion September 30, 2024, an increase of $17 million from December\n31, 2023. Deposits are held in various forms with varying maturities. The Company estimates that it has approximately $456 million in uninsured deposits. Of\nthis amount, $104 million represents deposits that are collateralized such as deposits of states, municipalities and tribal accounts.\nThe Company’s securities portfolio, Federal funds sold, FHLB advances, and cash and due from banks serve as the primary sources of liquidity, providing\nadequate funding for loans during periods of high loan demand. During periods of decreased lending, funds obtained from the maturing or sale of investments,\nloan payments, and new deposits are invested in short-term earning assets, such as cash held at the FRB, Federal funds sold and investment securities, to serve\nas a source of funding for future loan growth. Management believes that the Company’s available sources of funds, including borrowings, will provide\nadequate liquidity for its operations in the foreseeable future.\n41\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot required.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n“Exchange Act”) as of September 30, 2024. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the\nCompany’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures\nwere effective as of September 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that\noccurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting.\n42\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, the Company and/or its subsidiary are a party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of\nthe Company's management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition\nor results of operations of the Company taken as a whole.\nITEM 1A.

          "content": "INVESTOR PRESENTATION\nUPDATED THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2024\nNevada County\n1\nForward Looking Statements Disclaimer\nThe statements contained herein that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements based on management’s current expectations and beliefs concerning\nfuture developments and their potential effects on the Company. Such statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and\nare generally beyond our control. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be the same as those anticipated by management. We\ncaution readers that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, such forward-\nlooking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: the conditions of the United States economy in general and the\nstrength of the local economies in which we conduct operations; the impact of any future federal government shutdown and uncertainty regarding the federal\ngovernment’s debt limit or changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem; the impacts of inflation, interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations on the Company's business condition and financial operating results; the impact of\nchanges in financial services industry policies, laws and regulations; regulatory restrictions affecting our ability to successfully market and price our products to\nconsumers; the risks related to the development, implementation, use and management of emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning; extreme weather, natural disasters and other catastrophic events that may or may not be caused by climate change and their effects on the Company's\ncustomers and the economic and business environments in which the Company operates; the impact of a slowing U.S. economy, decreases in housing and\ncommercial real estate prices, and potentially increased unemployment on the performance of our loan portfolio, the market value of our investment securities and\npossible other-than temporary impairment of securities held by us due to changes in credit quality or rates; the availability of, and cost of, sources of funding and the\ndemand for our products; adverse developments with respect to U.S. or global economic conditions and other uncertainties, including the impact of supply chain\ndisruptions, commodities prices, inflationary pressures and labor shortages on the economic recovery and our business; the impacts of international hostilities, wars,\nterrorism or geopolitical events; adverse developments in the financial services industry generally such as the recent bank failures and any related impact on\ndepositor behavior or investor sentiment; risks related to the sufficiency of liquidity; the costs or effects of mergers, acquisitions or dispositions we may make, as well\nas whether we are able to obtain any required governmental approvals in connection with any such activities, or identify and complete favorable transactions in the\nfuture, and/or realize the anticipated financial and business benefits; the negative impact on our reputation and profitability in the event customers experience\neconomic harm or in the event that regulatory violations are identified; the ability to execute our business plan in new markets; the future operating or financial\nperformance of the Company, including our outlook for future growth and changes in the level and direction of our nonperforming assets and charge-offs; the\nappropriateness of the allowance for credit losses, including the assumptions made under our current expected credit losses model; the effectiveness of the\nCompany's asset management activities managing the mix of earning assets and in improving, resolving or liquidating lower-quality assets; the effect of changes in\nthe financial performance and/or condition of our borrowers; changes in accounting standards and practices; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings\nhabits; our ability to attract and maintain deposits and other sources of liquidity; the effects of changes in the level or cost of checking or savings account deposits on\nour funding costs and net interest margin; increasing noninterest expense and its impact on our financial performance; competition and innovation with respect to\nfinancial products and services by banks, financial institutions and non-traditional competitors including retail businesses and technology companies; the challenges\nof attracting, integrating and retaining key employees; the vulnerability of the Company's operational or security systems or infrastructure, the systems of third-party\nvendors or other service providers with whom the Company contracts, and the Company's customers to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes,\nspam attacks, human error, natural disasters, power loss and data/security breaches and the cost to defend against and respond to such incidents; increased data\nsecurity risks due to work from home arrangements and email vulnerability; failure to safeguard personal information, and any resulting litigation; the transition\nfrom the LIBOR to new interest rate benchmarks; the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics; the costs and effects of litigation\nand of unexpected or adverse outcomes in such litigation; and our ability to manage the risks involved in the foregoing.
