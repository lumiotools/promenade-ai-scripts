The data demonstrated clinically meaningful progression free survival (PFS) at the company’s recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 600mg BID. The cut-off date for these data was August 12, 2024. Key highlights included:\n      * 9.2-month median PFS across all mutations & 10.3 months among patients with kinase mutations\n      * 33% objective response rate (ORR) across all patients & 53% ORR in patients with kinase mutations at the RP2D\n      * Favorable overall tolerability profile; at RP2D, only two patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events & only 1 patient experienced Grade 3 hyperglycemia \n      * RLY-2608 + fulvestrant data will be presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, taking place December 10-13, 2024. Details of the poster spotlight presentation are as follows: \n        * **Abstract Title** : PS7-01: Efficacy of RLY-2608, a mutant-selective PI3Kα inhibitor in patients with PIK3CA-mutant HR+HER2- advanced breast cancer: ReDiscover trial\n        * **Abstract Number:** SESS-2211\n        * **Session** : Concurrent Poster Spotlight Session 7: Targeting the ER and PI3K pathway: Novel drugs and combinations\n        * **Date/Time** : Wednesday, December 11, 8:00-9:30 a.m. ET (7:00-8:30 a.m. CT)\n    * Data support planned initiation of Phase 3 pivotal trial for RLY-2608 + fulvestrant in 2025\n  *  _RLY-2608 triplet_ : Continued to progress two potential front-line triplet regimens in patients with PI3Kα-mutated, HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer who had previously received at least one prior CDK4/6 inhibitor, including:\n    * _CDK4/6_ : RLY-2608 + ribociclib + fulvestrant dose escalation is currently testing biologically active doses of RLY-2608 and is on track to identify a dose of RLY-2608 that is combinable with full-dose ribociclib. Expansion cohorts are expected to initiate in the first half of 2025\n    *  _CDK4_ : RLY-2608 + atirmociclib + fulvestrant trial on track to initiate by the end of 2024 \n\n\n\n _Lirafugratinib (RLY-4008)_\n\n  * Presented updated FGFR2 fusion tumor agnostic data at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, October 23-25, 2024\n  * Provided regulatory update regarding lirafugratinib regulatory path in which the FDA suggested that the company first file a new drug application (NDA) in cholangiocarcinoma, followed by a tumor agnostic supplemental NDA for FGFR2 fusions with data from more patients and more follow up\n  * Disclosed plans to seek a global commercialization partner for lirafugratinib in order to maintain company’s focus on the remainder of the portfolio \n\n\n\n _Corporate Highlights_\n\n  * Raised $230 million of gross proceeds in an underwritten follow-on public offering in September 2024\n  * Completed series of changes to streamline the research organization, collectively resulting in an expected $50 million in annual savings and workforce reduction of approximately 15%.

The company expects its current cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund its current operating plan into the second half of 2027.\n\n**Revenue:** Revenue was $0 for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $25.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the recognition of previously received milestone payments under the company’s Collaboration and License Agreement with Genentech, Inc. during the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**R &D Expenses**: Research and development expenses were $76.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $81.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of prioritization of certain programs in the company’s pipeline, as previously disclosed in 2023 and earlier in 2024.\n\n**G &A Expenses**: General and administrative expenses were $19.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $18.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in stock compensation expense, partially offset by decreases in other employee compensation costs and certain other general and administrative expenses.\n\n**Net Loss** : Net loss was $88.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, or a net loss per share of $0.63, as compared to a net loss of $65.7 million for the third quarter of 2023, or a net loss per share of $0.54.\n\n**About Relay Therapeutics**\n\nRelay Therapeutics is a clinical-stage precision medicine company transforming the drug discovery process by combining leading-edge computational and experimental technologies with the goal of bringing life-changing therapies to patients.
