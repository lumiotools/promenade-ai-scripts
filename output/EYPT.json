Vesting of the options is subject to the employee’s continued service with EyePoint Pharmaceuticals through the applicable vesting dates.\n\n**About EyePoint Pharmaceuticals**\n\nEyePoint (Nasdaq: EYPT) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics to help improve the lives of patients with serious retinal diseases. The Company's pipeline leverages its proprietary bioerodible Durasert E™ technology for sustained intraocular drug delivery. The Company’s lead product candidate, DURAVYU™ (f/k/a EYP-1901), is an investigational sustained delivery treatment for VEGF-mediated retinal diseases combining vorolanib, a selective and patent-protected tyrosine kinase inhibitor with bioerodible Durasert E™. DURAVYU is presently in Phase 3 global, pivotal clinical trials as a sustained delivery treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), the leading cause of vision loss among people 50 years of age and older in the United States, and in a Phase 2 clinical trial in diabetic macular edema (DME). EyePoint expects full topline data from the Phase 2 clinical trial in DME in Q1 2025 and topline data from both Phase 3 pivotal trials in wet AMD in 2026.\n\nPipeline programs include EYP-2301, a TIE-2 agonist, razuprotafib, formulated in Durasert E™ to potentially improve outcomes in serious retinal diseases. The proven Durasert® drug delivery technology has been safely administered to thousands of patient eyes across four U.S. FDA approved products.

(NASDAQ: EYPT), a company committed to developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics to improve the lives of patients with serious retinal diseases, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and highlighted recent corporate developments.\n\n“We made tremendous progress across our pipeline in recent months, including dosing the first patient in our first global pivotal trial of DURAVYU™ in wet AMD and reading out interim 16-week data for our Phase 2 VERONA trial in DME,” said Jay Duker, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of EyePoint. “Driven by positive clinical data in two indications, along with growing patient and investigator enthusiasm, we remain confident that DURAVYU’s differentiated profile underscores its potential to be the first sustained-release maintenance therapy in two significant indications, positioning EyePoint as the leader in sustained ocular drug delivery. This is an exciting time for EyePoint, and we anticipate dosing the first patient in the second Phase 3 LUCIA trial by the end of 2024. With a strong balance sheet and compelling clinical data, we are well-positioned to continue executing across our pipeline, working to bring our potentially paradigm-shifting treatment to patients as fast as possible.”\n\n**R &D Highlights and Updates**\n\n  * Announced positive interim 16-week data for the ongoing open label Phase 2 VERONA clinical trial of DURAVYU for diabetic macular edema (DME) in October. DURAVYU 2.7mg demonstrated an early, sustained, and clinically meaningful improvement in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) with a gain of +8.9 letters compared to baseline versus +3.2 letters for aflibercept control. DURAVYU 2.7mg also demonstrated concomitant structural improvement with CST (central subfield thickness) improvement of 68.1 microns versus 30.5 microns for aflibercept control. Notably, both DURAVYU doses showed an immediate benefit over aflibercept control in both BCVA and CST demonstrating the differentiated drug release profile of DURAVYU with immediate bioavailability. Additionally, a favorable safety and tolerability profile continued for both DURAVYU arms. The Company expects to report the full topline results in the first quarter of 2025, once all patients complete the trial.\n  * Announced first patient dosed in the Phase 3 LUGANO clinical trial of DURAVYUTM in wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). The second Phase 3 LUCIA pivotal trial initiation is expected to have first patient dosing by end of 2024. The LUGANO and LUCIA clinical trials are designed for potential global regulatory and commercial success with every six-month re-dosing in both trials. With over 160 trial sites committed and robust DAVIO 2 data, the company anticipates rapid enrollment of both trials with topline data anticipated in 2026.\n  * Presented DAVIO 2 twelve-month data at the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) 2024 Subspecialty Day in October, at the 24th EURetina Congress in September and the Retina Society 57th Annual Meeting in September.\n  * Presented a comparison of tyrosine kinase inhibitors being developed for intravitreal delivery at the Retina Society 57th Annual Meeting in September, demonstrating the differentiation of DURAVYU with immediate bioavailability and controlled release via zero-order kinetics for at least six months.\n  * Presented on sustained-release vorolanib highlighting selective pan-VEGF receptor inhibition and anti-angiogenic effects in VEGF-mediated ocular diseases at the American Retina Forum (ARF) 2024 National Meeting in August demonstrating the durable efficacy, reliable safety and reduced injection burden of treatment with DURAVYU.\n\n\n\n**Recent Corporate Highlights**\n\n  * Completed an underwritten public offering with gross proceeds of $161.0 million in October. The Company sold 14,636,363 shares of its common stock, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 1,909,090 shares of common stock. The shares of common stock were sold at a public offering price of $11.00 per share.\n  * Announced the grand opening of EyePoint’s Northbridge, MA manufacturing facility in October. The 40,000 square foot Good Manufacturing Process (cGMP) compliant commercial manufacturing facility was built to meet U.S. FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) and will support global manufacturing across the Company’s portfolio, including lead pipeline asset, DURAVYUTM upon potential regulatory approval.\n  * Announced the appointment of esteemed industry leader Fred Hassan to the Company’s Board of Directors in September.\n\n\n\n**Review of Results for the Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nFor the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, total net revenue was $10.5 million compared to $15.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Net product revenue for the third quarter was $0.7 million, compared to net product revenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023, of $0.8 million.\n\nNet revenue from royalties and collaborations for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, totaled $9.9 million compared to $14.4 million in the corresponding period in 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by lower recognition of deferred revenue related to the out-license of YUTIQ® product rights.\n\nOperating expenses for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, totaled $43.3 million versus $29.6 million in the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by (i) $5.4 million in costs related to the DURAVYU™ Phase 3 clinical trials for wet AMD, (ii) $3.8 million higher personnel expense for clinical and product development, including $2.1 million of non-cash stock compensation, (iii) $3 million in other R&D related expenses. Non-operating income, net, totaled $3.4 million and net loss was $29.4 million, or ($0.54) per share, compared to a net loss of $12.6 million, or ($0.33) per share, for the prior year period.\n\nCash and investments at September 30, 2024 totaled $253.8 million compared to $331.1 million at December 31, 2023.\n\n**Financial Outlook** We expect the cash, cash equivalents and investments on September 30, 2024, along with the net proceeds from the October $161.0 million equity financing will enable us to fund operations into 2027.\n\n**About EyePoint Pharmaceuticals**\n\nEyePoint (Nasdaq: EYPT) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics to help improve the lives of patients with serious retinal diseases.
