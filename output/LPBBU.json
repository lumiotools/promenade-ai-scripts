For the first nine months of 2024, generated a 7.0% total economic return on book value.(1)\n  * Generated Comprehensive Income of $19.3 million, or $0.18 per weighted average basic common share.\n  * Settled $3.3 billion in unpaid principal balance (UPB) of MSR through bulk and flow-sale acquisitions and recapture.\n  * Completed first full quarter of direct-to-consumer originations activities, funding $22.4 million UPB in first lien loans and brokering $7.5 million UPB in second lien loans.\n  * Post quarter-end, committed to purchase an additional $2.1 billion UPB of MSR through a bulk acquisition.\n\n\n\n“With MSR at our core, we have built an investment portfolio with RMBS that has less exposure to changes in mortgage spreads than portfolios without MSR, while still preserving upside to decreasing volatility and spread tightening,” stated Bill Greenberg, TWO’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We are intently focused on providing high-quality investment returns, and our combined strategy is designed to extract the most value that we can from our MSR asset for the benefit of our shareholders. We are thoughtfully augmenting our investment portfolio with additional revenue and hedging opportunities in order to further enhance a strategy that we expect will deliver attractive results for our shareholders through a variety of market environments.”\n\n“Our portfolio benefited from the net performance of mortgages in the third quarter, but performance across the stack was uneven. We entered the quarter with an up-in-coupon bias, but as interest rates declined we shifted our TBA coupons lower, tracking the change in current coupon exposure coming from our MSR,” stated Nick Letica, TWO’s Chief Investment Officer. “MSR valuations remain well supported with strong demand as the supply of bulk sales continues to normalize from the record levels of the past few years. Nevertheless, we believe there will continue to be opportunities to add MSR at attractive levels, enhanced by our deep expertise coupled with the benefits of our in-house servicing and recapture operations.”\n\n________________  \n---  \n(1) |  Economic return on book value is defined as the increase (decrease) in book value per common share from the beginning to the end of the given period, plus dividends declared in the period, divided by book value as of the beginning of the period.  \n  \n**_Operating Performance_**\n\nThe following table summarizes the company’s GAAP and non-GAAP earnings measurements and key metrics for the third quarter of 2024 and second quarter of 2024:\n\n**Operating Performance (unaudited)**  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands, except per common share data)  \n**Three Months Ended September 30, 2024** |  **Three Months Ended June 30, 2024**  \n**Earnings attributable to common stockholders** |  **Earnings** |  **Per weighted average basic common share** |  **Annualized return on average common equity** |  **Earnings** |  **Per weighted average basic common share** |  **Annualized return on average common equity**  \nComprehensive Income |  $ |  19,352 |  $ |  0.18 |  4.9 |  % |  $ |  479 |  $ |  — |  0.1 |  %  \nGAAP Net (Loss) Income |  $ |  (250,269 |  ) |  $ |  (2.42 |  ) |  (63.1 |  )% |  $ |  44,552 |  $ |  0.43 |  11.1 |  %  \nEarnings Available for Distribution(1) |  $ |  13,186 |  $ |  0.13 |  3.3 |  % |  $ |  17,516 |  $ |  0.17 |  4.4 |  %  \n**Operating Metrics**  \nDividend per common share |  $ |  0.45 |  $ |  0.45  \nAnnualized dividend yield(2) |  13.0 |  % |  13.6 |  %  \nBook value per common share at period end |  $ |  14.93 |  $ |  15.19  \nEconomic return on book value(3) |  1.3 |  % |  — |  %  \nOperating expenses, excluding non-cash LTIP amortization and certain operating expenses(4) |  $ |  36,874 |  $ |  37,924  \nOperating expenses, excluding non-cash LTIP amortization and certain operating expenses, as a percentage of average equity(4) |  6.7 |  % |  6.8 |  %  \n_______________  \n---  \n(1) |  Earnings Available for Distribution, or EAD, is a non-GAAP measure.

          "content": "TWO Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nMortgage Performance Drives Positive Quarterly Return with Stable MSR Spreads\nNEW YORK, October 28, 2024 - TWO (Two Harbors Investment Corp., NYSE: TWO), an MSR-focused real estate\ninvestment trust (REIT), today announced its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nQuarterly Summary\n• Reported book value of $14.93 per common share, and declared a third quarter common stock dividend of\n$0.45 per share, representing a 1.3% quarterly economic return on book value. For the first nine months of\n2024, generated a 7.0% total economic return on book value.(1)\n• Generated Comprehensive Income of $19.3 million, or $0.18 per weighted average basic common share.\n• Settled $3.3 billion in unpaid principal balance (UPB) of MSR through bulk and flow-sale acquisitions and\nrecapture.\n• Completed first full quarter of direct-to-consumer originations activities, funding $22.4 million UPB in first\nlien loans and brokering $7.5 million UPB in second lien loans.\n• Post quarter-end, committed to purchase an additional $2.1 billion UPB of MSR through a bulk acquisition.\n“With MSR at our core, we have built an investment portfolio with RMBS that has less exposure to changes in\nmortgage spreads than portfolios without MSR, while still preserving upside to decreasing volatility and spread\ntightening,” stated Bill Greenberg, TWO’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We are intently focused on\nproviding high-quality investment returns, and our combined strategy is designed to extract the most value that we can\nfrom our MSR asset for the benefit of our shareholders. We are thoughtfully augmenting our investment portfolio with\nadditional revenue and hedging opportunities in order to further enhance a strategy that we expect will deliver\nattractive results for our shareholders through a variety of market environments.”\n“Our portfolio benefited from the net performance of mortgages in the third quarter, but performance across the stack\nwas uneven. We entered the quarter with an up-in-coupon bias, but as interest rates declined we shifted our TBA\ncoupons lower, tracking the change in current coupon exposure coming from our MSR” stated Nick Letica, TWO’s\nChief Investment Officer. “MSR valuations remain well supported with strong demand as the supply of bulk sales\ncontinues to normalize from the record levels of the past few years. Nevertheless, we believe there will continue to be\nopportunities to add MSR at attractive levels, enhanced by our deep expertise coupled with the benefits of our in-house\nservicing and recapture operations.”\n________________\n(1) Economic return on book value is defined as the increase (decrease) in book value per common share from the beginning to the end of the given period, plus\ndividends declared in the period, divided by book value as of the beginning of the period.\n- 1 -\nOperating Performance\nThe following table summarizes the company’s GAAP and non-GAAP earnings measurements and key metrics for the\nthird quarter of 2024 and second quarter of 2024:\nOperating Performance (unaudited)\n(dollars in thousands, except per common share data)\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Three Months Ended June 30, 2024\nPer Per\nweighted Annualized weighted Annualized\naverage return on average return on\nbasic average basic average\nEarnings attributable to common common common common common\nstockholders Earnings share equity Earnings share equity\nComprehensive Income $ 19,352 $ 0.18 4.9 % $ 479 $ — 0.1 %\nGAAP Net (Loss) Income $ (250,269) $ (2.42) (63.1) % $ 44,552 $ 0.43 11.1 %\nEarnings Available for Distribution(1) $ 13,186 $ 0.13 3.3 % $ 17,516 $ 0.17 4.4 %\nOperating Metrics\nDividend per common share $ 0.45 $ 0.45\nAnnualized dividend yield(2) 13.0 % 13.6 %\nBook value per common share at period end $ 14.93 $ 15.19\nEconomic return on book value(3) 1.3 % — %\nOperating expenses, excluding non-cash\nLTIP amortization and certain operating\nexpenses(4) $ 36,874 $ 37,924\nOperating expenses, excluding non-cash\nLTIP amortization and certain operating\nexpenses, as a percentage of average\nequity(4) 6.7 % 6.8 %\n_______________\n(1) Earnings Available for Distribution, or EAD, is a non-GAAP measure.

As\ndefined, EAD includes net interest income, accrual and settlement of interest on derivatives, dollar roll income on TBAs, U.S. Treasury futures income,\nservicing income, net of estimated amortization on MSR and certain cash related operating expenses. EAD provides supplemental information to assist\ninvestors in analyzing the company’s results of operations and helps facilitate comparisons to industry peers. EAD is one of several measures our board of\ndirectors considers to determine the amount of dividends to declare on our common stock and should not be considered an indication of our taxable income or\nas a proxy for the amount of dividends we may declare.\n- 11 -"

EAD is one of several measures our board of directors considers to determine the amount of dividends to declare on our common stock and should not be 21\nconsidered an indication of our taxable income or as a proxy for the amount of dividends we may declare.\nAgency RMBS Portfolio\nWeighted\nPar Value Market Value Weighted Average % Prepay Amortized Cost Basis Gross Weighted Average Age\n($ millions) ($ millions) CPR(1) Protected(2) ($ millions) Average Coupon (Months)\n30-Year Fixed\n3.0% $ 225 $ 203 6.3 % 85.6 % $ 200 3.7 % 35\n3.5% 62 58 3.4 % 71.8 % 55 4.2 % 33\n4.0% 598 577 6.3 % 100.0 % 590 4.6 % 52\n4.5% 2,177 2,161 7.0 % 100.0 % 2,225 5.1 % 49\n5.0% 1,801 1,814 6.3 % 100.0 % 1,834 5.8 % 30\n5.5% 1,170 1,190 5.2 % 99.8 % 1,180 6.4 % 27\n6.0% 1,092 1,123 14.0 % 96.0 % 1,116 6.9 % 23\n≥ 6.5% 751 782 7.5 % 100.0 % 773 7.5 % 8\n7,876 7,908 7.6 % 98.8 % 7,973 5.9 % 33\nOther P&I(3) 561 570 0.1 % — % 558 5.4 % 12\nIOs and IIOs(4) 644 36 7.5 % — % 44 5.8 % 190\nTotal Agency RMBS $ 9,081 $ 8,514 91.8 % $ 8,575\nBond Equivalent Through-the-Box\n($ millions) Notional Amount Value(5) Speeds(6)\nTBA Positions\n3.0% $ — $ — 3.7 %\n3.5% 66 62 4.0 %\n4.0% 230 221 3.3 %\n4.5% 1,092 1,073 3.5 %\n5.0% 2,401 2,398 3.9 %\n5.5% 1,275 1,290 4.5 %\n6.0% — — 8.0 %\n≥ 6.5% — — 10.7 %\nNet TBA Position $ 5,064 $ 5,044\n22\n(1)\nMortgage Servicing Rights Portfolio\nUnpaid Principal\nNumber of Balance Gross Coupon Current Loan Size Loan Age Original 60+ Day Net Servicing\nLoans ($ millions) Rate ($ thousands) (months) FICO(2) Original LTV Delinquencies 3-Month CPR Fee (bps)\n30-Year Fixed\n< 3.25% 293,608 $ 90,892 2.8% $ 366 44 768 70% 0.4% 4.2% 25.1\n3.25% -

Economic return on book value is defined as the increase (decrease) in book value per common share from the beginning to the end of the given period, plus dividends declared in the period, divided by the book\nvalue as of the beginning of the period.\n2. Historical dividends may not be indicative of future dividend distributions. The company ultimately distributes dividends based on its taxable income per common share, not GAAP earnings. The annualized dividend\nyield on the company’s common stock is calculated based on the closing price of the last trading day of the relevant quarter.\n30\nEnd Notes (continued)\nPAGE 20 - Q3-2024 Portfolio Yields and Financing Costs\n1. Includes interest income, net of premium amortization/discount accretion, on Agency and non-Agency investment securities, servicing income, net of estimated amortization and servicing expenses, on MSR, and\nthe implied asset yield portion of dollar roll income on TBAs. Amortization on MSR refers to the portion of change in fair value of MSR primarily attributed to the realization of expected cash flows (runoff) of the\nportfolio, which is deemed a non-GAAP measure due to the company’s decision to account for MSR at fair value. TBA dollar roll income is the non-GAAP economic equivalent to holding and financing Agency RMBS\nusing short-term repurchase agreements.\n2. As reported elsewhere in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, MSR, Agency derivatives, TBA, interest rate swap agreements and U.S. Treasury futures are reported at fair value in\nthe company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and the GAAP presentation and disclosure requirements for these items do not define or include the concepts of yield or cost of\nfinancing, amortized cost, or outstanding borrowings.\n3. Amortized cost on MSR for a given period equals the net present value of the remaining future cash flows (obtained by applying original prepayment assumptions to the actual unpaid principal balance at the start\nof the period) using a discount rate equal to the original pricing yield. Original pricing yield is the discount rate which makes the net present value of the cash flows projected at purchase equal to the purchase\nprice. MSR amortized cost is deemed a non-GAAP measure due to the company’s decision to account for MSR at fair value.\n4. Represents inverse interest-only Agency RMBS which are accounted for as derivative instruments in accordance with GAAP.\n5. Both the implied asset yield and implied financing benefit/cost of dollar roll income on TBAs are calculated using the average cost basis of TBAs as the denominator. TBA dollar roll income is the non-GAAP\neconomic equivalent to holding and financing Agency RMBS using short-term repurchase agreements. TBAs are accounted for as derivative instruments in accordance with GAAP.\n6. Includes interest expense and amortization of deferred debt issuance costs on borrowings under repurchase agreements (excluding those collateralized by U.S. Treasuries), revolving credit facilities, term notes\npayable and convertible senior notes, interest spread income/expense and amortization of upfront payments made or received upon entering into interest rate swap agreements, and the implied financing benefit/\ncost portion of dollar roll income on TBAs. TBA dollar roll income is the non-GAAP economic equivalent to holding and financing Agency RMBS using short-term repurchase agreements.\n7. Unsecured convertible senior notes.\n8. The cost of financing on interest rate swaps held to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the company’s outstanding borrowings is calculated using average borrowings balance as the denominator.\n9. The cost of financing on U.S. Treasury futures held to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the company’s outstanding borrowings is calculated using average borrowings balance as the denominator. U.S.\nTreasury futures income is the economic equivalent to holding and financing a relevant cheapest-to-deliver U.S. Treasury note or bond using short-term repurchase agreements.\nPAGE 21 - GAAP to EAD Reconciliation\n1. MSR amortization refers to the portion of change in fair value of MSR primarily attributed to the realization of expected cash flows (runoff) of the portfolio, which is deemed a non-GAAP measure due to the\ncompany’s decision to account for MSR at fair value.\n2. TBA dollar roll income is the economic equivalent to holding and financing Agency RMBS using short-term repurchase agreements.\n3. U.S. Treasury futures income is the economic equivalent to holding and financing a relevant cheapest-to-deliver U.S. Treasury note or bond using short-term repurchase agreements.\n4. Certain operating expenses predominantly consists of expenses incurred in connection with the company’s ongoing litigation with PRCM Advisers LLC. It also includes certain transaction expenses incurred/\nreversed in connection with the company’s acquisition of RoundPoint Mortgage Servicing LLC.\n31\nEnd Notes (continued)\nPAGE 22 - Agency RMBS Portfolio\n1. Weighted average actual one-month CPR released at the beginning of the following month based on RMBS held as of the preceding month-end.\n2. Determination of the percentage of prepay protected 30-year fixed Agency RMBS includes securities with implicit or explicit prepayment protection, including lower loan balances (securities collateralized by loans\nless than or equal to $300K of initial principal balance), higher LTVs (securities collateralized by loans with greater than or equal to 80% LTV), certain geographic concentrations, loans secured by investor-owned\nproperties, and lower FICO scores.\n3. Other P&I includes 15-year fixed, Hybrid ARMs, CMO and DUS pools.\n4. IOs and IIOs represent market value of $11.8 million of Agency derivatives and $23.9 million of interest-only Agency RMBS. Agency derivatives are inverse interest-only Agency RMBS, which are accounted for as\nderivative instruments in accordance with GAAP.\n5. Bond equivalent value is defined as the notional amount multiplied by market price. TBA contracts accounted for as derivative instruments in accordance with GAAP.\n6. Three-month prepayment speeds of delivered TBA contracts; average of J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, and Citi data.\nPAGE 23 - Mortgage Servicing Rights Portfolio\n1. MSR portfolio excludes residential mortgage loans for which the company is the named servicing administrator. Portfolio metrics, other than fair value and UPB, represent averages weighted by UPB.\n2. FICO represents a mortgage industry-accepted credit score of a borrower.\nPAGE 25 - Financing\n1. As of September 30, 2024, outstanding borrowings had a weighted average of 5.9 months to maturity.\n2. Repurchase agreements and revolving credit facilities secured by MSR and/or other assets may be over-collateralized due to operational considerations.\nPAGE 26 - Futures\n1. Exchange-traded derivative instruments (futures and options on futures) require the posting of an “initial margin” amount determined by the clearing exchange, which is generally intended to be set at a level\nsufficient to protect the exchange from the derivative instrument’s maximum estimated single-day price movement. The company also exchanges “variation margin” based upon daily changes in fair value, as\nmeasured by the exchange. The exchange of variation margin is considered a settlement of the derivative instrument, as opposed to pledged collateral. Accordingly, the receipt or payment of variation margin is\naccounted for as a direct reduction to the carrying value of the exchange-traded derivative asset or liability.\nPAGE 27 - Interest Rate Swaps\n1. The Company did not hold any interest rate swaptions at September 30, 2024.\n2. Includes $2.5 billion notional amount of forward starting interest rate swaps.\n3. Weighted averages exclude forward starting interest rate swaps. As of September 30, 2024, forward starting interest rate swap payers had a weighted average fixed pay rate of 3.3% and weighted average\nmaturities of 5.4 years.\n4. Includes $665.7 million notional amount of forward starting interest rate swaps.\n5. Weighted averages exclude forward starting interest rate swaps. As of September 30, 2024, forward starting interest rate swap receivers had a weighted average fixed receive rate of 3.4% and weighted average\nmaturities of 2.0 years.\n32"

Except as may be required by law, TWO does not update forward-looking statements\nand disclaims any obligation to do so. I will now turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Greenberg\nThank you, Maggie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call.\nToday I'll start by providing an overview of our performance and strategy, followed by a discussion\non the markets, and finish with an update on RoundPoint operations. William will cover our financial\nresults in detail and Nick will discuss our investment portfolio and return outlook.\nAs you may have noticed in our earnings presentation and on our website, we have recently launched\na new brand, referring to ourselves simply as “TWO” going forward in all of our investor relations and\nmarketing communications, reflective of our evolution as a company into an MSR-focused REIT.\n1601 Utica Ave S., Suite 900 St. Louis Park, MN 55416 / 612.453.4100 twoinv.com\nWhile our core competencies have always been the understanding and managing of interest rate and\nprepayment risks, this new branding marks, in a very visible way, our commitment to MSR as a core\npart of our investment strategy.\nAlthough we intend to grow our origination and operational capabilities within our RoundPoint\nsubsidiary over time, we are intently focused on providing high-quality investment returns, and our\ncombined strategy is designed to extract the most value that we can from our MSR asset for the\nbenefit of our shareholders. I will tell you about some of those things in a few moments.\nPlease turn to slide 3. Our book value at September 30th was $14.93 per common share, and which,\nincluding the third quarter common stock dividend of $0.45 per share, represented a 1.3% quarterly\neconomic return on book value. For the first nine months of 2024, we generated a 7.0% total\neconomic return on book value, which demonstrates that our strategy is designed to produce strong\nreturns across market environments. Please turn to slide 4. Figure 1 shows market expectations over\nthe past year for the Fed funds rate. As you can see by looking at the green line at the end of the\nsecond quarter, market expectations were for a total of 50 basis points in cuts in 2024. However,\nforecasts rapidly changed for the short-end of the yield curve following the Fed's 50 basis point cut\nin September, such that by the end of the quarter, the market was pricing in almost 200 basis points\nof cuts over the next 15 months, bottoming out at around 3%, referenced by the blue line. Recent\ndata, including inflation, jobs, and retail sales, have all come in hotter than expected, and\nambiguous statements from several Fed governors have resulted in the market tempering its\nenthusiasm, so that as of October 21st, two cuts have been taken out of the market and the terminal\nrate is projected to be around 3.4%, which you can see in the purple line on this chart. Moving to\nfigure 2, ultimately, the 10-year Treasury yield finished the quarter 62 basis points lower at 3.78%,\nwhile the 2-year Treasury yield fell by 111 basis points to 3.64%, which you can see on the blue line.\nThe curve steepened by 50 basis points, resulting in the first positively-sloped yield curve between 2\nand 10-year Treasury notes since 2022. However, the change in Fed expectations took their toll on\nthe long-end of the curve, and rates increased in the month of October. As of October 21st, which is\nthe purple line in this chart, 10-year rates had given back approximately two-thirds of the third\nquarter's rate declines, rising 42 basis points to 4.20%, while the 2-year rate rose 39 basis points to\n4.03% during the same period, steepening the curve by 3 basis points.\nPlease turn to slide 5. The acquisition of RoundPoint was almost exactly one year ago, and we are on\ntrack to achieve the cost savings that we initially set out, and improving the economics for our\ninvestments in the MSR asset. Additionally, the direct-to-consumer loan origination channel that we\nstarted from scratch in December is starting to bear fruit. Once at scale, we imagine this effort to\nprovide significant hedge benefits to our MSR portfolio and to protect our asset from significantly\nfaster-than-expected prepayment speeds, should interest rates drop precipitously.\nIn our first full quarter of DTC originations, we closed and funded $22.4 million UPB of first mortgages\nand have approximately another $35 million of UPB in the pipeline. While not a large number, keep\nin mind that only about 1% of our MSR portfolio is considered “in-the-money,” meaning that the\ncustomer has 50 basis points or more of rate incentive to refinance. We also kicked off a partnership\nwith a large originator of second liens, and we acted as a broker on $7.5 million UPB in a combination\n1601 Utica Ave S., Suite 900 St. Louis Park, MN 55416 / 612.453.4100 twoinv.com\nof both open-ended and closed-ended loans. We continue to observe a great deal of interest in this\nproduct, with mortgage rates hovering in the low 6’s. Although these numbers are small, these\nresults show the proof of concept. It also must be noted that these numbers that I just quoted were\nachieved by a very small team of only three to five loan officers during the quarter, and by year-end,\nwe expect to have about 30 loan officers. As a reminder, we built our DTC originations from scratch,\nwith no legacy risk. We spent a de minimis amount of money getting it to this stage, and it is now\nessentially break even. We are confident that we are building a strong platform and brand for our\ncustomers to turn to for their mortgage and home equity needs.\nWe are thoughtfully augmenting our investment portfolio with additional revenue and hedging\nopportunities in order to further enhance the strategy that we expect will deliver attractive returns\nfor our shareholders through a variety of market environments. With MSR at our core, we have built\nan investment portfolio with RMBS that has less exposure to changes in mortgage spreads than\nportfolios without MSR, while still preserving upside to decreasing volatility and spread tightening.\nBy investing in TWO, our shareholders are able to take part in the mortgage market and benefit from\nour team's deep expertise in investing in and managing MSR and Agency RMBS. With that, I'd like to\nhand the call over to William to discuss our financial results.\nWilliam Dellal\nThank you, Bill.\nPlease turn to slide 6. Our book value was $14.93 per share at September 30th, compared to $15.19\non June 30th. Including the $0.45 common stock dividend, this resulted in a 1.3% quarterly economic\nreturn, as Bill has already mentioned.\nPlease turn to slide 7. The company generated Comprehensive Income of $19.3 million, or $0.18 per\nweighted average common share, in the third quarter.\nNet interest expense of $42 million was higher in the third quarter on higher average borrowing\nbalances that were partially offset by higher RMBS interest income.\nNet servicing income was $172 million, minus $4 million of third-party subservicing fees and other\nMSR-related servicing costs. Net servicing income was unfavorable to the second quarter by $4\nmillion due to lower servicing fee collections, offset by higher float income and lower third-party\nservicing costs from servicing our MSR on the RoundPoint platform.\nInvestment securities gain and change in OCI was favorable to the third quarter by about $337 million\ndue to a rally in rates and spread tightening, versus a selloff in rates and slight spread widening in the\nsecond quarter.\nServicing asset losses were $133 million in the quarter, unfavorable to the second quarter due to\ndeclining rates that drove a larger decrease in the servicing asset.\n1601 Utica Ave S., Suite 900 St. Louis Park, MN 55416 / 612.453.4100 twoinv.com\nNet swap and other derivative gains were lower in the third quarter by $225 million due to hedging\nlosses from the rally in rates.\nPlease turn to slide 8. RMBS funding markets remained stable and liquid throughout the quarter, with\nample balance sheet available. At quarter-end, our weighted average days to maturity for our Agency\nRMBS repo was 78 days.\nSpreads for repurchase agreements widened with financing for RMBS between SOFR plus 24 to 28\nbasis points. The widening was primarily due to uncertainty of the Fed's actions in September. At\nquarter-end, bank balance sheets were temporarily tight, owing to a number of factors that included\nsettlements of auctioned Treasury securities, as well as banks managing quarter-end reporting\nmetrics. Post-quarter end, liquidity and balance sheet room quickly returned to easing financial\nconditions. Similar effects may occur at year-end, and as has been the case in past years, we will\nseek to minimize our exposure to year-end funding pressures.\nWe finance our MSR activities across four lenders with $1.6 billion of outstanding borrowings under\nbilateral facilities. We ended the quarter with a total of $610 million in unused MSR asset financing\ncapacity and $91 million of unused capacity for servicing advances.\nI will now turn the call over to Nick.\nNick Letica\nThank you, William.\nPlease turn to slide 9. Our portfolio at September 30th was $16.4 billion, including $11.4 billion in\nsettled positions and $4.9 billion in TBAs. Overall, our portfolio benefited from the net performance\nof mortgages over the quarter, but performance across coupons was uneven. Lower coupons\noutperformed, as investors added duration in the bond rally, while production in higher coupons\nlagged as the negative convexity kicked in and prepayment concerns emerged. We entered the\nquarter with an up-in-coupon bias, but as interest rates declined, we shifted our TBA exposure\nlower, mainly tracking the change in current coupon exposure coming from our MSR and also\nselling some higher coupon TBAs to mitigate prepayment risk.\nI'll review spread performance shortly, but given the performance of spreads over the quarter, we\nsteered the portfolio to have less spread exposure by quarter-end, even as the economic debt-to-\nequity rose slightly to 7.0 times. The increase in leverage naturally results from MSR requiring more\ncurrent coupon hedging as rates rally. The amount of spread duration is a function of how many\nand which TBAs or pools we are long, after taking into account the effect of the MSR. We continue\nto manage our exposure to rates across the curve very closely, as you can see in figure 2 and can\nbe seen in more detail on Appendix slide 17.\nPlease turn to slide 10 to discuss the market for investing in Agency RMBS. Over the third quarter,\nagainst the backdrop of the Fed continuing to have success in guiding the economy to a soft-landing,\nrisk assets performed well. The S&P 500 was higher by about 5.5%, and with interest rates falling in\n1601 Utica Ave S., Suite 900 St. Louis Park, MN 55416 / 612.453.4100 twoinv.com\nthe yield curve, steepening demand remained high for fixed-income assets. Figure 1, which we have\nshown over the past several quarters, shows spreads versus volatility from 2019 through present.\nOur preferred implied volatility gauge, 2-year options on 10-year rates, decreased from 104 to 94\nbasis points on an annualized basis, close to its lowest level for 2024. The nominal spread on current\ncoupon RMBS finished 20 basis points tighter at 107 over the Treasury curve, while option-adjusted\nspreads finished 6 basis points tighter at +18 basis points. While nominal spreads remained wider\nthan longer-term averages, by quarter-end, option-adjusted spreads moved tighter than the long-\nterm non-QE average of 29 basis points. With OAS’ at these tight levels, future spread tightening will\nlikely need to be driven by an increased demand from depository institutions and/or further declines\nin volatility.\nThe nominal spread curve flattened a little, but remained steep, with peak spreads around the 5.5\ncoupon at quarter-end, as you can see in figure 2. On an OAS basis, the belly coupons of 4.5’s and\n5.0’s were the richest part of the coupon stack, with the higher and lower coupons somewhat\ncheaper. The move in rates focused a lot of demand on these coupons from convexity hedgers, such\nas originators and servicers.\nPlease turn to slide 11 to review our Agency RMBS portfolio. Figure 1 shows the performance of TBAs\ncompared to the specified pools we owned throughout this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, hedged\nmortgage performance varied across the coupon stack, which is evident in this chart. Overall,\nspecified pools outperformed TBAs, with better performance from higher coupons as prepayment\nrisks increased. We shifted about $3.8 billion in TBA exposure 5.5’s through 6.5’s into 4.5’s and 5.0’s,\npredominantly to re-hedge the MSR exposure as rates rallied. Overall, we continue to like the relative\nvalue of specified pools to TBAs, particularly some of the seasoned pools we own, and we added\nabout $300 million in loan balance 6.5 pools in the third quarter.\nFigure 2 on the bottom-right shows our specified pool prepayment speeds by coupon. On aggregate,\nspeeds increased to 7.6% from 7.2% CPR in the quarter. Primary mortgage rates dropped about 75\nbasis points to just above 6%, which triggered some mild “media effect” for high coupon originations\nfrom the past two years, and led to material increases in prepayment speeds for 6.5% coupons and\nabove. Overall, prepayment rates for 30-year Agency RMBS increased 8% quarter-over-quarter to\n6.5% CPR in the October report, which reflected September activity.\nPlease turn to slide 12 as we discuss the market for investing in MSR. MSR performed well in the third\nquarter with strong demand for bulk packages. The volume of MSR sales continued to normalize from\nthe record levels of the past few years. This quarter brought approximately $40 billion UPB of supply,\nbringing the year-to-date total to $305 billion, about 70% of the pace of 2023. Traded prices have\nheld steady with the supply being easily absorbed by a deep pool of buyers, including both banks\nand non-banks. The number of banks offering MSR financing has broadened, and the increased\ncompetition has led to a compression in financing spreads. Additionally, we saw the first\nsecuritization of MSR financing of the past two years, as spreads for the securities returned to sub-\n300 basis points to SOFR.\nLet's look at figure 1. As mortgage rates have dropped, prepayments have begun to display a\nbifurcated pattern: they are speeding up for newer, higher coupon mortgages, but they continue to\n1601 Utica Ave S., Suite 900 St. Louis Park, MN 55416 / 612.453.4100 twoinv.com\nbe very slow for the locked-in, low coupon COVID-era borrowers. This chart compares actual 1-\nmonth speeds for 30-year 6.5s versus our MSR population for the past 12 months and then shows\nprojections, the dotted lines, for the next several months. As is evident, while the 6.5a have picked\nup in speed, our MSR portfolio has not noticeably responded to the rally in mortgage rates. The\nquarterly prepayment speed was unchanged at 5.3% CPR. Figure 2 shows the composition of our\nMSR portfolio and where mortgage rates were at quarter-end. Assuming a 6.25% mortgage rate, on\na UPB basis, only 1% of our MSR has a rate refinance incentive of 50 basis points or more. Even if 30-\nyear mortgage rates were to drop to 5%, the number increases to only 7%. Suffice it to say that we\nhave a substantial buffer to further declines in mortgage rates before triggering a large-scale refi\nwave for our MSR.\nPlease turn to slide 13, where we will discuss our MSR portfolio. With mortgage rates declining, the\nprice multiple of our MSR decreased slightly to 5.6 times from 5.8 times, and 60+ day delinquencies\nremained low at under 1%. The portfolio was $203 billion UPB at September 30th, reflecting the net\neffects of the settlement of the sale of $6.2 billion of higher coupon MSR that we announced last\nquarter, offset by settled purchases of $3.3 billion UPB from bulk and flow channels. Post quarter-\nend, we committed to purchase $2.1 billion UPB through another bulk acquisition.\nFinally, please turn to slide 14, our Return Potential and Outlook slide. The top half of this table is\nmeant to show what returns we believe are available on the assets in our portfolio. We estimate that\nabout 65% of our capital is allocated to Servicing with a static return projection of 12 to 16%. The\nremaining capital is allocated to Securities with a static return estimate of 12 to 14%.\nWith our portfolio allocation shown in the top half of the table, and after expenses, the static return\nestimate for our portfolio is between 9.5% to 12.7% before applying any capital structure leverage to\nthe portfolio. After giving effect to our outstanding convertible notes and preferred stock, we believe\nthat the potential static return on common equity falls in the range of 10.5 to 15.6%, or a prospective\nquarterly static return per share of $0.39 to $0.58.\nAs Bill discussed earlier, since quarter-end we have witnessed a large reversal in rates and have been\nreminded once again how quickly market sentiment can shift and that bouts of high interest rate\nvolatility are not over. Mortgage spreads have widened, erasing much of the spread performance of\nthe third quarter. In response, we have moved some of our TBA exposure higher, and concurrently\nincrease our spread exposure. As noted earlier, we also added $2.1 billion UPB of MSR through a\nbulk purchase.\nWhile periods of high market volatility remain a challenge, we are confident in our strategy, as\nevidenced by the attractiveness of our return potential. We continue to favor the long-run return and\nstability of having a majority of our capital invested in low mortgage rate MSR, while still preserving\nsome upside to tighter mortgage spreads and a decline in volatility. Mortgage spread volatility has\ndeclined as the Fed has moved to an accommodative stance, and the market feels generally\nbalanced with regard to supply and demand. Though demand is strong in the MSR market, we have\nnevertheless continued to find good opportunities to add at attractive levels, leveraging our deep\nexpertise coupled with the benefits of our own in-house servicing and recapture operations.\n1601 Utica Ave S., Suite 900 St. Louis Park, MN 55416 / 612.453.4100 twoinv.com\nThank you very much for joining us today, and now we will be happy to take any questions you might\nhave.\nOperator\nIf you would like to ask a question, please signal by pressing star 1 on your telephone keypad. If you\nare using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow the signal to\nreach our equipment. Again, press star 1 to ask a question. We'll pause for a moment to assemble\nthe queue.\nThe first question comes from Doug Harter with UBS.\nDoug Harter\nHey, thanks. I was hoping you could talk about the move lower in the static return for the securities\nportfolio. How much of that was a result of the move lower in coupon that you talked about?\nNick Letica\nHey, Doug, this is Nick. Thank you for the question. Mostly related to the fact that spreads just got\ntighter over the quarter. Also, you have to remember that on our return estimate, that fully reflects\nthe composition of our portfolio. As you can see, the amount of servicing we have as a percentage of\ncapital has gone up a little bit and it's leverage as a total of the portfolio has gone up. On the other\nside, the securities side leverage goes down a little bit so that impacts the return potential as well.\nDoug Harter\nGot it. Obviously, this number moves around, but then, how would you think about how the quarter-\nto-date spreads have impacted book value and, two, how that translates to incremental returns\ntoday?\nBill Greenberg\nYeah. Good morning, Doug. Thanks for the question. I can take the book value part. As we said in our\nprepared remarks and as Nick mentioned a moment ago, the market in October has been pretty\nvolatile. Fed expectations have changed, rates have risen, curve is steepened, all of that. And so\nthrough October 18th, we think that our book value was down between 1.5 and 3.0%. Over the last\nweek, mortgages continued to widen a little bit more, so we're down a couple more on top of that.\n1601 Utica Ave S., Suite 900 St. Louis Park, MN 55416 / 612.453.4100 twoinv.com\nNick Letica\nI can address the other question. As everyone knows, we've had a major reversal since the lower in\nrates. That was just prior to the Fed meeting in September and in fact, since quarter-end, we're up\nabout, I don't know, 50 basis points or so, and mortgage spreads have really widened out. Many of\nthe things that happened throughout the third quarter have now been reversed in the short period of\ntime in the fourth quarter.\nIf you would look at our return potential now, it would surely be shifting back to somewhat of a\nhigher leverage. Since quarter-end, as I mentioned in my comments, we have slid our coupon, our\nBV exposure back up a little bit, and our spread exposure up a little bit. You would definitely see an\nuptick in the return potential on the security side compared to what you saw at quarter-end.\nDoug Harter\nGreat. Thank you both.\nBill Greenberg\nThank you, Doug.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Bose George with KBW.\nBose George\nYes, good morning. Just a follow-up to Doug's question, in terms of the new target range, I was\ncurious what drove the much wider range this quarter?\nNick Letica\nOn the return potential?\nBose George\nYes, exactly, on the return potential. It's a quite a wide range, and maybe just discuss factors that\nwould take it to the high end versus the low end?\n1601 Utica Ave S., Suite 900 St. Louis Park, MN 55416 / 612.453.4100 twoinv.com\nNick Letica\nI know you've asked this question before and it's a good question. What really drives those variants\nand those returns are prepay expectations as well as funding rates. Based on the assumptions that\nwe use for the highs and lows and how they affect those numbers, that is what really drives it. To the\nextent that we use a wider funding rate spread on the security side for repo, that will affect what\nthose ranges are.\nAs we mentioned, there has been a little bit more volatility on the funding rates and the repo side for\npools. Our funding for MSRs is predetermined. That's all longer-term, kind of locked-in sort of\nspreads, but it's really just variations in prepays as well as funding rates.\nBose George\nOkay, great. Thanks. Then just based on your earlier comment, it sounds like the return profile this\nquarter-end with the move-in rates should be somewhat closer to what it was last quarter. Is that a\ngood way to think about that?\nNick Letica\nYeah, that's correct. I think it would even be wider than that because mortgage spreads, where they\nsit right now, they really have widened out to the highest levels of the year. Depending, there are lots\nof ways to look at spreads, as everybody knows. But almost to a one, they are at the highest levels of\nthe year in fact, where we sit today mortgage spreads are starting to look very attractive.\nBose George\nOkay, great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Jason Stewart with Janney.\nJason Stewart\nHey, good morning. Thanks. Could you talk a little bit about your outlook intermediate-term, maybe\nnear-term/intermediate-term, for prepays and how servicing capacity looks for the industry given\nwhere current mortgage rates sit?\n1601 Utica Ave S., Suite 900 St. Louis Park, MN 55416 / 612.453.4100 twoinv.com\nNick Letica\nSure. Prepays for this month – we have seen an uptick in. Some of it has to do with day count, some\nof it just has to do with lags of where mortgage rates went in the third quarter. Those lags are a little\nbit hard to gauge these days for various reasons and without getting too deep into that topic, we do\nexpect prepays to pick up in this next report. Then it will start reflecting the fact that, rates really have\nreversed and we estimated that mortgage rates were down about 75 basis points in the third quarter,\nand we're up at least that much now in the fourth quarter. We'll also be entering the winter months\nas we get here. Overall, I think we'll see prepays really start to come back down across the board,\nreflecting slower turnover rates for the lower coupons and then just much less sensitivity for the\nhighers that we saw. The little bit of, as people were saying, we had around a two-week refi\nenvironment for the higher coupons, which is now kind of turned around. I'll let Bill talk about the\nMSR side.\nBill Greenberg\nYeah. In terms of MSR supply, I think we've said, and other people have commented, that MSR supply\nhas really reverted back to more historical norms, that the amount of MSR which has changed hands\nin 2021 and in 2023 were record levels. Now the amount is really back to historical levels, which is in\nthe $200 billion kind of range for a year. So we're continuing to see some certain amounts of pools\ntrade and we're participating in those markets. As Nick said, we participate in that market, we bought\nsome at attractive levels. We're finding opportunities to be situational and we sold a little bit in the\nprevious quarter. We bought some here so I'd say the market is returning to historical norms, but it\nremains healthy and well-supported.\nJason Stewart\nGot it. Okay, thank you. Then just in terms of transaction activity on the MSR valuation, do you think\nthat has an impact on multiples? Maybe if you could just parse out the delta in the move, in the\nmultiple, maybe 3Q to where it's going in 4Q in terms of earnings on float income versus prepays and\nhow those two factors are driving MSR transaction multiples? Thanks.\nBill Greenberg\nSure. The transaction multiples and the prices of MSR depends on all of those factors. Forward short-\nterm rates to the extent that the Fed has cut rates will decrease float earnings some, which should\ndrive multiples lower, all else being equal. As Nick said, long-term prepayments are probably back\nto where they were a quarter ago, so that's going to be sort of a wash. Where people are pricing\nrecapture, of course, has become a very hot topic of interest for MSR participants. Generally, we\nhave seen what I will call the MSR mult curve, that is the prices, the mults of MSR packages ranging\nfrom very low WAC, like we have of 3.5% up to higher WAC packages, 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0s to be as flat\n1601 Utica Ave S., Suite 900 St. Louis Park, MN 55416 / 612.453.4100 twoinv.com\nas it's been in history. That's really attributable to the value that people are putting on recapture. That\nsaid, putting all that together, I think the movements in the short rates are small comparatively to\nwhere we are. The forward curve has steepened out, so that means forward projections of float\nincome are higher than it was when the curve is flat. I think these will translate to pretty small\nchanges in MSR mults.\nNick Letica\nYeah. I'll just add on to that. Your question about float income versus prepays. We've talked in\nprevious calls about the fact that a lot of our price sensitivity on our MSR is really related to float\nincome, given how far out-of-the-money our MSR is given its low gross WAC. Although there is always\nsome prepay response, as we've gone to some lengths to demonstrate, it's still pretty small. Most of\nthe price sensitivity that our MSR displays is about float rather than prepays. I don't think that's\nchanged dramatically in this move. Of course, if you had higher gross WAC MSR alone, then prepays\nand current coupon exposure would have a much bigger impact on the pricing. But most of it is really\njust interest rate movement related.\nJason Stewart\nRight. So net neutral on market multiples and biased higher on TWO’s MSR multiple. Then just a\nquick question, is the MSR in your estimate of book value quarter-to-date? Is there any change to the\nMSR valuation embedded in that?\nBill Greenberg\nYeah. Well, when we said we were down between 1.5 and 3% as of October 18th, that incorporates\nthe entire portfolio.\nJason Stewart\nOkay.\nBill Greenberg\nIt's a hedged portfolio on both sides. All positive- and negative-duration assets are moving around in\nthat, and that's the estimate that we think.\nJason Stewart\n1601 Utica Ave S., Suite 900 St. Louis Park, MN 55416 / 612.453.4100 twoinv.com\nGreat. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Rick Shane with J.P. Morgan.\nRichard Shane\nThanks, everybody, for taking my question. I'd like to follow up on Jason's questions related to the\nMSR. When we look at the sales and bulk purchases, they almost net out. When we look at the gross\ncoupon rate, it ticked down slightly. Can you help us understand a little bit about the characteristics\nof the purchases you're making? I'm assuming that some of this is, or a lot of this, is seasoned MSR.\nYou're not buying new production, but if you could help us understand what's going on here and what\nthe strategy is?\nNick Letica\nHey, Rick, this is Nick. Thank you for that question. As you know MSR is a nuanced asset. There's all\nkinds of things that go into its valuation and you know that old adage in the bond market: “there's no\nbad bonds, just bad prices.” We really look across the WAC range of MSRs. Each package is unique\nand it's hard to generalize. As you know we've sold some high-gross WAC stuff, we've been engaged\nin buying some from time to time. We bought sort of intermediate WAC kind of things that are in the\n4 to 5% gross WAC range through time. It really varies and it depends on where the value is. We have\nbought some high-gross WAC stuff too, just because it's high-gross WAC doesn't mean that it doesn't\nhave good value. As I said, it's a nuanced asset, the deep variables really do matter. We also have\nsome flow and the flow MSR is by definition pretty much current coupon and we have that coming\ninto our portfolio too. So it's a mix of things.\nRichard Shane\nGot it. Okay. Again, it's interesting, I'm looking at your slides, looking at the new logo, looking at the\nnew branding, and realizing that this is indicative of the strategic shift that you guys are pointing to.\nWhen we think about how you're approaching the MSR market at this point, we've historically thought\nof it as a pure hedge against the Agency book. I think what's really happening here is that you're trying\nto play both sides of the coin, that you really want to be in the recapture business. You're competing\nthere as much as you are, sort of creating the traditional, I'll call it “Two Harbors book versus the\nTWO book.”\nBill Greenberg\n1601 Utica Ave S., Suite 900 St. Louis Park, MN 55416 / 612.453.4100 twoinv.com\nYeah, I think that's mostly right. What we saw in the last couple of years as rates rose was that the\ntraditional, what I like to call hedge capacity of the MSR asset declined. The MBS part of the portfolio\nand the MSR portfolio bifurcated because they didn't really hedge one another necessarily, but we\nlike the attributes and return opportunities of both. Our MSR portfolio today, at 3.5 gross WAC as we\nshowed on some of the earlier slides, is prepaying slowly, it's cash flowing well. It's very far out-of-\nthe-money and so forth, and so the MBS part and the MSR part don't hedge one another exactly, but\nthey complement one another. When we think about the ways to add or augment potential returns\nto our MSR assets and to improve returns for the company and for shareholders, there's things we\ncan do on the MSR side that we can't do on the security side. One of the things that we can do is we\ncan buy a servicer. Because we did that, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're on track to achieve\nthe cost savings that we said just through economies of scale, and control our own destiny and being\nable to be more efficient than we were rather than owning subservicing. The recapture effort is a part\nof that also. I think I've talked publicly about being able to hedge faster-than expected prepayment\nspeeds. When rates move, when rates fall or rise, we have expectations of what we think\nprepayments will do. Therefore, we have expectations for what MSR prices will do and we can hedge\nthose with financial instruments. But what we can't do is we can't hedge speeds that are faster than\nwe expect. The origination channel, the direct-to-consumer channel, will help us do that and so\nthat's really the genesis of wanting to embark on that. Then once we're here, we can do some of these\nother things, like I mentioned in my prepared remarks, in terms of originating or brokering second\nliens to other people and other such things. It is a recognition that we're creating this ecosystem\naround the MSR asset, but it's designed to support and augment the investment portfolio.\nRichard Shane\nGot it. Hey, Nick, thank you very much and Bill, that's very helpful. It's good to get strategic insight\nand we appreciate it. Thank you.\nBill Greenberg\nYes. Thanks, Rick.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Trevor Cranston with citizens JMP.\nTrevor Cranston\nHey, thanks. Can you talk a little bit about your thoughts on swap spreads relative to Treasuries? If\nthere's a limit to how low you think those can go and how all that plays into your choice of hedging\ninstruments for the portfolio? Thanks.\n1601 Utica Ave S., Suite 900 St. Louis Park, MN 55416 / 612.453.4100 twoinv.com\nNick Letica\nHey, Trevor, thanks for that question. It's a great question and I will hesitate to state a limit on where\nI think swap spreads can go. We'll say that we use a combination of swaps and Treasury futures to\nhedge our book overall. It does appear to us as though a lot of the supply concerns about the market\nare priced into swap spreads. Right now we are at extremely tight levels on swaps relative to\nTreasuries. But as we've seen this quarter, that gap continues to grow. A lot of it has to do with market\ndirectionality, a lot of it has to do with the expectation for budget responsibility of the next and future\nadministrations. But overall, we do think that swap spreads here present a good hedging opportunity\nand have shifted a little bit so we remain reasonably heavily hedged with swaps. Just thinking that\nthey do offer better carry from a hedge perspective and that there are reasons to also believe that\nswap spreads could widen. One of them really would be if the Fed were to really stop the QT side.\nThere are debates about that in the market, arguments on both sides, but there's a reasonable\nchance that happens as well, which would change the dynamic of that market greatly. But it's a very\ngood question. It's one in which it will just depend on what happens from a budgetary perspective\nfor the U.S. and what supply looks like. But as I said, on balance, we think that there is a lot of the\nbad news, about the budget and Treasury supply priced into spreads right now.\nTrevor Cranston\nYeah. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Eric Hagen with BTIG.\nEric Hagen\nHey, thanks. Good morning. When you say that you raised your spread exposure into October, is that\na function of taking your financial leverage higher, or is your spread exposure also a function of how\nmuch TBA you have relative to pools and such?\nNick Letica\nYeah. Hey, Eric. It's a function of a few things. It's not leverage and that's one thing that we pointed\nout on the prepared remarks. Leverage is but one measure of risk that we look at. Some of our spread\nexposure has to do with how we allow our spread exposure to change with regard to the MSR. When\nrates go down, the MSR it requires, as I mentioned, more mortgages to hedge when rates go back up\nless.\n1601 Utica Ave S., Suite 900 St. Louis Park, MN 55416 / 612.453.4100 twoinv.com\nIf you know you hold essentially the same amount of mortgages, you're going to have mortgage\nspread exposure as rates go up and less as rates go down. Some of it just has to do with letting that\nexposure grow as spreads have widened so it's really more of a function of that than a leverage. We\nhave really not taken our leverage up.\nEric Hagen\nOkay. Got you. I think there is a follow-up question here on leverage, though. What is the right way to\nbenchmark your leverage relative to the spread environment? Does your leverage account for the\nfact that the Fed is expected to cut rates versus last year when spreads were even wider than they\nare right now? But the benefit from the borrowing cost wasn't really reflected in the spread\nenvironment. How do you benchmark your leverage against that?\nNick Letica\nHonestly, I'm not sure I really understand your question. We look at our portfolio composition, look\nat the spreads in the market, and what kind of returns we think we could generate. As we've said on\nprior calls, we've given a range of what our overall economic leverage is. I think that still holds. But it\nhas to do really with where we see spreads are now. Essentially, I think you're asking, are we\npredicting mortgage performance based on the way the Fed is going to act? But I'm not quite sure\nwhat you're asking to be perfectly honest.\nEric Hagen\nOkay. And you guys have the convertible debt coming up on a current liability in a couple of months?\nDo you have a sense for how you're thinking about potentially refinancing that piece of your capital\nstructure?\nBill Greenberg\nConvertible debt is coming due in early ‘26, and so that's on our radar and then we'll be addressing\nit before that. One other point, if I could just make about your question about leverage and so forth\nand Nick's answer, I might just elaborate a little bit. That leverage is one measure of our risk that we\nlook at, of course. But we have other measures in terms of that. We put in the deck, also, about our\nmortgage spread exposure and the amount of liquidity we have and so forth. Because the MSR is as\nout-of-the-money as it is, it does still contribute to offsetting some mortgage spread exposure. We\nthink that's important to include in our overall risks as well, and so, we don't just look at leverage as\none measure, although we obviously pay attention to it and respect it. But it's a whole suite of metrics\nthat we look at when we're managing the portfolio exposures.\n1601 Utica Ave S., Suite 900 St. Louis Park, MN 55416 / 612.453.4100 twoinv.com\nEric Hagen\nGot you. All right, that's really helpful. Thank you guys.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Harsh Hemnani with Green Street.\nHarsh Hemnani\nGood morning. Hey, thanks for taking my question. Now that RoundPoint is scaled up and operating,\ncould you remind us the recapture rate on a long-term basis that you're projecting on the MSR there?\nBill Greenberg\nYeah. As I said, we just finished our first quarter of DTC operations. As I mentioned, we only had a\nnumber of loan officers that can be counted on one hand. And so, we're not up to scale yet. As I said,\nI think what we've done here is a proof of concept, and we're bringing the thing to scale. I think it's\ntoo soon to talk about what the recapture rates are on our portfolio. But we do expect that we'll be\nable to achieve industry-level recapture rates on an Agency portfolio once we're fully at scale. We\nare in this weird environment where 1%, or less than 1%, especially with the recent move in rates of\nour portfolio, are in-the-money. And so these are very small numbers of our portfolio that are actually\nin-the-money. It's not a great moment to talk about what the recapture rate is, but we'll have more\nto say about that in future quarters.\nHarsh Hemnani\nOkay. That's fair. Then you touched on this a little bit in the prepared remarks and on a few prior\nquestions, but perhaps in the near-term, call it the next couple of quarters. How are you looking at\nthe relative value across the two strategies right now, where you're seeing the opportunity to invest\nbetter in the securities portfolio or MSRs?\nNick Letica\nHey, Harsh. Thank you for that question. Mortgage spreads having done what they have done thus\nfar this quarter, the mortgage side at the moment looks quite attractive. How long that lasts? It's hard\nto say. I believe there are a lot of market participants that are holding on for the election to be over\nbecause, as we know, there can be a significant amount of volatility and we have a lot of events\n1601 Utica Ave S., Suite 900 St. Louis Park, MN 55416 / 612.453.4100 twoinv.com\ncoming up in the next few weeks. We have non-farm payroll, we have the election, and then we have\nthe Fed right after that. There are a lot of reasons to do nothing and I think that there are a lot of\ninvestors right now that are happy to just sit and watch right now. I believe that explains a lot of the\nreasons why we've seen mortgage spreads move out as they have. At the moment, if you ask me,\nright, today, if I had money to invest, I would put it into the mortgage side because I think mortgage\nspreads are very attractive. My sense is that won't last for a longer period of time unless we really\nhave a different environment for one reason or another, unless we're again moving back to higher\nrates or some questioning about whether the Fed's really cutting or not. I think the base case should\nbe that mortgage spreads probably do better once we get through these market events that are\ncoming up. We love our MSR asset, as we say, it's a great risk-reward asset. It's fairly easy to hedge\nand provides a lot of great cash flows and prepays are very stable. From a longer-term perspective,\nwe really do like the MSR.\nHarsh Hemnani\nGot it. Great. Thank you.\nBill Greenberg\nThank you, Harsh.\nOperator\nThere are no further questions at this time, Mr. Greenberg, I will turn the conference back to you for\nany additional or closing remarks.\nBill Greenberg\nI'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. Thank you, as always, for your interest in Two Harbors.\nGo TWO.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's call, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\n1601 Utica Ave S., Suite 900 St. Louis Park, MN 55416 / 612.453.4100 twoinv.com"

HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nNote 1. Organization and Operations\n\nTwo Harbors Investment Corp. is a Maryland corporation founded in 2009 that, through its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the Company), invests in, finances and manages mortgage servicing rights, or MSR, and Agency residential mortgage-backed securities, or Agency RMBS, and, through its operational platform, RoundPoint Mortgage Servicing LLC, or RoundPoint, is one of the largest servicers of conventional loans in the country. Agency refers to a U.S. government sponsored enterprise, or GSE, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, or a U.S. government agency such as the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae. The Company is structured as an internally-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, and its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol “TWO”. \n\nThe Company seeks to leverage its core competencies of understanding and managing interest rate and prepayment risk to invest in its portfolio of MSR and Agency RMBS, with the objective of delivering more stable performance, relative to RMBS portfolios without MSR, across changing market environments. The Company is acutely focused on creating sustainable stockholder value over the long term.\n\nEffective September 30, 2023, one of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries, TH MSR Holdings LLC (formerly Matrix Financial Services Corporation), acquired RoundPoint from Freedom Mortgage Corporation, or Freedom, after the completion of customary closing conditions and receiving the required regulatory and GSE approvals. Upon closing, all servicing and origination licenses and operational capabilities remained with RoundPoint, and RoundPoint became a wholly owned subsidiary of TH MSR Holdings. Management believes this acquisition will add value for stakeholders of the Company through cost savings achieved by bringing the servicing of its MSR portfolio in-house, greater control over the Company’s MSR portfolio and the associated cash flows, and the ability to participate more fully in the mortgage finance space as opportunities arise.\n\nThe Company has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, as defined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As long as the Company continues to comply with a number of requirements under federal tax law and maintains its qualification as a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes to the extent that the Company distributes its taxable income to its stockholders on an annual basis and does not engage in prohibited transactions. However, certain activities that the Company may perform may cause it to earn income which will not be qualifying income for REIT purposes. The Company has designated certain of its subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, as defined in the Code, to engage in such activities.\n\nNote 2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\n\nConsolidation and Basis of Presentation\n\nThe interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, have been condensed or omitted according to such SEC rules and regulations. However, management believes that the disclosures included in these interim condensed consolidated financial statements are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.\n\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of all subsidiaries; inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. All trust entities in which the Company holds investments that are considered variable interest entities, or VIEs, for financial reporting purposes were reviewed for consolidation under the applicable consolidation guidance. Whenever the Company has both the power to direct the activities of a trust that most significantly impact the entity’s performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entities that could be significant, the Company consolidates the trust. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In the opinion of management, all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial condition of the Company at September 30, 2024 and results of operations for all periods presented have been made. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 should not be construed as indicative of the results to be expected for future periods or the full year.\n\n7\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of significant estimates. These include estimates of fair value of certain assets and liabilities, the amount and timing of credit losses, prepayment rates, the period of time during which the Company anticipates an increase in the fair values of real estate securities sufficient to recover unrealized losses in those securities, and other estimates that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during the reported period. It is likely that changes in these estimates (e.g., valuation changes due to supply and demand in the market, credit performance, prepayments, interest rates, or other reasons) will occur in the near term. The Company’s estimates are inherently subjective in nature and actual results could differ from its estimates and the differences may be material.\n\nSignificant Accounting Policies\n\nIncluded in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K is a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies. Provided below is a summary of any additional and/or modified accounting policies that were significant to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nMortgage Loans Held-for-Sale, at Fair Value\n\nThe Company originates residential mortgage loans with the intention of selling such loans on a servicing-retained basis in the secondary market. As these loans are originated with intent to sell, the loans are classified as held-for-sale, and the Company has elected to measure these loans held-for-sale at fair value. The Company estimates fair value of mortgage loans held-for-sale using a market approach by utilizing either: (i) the fair value of securities backed by similar mortgage loans, adjusted for certain factors to approximate the fair value of a whole mortgage loan, including the value attributable to mortgage servicing and credit risk; (ii) current commitments to purchase loans; or (iii) recent observable market trades for similar loans, adjusted for credit risk and other individual loan characteristics. In connection with the Company’s election to measure originated mortgage loans held-for-sale at fair value, the Company records the loan origination fees when earned, net of direct loan originations costs associated with these loans. Loan origination fees and underwriting fees are recorded within the other income line item in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses recognized upon sale of loans and fair value adjustments are recorded within gain on mortgage loans held-for-sale in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n\nInterest income on mortgage loans held-for-sale is recognized at the loan coupon rate. Loans are considered past due when they are 30 days past their contractual due date. Interest income recognition is suspended when mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual status. Generally, mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual status when delinquent for more than 90 days or when determined not to be probable of full collection. Interest accrued, but not collected, at the date mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual is reversed and subsequently recognized only to the extent it is received in cash or until it qualifies for return to accrual status. However, where there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of loan principal, all cash received is applied to reduce the carrying value of such loans. Mortgage loans are restored to accrual status only when contractually current or the collection of future payments is reasonably assured.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments, at Fair Value \n\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or ASC 815, all derivative financial instruments, whether designated for hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities and carried at fair value. \n\nThe Company enters into interest rate derivative contracts for a variety of reasons, including minimizing fluctuations in earnings or market values on certain assets or liabilities, including the Company’s loan origination pipeline, that may be caused by changes in interest rates. The pipeline refers to loan applications that have been initiated and offered to borrowers, which remain in the pipeline from the time they are locked until they fall out or are sold into the secondary mortgage market and consists of interest rate lock commitments, or IRLCs, and mortgage loans held-for-sale at fair value. The Company may, at times, enter into various forward contracts including short securities, Agency to-be-announced securities, or TBAs, options, futures, swaps, caps, credit default swaps, total return swaps and forward mortgage loan sale commitments. \n\n8\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nAt the inception of a derivative contract, the Company determines whether the instrument will be part of a qualifying hedge accounting relationship or whether the Company will account for the contract as a trading instrument. Due to the volatility of the interest rate and credit markets and difficulty in effectively matching pricing or cash flows, the Company has elected to treat all derivative contracts as trading instruments. Changes in fair value as well as the accrual and settlement of interest associated with derivatives accounted for as trading instruments are reported in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as (loss) gain on interest rate swap and swaption agreements, (loss) gain on other derivative instruments or gain on mortgage loans held-for-sale, depending on the type of derivative instrument.\n\nDue to the nature of the Company’s derivative instruments, they may be in a receivable/asset position or a payable/liability position at the end of an accounting period. Amounts payable to and receivable from the same party under contracts may be offset as long as the following conditions are met: (i) each of the two parties owes the other determinable amounts; (ii) the reporting party has the right to offset the amount owed with the amount owed by the other party; (iii) the reporting party intends to offset; and (iv) the right of offset is enforceable by law. If the aforementioned conditions are not met, amounts payable to and receivable from are presented by the Company on a gross basis in its consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s centrally cleared interest rate swaps and exchange-traded futures and options on futures require that the Company posts an “initial margin” amount determined by the clearing exchange, which is generally intended to be set at a level sufficient to protect the exchange from the derivative instrument’s maximum estimated single-day price movement. The Company also exchanges “variation margin” based upon daily changes in fair value, as measured by the exchange. The exchange of variation margin is considered a settlement of the derivative instrument, as opposed to pledged collateral. Accordingly, the Company accounts for the receipt or payment of variation margin as a direct reduction to the carrying value of the centrally cleared or exchange-traded derivative asset or liability. The receipt or payment of initial margin is accounted for separate from the derivative asset or liability and is netted on a counterparty basis and classified within restricted cash, due from counterparties, or due to counterparties on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe Company has provided specific disclosure regarding the location and amounts of derivative instruments in the consolidated financial statements and how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for. See Note 9 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities of these notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWarehouse Facilities\n\nTo finance origination activities, the Company enters into warehouse facilities collateralized by the value of the mortgage loans pledged for a period of up to 90 days per loan. Borrowings under these warehouse facilities are considered short-term debt. The Company’s warehouse facilities generally bear interest rates based on an index plus a spread. Borrowings under warehouse facilities are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are carried at contractual amounts, as specified in the respective agreements.\n\nRecently Issued and/or Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, which requires public entities to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to provide the new disclosures and all the disclosures required under ASC 280, Segment Reporting. The ASU does not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates them or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The guidance should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements, unless it is impracticable. The segment expense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior periods should be based on the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. The Company has early adopted this ASU, which did not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or financial statement disclosures.\n\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, which requires entities to provide additional information about federal, state and foreign income taxes and reconciling items in the rate reconciliation table, and to disclose further disaggregation of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) by federal (national), state and foreign taxes by jurisdiction. For public business entities, the ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The guidance should be applied prospectively, but entities have the option to apply it retrospectively for each period presented. The Company has determined this ASU will not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or financial statement disclosures.\n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nEnhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures\n\nIn March 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, issued Release No. 33-11275, its final rule on the enhancement and standardization of climate-related disclosures for investors requiring registrants to provide certain climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports. The rules require information about a registrant’s climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on its business, results of operations, or financial condition. The required information about climate-related risks will also include disclosure of a registrant’s greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the rules will require registrants to present certain climate-related financial metrics in their audited financial statements. For large accelerated filers like the Company, the individual requirements will be phased-in with the first phase being effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2025. Disclosures will be required prospectively, with information for prior periods required only to the extent it was previously disclosed in an SEC filing. On April 4, 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed the final rules pending judicial review. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these final rules on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\n\nNote 3. Acquisition of RoundPoint Mortgage Servicing LLC\n\nEffective September 30, 2023, the Company acquired RoundPoint from Freedom after the completion of customary closing conditions and receiving the required regulatory and GSE approvals. The provisional purchase price recognized was $44.7 million, with $23.6 million paid upon closing and $21.1 million recognized as a payable to Freedom within the other liabilities line item on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2023. The Company performed a provisional allocation of the consideration of $44.7 million to RoundPoint’s assets and liabilities, as set forth below. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a total of $0.2 million in measurement period adjustments, resulting in a final purchase price of $44.5 million. The remaining payable to Freedom of $20.9 million was paid in January 2024. The allocation of the adjusted purchase price of $44.5 million to RoundPoint’s assets and liabilities is also set forth below. The determination of fair value of assets and liabilities required the use of significant assumptions and estimates. Significant estimates included, but were not limited to, future expected cash flows, including projected revenues and expenses, and discount rates. These estimates were based on assumptions that management believes to be reasonable as well as a third party-prepared valuation analysis; however, actual results may differ from these estimates. The measurement period adjustments made during the three months ended December 31, 2023 are set forth below. No measurement period adjustments were made subsequent to December 31, 2023.\n\n(in thousands)| Acquisition Date Amounts Recognized| Subsequent Measurement Period Adjustments| Acquisition Date Amounts Recognized, as adjusted  \n---|---|---|---  \nTotal Consideration| $| 44,732 | $| (188)| $| 44,544  \nAssets:  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 50,366 | $| — | $| 50,366  \nIntangible assets| 786 | 13 | 799  \nOther assets| 29,148 | — | 29,148  \nTotal Assets Acquired| $| 80,300 | $| 13 | $| 80,313  \nLiabilities:  \nAccrued expenses| $| 4,483 | $| — | $| 4,483  \nOther liabilities| 58,739 | — | 58,739  \nTotal Liabilities Assumed| $| 63,222 | $| — | $| 63,222  \nNet Assets| $| 17,078 | $| 13 | $| 17,091  \nGoodwill| $| 27,654 | $| (201)| $| 27,453  \n  \n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nAs a result of the RoundPoint acquisition, the Company identified intangible assets in the form of mortgage servicing and origination state licenses, insurance state licenses, GSE servicing approvals and trade names. The Company recorded the intangible assets at fair value at the acquisition date and amortizes the value of finite-lived intangibles into expense over the expected useful life. Trade names, with a total acquisition date fair value of $0.2 million, are amortized straight-line over a finite life of six months based on the Company’s determination of the time to change a trade name. The Company determined the licenses and approvals, with a total acquisition date fair value of $0.6 million, have indefinite useful lives and are periodically evaluated for impairment given there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive or economic factors that would limit their useful lives.\n\nThe total goodwill of $27.5 million was calculated as the excess of the total consideration transferred over the net assets acquired and primarily includes the existence of an assembled workforce, synergies and benefits expected to result from combining operations with RoundPoint and adding in-house servicing. The full amount of goodwill for tax purposes of $27.5 million is expected to be deductible. The Company will assess the goodwill annually during the fourth quarter and in interim periods whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.\n\nAcquisition-related costs are expensed in the period incurred and included within the other operating expenses line item in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized $1.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively, of acquisition-related costs. The Company did not recognize any further acquisition-related costs in 2024.\n\nAs discussed above, the acquisition of RoundPoint closed effective September 30, 2023. Accordingly, RoundPoint’s consolidated balance sheet is included within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. Beginning October 1, 2023, RoundPoint’s results of operations have been consolidated with the Company’s in accordance with U.S. GAAP; inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The following table presents unaudited pro forma combined revenues and income before income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 prepared as if the RoundPoint acquisition had been consummated on January 1, 2023.\n\nThree Months Ended| Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30,| September 30,  \n(in thousands)| 2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nRevenue (1)| $| (51,527)| $| 585,641 | $| 646,894 | $| 1,044,039  \n(Loss) income before income taxes| $| (248,943)| $| 339,009 | $| 37,153 | $| 357,636  \n  \n____________________\n\n(1)The Company’s revenue is defined as the sum of the interest income, servicing income and total other income line items on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n\nThe above unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information has not been adjusted for transactions that are now considered inter-company as a result of the acquisition, the conforming of accounting policies, nor the divestiture of RoundPoint’s retail origination business and RPX servicing exchange platform, as required by the stock purchase agreement. The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information also does not include any anticipated synergies or other anticipated benefits of the RoundPoint acquisition and, accordingly, the unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of either future results of operations or results that might have been achieved had the acquisition been consummated on January 1, 2023.\n\nAdditionally, in the third quarter of 2022, TH MSR Holdings agreed to engage RoundPoint as a subservicer prior to the closing date and began transferring loans to RoundPoint in the fourth quarter of 2022. As such, prior to the acquisition on September 30, 2023, the Company incurred servicing expenses related to RoundPoint’s subservicing of the Company’s MSR of $10.3 million and $23.9 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. These subservicing expenses are included within the servicing costs line item on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n\n11\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nNote 4. Variable Interest Entities\n\nThe Company enters into transactions with subsidiary trust entities that are established for limited purposes. One of the Company’s subsidiary trust entities, MSR Issuer Trust, was formed for the purpose of financing MSR through securitization, pursuant to which, through two of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries, MSR is pledged to MSR Issuer Trust and in return, MSR Issuer Trust issues term notes to qualified institutional buyers and a variable funding note, or VFN, to one of the subsidiaries, in each case secured on a pari passu basis. The Company has one repurchase facility that is secured by the VFN, which is collateralized by the Company’s MSR. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, all outstanding term notes previously issued by MSR Issuer Trust matured and were repaid.\n\nAnother of the Company’s subsidiary trust entities, Servicing Advance Receivables Issuer Trust, was formed for the purpose of financing servicing advances through a revolving credit facility, pursuant to which Servicing Advance Receivables Issuer Trust issued a VFN backed by servicing advances pledged to the financing counterparty.\n\nBoth MSR Issuer Trust and Servicing Advance Receivables Issuer Trust are considered VIEs for financial reporting purposes and were reviewed for consolidation under the applicable consolidation guidance. As the Company has both the power to direct the activities of the trusts that most significantly impact the entities’ performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entities that could be significant, the Company is the primary beneficiary and, thus, consolidates the trusts. Additionally, in accordance with arrangements entered into in connection with the securitization transaction and the servicing advance revolving credit facility, the Company has direct financial obligations payable to both MSR Issuer Trust and Servicing Advance Receivables Issuer Trust, which, in turn, support MSR Issuer Trust’s obligations to noteholders under the securitization transaction and Servicing Advance Receivables Issuer Trust’s obligations to the financing counterparty.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of the assets and liabilities of all consolidated trusts as reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\n(in thousands)| September 30,2024| December 31,2023  \n---|---|---  \nNote receivable (1)| $| — | $| 399,317  \nRestricted cash| 42,696 | 45,642  \nAccrued interest receivable (1)| — | 551  \nOther assets| 86,646 | 79,749  \nTotal Assets| $| 129,342 | $| 525,259  \nTerm notes payable| $| — | $| 399,317  \nRevolving credit facilities| 59,300 | 34,300  \nAccrued interest payable| 403 | 816  \nOther liabilities| 42,293 | 45,377  \nTotal Liabilities| $| 101,996 | $| 479,810  \n  \n____________________\n\n(1)Receivables due from a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company to the trusts are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nAdditionally, the Company entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement on August 2, 2022 to acquire RoundPoint whereby the preliminary purchase price was subject to a post-closing adjustment based on RoundPoint’s aggregate “earnings” (as defined in the stock purchase agreement) from October 1, 2022 through the closing date, or the Interim Period, in addition to other post-closing adjustments. During the Interim Period, the manner in which the purchase price is calculated represented an implicit guarantee of the value of RoundPoint’s net book value, in which the Company held the variable interests. These terms also indicated that RoundPoint met the criteria to be considered a VIE that the Company must review for consolidation. As the Company had the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits of RoundPoint during the Interim Period that could be significant, but not the power to direct the activities of RoundPoint that most significantly impacted its performance, the Company was not the primary beneficiary and, thus, did not consolidate RoundPoint during the Interim Period. Effective September 30, 2023, the parties had satisfied customary closing conditions and received the required regulatory and GSE approvals to close the transaction. Upon closing, RoundPoint became a consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and was no longer considered a VIE.\n\n12\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nNote 5.

TH MSR Holdings acquires MSR from third-party originators through flow and bulk purchases, as well as through the recapture of MSR on loans in its MSR portfolio that refinance. TH MSR Holdings does not directly service mortgage loans; instead, it engages its wholly owned subsidiary, RoundPoint, to handle substantially all servicing functions in the name of the subservicer for the mortgage loans underlying the Company’s MSR. RoundPoint also services mortgage loans underlying MSR owned by third parties.

Changes in fair value based on 10% and 20% variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of MSR is calculated without changing any other assumptions. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (e.g., increased market interest rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit losses) that could magnify or counteract the sensitivities. Further, these sensitivities show only the change in the asset balances and do not show any expected change in the fair value of the instruments used to manage the interest rates and prepayment risks associated with these assets.\n\nRisk Mitigation Activities\n\nThe primary risks associated with the Company’s MSR are changes in interest rates, mortgage spreads and prepayments. The Company economically hedges interest rate and mortgage spread risk primarily with its Agency RMBS portfolio. Prepayment risk is carefully monitored and partially mitigated through the Company’s ability to retain the MSR, in certain circumstances, through recapture if the underlying loan is refinanced.\n\nMortgage Servicing Income and Costs\n\nThe following table presents the components of servicing income recorded on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nThree Months Ended| Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30,| September 30,  \n(in thousands)| 2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nServicing fee income| $| 126,597 | $| 141,816 | $| 400,278 | $| 415,423  \nAncillary and other fee income| 3,928 | 476 | 12,220 | 2,236  \nFloat income| 41,207 | 36,333 | 101,582 | 89,509  \nTotal| $| 171,732 | $| 178,625 | $| 514,080 | $| 507,168  \n  \nPrior to the acquisition of RoundPoint, the Company did not directly service mortgage loans; instead, it contracted with appropriately licensed third-party subservicers to handle substantially all servicing functions in the name of the subservicer for the mortgage loans underlying the Company’s MSR. These third-party subservicing costs and other servicing expenses directly related to the Company’s MSR portfolio are included within the servicing costs line item on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Post-acquisition, all servicing-related expenses incurred by RoundPoint as an operating company are included within the compensation and benefits and other operating expenses line items on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n\n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nMortgage Servicing Advances\n\nAs the servicer of record for the MSR assets, the Company may be required to advance principal and interest payments to security holders, and intermittent tax and insurance payments to local authorities and insurance companies on mortgage loans that are in forbearance, delinquency or default. The Company is responsible for funding these advances, potentially for an extended period of time, before receiving reimbursement from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Servicing advances are priority cash flows in the event of a loan principal reduction or foreclosure and ultimate liquidation of the real estate-owned property, thus making their collection reasonably assured. These servicing advances totaled $92.0 million and $143.2 million and were included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, mortgage loans in 60+ day delinquent status (whether or not subject to forbearance) accounted for approximately 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively, of the aggregate principal balance of loans for which the Company had servicing advance funding obligations.\n\nThe Company has one revolving credit facility to finance its servicing advance obligations. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had pledged servicing advances with a carrying value of $86.6 million and $79.7 million, respectively, as collateral for this revolving credit facility. See Note 14 - Revolving Credit Facilities.\n\nNote 7. Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale, at Fair Value\n\nThe Company originates residential mortgage loans for the purpose of selling to the GSEs or other third-party investors in the secondary market on a servicing-retained basis, typically within 30 days of origination. The Company also holds a small amount of mortgage loans purchased from the collateral underlying its MSR. Mortgage loans held-for-sale are recorded at fair value as a result of a fair value option election. The following table presents the carrying value of Company’s mortgage loans held-for-sale as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\n(in thousands)| September 30,2024| December 31,2023  \n---|---|---  \nUnpaid principal balance| $| 3,284 | $| 318  \nMark-to-market adjustments| 60 | 14  \nTotal mortgage loans held-for-sale| $| 3,344 | $| 332  \n  \nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the Company’s mortgage loans held-for-sale for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nThree Months Ended| Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30,| September 30,  \n(in thousands)| 2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nBalance at beginning of period| $| 278 | $| 295 | $| 332 | $| 283  \nOriginations and purchases of mortgage loans| 22,394 | 40 | 22,445 | 80  \nSales and principal collections| (19,378)| (2)| (19,479)| (30)  \nUnrealized gains (losses) on mortgage loans| 50 | — | 46 | —  \nBalance at end of period| $| 3,344 | $| 333 | $| 3,344 | $| 333  \n  \nThe Company is subject to credit risk associated with its originated mortgage loans during the period of time prior to the sale of these loans. The Company considers credit risk associated with these loans to be minimal as it holds the loans for a short period of time and the market for these loans continues to be highly liquid.\n\nThe Company has one warehouse facility to finance its mortgage loans held-for-sale. At September 30, 2024, the Company had pledged mortgage loans held-for-sale with a carrying value of $3.1 million as collateral for this warehouse facility.

The Company has also placed cash in a restricted account pursuant to a letter of credit on an office space lease.\n\nThe following table presents the Company’s restricted cash balances as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\n(in thousands)| September 30,2024| December 31,2023  \n---|---|---  \nRestricted cash balances held by trading counterparties:  \nFor securities trading activity| $| 450 | $| 450  \nFor derivatives trading activity| 26,649 | 1,669  \nFor servicing activities| 47,963 | 50,345  \nAs restricted collateral for borrowings| 13,998 | 12,575  \nTotal restricted cash balances held by trading counterparties| 89,060 | 65,039  \nRestricted cash balance pursuant to letter of credit on office lease| 65 | 62  \nTotal| $| 89,125 | $| 65,101  \n  \nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the statements of cash flows:\n\n(in thousands)| September 30,2024| December 31,2023  \n---|---|---  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 522,581 | $| 729,732  \nRestricted cash| 89,125 | 65,101  \nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash| $| 611,706 | $| 794,833  \n  \nNote 9. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n\nThe Company enters into a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments in connection with its risk management activities. The primary objective for executing these derivative and non-derivative instruments is to mitigate the Company’s economic exposure to future events that are outside its control, principally cash flow volatility associated with interest rate risk (including associated prepayment risk). Specifically, the Company enters into derivative and non-derivative instruments to economically hedge interest rate risk or “duration mismatch (or gap)” by adjusting the duration of its floating-rate borrowings into fixed-rate borrowings to more closely match the duration of its assets. This particularly applies to floating-rate borrowing agreements with maturities or interest rate resets of less than six months. Typically, the interest receivable terms (e.g., Overnight Index Swap Rate, or OIS, or Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR) of certain derivatives match the terms of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective conversion of the rate of the related borrowing agreement from floating to fixed. The objective is to manage the cash flows associated with current and anticipated interest payments on borrowings, as well as the ability to roll or refinance borrowings at the desired amount by adjusting the duration.\n\nTo help manage the adverse impact of interest rate changes on the value of the Company’s portfolio, its cash flows, and its loan origination pipeline, the Company may, at times, enter into various forward contracts, including short securities, Agency to-be-announced securities, or TBAs, options, futures, swaps, caps, credit default swaps, total return swaps and forward mortgage loan sale commitments.In executing on the Company’s current risk management strategy, the Company has entered into TBAs, interest rate swap and swaption agreements, futures, options on futures, IRLCs and forward mortgage loan sale commitments. The Company has also entered into a number of non-derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk, principally MSR and interest-only securities (see discussion below).\n\n19\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nThe following summarizes the Company’s significant asset and liability classes, the risk exposure for these classes, and the Company’s risk management activities used to mitigate these risks. The discussion includes both derivative and non-derivative instruments used as part of these risk management activities. Any of the Company’s derivative and non-derivative instruments may be entered into in conjunction with one another in order to mitigate risks. As a result, the following discussions of each type of instrument should be read as a collective representation of the Company’s risk mitigation efforts and should not be considered independent of one another. While the Company uses derivative and non-derivative instruments to achieve the Company’s risk management activities, it is possible that these instruments will not effectively mitigate all or a substantial portion of the Company’s market rate risk. In addition, the Company might elect, at times, not to enter into certain hedging arrangements in order to maintain compliance with REIT requirements.\n\nBalance Sheet Presentation\n\nIn accordance with ASC 815, the Company records derivative financial instruments on its condensed consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative instruments and whether they are designated or qualify as hedge instruments. Due to the volatility of the interest rate and credit markets and difficulty in effectively matching pricing or cash flows, the Company has not designated any current derivatives as hedging instruments.\n\nThe following tables present the gross fair value and notional amounts of the Company’s derivative financial instruments treated as trading derivatives as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024  \n---  \nDerivative Assets| Derivative Liabilities  \n(in thousands)| Fair Value| Notional| Fair Value| Notional  \nInverse interest-only securities| $| 11,842 | $| 142,011 | $| — | $| —  \nInterest rate swap agreements| — | — | — | 14,197,205  \nSwaptions, net| — | — | — | —  \nTBAs| 184 | (34,000)| (16,725)| 5,098,000  \nFutures, net| — | — | — | (3,693,900)  \nInterest rate lock commitments| 478 | 33,381 | — | —  \nForward mortgage loan sale commitments| 68 | 26,786 | (39)| 9,612  \nTotal| $| 12,572 | $| 168,178 | $| (16,764)| $| 15,610,917  \n  \nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \nDerivative Assets| Derivative Liabilities  \n(in thousands)| Fair Value| Notional| Fair Value| Notional  \nInverse interest-only securities| $| 12,292 | $| 163,735 | $| — | $| —  \nInterest rate swap agreements| — | — | — | 17,788,114  \nSwaptions, net| 19 | (200,000)| — | —  \nTBAs| 72,980 | 2,979,000 | (21,506)| 518,000  \nFutures, net| — | — | — | (6,203,050)  \nInterest rate lock commitments| — | — | — | —  \nForward mortgage loan sale commitments| — | — | — | —  \nTotal| $| 85,291 | $| 2,942,735 | $| (21,506)| $| 12,103,064  \n  \nComprehensive Income (Loss) Statement Presentation\n\nThe Company has not applied hedge accounting to its current derivative portfolio held to mitigate interest rate risk and credit risk.

Periods of rising interest rates with corresponding decreasing prepayment speeds generally result in a decline in the value of the Company’s fixed-rate Agency principal and interest (P&I) RMBS. The impact of this effect on the Company’s fixed-rate Agency P&I RMBS portfolio is partially mitigated by the presence of fixed-rate interest-only Agency RMBS, which generally increase in value when prepayment speeds decrease and MSR, which generally increase in value when prepayment speeds decrease and interest rates increase. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $17.4 million and $41.9 million, respectively, of interest-only securities, and $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, of MSR. Interest-only securities are included in AFS securities, at fair value, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe Company monitors its borrowings under repurchase agreements and revolving credit facilities, which are generally floating-rate debt, in relation to the rate profile of its portfolio. In connection with its risk management activities, the Company enters into a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments to economically hedge interest rate risk or duration mismatch (or gap) by adjusting the duration of its floating-rate borrowings into fixed-rate borrowings to more closely match the duration of its assets. This particularly applies to borrowing agreements with maturities or interest rate resets of less than six months. Typically, the interest receivable terms (e.g., OIS or SOFR) of certain derivatives match the terms of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective conversion of the rate of the related borrowing agreement from floating to fixed. The objective is to manage the cash flows associated with current and anticipated interest payments on borrowings, as well as the ability to roll or refinance borrowings at the desired amount by adjusting the duration. To help manage the adverse impact of interest rate changes on the value of the Company’s portfolio, its cash flows and its loan origination pipeline (consisting of IRLCs and mortgage loans held-for-sale), the Company may, at times, enter into various forward contracts, including short securities, TBAs, options, futures, swaps, caps, credit default swaps, total return swaps and forward mortgage loan sale commitments. In executing on the Company’s current interest rate risk management strategy, the Company has entered into TBAs, interest rate swap and swaption agreements, futures, options on futures and forward mortgage loan sale commitments.\n\nTBAs. The Company may use TBAs as a means of deploying capital until targeted investments are available or to take advantage of temporary displacements, funding advantages or valuation differentials in the marketplace. Additionally, the Company may use TBAs independently, or in conjunction with other derivative and non-derivative instruments, in order to mitigate risks. TBAs are forward contracts for the purchase (long notional positions) or sale (short notional positions) of Agency RMBS. The issuer, coupon and stated maturity of the Agency RMBS are predetermined as well as the trade price, face amount and future settle date (published each month by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association). However, the specific Agency RMBS to be delivered upon settlement is not known at the time of the TBA transaction. As a result, and because physical delivery of the Agency RMBS upon settlement cannot be assured, the Company accounts for TBAs as derivative instruments.\n\nThe Company may hold both long and short notional TBA positions, which are disclosed on a gross basis according to the unrealized gain or loss position of each TBA contract regardless of long or short notional position. The following tables present the notional amount, cost basis, market value and carrying value (which approximates fair value) of the Company’s TBA positions as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024  \n---  \nNet Carrying Value (4)  \n(in thousands)| Notional Amount (1)| Cost Basis (2)| Market Value (3)| Derivative Assets| Derivative Liabilities  \nPurchase contracts| $| 5,098,000 | $| 5,092,267 | $| 5,075,542 | $| — | $| (16,725)  \nSale contracts| (34,000)| (31,850)| (31,665)| 185 | —  \nTBAs, net| $| 5,064,000 | $| 5,060,417 | $| 5,043,877 | $| 185 | $| (16,725)  \n  \n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \nNet Carrying Value (4)  \n(in thousands)| Notional Amount (1)| Cost Basis (2)| Market Value (3)| Derivative Assets| Derivative Liabilities  \nPurchase contracts| $| 4,194,000 | $| 3,827,271 | $| 3,898,874 | $| 72,980 | $| (1,377)  \nSale contracts| (697,000)| (656,723)| (676,852)| — | (20,129)  \nTBAs, net| $| 3,497,000 | $| 3,170,548 | $| 3,222,022 | $| 72,980 | $| (21,506)  \n  \n___________________\n\n(1)Notional amount represents the face amount of the underlying Agency RMBS.\n\n(2)Cost basis represents the forward price to be paid (received) for the underlying Agency RMBS.\n\n(3)Market value represents the current market value of the TBA (or of the underlying Agency RMBS) as of period end.\n\n(4)Net carrying value represents the difference between the market value of the TBA as of period end and its cost basis, and is reported in derivative assets / (liabilities), at fair value, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\nFutures.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, forward starting interest rate swap payers had a weighted average fixed pay rate of 3.3% and 4.0% and weighted average maturities of 5.4 and 6.4 years, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held the following interest rate swaps that were utilized as economic hedges of interest rate exposure (or duration) risk whereby the Company pays interest at a floating interest rate (OIS or SOFR):\n\n(notional in thousands)  \n---  \nSeptember 30, 2024  \nSwaps Maturities| Notional Amount (1)| Weighted Average Pay Rate| Weighted Average Fixed Receive Rate (2)| Weighted Average Maturity (Years) (2)  \n≤ 1 year| $| 786,641 | 4.960 | %| 4.025 | %| 0.47  \n> 1 and ≤ 3 years| 925,695 | 4.960 | %| 3.326 | %| 3.00  \n> 3 and ≤ 5 years| 352,348 | 4.960 | %| 3.099 | %| 4.96  \n> 5 and ≤ 7 years| 99,607 | 4.960 | %| 3.097 | %| 6.95  \n> 7 and ≤ 10 years| 194,861 | 4.960 | %| 3.633 | %| 9.83  \n> 10 years| 493,326 | 4.960 | %| 3.384 | %| 20.38  \nTotal| $| 2,852,478 | 4.960 | %| 3.571 | %| 7.12  \n  \n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\n(notional in thousands)  \n---  \nDecember 31, 2023  \nSwaps Maturities| Notional Amount (1)| Weighted Average Pay Rate| Weighted Average Fixed Receive Rate (2)| Weighted Average Maturity (Years) (2)  \n≤ 1 year| $| — | — | %| — | %| 0.00  \n> 1 and ≤ 3 years| 2,470,819 | 5.380 | %| 4.204 | %| 1.36  \n> 3 and ≤ 5 years| 780,000 | 5.380 | %| 3.845 | %| 1.36  \n> 5 and ≤ 7 years| 988,026 | 5.380 | %| 4.023 | %| 4.03  \n> 7 and ≤ 10 years| 1,161,160 | 5.380 | %| 4.013 | %| 9.57  \n> 10 years| 260,626 | 5.380 | %| 3.444 | %| 20.01  \nTotal| $| 5,660,631 | 5.380 | %| 4.052 | %| 5.00  \n  \n____________________\n\n(1)Notional amount includes $665.7 million and $645.2 million in forward starting interest rate swaps as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\n(2)Weighted averages exclude forward starting interest rate swaps. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, forward starting interest rate swap receivers had a weighted average fixed receive rate of 3.4% and 4.4% and weighted average maturities of 2.0 and 2.0 years, respectively.\n\nInterest Rate Swaptions. The Company may use interest rate swaptions (which provide the option to enter into interest rate swap agreements for a predetermined notional amount, stated term and pay and receive interest rates in the future) independently, or in conjunction with other derivative and non-derivative instruments, in order to mitigate risks. The Company did not hold any interest rate swaptions as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had the following outstanding interest rate swaptions:\n\nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \n(notional and dollars in thousands)| Option| Underlying Swap  \nSwaption| Expiration| Cost| Fair Value| Average Months to Expiration| Notional Amount| Average Fixed Rate| Average Term (Years)  \nPurchase contracts:  \nPayer| < 6 Months| $| 480 | $| 22 | 2.40 | $| 200,000 | 5.13 | %| 1.0  \nSale contracts:  \nPayer| < 6 Months| $| (332)| $| (3)| 2.40 | $| (400,000)| 5.61 | %| 1.0  \n  \nInterest Rate Lock Commitments. The Company enters into IRLCs to originate residential mortgage loans at specified interest rates and terms within a specified period of time with customers who have applied for a loan and may meet certain credit and underwriting criteria. IRLCs are subject to changes in mortgage interest rates from the date of the commitment through the date of funding the loan or the cancellation or expiration of the lock commitment, generally ranging between 30 and 90 days. IRLCs are considered freestanding derivatives and are recorded at fair value at inception inclusive of the inherent value of servicing the loan. The Company did not hold any IRLCs as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding IRLCs of $33.4 million in principal with a net fair value of $0.5 million.\n\n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nForward Mortgage Loan Sale Commitments. The Company uses forward mortgage loan sale commitments to manage exposure to interest rate risk and changes in the fair value of IRLCs from the date of the commitment through the date of funding or cancellation or expiration of the lock commitment. Forward mortgage loan sale commitments are also used to manage exposure to interest rate risk and changes in the fair value of the Company’s mortgage loans held-for-sale from the date of funding through the date of sale in the secondary market, typically within 30 days of origination. Forward mortgage loan sale commitments are recorded at fair value based on pricing of similar instruments in the secondary market based upon the investor, coupon, and estimated sale or delivery month. The Company’s expectation of the amount of IRLCs that will ultimately close is a key factor in determining the notional amount of derivatives used in economically hedging the position. The Company did not hold any forward mortgage loan sale commitments as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding forward mortgage loan sale commitments of $36.4 million in principal with a net fair value of $29 thousand.\n\nCredit Risk\n\nThe Company’s exposure to credit losses on its Agency RMBS portfolio is limited due to implicit or explicit backing from either a GSE or a U.S. government agency. The payment of principal and interest on the Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed by those respective agencies, and the payment of principal and interest on the Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\n\nIn future periods, the Company could enhance its credit risk protection, enter into further paired derivative positions, including both long and short credit default swaps, and/or seek opportunistic trades in the event of a market disruption. The Company also has processes and controls in place to monitor, analyze, manage and mitigate its credit risk with respect to non-Agency securities and mortgage loans held-for-sale.\n\nDerivative financial instruments contain an element of credit risk if counterparties are unable to meet the terms of the agreements. Credit risk associated with derivative financial instruments is measured as the net replacement cost should the counterparties that owe the Company under such contracts completely fail to perform under the terms of these contracts, assuming there are no recoveries of underlying collateral, as measured by the market value of the derivative financial instruments. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of derivative financial instruments as an asset and liability position was $12.6 million and $16.8 million, respectively.\n\nThe Company attempts to mitigate its credit risk exposure on derivative financial instruments by limiting its counterparties to banks and financial institutions that meet established internal credit guidelines. The Company also seeks to spread its credit risk exposure across multiple counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to any single counterparty. Additionally, the Company reduces credit risk on the majority of its derivative instruments by entering into agreements that permit the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty or clearing agency upon the occurrence of certain events. To further mitigate the risk of counterparty default, the Company maintains collateral agreements with certain of its counterparties and clearing agencies, which require both parties to maintain cash deposits in the event the fair values of the derivative financial instruments exceed established thresholds. The Company’s centrally cleared interest rate swaps and exchange-traded futures and options on futures require the Company to post an “initial margin” amount determined by the clearing exchange, which is generally intended to be set at a level sufficient to protect the exchange from the derivative instrument’s maximum estimated single-day price movement. The Company also exchanges “variation margin” based upon daily changes in fair value, as measured by the exchange. The exchange of variation margin is considered a settlement of the derivative instrument, as opposed to pledged collateral. Accordingly, the Company accounts for the receipt or payment of variation margin as a direct reduction to the carrying value of the centrally cleared or exchange-traded derivative asset or liability.\n\nNote 10. Reverse Repurchase Agreements\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $280.5 million and $286.1 million in amounts due to counterparties as collateral for reverse repurchase agreements that could be pledged, delivered or otherwise used, with a fair value of $359.2 million and $284.1 million, respectively.\n\n28\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nNote 11. Offsetting Assets and Liabilities\n\nCertain of the Company’s repurchase agreements are governed by underlying agreements that provide for a right of setoff in the event of default by either party to the agreement. The Company also has netting arrangements in place with all derivative counterparties pursuant to standard documentation developed by the International Swap and Derivatives Association, or ISDA, or central clearing exchange agreements. The Company and the counterparty or clearing agency are required to post cash collateral based upon the net underlying market value of the Company’s open positions with the counterparty. Additionally, the Company’s centrally cleared interest rate swaps and exchange-traded futures and options on futures require the Company to post an initial margin amount determined by the clearing exchange, which is generally intended to be set at a level sufficient to protect the exchange from the derivative instrument’s maximum estimated single-day price movement. The Company also exchanges variation margin based upon daily changes in fair value, as measured by the exchange.\n\nUnder U.S. GAAP, if the Company has a valid right of setoff, it may offset the related asset and liability and report the net amount. Based on rules governing certain central clearing and exchange-trading activities, the exchange of variation margin is considered a settlement of the derivative instrument, as opposed to pledged collateral. Accordingly, the Company accounts for the receipt or payment of variation margin on Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or CME, and London Clearing House, or LCH, cleared positions as a direct reduction to the carrying value of the centrally cleared or exchange-traded derivative asset or liability. The receipt or payment of initial margin is accounted for separate from the derivative asset or liability.\n\nReverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements with the same counterparty and the same maturity are presented net in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets when the terms of the agreements meet the criteria to permit netting. The Company reports cash flows on repurchase agreements as financing activities and cash flows on reverse repurchase agreements as investing activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities (other than centrally cleared or exchange-traded derivative instruments) subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements on a net basis, based on derivative type and counterparty, in its condensed consolidated balance sheets. Separately, the Company presents cash collateral subject to such arrangements (other than variation margin on centrally cleared or exchange-traded derivative instruments) on a net basis, based on counterparty, in its condensed consolidated balance sheets. However, the Company does not offset repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements or derivative assets and liabilities (other than centrally cleared or exchange-traded derivative instruments) with the associated cash collateral on its condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe following tables present information about the Company’s assets and liabilities that are subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements and can potentially be offset on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024  \n---  \nGross Amounts Not Offset with Financial Assets (Liabilities) in the Balance Sheets (1)  \n(in thousands)| Gross Amounts of Recognized Assets (Liabilities)| Gross Amounts Offset in the Balance Sheets| Net Amounts of Assets (Liabilities) Presented in the Balance Sheets| Financial Instruments| Cash Collateral (Received) Pledged| Net Amount  \nAssets:  \nDerivative assets| $| 47,468 | $| (34,896)| $| 12,572 | $| (12,572)| $| — | $| —  \nReverse repurchase agreements| 359,180 | — | 359,180 | — | (280,523)| 78,657  \nTotal Assets| $| 406,648 | $| (34,896)| $| 371,752 | $| (12,572)| $| (280,523)| $| 78,657  \nLiabilities:  \nRepurchase agreements| $| (8,763,400)| $| — | $| (8,763,400)| $| 8,763,400 | $| — | $| —  \nDerivative liabilities| (51,660)| 34,896 | (16,764)| 12,572 | — | (4,192)  \nTotal Liabilities| $| (8,815,060)| $| 34,896 | $| (8,780,164)| $| 8,775,972 | $| — | $| (4,192)  \n  \n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \nGross Amounts Not Offset with Financial Assets (Liabilities) in the Balance Sheets (1)  \n(in thousands)| Gross Amounts of Recognized Assets (Liabilities)| Gross Amounts Offset in the Balance Sheets| Net Amounts of Assets (Liabilities) Presented in the Balance Sheets| Financial Instruments| Cash Collateral (Received) Pledged| Net Amount  \nAssets:  \nDerivative assets| $| 228,227 | $| (142,936)| $| 85,291 | $| (21,506)| $| — | $| 63,785  \nReverse repurchase agreements| 284,091 | — | 284,091 | — | (284,091)| —  \nTotal Assets| $| 512,318 | $| (142,936)| $| 369,382 | $| (21,506)| $| (284,091)| $| 63,785  \nLiabilities:  \nRepurchase agreements| $| (8,020,207)| $| — | $| (8,020,207)| $| 8,020,207 | $| — | $| —  \nDerivative liabilities| (164,442)| 142,936 | (21,506)| 21,506 | — | —  \nTotal Liabilities| $| (8,184,649)| $| 142,936 | $| (8,041,713)| $| 8,041,713 | $| — | $| —  \n  \n____________________\n\n(1)Amounts presented are limited in total to the net amount of assets or liabilities presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheets by instrument. Excess cash collateral or financial assets that are pledged to counterparties may exceed the financial liabilities subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement, or counterparties may have pledged excess cash collateral to the Company that exceed the corresponding financial assets. These excess amounts are excluded from the table above, although separately reported within restricted cash, due from counterparties, or due to counterparties in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\nNote 12. Fair Value\n\nFair Value Measurements\n\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820, defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 clarifies that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices available in active markets (i.e., observable inputs) and the lowest priority to data lacking transparency (i.e., unobservable inputs). Additionally, ASC 820 requires an entity to consider all aspects of nonperformance risk, including the entity’s own credit standing, when measuring fair value of a liability.\n\nASC 820 establishes a three-level hierarchy to be used when measuring and disclosing fair value. An instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to its valuation. The following is a description of the three levels:\n\nLevel 1Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date under current market conditions. Additionally, the entity must have the ability to access the active market and the quoted prices cannot be adjusted by the entity.\n\nLevel 2Inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in inactive markets for identical or similar assets or liabilities; or inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means for substantially the full-term of the assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 3Unobservable inputs are supported by little or no market activity. The unobservable inputs represent the assumptions that market participants would use to price the assets and liabilities, including risk. Generally, Level 3 assets and liabilities are valued using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that require significant judgment or estimation.\n\n30\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nThe following are descriptions of the valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models, key inputs to those models and significant assumptions utilized.\n\nAvailable-for-sale securities. The Company holds a portfolio of AFS securities that are carried at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and primarily comprised of Agency and non-Agency investment securities. The Company determines the fair value of its Agency RMBS based upon prices obtained from third-party brokers and pricing vendors received using bid price, which are deemed indicative of market activity. The third-party pricing vendors use pricing models that generally incorporate such factors as coupons, primary and secondary mortgage rates, rate reset period, issuer, prepayment speeds, credit enhancements and expected life of the security. In determining the fair value of its non-Agency securities, management judgment may be used to arrive at fair value that considers prices obtained from third-party pricing vendors and other applicable market data. If observable market prices are not available or insufficient to determine fair value due principally to illiquidity in the marketplace, then fair value is based upon models that are primarily based on observable market-based inputs but also include unobservable market data inputs (including prepayment speeds, delinquency levels, and credit losses). \n\nThe Company classified 99.95% and 0.05% of its AFS securities as Level 2 and Level 3 fair value assets, respectively, at September 30, 2024.\n\nMortgage servicing rights.The Company holds a portfolio of MSR that are carried at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines fair value of its MSR based on prices obtained from third-party pricing vendors. Although MSR transactions may be observable in the marketplace, the details of those transactions are not necessarily reflective of the value of the Company’s MSR portfolio. Third-party vendors use both observable market data and unobservable market data (including forecasted prepayment speeds, OAS and cost to service) as inputs into models, which help to inform their best estimates of fair value market price. As a result, the Company classified 100% of its MSR as Level 3 fair value assets at September 30, 2024.\n\nMortgage loans held-for-sale.The Company’s recognizes on its condensed consolidated balance sheets originated mortgage loans held-for-sale that are carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election. The Company estimates fair value of mortgage loans held-for-sale using a market approach by utilizing either: (i) the fair value of securities backed by similar mortgage loans, adjusted for certain factors to approximate the fair value of a whole mortgage loan, including the value attributable to mortgage servicing and credit risk; (ii) current commitments to purchase loans; or (iii) recent observable market trades for similar loans, adjusted for credit risk and other individual loan characteristics. As these fair values are derived from market observable inputs, the Company classified 100% of its mortgage loans held-for-sale as Level 2 fair value assets at September 30, 2024.\n\nDerivative instruments. The Company may enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments as part of its hedging strategies, including over-the-counter, or OTC, derivative contracts, such as interest rate swaps and swaptions. The Company utilizes third-party brokers to value its OTC derivative instruments. The Company classified 100% of its interest rate swaps reported at fair value as Level 2 at September 30, 2024. The Company did not hold any interest rate swaptions at September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company may also enter into certain other derivative financial instruments, such as inverse interest-only securities, TBAs, futures and options on futures. The Company utilizes third-party pricing vendors to value inverse interest-only securities, as these instruments are similar in form to the Company’s AFS securities. The Company classified 100% of its inverse interest-only securities at fair value as Level 2 at September 30, 2024. TBAs, futures and options on futures are considered to be active markets such that participants transact with sufficient frequency and volume to provide transparent pricing information for identical instruments. The Company utilizes third-party pricing vendors to value TBAs, futures and options on futures. The Company reported 100% of its TBAs and futures as Level 1 as of September 30, 2024. The Company did not hold any options on futures at September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company also enters into IRLCs and forward mortgage loan sale commitments in connection with its origination activities. The Company determines fair value of its IRLCs based on valuation models that use the market price for similar loans sold in the secondary market, net of costs to close the loans, subject to the estimated loan funding probability or pull-through rate. Given the significant and unobservable nature of the pull-through rate assumption, the Company classified 100% of its IRLCs as Level 3 at September 30, 2024. The valuation model for forward mortgage loan sale commitments utilizes the fair value of related mortgage loans determined using observable market data, and therefore, the Company reported 100% of its forward mortgage loan sale commitments as Level 2 as of September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company’s policy is to minimize credit exposure related to financial derivatives used for hedging by limiting the hedge counterparties to major banks, financial institutions, exchanges, and private investors who meet established capital and credit guidelines as well as by limiting the amount of exposure to any individual counterparty.\n\n31\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nThe Company has netting arrangements in place with all derivative counterparties pursuant to standard documentation developed by ISDA or central clearing exchange agreements. Additionally, both the Company and the counterparty or clearing agency are required to post cash margin based upon the net underlying market value of the Company’s open positions with the counterparty. Posting of cash margin typically occurs daily, subject to certain dollar thresholds. Due to the existence of netting arrangements, as well as frequent cash margin posting at low posting thresholds, credit exposure to the Company and/or to the counterparty or clearing agency is considered materially mitigated. Based on the Company’s assessment, there is no requirement for any additional adjustment to derivative valuations specifically for credit.\n\nThe following tables display the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company often economically hedges the fair value change of its assets or liabilities with derivatives and other financial instruments. The tables below display the hedges separately from the hedged items, and therefore do not directly display the impact of the Company’s risk management activities:\n\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements  \n---  \nSeptember 30, 2024  \n(in thousands)| Level 1| Level 2| Level 3| Total  \nAssets:  \nAvailable-for-sale securities| $| — | $| 8,502,243 | $| 3,859 | $| 8,506,102  \nMortgage servicing rights| — | — | 2,884,304 | 2,884,304  \nMortgage loans held-for-sale| — | 3,344 | — | 3,344  \nDerivative assets| 184 | 11,910 | 478 | 12,572  \nTotal assets| $| 184 | $| 8,517,497 | $| 2,888,641 | $| 11,406,322  \nLiabilities:  \nDerivative liabilities| $| 16,725 | $| 39 | $| — | $| 16,764  \nTotal liabilities| $| 16,725 | $| 39 | $| — | $| 16,764  \n  \nRecurring Fair Value Measurements  \n---  \nDecember 31, 2023  \n(in thousands)| Level 1| Level 2| Level 3| Total  \nAssets:  \nAvailable-for-sale securities| $| — | $| 8,322,999 | $| 4,150 | $| 8,327,149  \nMortgage servicing rights| — | — | 3,052,016 | 3,052,016  \nMortgage loans held-for-sale| — | 332 | — | 332  \nDerivative assets| 72,980 | 12,311 | — | 85,291  \nTotal assets| $| 72,980 | $| 8,335,642 | $| 3,056,166 | $| 11,464,788  \nLiabilities:  \nDerivative liabilities| $| 21,506 | $| — | $| — | $| 21,506  \nTotal liabilities| $| 21,506 | $| — | $| — | $| 21,506  \n  \nThe Company may be required to measure certain assets or liabilities at fair value from time to time. These periodic fair value measures typically result from application of certain impairment measures under U.S. GAAP. These items would constitute nonrecurring fair value measures under ASC 820. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the periods presented. \n\nThe valuation of Level 3 instruments requires significant judgment by the third-party pricing vendors and/or management. The third-party pricing vendors and/or management rely on inputs such as market price quotations from market makers (either market or indicative levels), original transaction price, recent transactions in the same or similar instruments, and changes in financial ratios or cash flows to determine fair value. Level 3 instruments may also be discounted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, with the amount of such discount estimated by the third-party pricing vendors in the absence of market information. Assumptions used by the third-party pricing vendors due to lack of observable inputs may significantly impact the resulting fair value and therefore the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. \n\n32\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nThe Company’s valuation committee reviews all valuations that are based on pricing information received from third-party pricing vendors. As part of this review, prices are compared against other pricing or input data points in the marketplace, along with internal valuation expertise, to ensure the pricing is reasonable. In addition, the Company performs back-testing of pricing information to validate price information and identify any pricing trends of a third-party pricing vendors.\n\nIn determining fair value, third-party pricing vendors use various valuation approaches, including market and income approaches. Inputs that are used in determining fair value of an instrument may include pricing information, credit data, volatility statistics, and other factors. In addition, inputs can be either observable or unobservable.\n\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary by instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of instrument, whether the instrument is new and not yet established in the marketplace and other characteristics particular to the instrument. The third-party pricing vendor uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market dislocations. In periods of market dislocation, the availability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified to or from various levels within the fair value hierarchy.\n\nSecurities that are priced using third-party broker quotations are valued at the bid price (in the case of long positions) or the ask price (in the case of short positions) at the close of trading on the date as of which value is determined. Exchange-traded securities for which no bid or ask price is available are valued at the last traded price. OTC derivative contracts, including interest rate swap and swaption agreements, are valued by the Company using observable inputs, specifically quotations received from third-party brokers. Exchange-traded derivative instruments, including futures and options on futures, are valued based on quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\n\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of the Company’s Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\n\nThree Months Ended  \n---  \nSeptember 30, 2024  \n(in thousands)| Available-For-Sale Securities| Mortgage Servicing Rights| Interest Rate Lock Commitments  \nBeginning of period level 3 fair value| $| 3,942 | $| 3,065,415 | $| —  \nGains (losses) included in net (loss) income:  \nRealized| (147)| (39,521)| —  \nUnrealized| — | (1)| (93,828)| (2)| 478 | (3)  \nReversal of provision for credit losses| 11 | — | —  \nNet gains (losses) included in net (loss) income| (136)| (133,349)| 478  \nOther comprehensive income| 53 | — | —  \nPurchases/additions| — | 43,254 | —  \nSales| — | (91,103)| —  \nSettlements| — | 87 | —  \nGross transfers into level 3| — | — | —  \nGross transfers out of level 3| — | — | —  \nEnd of period level 3 fair value| $| 3,859 | $| 2,884,304 | $| 478  \nChange in unrealized gains or losses for the period included in earnings for assets held at the end of the reporting period| $| — | (4)| $| (65,594)| (5)| $| 478 | (6)  \nChange in unrealized gains or losses for the period included in other comprehensive income (loss) for assets held at the end of the reporting period| $| 53 | $| — | $| —  \n  \n33\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nNine Months Ended  \n---  \nSeptember 30, 2024  \n(in thousands)| Available-For-Sale Securities| Mortgage Servicing Rights| Interest Rate Lock Commitments  \nBeginning of period level 3 fair value| $| 4,150 | $| 3,052,016 | $| —  \nGains (losses) included in net (loss) income:  \nRealized| (438)| (145,969)| —  \nUnrealized| — | (1)| 775 | (2)| 478 | (3)  \nReversal of provision for credit losses| (100)| — | —  \nNet gains (losses) included in net (loss) income| (538)| (145,194)| 478  \nOther comprehensive income| 247 | — | —  \nPurchases/additions| — | 87,390 | —  \nSales| — | (109,284)| —  \nSettlements| — | (624)| —  \nGross transfers into level 3| — | — | —  \nGross transfers out of level 3| — | — | —  \nEnd of period level 3 fair value| $| 3,859 | $| 2,884,304 | $| 478  \nChange in unrealized gains or losses for the period included in earnings for assets held at the end of the reporting period| $| — | (4)| $| 9,505 | (5)| $| 478 | (6)  \nChange in unrealized gains or losses for the period included in other comprehensive income (loss) for assets held at the end of the reporting period| $| (535)| $| — | $| —  \n  \n____________________\n\n(1)The change in unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities accounted for under the fair value option was recorded in gain (loss) on investment securities on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n\n(2)The change in unrealized gains or losses on MSR was recorded in (loss) gain on servicing asset on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n\n(3)The change in unrealized gains or losses on IRLCs was recorded in gain on mortgage loans held-for-sale on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)\n\n(4)The change in unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities accounted for under the fair value option that were held at the end of the reporting period was recorded in gain (loss) on investment securities on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n\n(5)The change in unrealized gains or losses on MSR that were held at the end of the reporting period was recorded in (loss) gain on servicing asset on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n\n(6)The change in unrealized gains or losses on IRLCs that were held at the end of the reporting period was recorded in gain on mortgage loans held-for-sale on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n\nNo transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 were made during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Transfers between Levels are deemed to take place on the first day of the reporting period in which the transfer has taken place.\n\nThe Company used multiple third-party pricing vendors in the fair value measurement of its Level 3 AFS securities. The significant unobservable inputs used by the third-party pricing vendors included expected default, severity and discount rate. Significant increases (decreases) in any of the inputs in isolation may result in significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.\n\n34\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nThe Company also used multiple third-party pricing vendors in the fair value measurement of its Level 3 MSR. The tables below present information about the significant unobservable market data used by the third-party pricing vendors as inputs into models utilized to inform their best estimates of the fair value measurement of the Company’s MSR classified as Level 3 fair value assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024  \n---  \nUnobservable Input| Range| Weighted Average (1)  \nConstant prepayment speed| 5.9%| -| 7.3%| 6.6%  \nOption-adjusted spread| 5.2%| -| 8.7%| 5.4%  \nPer loan annual cost to service| $67.80| -| $81.74| $68.56  \n  \nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \nUnobservable Input| Range| Weighted Average (1)  \nConstant prepayment speed| 5.0%| -| 6.9%| 6.2%  \nOption-adjusted spread| 4.8%| -| 8.6%| 5.3%  \nPer loan annual cost to service| $66.31| -| $81.30| $68.27  \n  \n___________________\n\n(1)Calculated by averaging the weighted average significant unobservable inputs used by the multiple third-party pricing vendors in the fair value measurement of MSR.\n\nThe Company determines fair value of its Level 3 IRLCs based on valuation models that incorporate the estimated pull-through rate, which is considered a significant unobservable input. The Company did not hold any IRLCs at December 31, 2023. The table below presents information about the pull-through rates used in the valuation of IRLCs at September 30, 2024:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024  \n---  \nUnobservable Input| Range| Weighted Average (1)  \nPull-through rate| 59.3%| -| 97.0%| 80.2%  \n  \n___________________\n\n(1)Calculation utilizes underlying loan principal balance for weighting purposes.\n\nCertain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment. Upon the occurrence of certain events, the Company re-measures the fair value of long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, operating lease right of use assets, intangible assets and goodwill if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current period. No instances requiring re-measurement of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis occurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nIn accordance with ASC 820, the Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, for which fair value can be estimated.\n\nThe following describes the Company’s methods for estimating the fair value for financial instruments.\n\n•AFS securities, MSR, mortgage loans held-for-sale and derivative assets and liabilities are recurring fair value measurements; carrying value equals fair value. See discussion of valuation methods and assumptions within the Fair Value Measurements section of this Note 12.\n\n•Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash have a carrying value which approximates fair value because of the short maturities of these instruments. The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these assets as Level 1.\n\n•Reverse repurchase agreements have a carrying value which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these assets as Level 2.\n\n35\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\n•The carrying value of repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities and warehouse facilities that mature in less than one year generally approximates fair value due to the short maturities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $650.0 million under repurchase agreements and $1.0 billion under revolving credit facilities that are considered long-term. The Company’s long-term repurchase agreements and revolving credit facilities have floating rates based on an index plus a spread and the credit spread is typically consistent with those demanded in the market. Accordingly, the interest rates on these borrowings are at market and thus carrying value approximates fair value. The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these liabilities as Level 2.\n\n•Term notes payable are recorded at outstanding principal balance, net of any unamortized deferred debt issuance costs. In determining the fair value of term notes payable, management judgment may be used to arrive at fair value that considers prices obtained from third-party pricing vendors, broker quotes received and other applicable market data. If observable market prices are not available or insufficient to determine fair value due principally to illiquidity in the marketplace, then fair value is based upon internally developed models that are primarily based on observable market-based inputs but also include unobservable market data inputs (including prepayment speeds, delinquency levels, and credit losses). The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these liabilities as Level 2.\n\n•Convertible senior notes are carried at their unpaid principal balance, net of any unamortized deferred issuance costs. The Company estimates the fair value of its convertible senior notes using the market transaction price nearest to September 30, 2024. The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these assets as Level 2.\n\nThe following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values of assets and liabilities that are required to be recorded or disclosed at fair value at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \n(in thousands)| Carrying Value| Fair Value| Carrying Value| Fair Value  \nAssets:  \nAvailable-for-sale securities| $| 8,506,102 | $| 8,506,102 | $| 8,327,149 | $| 8,327,149  \nMortgage servicing rights| $| 2,884,304 | $| 2,884,304 | $| 3,052,016 | $| 3,052,016  \nMortgage loans held-for-sale| $| 3,344 | $| 3,344 | $| 332 | $| 332  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 522,581 | $| 522,581 | $| 729,732 | $| 729,732  \nRestricted cash| $| 89,125 | $| 89,125 | $| 65,101 | $| 65,101  \nDerivative assets| $| 12,572 | $| 12,572 | $| 85,291 | $| 85,291  \nReverse repurchase agreements| $| 359,180 | $| 359,180 | $| 284,091 | $| 284,091  \nOther assets| $| 31,283 | $| 31,283 | $| 31,373 | $| 31,373  \nLiabilities:  \nRepurchase agreements| $| 8,763,400 | $| 8,763,400 | $| 8,020,207 | $| 8,020,207  \nRevolving credit facilities| $| 999,171 | $| 999,171 | $| 1,329,171 | $| 1,329,171  \nWarehouse facilities| $| 3,017 | $| 3,017 | $| — | $| —  \nTerm notes payable| $| — | $| — | $| 295,271 | $| 289,653  \nConvertible senior notes| $| 259,815 | $| 257,994 | $| 268,582 | $| 254,232  \nDerivative liabilities| $| 16,764 | $| 16,764 | $| 21,506 | $| 21,506  \n  \nNote 13.

The VFN is collateralized by the Company’s MSR. As of December 31, 2023, MSR repurchase agreements of $58.6 million were secured by a portion of the term notes issued in connection with the Company’s securitization of MSR and repurchased by the Company. Prior to their maturity and repayment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the term notes were collateralized by the Company’s MSR.\n\nAlthough the transactions under repurchase agreements represent committed borrowings until maturity, the respective lender retains the right to mark the underlying collateral to fair value.

The Company does not anticipate any defaults by its repurchase agreement counterparties. There can be no assurance, however, that any such default or defaults will not occur.\n\nNote 14. Revolving Credit Facilities\n\nTo finance MSR assets and related servicing advance obligations, the Company has entered into revolving credit facilities collateralized by the value of the MSR and/or servicing advances pledged.

Term Notes Payable\n\nPrior to its maturity and repayment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the debt issued in connection with the Company’s on-balance sheet MSR securitization was classified as term notes payable. Term notes payable were carried at outstanding principal balance, net of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance of the Company’s term notes was $295.8 million and the balance net of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs was $295.3 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s outstanding term notes payable had a weighted average interest rate of 8.27% and weighted average remaining maturity of 0.5 years. At December 31, 2023, the Company pledged MSR with a carrying value of $397.9 million and weighted average underlying loan coupon of 3.32% as collateral for term notes payable. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, $0.2 million of cash was held in restricted accounts as collateral for the future payment obligations of outstanding term notes payable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company’s outstanding term notes matured and were repaid in full.\n\nNote 17. Convertible Senior Notes\n\nThe Company’s convertible senior notes are unsecured, pay interest semiannually at a rate of 6.25% per annum and are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of the Company’s common stock. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the notes had a conversion rate of 33.8752 and 33.8752 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, respectively. The notes will mature in January 2026, unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. \n\nThe Company does not have the right to redeem its convertible senior notes prior to maturity, but may repurchase the notes in open market or privately negotiated transactions at the same or differing price without giving prior notice to or obtaining any consent of the holders. The Company may also be required to repurchase the notes from holders under certain circumstances. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased $10.0 million principal amount of its convertible senior notes in open market transactions for an aggregate cost of $9.7 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased $15.6 million principal amount of its convertible senior notes in open market transactions for an aggregate cost of $13.2 million. The difference between the consideration transferred and the carrying value of the convertible notes repurchased resulted in a gain of $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 recorded within the other income line item on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The Company did not repurchase any of its convertible senior notes during the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\n\n39\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $261.9 million and $271.9 million principal amount of convertible senior notes, respectively, remained outstanding. The outstanding amount due on the notes as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $259.8 million and $268.6 million, respectively, net of unamortized deferred issuance costs.\n\nNote 18. Commitments and Contingencies \n\nThe following represent the material commitments and contingencies of the Company as of September 30, 2024:\n\nLegal and regulatory. The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely involved in numerous legal and regulatory proceedings, including but not limited to judicial, arbitration, regulatory and governmental proceedings related to matters that arise in connection with the conduct of the Company’s business. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation and may consist of a variety of claims, including common law tort and contract claims, consumer protection-related claims and claims under other laws and regulations. Any legal proceedings or actions brought against the Company may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, business improvement orders, consent orders, supervisory agreements, restrictions on business activities, or other results adverse to the Company, which could materially and negatively affect its business. The Company seeks to resolve all litigation and regulatory matters in the manner management believes is in the best interest of the Company and contests liability, allegations of wrongdoing, and, where applicable, the amount of damages or scope of any penalties or other relief sought as appropriate in each pending matter. Under ASC 450, Contingencies, or ASC 450, liabilities are established for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts established or the range of reasonably possible loss disclosed for those claims.\n\nAs previously disclosed, on July 15, 2020, the Company provided PRCM Advisers LLC with a notice of termination of the Management Agreement for “cause” in accordance with Section 15(a) of the Management Agreement. The Company terminated the Management Agreement for “cause” on the basis of certain material breaches and certain events of gross negligence on the part of PRCM Advisers in the performance of its duties under the Management Agreement. On July 21, 2020, PRCM Advisers filed a complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, or the Court. Subsequently, Pine River Domestic Management L.P. and Pine River Capital Management L.P. were added as plaintiffs to the matter. As amended, the complaint, or the Federal Complaint, alleges, among other things, the misappropriation of trade secrets in violation of both the Defend Trade Secrets Act and New York common law, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unfair competition and business practices, unjust enrichment, conversion, and tortious interference with contract. The Federal Complaint seeks, among other things, an order enjoining the Company from making any use of or disclosing PRCM Advisers’ trade secret, proprietary, or confidential information; damages in an amount to be determined at a hearing and/or trial; disgorgement of the Company’s wrongfully obtained profits; and fees and costs incurred by the plaintiffs in pursuing the action. The Company has filed its answer to the Federal Complaint and made counterclaims against PRCM Advisers and Pine River Capital Management L.P. On May 5, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, seeking judgment in their favor on all but one of the Company’s counterclaims and on one of the Company’s affirmative defenses. The Company opposed the motion for judgment on the pleadings. On August 10, 2023, the motion for judgment on the pleadings was granted in part and denied in part. The discovery period has ended. On November 8, 2023, the Company and the plaintiffs filed motions for summary judgment, seeking judgment in their favor on the pending claims and counterclaims. Each party opposed the other party’s motion for summary judgment. The motions for summary judgment are fully briefed. The Company’s board of directors believes the Federal Complaint is without merit and that the Company has fully complied with the terms of the Management Agreement.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements do not recognize a contingency liability or disclose a range of reasonably possible loss under ASC 450 because management does not believe that a loss or expense related to the Federal Complaint is probable or reasonably estimable. The specific factors that limit the Company’s ability to reasonably estimate a loss or expense related to the Federal Complaint are that the matter is not sufficiently advanced and the outcome of litigation is uncertain. If and when management believes losses associated with the Federal Complaint are a probable future event that may result in a loss or expense to the Company and the loss or expense is reasonably estimable, the Company will recognize a contingency liability and resulting loss in such period.\n\nBased on information currently available, management is not aware of any other legal or regulatory claims that would have a material effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and therefore no accrual is required as of September 30, 2024.\n\n40\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nNote 19. Stockholders’ Equity\n\nRedeemable Preferred Stock\n\nThe following is a summary of the Company’s series of cumulative redeemable preferred stock issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024. In the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each series of preferred stock will rank on parity with one another and rank senior to the Company’s common stock with respect to the payment of the dividends and the distribution of assets. \n\n(dollars in thousands)  \n---  \nClass of Stock| Issuance Date| Shares Issued and Outstanding| Carrying Value| Contractual Rate| Redemption Eligible Date (1)| Fixed to Floating Rate Conversion Date (2) | Floating Annual Rate (3)  \nSeries A| March 14, 2017| 5,050,221 | $| 121,971 | 8.125 | %| April 27, 2027| April 27, 2027| 3M Rate + 5.660%  \nSeries B| July 19, 2017| 10,159,200 | 245,670 | 7.625 | %| July 27, 2027| July 27, 2027| 3M Rate + 5.352%  \nSeries C| November 27, 2017| 9,661,396 | 233,826 | 7.250 | %| January 27, 2025| January 27, 2025| 3M Rate + 5.011%  \nTotal| 24,870,817 | $| 601,467  \n  \n____________________\n\n(1)Subject to the Company’s right under limited circumstances to redeem the preferred stock earlier than the redemption eligible date disclosed in order to preserve its qualification as a REIT or following a change in control of the Company. \n\n(2)The dividend rate on the fixed-to-floating rate redeemable preferred stock will remain at an annual fixed rate of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference from the issuance date up to but not including the transition date disclosed within. Effective as of the fixed-to-floating rate conversion date and onward, dividends will accumulate on a floating rate basis according to the terms disclosed in footnote (3) below.\n\n(3)On and after the fixed-to-floating rate conversion date, dividends will accumulate and be payable quarterly at a percentage of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference equal to a floating base rate plus the spread indicated with respect to each series of preferred stock. The original floating base rate applicable to each preferred series was three-month USD-LIBOR, which ceased to be published on June 30, 2023. Under the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the replacement reference rate for three-month USD-LIBOR is three-month CME Term SOFR plus a tenor spread adjustment of 0.26161%. As a result, based on the terms of the LIBOR Act, the Company expects that the floating base rate with respect to each series of preferred stock, following the applicable conversion date, will be three-month CME SOFR plus a tenor spread of 0.26161%.\n\nFor each series of preferred stock, the Company may redeem the stock on or after the redemption eligible date in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time. The Company may also purchase shares of preferred stock from time to time in the open market by tender or in privately negotiated transactions. Each series of preferred stock has a par value of $0.01 per share and a liquidation and redemption price of $25.00, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon up to, but excluding, the redemption date. Through September 30, 2024, the Company had declared and paid all required quarterly dividends on the Company’s preferred stock.\n\n41\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nPreferred Share Repurchase Program\n\nIn June 2022, the Company’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of the Company’s preferred stock, which includes each series shown in the table above under the heading Redeemable Preferred Stock. Preferred shares may be repurchased from time to time through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, pursuant to trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, or by any combination of such methods. The manner, price, number and timing of preferred share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and applicable SEC rules. The preferred share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and, subject to SEC rules, purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. The preferred share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of September 30, 2024, a total of 699,779 shares of the Company’s 8.125% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, 1,340,800 shares of the Company’s 7.625% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and 2,138,604 shares of the Company’s 7.25% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock had been repurchased by the Company under the program for an aggregate cost of $13.3 million, $25.5 million and $38.5 million, respectively, of which 35,047, 280,060 and 170,502 shares were repurchased for a total cost of $0.8 million, $6.4 million and $3.9 million, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

The difference between the consideration transferred and the carrying value of the preferred stock repurchased resulted in a gain attributable to common stockholders of $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $2.5 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2023. No preferred shares were repurchased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\n\nCommon Stock\n\nPublic Offerings\n\nOn February 6, 2023, the Company completed a public offering of 10,000,000 shares of its common stock. The underwriters purchased the shares from the Company at a price of $17.59 per share, for net proceeds to the Company of approximately $175.6 million after deducting offering expenses. The underwriters did not exercise any portion of their 30-day overallotment option to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional shares.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had 103,650,126 shares of common stock outstanding.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, 3,583 and 12,031 shares were issued for a total proceeds of $48 thousand and $0.2 million, respectively.\n\nCommon Share Repurchase Program\n\nThe Company’s common share repurchase program allows for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of 9,375,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. Common shares may be repurchased from time to time through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, or by any combination of such methods. The manner, price, number and timing of common share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and applicable SEC rules. The common share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and, subject to SEC rules, purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice.

As of September 30, 2024, a total of 3,637,028 shares of common stock had been repurchased by the Company under the program for an aggregate cost of $208.5 million, of which 593,453 shares were repurchased for a total cost of $7.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. No shares of common stock were repurchased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nAt-the-Market Offerings\n\nThe Company is party to an equity distribution agreement under which the Company is authorized to sell shares of its common stock from time to time in any method permitted by law deemed to be an “at the market” offering as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. On July 30, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the equity distribution agreement, which increased the maximum number of shares of common stock available for sale under the agreement to 15,000,000.

The Company did not sell any AFS securities with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nNote 20. Equity Incentive Plans\n\nThe Company’s 2021 Equity Incentive Plan, or the Equity Incentive Plan, provides incentive compensation to attract and retain qualified directors, officers, personnel and other parties who may provide significant services to the Company. The Equity Incentive Plan is administered by the compensation committee of the Company’s board of directors. The compensation committee has the full authority to administer and interpret the Equity Incentive Plan, to authorize the granting of awards, to determine the eligibility of potential recipients to receive an award, to determine the number of shares of common stock to be covered by each award (subject to the individual participant limitations provided in the Equity Incentive Plan), to determine the terms, provisions and conditions of each award (which may not be inconsistent with the terms of the Equity Incentive Plan), to prescribe the form of instruments evidencing awards and to take any other actions and make all other determinations that it deems necessary or appropriate in connection with the Equity Incentive Plan or the administration or interpretation thereof. In connection with this authority, the compensation committee may, among other things, establish performance goals that must be met in order for awards to be granted or to vest, or for the restrictions on any such awards to lapse.\n\nThe Equity Incentive Plan provides for grants of restricted common stock, restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance-based awards (including performance share units, or PSUs), phantom shares, dividend equivalent rights and other equity-based awards. The Equity Incentive Plan is subject to a ceiling of 4,250,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company’s Second Restated 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, or the Prior Plan, was subject to a ceiling of 1,625,000 shares of the Company’s common stock; however, following stockholder approval of the Equity Incentive Plan in May 2021, no new awards will be granted under the Prior Plan. All awards previously granted under the Prior Plan, which remained outstanding and valid in accordance with their terms, have since vested or been forfeited. \n\nThe Equity Incentive Plan allows for the Company’s board of directors to expand the types of awards available under the Equity Incentive Plan to include long-term incentive plan units in the future. If an award granted under the Equity Incentive Plan expires or terminates, the shares subject to any portion of the award that expires or terminates without having been exercised or paid, as the case may be, will again become available for the issuance of additional awards. Unless earlier terminated by the Company’s board of directors, no new award may be granted under the Equity Incentive Plan after the tenth anniversary of the date that the Equity Incentive Plan was approved by the Company’s board of directors. No award may be granted under the Equity Incentive Plan to any person who, assuming payment of all awards held by such person, would own or be deemed to own more than 9.8% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock.\n\n44\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nRestricted Stock Units\n\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to RSUs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024| 2023  \nUnits| Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Market Value| Units| Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Market Value  \nOutstanding at Beginning of Period| 613,699 | $| 19.11 | 468,632 | $| 23.54  \nGranted| 434,428 | 13.91 | 371,673 | 16.19  \nVested| (370,453)| (19.30)| (221,575)| (23.56)  \nForfeited| (3,739)| (18.52)| (5,031)| (20.20)  \nOutstanding at End of Period| 673,935 | $| 15.65 | 613,699 | $| 19.11  \n  \nThe estimated fair value of RSUs on grant date is based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the NYSE on such date. The shares underlying RSUs granted to independent directors are subject to a one-year vesting period. RSUs granted to certain eligible employees vest in three equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date, as long as such grantee complies with the terms and conditions of the applicable RSU agreement. All RSUs entitle the grantee to receive dividend equivalent rights, or DERs, during the vesting period. A DER represents the right to receive a payment equal to the amount of cash dividends declared and payable on the grantee’s unvested and outstanding equity incentive awards. In the case of RSUs, DERs are paid in cash within 60 days of the quarterly dividend payment date based on the number of unvested and outstanding RSUs held by the grantee on the applicable dividend record date. In the event that an RSU is forfeited, the related DERs which have not yet been paid shall be forfeited.\n\nPerformance Share Units\n\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to PSUs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024| 2023  \nTarget Units| Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Market Value| Target Units| Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Market Value  \nOutstanding at Beginning of Period| 485,822 | $| 24.89 | 265,261 | $| 26.93  \nGranted| 292,000 | 16.19 | 222,208 | 22.47  \nVested| (60,777)| (34.68)| — | —  \nForfeited| (60,442)| (30.56)| (1,647)| (25.21)  \nOutstanding at End of Period| 656,603 | $| 19.60 | 485,822 | $| 24.89  \n  \nThe estimated fair value of PSUs on grant date is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. PSUs vest promptly following the completion of a three year performance period, as long as such grantee complies with the terms and conditions of the applicable PSU award agreement. The number of underlying shares of common stock that vest and that the grantee becomes entitled to receive at the time of vesting will be determined based on the level of achievement of certain Company performance goals during the performance period and will generally range from 0% to 200% of the target number of PSUs granted. All PSUs entitle the grantee to DERs during the vesting period, which accrue in the form of additional PSUs reflecting the value of any dividends declared on the Company’s common stock during the vesting period. In the event that a PSU is forfeited, the related accrued DERs shall be forfeited. \n\n45\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nRestricted Common Stock\n\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to restricted common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024| 2023  \nShares| Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Market Value| Shares| Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Market Value  \nOutstanding at Beginning of Period| — | $| — | 42,884 | $| 60.91  \nGranted| — | — | — | —  \nVested| — | — | (42,884)| (60.91)  \nForfeited| — | — | — | —  \nOutstanding at End of Period| — | $| — | — | $| —  \n  \nThe estimated fair value of restricted common stock on grant date is based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the NYSE on such date.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized compensation related to RSUs, PSUs and restricted common stock granted pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan and/or the Prior Plan of $1.6 million and $9.4 million, respectively.

Income Taxes\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company qualified to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As long as the Company qualifies as a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on its taxable income to the extent it annually distributes its net taxable income to stockholders, and does not engage in prohibited transactions. The Company intends to distribute 100% of its REIT taxable income and comply with all requirements to continue to qualify as a REIT. The majority of states also recognize the Company’s REIT status. The Company’s TRSs file separate tax returns and are fully taxed as standalone U.S. C corporations. It is assumed that the Company will retain its REIT status and will incur no REIT level taxation as it intends to comply with the REIT regulations and annual distribution requirements.\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a benefit from income taxes of $10.5 million and a provision for income taxes of $15.7 million, respectively. The benefit recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to net losses recognized on MSR and operating expenses, offset by net income from MSR servicing and mortgage loan origination activities incurred in the Company’s TRSs. The provision recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to net income from MSR servicing and mortgage loan origination activities, offset by net losses recognized on MSR and operating expenses incurred in the Company’s TRSs. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a provision for income taxes of $36.4 million and $52.2 million, respectively, which was primarily due to net income from MSR servicing activities and net gains recognized on MSR, offset by net losses recognized on derivative instruments and operating expenses incurred in the Company’s TRSs.\n\nBased on the Company’s evaluation, it has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements of a contingent tax liability for uncertain tax positions. Additionally, there were no amounts accrued for penalties or interest as of or during the periods presented in these condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\n47\n\n[Table of Contents](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_13)\n\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\n\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n\nNote 23.

Segment Reporting\n\nThe Company generally derives its revenues from its investment portfolio of MSR and Agency RMBS, which includes servicing fee income, float income, ancillary and other fee income, and interest income, net of premium amortization and discount accretion, and mortgage loan origination activities established primarily as a MSR portfolio defense strategy. The Company’s investment portfolio is subject to market risks, primarily interest rate risk, basis risk and prepayment risk. Management seeks to offset a portion of its Agency pool market value exposure through its investment in MSR and interest-only Agency RMBS. The Company’s strategy of pairing Agency RMBS with MSR, with a focus on managing various associated risks, including interest rate, basis, prepayment, and credit and financing risk, is intended to generate more stable performance, relative to an investment portfolio of Agency RMBS without MSR, across changing market environments. \n\nThe Company’s investment portfolio is managed as a whole and resources are allocated and financial performance is assessed by the Company’s Chief Investment Officer, its chief operating decision maker, or the CODM, based on total assets reported on the consolidated balance sheet and comprehensive income (loss) reported on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). The Company’s CODM views consolidated expense information related to interest expenses, compensation and benefits, other operating expenses and tax expenses to be significant. Consolidated comprehensive income (loss) is also used by the CODM to monitor actual results and benchmarking to that of its peers, the results of which are used to establish management’s compensation. Investment and hedging decisions are assessed collectively by the CODM, based on the inputs discussed above. Accordingly, the Company consists of a single operating and reportable segment and the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are presented as a single reportable segment.\n\nNote 25. Subsequent Events\n\nEvents subsequent to September 30, 2024 were evaluated through the date these condensed consolidated financial statements were issued and no other additional events were identified requiring further disclosure in these condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\n49\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nGeneral\n\nWe are a Maryland corporation that invests in, finances and manages MSR and Agency RMBS, and, through our operational platform, RoundPoint Mortgage Servicing LLC, or RoundPoint, we are one of the largest servicers of conventional loans in the country. We are structured as an internally-managed REIT and our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “TWO”. We seek to leverage our core competencies of understanding and managing interest rate and prepayment risk to invest in our portfolio of MSR and Agency RMBS. Our objective is to deliver more stable performance, relative to RMBS portfolios without MSR, across changing market environments, and we are acutely focused on creating sustainable stockholder value over the long term.\n\nEffective September 30, 2023, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, TH MSR Holdings LLC (formerly Matrix Financial Services Corporation), acquired RoundPoint from Freedom Mortgage Corporation after the completion of customary closing conditions and receiving the required regulatory and GSE approvals. Upon closing, all servicing and origination licenses and operational capabilities remained with RoundPoint, and RoundPoint became a wholly owned subsidiary of TH MSR Holdings. Management believes this acquisition will add value for stakeholders of Two Harbors through cost savings achieved by bringing the servicing of our MSR portfolio in-house, greater control over our MSR portfolio and the associated cash flows, and the ability to participate more fully in the mortgage finance space as opportunities arise.\n\nTH MSR Holdings holds the requisite approvals from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to own and manage MSR, which represent a contractual right to control the servicing of a mortgage loan, the obligation to service the loan in accordance with applicable laws and requirements and the right to collect a fee for the performance of servicing activities, such as collecting principal and interest from a borrower and distributing those payments to the owner of the loan. TH MSR Holdings acquires MSR from third-party originators through flow and bulk purchases, as well as through the recapture of MSR on loans in its MSR portfolio that refinance. TH MSR Holdings does not directly service mortgage loans; instead, it engages its wholly owned subsidiary, RoundPoint, to handle substantially all servicing functions for the mortgage loans underlying our MSR. Our MSR business leverages our core competencies in prepayment and interest rate risk analytics, and the MSR assets may provide offsetting risks to our Agency RMBS, hedging both interest rate and mortgage spread risk. \n\nRoundPoint has approvals from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to service residential mortgage loans, and services mortgage loans underlying TH MSR Holdings’ MSR as well as MSR owned by third parties. Late in the second quarter, RoundPoint began operating its in-house, direct-to-consumer originations platform, which was established primarily as a MSR portfolio defense strategy to retain or recapture existing borrowers by providing them with competitive refinance and purchase mortgage options. The originations platform also originates loans for new borrowers that do not currently have a mortgage loan serviced by RoundPoint and also brokers second lien loans to our borrowers. For our own MSR portfolio, adding new or recaptured MSR through our origination platform is intended to hedge faster than expected MSR prepayment speeds in a refinance environment, and requires less capital relative to acquiring MSR through flow and bulk purchases from third-party originators. In addition, origination activities are generally counter-cyclical to MSR, which provides supplementary sources of profitability to our stockholders while also hedging our MSR. RoundPoint also intends to offer a suite of ancillary and home equity products to our customers, including second lien mortgage loans.\n\nOur Agency RMBS portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed rate mortgage-backed securities backed by single-family and multi-family mortgage loans. All of our principal and interest Agency RMBS are Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgage pass-through certificates or collateralized mortgage obligations, or Ginnie Mae mortgage pass-through certificates, which are backed by the guarantee of the U.S. government. The majority of our Agency RMBS portfolio is comprised of whole pool certificates. \n\nWe seek to deploy moderate leverage as part of our investment strategy. We generally finance our Agency RMBS through short- and long-term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements. We also finance our MSR through revolving credit facilities, repurchase agreements and convertible senior notes. Additionally, we finance our origination of mortgage loans through warehouse facilities.\n\nWe have elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To qualify as a REIT we are required to meet certain investment and operating tests and annual distribution requirements. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders, do not participate in prohibited transactions and maintain our intended qualification as a REIT. However, certain activities that we may perform may cause us to earn income which will not be qualifying income for REIT purposes. We have designated certain of our subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, as defined in the Code, to engage in such activities. We also operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. Certain of our subsidiaries have obtained the requisite licenses and approvals to own and manage MSR and to originate and directly service residential mortgage loans.\n\n50\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains, or incorporates by reference, not only historical information, but also forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, and that are subject to the safe harbors created by such sections. Forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ from our beliefs, expectations, estimates, and projections and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements are not historical in nature and can be identified by words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “target,” “believe,” “intend,” “seek,” “plan,” “goals,” “future,” “likely,” “may” and similar expressions or their negative forms, or by references to strategy, plans, or intentions. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, under the caption “Risk Factors.” Other risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected are described below and may be described from time to time in reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\n\nImportant factors, among others, that may affect our actual results include:\n\n•changes in interest rates and the market value of our target assets;\n\n•changes in prepayment rates of mortgages underlying our target assets;\n\n•the state of the credit markets and other general economic conditions, particularly as they affect the price of earning assets, the credit status of borrowers and home prices;\n\n•legislative and regulatory actions affecting our business;\n\n•the availability and cost of our target assets;\n\n•the availability and cost of financing for our target assets, including repurchase agreement financing, revolving credit facilities and convertible notes;\n\n•the impact of any increases in payment delinquencies and defaults on the mortgages comprising and underlying our target assets, including additional servicing costs and servicing advance obligations on the MSR assets we own;\n\n•changes in liquidity in the market for real estate securities, the re-pricing of credit risk in the capital markets, inaccurate ratings of securities by rating agencies, rating agency downgrades of securities, and increases in the supply of real estate securities available-for-sale;\n\n•changes in the values of securities we own and the impact of adjustments reflecting those changes on our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and balance sheets, including our stockholders’ equity;\n\n•our ability to generate cash flow from our target assets;\n\n•our ability to effectively execute and realize the benefits of strategic transactions and initiatives we have pursued or may in the future pursue;\n\n•our ability to recognize the benefits of our acquisition of RoundPoint and to manage the risks associated with operating a mortgage loan servicer and originator;\n\n•our decision to terminate our Management Agreement with PRCM Advisers LLC and the ongoing litigation related to such termination;\n\n•changes in the competitive landscape within our industry, including changes that may affect our ability to attract and retain personnel;\n\n•our exposure to legal and regulatory claims, penalties or enforcement activities, including those arising from our ownership and management of MSR and prior securitization transactions;\n\n•our exposure to counterparties involved in our MSR business and prior securitization transactions and our ability to enforce representations and warranties made by them;\n\n•our ability to acquire MSR and successfully operate our seller-servicer subsidiaries;\n\n•our ability to manage various operational and regulatory risks associated with our business;\n\n•interruptions in or impairments to our communications and information technology systems;\n\n•our ability to maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting;\n\n•our ability to establish, adjust and maintain appropriate hedges for the risks in our portfolio; \n\n•our ability to maintain our REIT qualification for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and\n\n51\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\n•limitations imposed on our business due to our REIT status and our status as exempt from registration under the 1940 Act.\n\nFactors Affecting our Operating Results\n\nOur net interest income includes income from our securities portfolio, including the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts, and mortgage loans held-for-sale. Net interest income, as well as our servicing income, net of servicing costs, will fluctuate primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates, our financing costs and prepayment speeds on our assets. Interest rates, financing costs and prepayment rates vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty.\n\nFair Value Measurement\n\nA significant portion of our assets and liabilities are reported at fair value and, therefore, our condensed consolidated balance sheets and statements of comprehensive income (loss) are significantly affected by fluctuations in market prices. At September 30, 2024, approximately 88.5% of our total assets, or $11.4 billion, consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value. See Note 12 - Fair Value to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for descriptions of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models, key inputs to those models and significant assumptions utilized. Although we execute various hedging strategies to mitigate our exposure to changes in fair value, we cannot fully eliminate our exposure to volatility caused by fluctuations in market prices.\n\nAny temporary change in the fair value of our AFS securities, excluding certain AFS securities for which we have elected the fair value option, is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and does not impact our reported income (loss) for U.S. GAAP purposes, or GAAP net income (loss). However, changes in the provision for credit losses on AFS securities are recognized immediately in GAAP net income (loss). Our GAAP net income (loss) is also affected by fluctuations in market prices on the remainder of our financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, including interest rate swap and swaption agreements and certain other derivative instruments (i.e., Agency to-be-announced securities, or TBAs, options on TBAs, futures, options on futures, inverse interest-only securities, interest rate lock commitments and forward loan sale commitments), which are accounted for as derivative trading instruments under U.S. GAAP, fair value option elected AFS securities, MSR and mortgage loans held-for-sale.\n\nWe have numerous internal controls in place to help ensure the appropriateness of fair value measurements. Significant fair value measures are subject to detailed analytics and management review and approval. Our entire MSR and Agency RMBS investment portfolio reported at fair value is priced by third-party brokers and/or by independent pricing vendors. We generally receive three or more broker and vendor quotes on pass-through Agency P&I RMBS, and generally receive multiple broker or vendor quotes on all other securities, including interest-only and inverse interest-only Agency RMBS. We also receive multiple vendor quotes for the MSR in our investment portfolio. For Agency RMBS, the third-party pricing vendors and brokers use pricing models that commonly incorporate such factors as coupons, primary and secondary mortgage rates, rate reset periods, issuer, prepayment speeds, credit enhancements and expected life of the security. For MSR, vendors use pricing models that generally incorporate observable inputs such as principal balance, note rate, geographical location, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, FICO, appraised value and other loan characteristics, along with observed market yields and trading levels. Pricing vendors will customarily incorporate servicing fee, ancillary income, and earnings rate on escrow as observable inputs. Unobservable or model-driven inputs include forecast per loan annual cost to service, forecast cumulative defaults, default curve, forecast loss severity and forecast voluntary prepayment.\n\nWe evaluate the prices we receive from both third-party brokers and pricing vendors by comparing those prices to actual purchase and sale transactions, our internally modeled prices calculated based on market observable rates and credit spreads, and to each other both in current and prior periods. We review and may challenge valuations from third-party brokers and pricing vendors to ensure that such quotes and valuations are indicative of fair value as a result of this analysis. We then estimate the fair value of each security based upon the median of the final broker quotes received, and we estimate the fair value of MSR based upon the average of prices received from third-party vendors, subject to internally-established hierarchy and override procedures.\n\nWe utilize “bid side” pricing for our Agency RMBS and, as a result, certain assets, especially the most recent purchases, may realize a markdown due to the “bid-offer” spread. To the extent that this occurs on available-for-sale securities not accounted for under the fair value option, any economic effect of this would be reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss. \n\nConsiderable judgment is used in forming conclusions and estimating inputs to our Level 3 fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs such as interest rate movements, prepayments speeds, credit losses and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate. Changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements. Accordingly, there is no assurance that our estimates of fair value are indicative of the amounts that would be realized on the ultimate sale or exchange of these assets. At September 30, 2024, 22.4% of our total assets were classified as Level 3 fair value assets.\n\n52\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain judgments and assumptions, based on information available at the time of our preparation of the financial statements, in determining accounting estimates used in preparation of the statements. Accounting estimates are considered critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates reasonably could have been used in the reporting period or changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period that would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our most critical accounting policies involve our fair valuation of AFS securities, MSR and derivative instruments.\n\nThe methods used by us to estimate fair value for AFS securities, MSR and derivative instruments may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair value. Furthermore, while we believe that our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies, or assumptions, to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. We use prices obtained from third-party pricing vendors or broker quotes deemed indicative of market activity and current as of the measurement date, which in periods of market dislocation, may have reduced transparency. For more information on our fair value measurements, see Note 12 - Fair Value to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Additionally, the key economic assumptions and sensitivity of the fair value of MSR to immediate adverse changes in these assumptions are presented in Note 6 - Servicing Activities to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\nMarket Conditions and Outlook\n\nInterest rates fell and the yield curve steepened in the third quarter of 2024 with the Federal Reserve, or the Fed, cutting rates by 50 basis points at their September 2024 meeting. Reports on inflation showed further progress towards the Fed’s two percent target and signs of gradual cooling of the labor market gave the Fed enough evidence to cut rates for the first time in this cycle. Prior to the September meeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had characterized rates as being clearly restrictive, and a 50 basis point cut, in Powell’s words, was “a good strong start” in getting rates back to neutral in order to avoid a rapid deterioration in the labor market. Updated Fed projections showed another 50 basis points in cuts for 2024 (for a total of 100 basis points), followed by another 100 basis points in 2025. At the start of the third quarter, market expectations were for 50 basis points in cuts for all of 2024, marking another quarter of rapidly changing forecasts for the short-end of the yield curve. Ultimately, the 10-year Treasury yield finished the quarter 62 basis points lower at 3.75% while the 2-year Treasury yield fell by 111 basis points to 3.64%, resulting in the first positively sloped curve between 2-year and 10-year Treasury notes since 2022.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of the Fed guiding the economy towards a soft landing scenario together with lower interest rates, risk assets performed well over the quarter. The S&P 500 was higher by about 5.5%, and with interest rates falling and the yield curve steepening, demand remained high for fixed-income assets. Our preferred implied volatility gauge, 2-year options on 10-year rates, decreased from 104 to 94 basis points on an annualized basis, close to its lowest level for 2024. The nominal spread on current coupon RMBS finished 20 basis points tighter at +107 to the Treasury curve, while the option-adjusted spread finished 6 basis points tighter at +18. Current coupon nominal spreads remained wide compared to the longer-term non-QE average of 83 basis points, while option-adjusted spreads finished tighter to the longer-term average of 29 basis points. Hedged mortgage performance varied across coupons, with longer duration lower coupons outperforming while higher coupons were negatively impacted by the rapid decline in rates and increased concerns over prepayments. With regard to supply, projected 2024 net supply of Agency RMBS is running at approximately a $200 billion pace, similar to 2023.\n\nPrimary mortgage rates dropped about 75 basis points in the third quarter to just above 6%, which garnered attention from the media and spurred an uptick in prepayments for high coupon originations from the last two years. Overall constant prepayment rates, or CPRs, for 30-year Agency RMBS increased 8% quarter-on-quarter to 6.5% CPR in the October 2024 report (reflecting September 2024 activity). Prepayments have begun to display a bifurcated pattern: they are speeding up for those newer high coupon mortgages but they continue to be very slow for the locked-in, low coupon COVID-era borrowers. Because of this, our MSR portfolio has not noticeably responded to the decrease in mortgage rates as the quarterly prepayment rate was unchanged at 5.3%.\n\nThe housing market remains in a state of gridlock. Exiting home sales have slowed, running behind the pace of 2023 and projected to be the weakest year in almost two decades. Inventory has begun to climb off of very low levels and homes are sitting on the market longer. Many sellers withdraw listings that don't sell and are content to keep their low rate mortgages rather than sell for a price below market. Home prices appear to be headed toward a small gain for 2024 compared to 2023.\n\n53\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nRMBS funding markets remained stable and liquid throughout the quarter with ample financing being readily available. Spreads for repurchase agreements widened with financing for RMBS between SOFR plus 24 to 28 basis points. The widening was primarily due to the uncertainty of the Fed’s actions in September. At quarter-end, bank balance sheets were temporarily tight owing to a number of factors that included settlements of auctioned Treasury securities as well as banks managing quarter-end reporting metrics. Post quarter-end, liquidity and balance sheet room quickly returned easing financing conditions. Similar effects may occur at year-end and we will seek to minimize our exposure to year-end funding pressures.\n\nThe volume of MSR sales continued to normalize from the record volumes of the past few years. This quarter brought approximately $40 billion UPB of supply, bringing the year-to-date total to about $305 billion, about 70% of the pace of 2023. Traded prices have held steady with the supply being easily absorbed by a deep pool of buyers including both banks and non-banks. The number of banks offering MSR financing has broadened and the increased competition has led to a compression in financing spreads. Additionally, we saw the first MSR financing securitizations of the past two years as spreads for the securities returned to sub-300 basis point spreads to SOFR.\n\nLooking ahead, we continue to see attractive levered returns on our portfolio composed of Agency MSR and RMBS. Despite the recent tightening of RMBS spreads, nominal spreads are still wider than long-term history, reflecting continued higher than average implied volatility. On an option-adjusted spread basis, RMBS look less compelling, which indicates that spread tightening will need to be driven by increased demand (most likely by depository institutions) and/or further declines in volatility. Both of these factors will be most influenced by the quantity and timing of more cuts in rates by the Fed, which themselves remain data dependent. We expect that the MSR market will continue to be stable and well supported given the overall demand for the asset class. Despite mortgage rates declining, our MSR portfolio, with an average mortgage rate of 3.43% remains far out of the money with only 1% of the underlying mortgage loans 50 basis points or more below current mortgage rates. Barring a significant decline in mortgage rates, housing turnover will remain the key driver for prepayments of our MSR. Turnover typically slows in the fall and winter months, hence we expect prepayment speeds to decline modestly over the fourth quarter, providing a tailwind for our MSR performance. For the small population of loans that can be refinanced, RoundPoint is now offering refinance opportunities to mortgagors on our platform which should mitigate the impact of rising prepayment rates and protect the MSR’s asset value.\n\nThe following table provides the carrying value of our investment portfolio by asset type:\n\n(dollars in thousands)| September 30,2024| December 31,2023  \n---|---|---  \nAgency RMBS| $| 8,514,041 | 74.7 | %| $| 8,335,245 | 73.2 | %  \nMortgage servicing rights| 2,884,304 | 25.3 | %| 3,052,016 | 26.8 | %  \nOther| 3,859 | — | %| 4,150 | — | %  \nTotal| $| 11,402,204 | $| 11,391,411   \n  \nPrepayment speeds and volatility due to interest rates \n\nOur portfolio is subject to market risks, primarily interest rate risk and prepayment risk. We seek to offset a portion of our Agency pool market value exposure through our MSR and interest-only Agency RMBS portfolios. During periods of decreasing interest rates with rising prepayment speeds, the market value of our Agency pools generally increases and the market value of our interest-only securities and MSR generally decreases. The inverse relationship occurs when interest rates rise and prepayments fall. Average prepayment speeds for our overall portfolio remained relatively consistent with the prior quarter due primarily to the bifurcated pattern discussed above. In addition to changes in interest rates, changes in home price performance, key employment metrics and government programs, among other macroeconomic factors, can affect prepayment speeds. We believe our active portfolio management approach, including our asset selection process, positions us to respond to a variety of market scenarios. Although we are unable to predict future interest rate movements, our strategy of pairing MSR with Agency RMBS, with a focus on managing various associated risks, including interest rate, prepayment, credit, mortgage spread and financing risk, is intended to generate stable performance, relative to RMBS portfolios without MSR, with a low level of sensitivity to changes in the yield curve, prepayments and interest rate cycles. \n\nThe following table provides the three-month average CPR experienced by our Agency RMBS and MSR during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and the four immediately preceding quarters:\n\nThree Months Ended  \n---  \nSeptember 30,2024| June 30,2024| March 31,2024| December 31,2023| September 30,2023  \nAgency RMBS| 7.2 | %| 7.3 | %| 4.8 | %| 5.2 | %| 6.5 | %  \nMortgage servicing rights| 5.3 | %| 5.3 | %| 3.9 | %| 3.8 | %| 4.9 | %  \n  \n54\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nOur Agency RMBS are primarily collateralized by pools of fixed-rate mortgage loans. Our Agency portfolio also includes securities with implicit prepayment protection, including lower loan balances (securities collateralized by loans of less than $300,000 in initial principal balance), higher LTVs (securities collateralized by loans with LTVs greater than or equal to 80%), certain geographic concentrations, loans secured by investor-owned properties and lower FICO scores. Our overall allocation of Agency RMBS and holdings of pools with specific characteristics are viewed in the context of our aggregate portfolio strategy, including MSR and related derivative hedging instruments. Additionally, the selection of securities with certain attributes is driven by the perceived relative value of the securities, which factors in the opportunities in the marketplace, the cost of financing and the cost of hedging interest rate, prepayment, credit and other portfolio risks. Accordingly, our Agency RMBS capital allocation reflects management’s flexible approach to investing in the marketplace.\n\nThe following tables provide the carrying value of our Agency RMBS portfolio by underlying mortgage loan rate type:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands)| Principal/ Current Face| Carrying Value| Weighted Average CPR (1)| % Prepayment Protected| Gross Weighted Average Coupon Rate| Amortized Cost| Allowance for Credit Losses| Weighted Average Loan Age (months)  \nAgency RMBS AFS:  \n30-Year Fixed:  \n≤ 2.5%| $| — | $| — | — | %| — | %| — | %| $| — | $| — | —   \n3.0%| 225,307 | 203,422 | 6.3 | %| 85.6 | %| 3.7 | %| 200,225 | — | 35   \n3.5%| 61,984 | 57,791 | 3.4 | %| 71.8 | %| 4.2 | %| 54,562 | — | 33   \n4.0%| 598,568 | 577,359 | 6.3 | %| 100.0 | %| 4.6 | %| 590,109 | — | 52   \n4.5%| 2,176,867 | 2,160,730 | 7.0 | %| 100.0 | %| 5.1 | %| 2,225,267 | — | 49   \n5.0%| 1,800,755 | 1,813,816 | 6.3 | %| 100.0 | %| 5.8 | %| 1,834,228 | — | 30   \n5.5%| 1,170,088 | 1,190,085 | 5.2 | %| 99.8 | %| 6.4 | %| 1,180,221 | — | 27   \n6.0%| 1,091,580 | 1,122,918 | 14.0 | %| 96.0 | %| 6.9 | %| 1,115,566 | — | 23   \n≥ 6.5%| 751,112 | 782,336 | 7.5 | %| 100.0 | %| 7.5 | %| 772,628 | — | 8   \n7,876,261 | 7,908,457 | 7.6 | %| 98.8 | %| 5.9 | %| 7,972,806 | — | 33   \nOther P&I| 560,987 | 569,874 | 0.1 | %| — | %| 5.4 | %| 557,577 | — | 12   \nInterest-only| 501,846 | 23,912 | 7.0 | %| — | %| 5.4 | %| 29,209 | (2,546)| 169   \nAgency Derivatives| 142,011 | 11,798 | 8.3 | %| — | %| 6.6 | %| 15,161 | — | 233   \nTotal Agency RMBS| $| 9,081,105 | $| 8,514,041 | 91.8 | %| $| 8,574,753 | $| (2,546)  \n  \n55\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands)| Principal/ Current Face| Carrying Value| Weighted Average CPR (1)| % Prepayment Protected| Gross Weighted Average Coupon Rate| Amortized Cost| Allowance for Credit Losses| Weighted Average Loan Age (months)  \nAgency RMBS AFS:  \n30-Year Fixed:  \n≤ 2.5%| $| 420,720 | $| 359,801 | 3.6 | %| — | %| 3.3 | %| $| 359,188 | $| — | 30   \n3.0%| 237,874 | 211,852 | 2.6 | %| 85.4 | %| 3.7 | %| 210,850 | — | 26   \n3.5%| 125,647 | 115,675 | 2.0 | %| 84.9 | %| 4.3 | %| 113,092 | — | 22   \n4.0%| 503,451 | 479,715 | 5.2 | %| 100.0 | %| 4.6 | %| 508,294 | — | 49   \n4.5%| 2,331,021 | 2,281,535 | 5.2 | %| 100.0 | %| 5.1 | %| 2,384,460 | — | 40   \n5.0%| 2,084,422 | 2,078,510 | 3.6 | %| 100.0 | %| 5.8 | %| 2,125,950 | — | 21   \n5.5%| 1,358,288 | 1,370,920 | 5.4 | %| 99.8 | %| 6.4 | %| 1,371,534 | — | 18   \n6.0%| 779,560 | 795,963 | 6.1 | %| 99.8 | %| 6.9 | %| 799,184 | — | 17   \n≥ 6.5%| 8,448 | 8,853 | 7.4 | %| 97.8 | %| 7.8 | %| 9,084 | — | 249   \n7,849,431 | 7,702,824 | 4.7 | %| 94.7 | %| 5.5 | %| 7,881,636 | — | 28   \nOther P&I| 572,302 | 569,077 | 0.8 | %| — | %| 5.3 | %| 564,336 | — | 9   \nInterest-only| 840,723 | 51,098 | 5.3 | %| — | %| 4.3 | %| 58,567 | (3,619)| 100   \nAgency Derivatives| 163,735 | 12,246 | 8.0 | %| — | %| 6.7 | %| 17,814 | — | 225   \nTotal Agency RMBS| $| 9,426,191 | $| 8,335,245 | 87.5 | %| $| 8,522,353 | $| (3,619)  \n  \n____________________\n\n(1)Weighted average actual one-month CPR released at the beginning of the following month based on RMBS held as of the preceding month-end.\n\nOur MSR portfolio offers attractive spreads and has many risk reducing characteristics when paired with our Agency RMBS portfolio.

In addition, we held short- and long-term borrowings under revolving credit facilities, warehouse facilities and unsecured convertible senior notes. As of September 30, 2024, the debt-to-equity ratio funding our Agency and non-Agency investment securities, MSR and related servicing advances and mortgage loans held-for-sale, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes, was 4.6:1.0.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we held $522.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $4.8 million of unpledged Agency RMBS and $3.5 million of unpledged non-Agency securities. As a result, we had an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on our unpledged securities of approximately $6.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, we held approximately $19.6 million of unpledged MSR and $5.4 million of unpledged servicing advances. Overall, on September 30, 2024, we had $60.1 million unused committed and $550.0 million unused uncommitted borrowing capacity on MSR financing facilities, and $90.7 million in unused committed borrowing capacity on servicing advance financing facilities. As of September 30, 2024, all of our mortgage loans were pledged for financing and we had $4.0 million unused committed borrowing capacity on our warehouse facilities. Generally, unused borrowing capacity may be the result of our election not to utilize certain financing, as well as delays in the timing in which funding is provided, insufficient collateral or the inability to meet lenders’ eligibility requirements for specific types of asset classes. \n\nWe also monitor exposure to our MSR counterparties. We may be required to make representations and warranties to investors in the loans underlying the MSR we own; however, some of our MSR were purchased on a bifurcated basis, meaning the representation and warranty obligations remain with the seller. If the representations and warranties we make prove to be inaccurate, we may be obligated to repurchase certain mortgage loans, which may impact the profitability of our portfolio. Although we obtain similar representations and warranties from the counterparty from which we acquired the relevant asset, if those representations and warranties do not directly mirror those we make to the investor, or if we are unable to enforce the representations and warranties against the counterparty for a variety of reasons, including the financial condition or insolvency of the counterparty, we may not be able to seek indemnification from our counterparties for any losses attributable to the breach.\n\nSummary of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n\nOur book value per common share for U.S. GAAP purposes was $14.93 at September 30, 2024, a decrease from $15.19 per common share at June 30, 2024, and a decrease from $15.21 per common share at December 31, 2023. The decline in book value for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by losses recognized on MSR and derivatives and dividends declared, offset by net servicing income and unrealized gains recognized on AFS securities. Our comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders was $19.4 million and comprehensive loss attributable to common stockholders was $34.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to comprehensive loss attributable to common stockholders of $56.8 million and $34.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,

was driven by net purchases of AFS securities with lower unamortized premiums. The decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of AFS securities for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was due to declining interest rates. The increase in cost of funds associated with the financing of AFS securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was due to rising interest rates throughout the first half of 2024.\n\nYields on reverse repurchase agreements remained consistent for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in yields on reverse repurchase agreements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was the result of rising interest rates throughout the first half of 2024. However, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, these yields were offset by the cost of financing the associated repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. We did not hold any repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe slight decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of MSR assets and related servicing advance obligations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily the result of a greater portion of MSR financing from repurchase agreements versus revolving credit facilities. Our repurchase agreements, on average, carry lower floating rate spreads than our revolving credit facilities. We have one revolving credit facility in place to finance our servicing advance obligations, which are included in other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\nLate in the second quarter of 2024, RoundPoint began operating its in-house, direct-to-consumer originations platform. Prior to the launch of originations, our mortgage loans held-for-sale consisted of a handful of loans purchased from the collateral underlying our MSR, which were not pledged for any form of financing.\n\nThe cost of funds associated with our convertible senior notes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was consistent.\n\n60\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nThe following table presents the components of the yield earned on our AFS securities portfolio as a percentage of our average amortized cost of securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nThree Months Ended| Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30,| September 30,  \n(in thousands)| 2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nGross yield/stated coupon| 5.0 | %| 4.9 | %| 4.9 | %| 4.9 | %  \nNet (premium amortization) discount accretion| (0.2)| %| (0.3)| %| (0.1)| %| (0.3)| %  \nNet yield| 4.8 | %| 4.6 | %| 4.8 | %| 4.6 | %  \n  \nNet Servicing Income\n\nThe following table presents the components of net servicing income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nThree Months Ended| Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30,| September 30,  \n(in thousands)| 2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nServicing fee income| $| 126,597 | $| 141,816 | $| 400,278 | $| 415,423   \nAncillary and other fee income| 3,928 | 476 | 12,220 | 2,236   \nFloat income| 41,207 | 36,333 | 101,582 | 89,509   \nTotal servicing income| 171,732 | 178,625 | 514,080 | 507,168   \nTotal servicing costs| 3,900 | 29,903 | 15,494 | 83,459   \nNet servicing income| $| 167,832 | $| 148,722 | $| 498,586 | $| 423,709   \n  \nThe decrease in total servicing income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to lower servicing fee income on a smaller MSR portfolio as a result of sales and runoff, offset by higher float income as a result of the higher interest rate environment and higher ancillary and other fee income as a result of the acquisition of RoundPoint. The increase in total servicing income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to higher float income as a result of the higher interest rate environment and higher ancillary and other fee income as a result of the acquisition of RoundPoint, offset by lower servicing fee income on a smaller MSR portfolio as a result of sales and runoff.\n\nPrior to the acquisition of RoundPoint, we did not directly service mortgage loans; instead, we contracted with appropriately licensed subservicers to handle substantially all servicing functions in the name of the subservicer for the mortgage loans underlying our MSR. These third-party subservicing costs and other servicing expenses directly related to our MSR portfolio are included within the servicing costs line item on our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Post-acquisition, all servicing-related expenses incurred by RoundPoint as an operating company are included within the other operating expenses line item on our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The decrease in servicing costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was the result of lower third-party subservicing fees due to the acquisition of RoundPoint.\n\nGain (Loss) On Investment Securities \n\nThe following table presents the components of gain (loss) on investment securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nThree Months Ended| Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30,| September 30,  \n(in thousands)| 2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nProceeds from sales| $| 91,115 | $| 119,095 | $| 896,520 | $| 1,694,891   \nAmortized cost of securities sold| (91,503)| (118,999)| (929,064)| (1,730,866)  \nTotal realized (losses) gains on sales| (388)| 96 | (32,544)| (35,975)  \nReversal of (provision for) credit losses| 276 | 98 | 25 | 217   \nOther| 1,495 | (665)| 490 | 48,257   \nGain (loss) on investment securities| $| 1,383 | $| (471)| $| (32,029)| $| 12,499   \n  \n61\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we make investment decisions and allocate capital in accordance with our views on the changing risk/reward dynamics in the market and in our portfolio. We do not expect to sell assets on a frequent basis, but may sell assets to reallocate capital into new assets that we believe have higher risk-adjusted returns.\n\nWe use a discounted cash flow method to estimate and recognize an allowance for credit losses on AFS securities. Subsequent adverse or favorable changes in expected cash flows are recognized immediately in earnings as a provision for or reversal of provision for credit losses (within gain (loss) on investment securities).\n\nThe majority of the “other” component of gain (loss) on investment securities is related to changes in unrealized gains (losses) on certain AFS securities for which we have elected the fair value option. Fluctuations in this line item are primarily driven by the reclassification of unrealized gains and losses to realized gains and losses upon sale, as well as changes in fair value assumptions.\n\n(Loss) Gain On Servicing Asset\n\nThe following table presents the components of (loss) gain on servicing asset for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nThree Months Ended| Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30,| September 30,  \n(in thousands)| 2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nChanges in fair value due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions used in the valuation model| $| (93,828)| $| 111,186 | $| 775 | $| 213,803   \nChanges in fair value due to realization of cash flows (runoff)| (62,481)| (63,999)| (174,239)| (172,177)  \nGains on sales| 22,960 | 20,182 | 28,270 | 19,343   \n(Loss) gain on servicing asset| $| (133,349)| $| 67,369 | $| (145,194)| $| 60,969   \n  \nThe increase in loss (decrease in gain) on servicing asset for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was driven by unfavorable change in valuation assumptions used in the fair valuation of MSR, particularly faster prepayment speeds, offset by slightly lower portfolio run-off and higher realized gains on sales of MSR. The increase in loss (decrease in gain) on servicing asset for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was driven by lower favorable change in valuation assumptions used in the fair valuation of MSR and slightly higher portfolio run-off, offset by higher realized gains on sales of MSR.\n\n(Loss) Gain On Interest Rate Swap And Swaption Agreements\n\nThe following table summarizes the net interest spread and gains and losses associated with our interest rate swap and swaption positions recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nThree Months Ended| Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30,| September 30,  \n(in thousands)| 2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nNet interest spread| $| 17,059 | $| 6,851 | $| 46,369 | $| 13,914   \nEarly termination, agreement maturation and option expiration losses| (86,310)| (5,176)| (70,032)| (23,756)  \nChange in unrealized (loss) gain on interest rate swap and swaption agreements, at fair value| (103,012)| 110,234 | (28,078)| 96,130   \n(Loss) gain on interest rate swap and swaption agreements| $| (172,263)| $| 111,909 | $| (51,741)| $| 86,288   \n  \n62\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nNet interest spread recognized for the accrual and/or settlement of the net interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps results from receiving either a floating interest rate (OIS or SOFR) or a fixed interest rate and paying either a fixed interest rate or a floating interest rate (OIS or SOFR) on positions held to economically hedge/mitigate portfolio interest rate exposure (or duration) risk. We may elect to terminate certain swaps and swaptions to align with our investment portfolio, agreements may mature or options may expire resulting in full settlement of our net interest spread asset/liability and the recognition of realized gains and losses, including early termination penalties. The change in fair value of interest rate swaps and swaptions during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was a result of changes to floating interest rates (OIS or SOFR), the swap curve and corresponding counterparty borrowing rates. Swaps and swaptions are used for purposes of hedging our interest rate exposure, and therefore, their unrealized valuation gains and losses (excluding the reversal of unrealized gains and losses to realized gains and losses upon termination, maturation or option expiration) generally offset a portion of the unrealized losses and gains recognized on our Agency RMBS AFS portfolio, which are recorded either directly to stockholders’ equity through other comprehensive income (loss) or to gain (loss) on investment securities, in the case of certain AFS securities for which we have elected the fair value option.\n\n(Loss) Gain On Other Derivative Instruments\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the total net gains (losses) recognized on other derivative instruments we hold for purposes of both hedging and non-hedging activities, principally TBAs, futures, options on futures, and inverse interest-only securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nThree Months Ended| Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \n(in thousands)| September 30,| September 30,  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nTBAs| $| 84,073 | $| (90,662)| $| (2,438)| $| (184,909)  \nFutures| (119,553)| 179,697 | 16,061 | 166,533   \nOptions on futures| — | (779)| (127)| (779)  \nInverse interest-only securities| 2,758 | (2,044)| 631 | (3,243)  \n(Loss) gain on other derivative instruments| $| (32,722)| $| 86,212 | $| 14,127 | $| (22,398)  \n  \nFor further details regarding our use of derivative instruments and related activity, refer to Note 9 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\nGain On Mortgage Loans Held-For-Sale\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the total net realized and unrealized gains (losses) recognized on mortgage loans held-for-sale and the related derivative instruments used to manage exposure to market risks primarily associated with fluctuations in interest rate risks related to our origination pipeline during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nThree Months Ended| Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \n(in thousands)| September 30,| September 30,  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nMortgage loans held-for-sale| $| 420 | $| — | $| 417 | $| —   \nInterest rate lock commitments| 478 | — | 478 | —   \nForward mortgage loan sale commitments| 29 | — | 29 | —   \nGain on mortgage loans held-for-sale| $| 927 | $| — | $| 924 | $| —   \n  \nLate in the second quarter of 2024, RoundPoint began operating its in-house, direct-to-consumer originations platform.

It also includes certain transaction expenses incurred in connection with the Company’s acquisition of RoundPoint.\n\nThe increase in total operating expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was driven by the addition of RoundPoint’s compensation, benefits, operating and loan level expenses, offset by lower expenses incurred in connection with the Company’s ongoing litigation with PRCM Advisers.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a benefit from income taxes of $10.5 million and a provision for income taxes of $15.7 million, respectively. The benefit recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to net losses recognized on MSR and operating expenses, offset by net income from MSR servicing and mortgage loan origination activities incurred in our TRSs. The provision recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to net income from MSR servicing and mortgage loan origination activities, offset by net losses recognized on MSR and operating expenses incurred in our TRSs. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a provision for income taxes of $36.4 million and $52.2 million, respectively, which was primarily due to net income from MSR servicing activities and net gains recognized on MSR, offset by net losses recognized on derivative instruments and operating expenses incurred in our TRSs.\n\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the components of other comprehensive income (loss) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nThree Months Ended| Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \n(in thousands)| September 30,| September 30,  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nUnrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities| $| 267,864 | $| (350,922)| $| 104,740 | $| (444,519)  \nRealized losses on sales of available-for-sale securities reclassified to gain (loss) on investment securities| 1,757 | — | 17,730 | 63,222   \nOther comprehensive income (loss)| $| 269,621 | $| (350,922)| $| 122,470 | $| (381,297)  \n  \n64\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nWith our accounting treatment for AFS securities, unrealized fluctuations in the market values of AFS securities, excluding certain AFS securities for which we have elected the fair value option and securities with an allowance for credit losses, are recorded directly to stockholders’ equity through other comprehensive income (loss). Additionally, we reclassify unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities in accumulated other comprehensive loss to net (loss) income upon the recognition of any realized gains and losses on sales as individual securities are sold. Fluctuations in other comprehensive income (loss) are driven by changes in fair value assumptions and the reclassification of unrealized gains and losses to realized gains and losses upon sale.\n\nFinancial Condition\n\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value\n\nThe majority of our AFS investment securities portfolio is comprised of fixed rate Agency mortgage-backed securities backed by single-family and multi-family mortgage loans.

Repurchase agreements and revolving credit facilities are collateralized by our pledge of AFS securities, derivative instruments, MSR, servicing advances and certain cash balances. Substantially all of our Agency RMBS are currently pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements. Additionally, a substantial portion of our MSR is currently pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements and revolving credit facilities, and a portion of our servicing advances have been pledged as collateral for revolving credit facilities. Warehouse facilities are collateralized by our pledge of mortgage loans for a period of up to 90 days or until they are sold to the GSEs or other third-party investors in the secondary market, typically within 30 days of origination. Substantially all of our funded mortgage loans held-for-sale are currently pledged as collateral for warehouse facilities. In connection with our securitization of MSR, a variable funding note, or VFN, was issued to one of our subsidiaries. We have one repurchase facility that is secured by the VFN, which is collateralized by our MSR. Finally, our convertible senior notes due 2026 are unsecured and pay interest semiannually at a rate of 6.25% per annum.\n\n66\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nAt September 30, 2024, borrowings under repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities, warehouse facilities and convertible senior notes had the following characteristics:\n\n(dollars in thousands)| September 30, 2024  \n---|---  \nBorrowing Type| Amount Outstanding| Weighted Average Borrowing Rate| Weighted Average Years to Maturity  \nRepurchase agreements| $| 8,763,400 | 5.40 | %| 0.3   \nRevolving credit facilities| 999,171 | 8.11 | %| 1.8   \nWarehouse facilities| 3,017 | 7.34 | %| 0.2   \nConvertible senior notes (1)| 259,815 | 6.25 | %| 1.3   \nTotal| $| 10,025,403 | 5.69 | %| 0.5   \n  \n(dollars in thousands)| September 30, 2024  \n---|---  \nCollateral Type| Amount Outstanding| Weighted Average Borrowing Rate| Weighted Average Haircut on Collateral Value  \nAgency RMBS| $| 8,107,734 | 5.20 | %| 3.7 | %  \nNon-Agency securities| 207 | 5.39 | %| 44.2 | %  \nAgency Derivatives| 5,459 | 5.88 | %| 17.2 | %  \nMortgage servicing rights| 1,589,871 | 8.08 | %| 31.1 | %  \nMortgage servicing advances| 59,300 | 7.74 | %| 12.9 | %  \nMortgage loans held-for-sale| 3,017 | 7.34 | %| — | %  \nOther (1)| 259,815 | 6.25 | %| N/A  \nTotal| $| 10,025,403 | 5.69 | %| 8.0 | %  \n  \n____________________\n\n(1)Includes unsecured convertible senior notes due 2026 paying interest semiannually at a rate of 6.25% per annum on the aggregate principal amount of $261.9 million.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the debt-to-equity ratio funding our Agency and non-Agency investment securities, MSR and related servicing advances and mortgage loans held-for-sale, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes, was 4.6:1.0. Our Agency RMBS, given their liquidity and high credit quality, are eligible for higher levels of leverage, while MSR, with less liquidity and/or more exposure to prepayment risk, utilize lower levels of leverage. Generally, our debt-to-equity ratio is directly correlated to the composition of our portfolio; typically, the higher the percentage of Agency RMBS we hold, the higher our debt-to-equity ratio will be. However, in addition to portfolio mix, our debt-to-equity ratio is a function of many other factors, including the liquidity of our portfolio, the availability and price of our financing, the diversification of our counterparties and their available capacity to finance our assets, and anticipated regulatory developments. We may alter the percentage allocation of our portfolio among our target assets depending on the relative value of the assets that are available to purchase from time to time, including at times when we are deploying proceeds from offerings we conduct. We believe the current degree of leverage within our portfolio helps ensure that we have access to unused borrowing capacity, thus supporting our liquidity and the strength of our balance sheet.\n\n67\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nThe following table provides a summary of our borrowings under repurchase agreements (excluding those collateralized by U.S. Treasuries), revolving credit facilities, warehouse facilities, term notes payable and convertible senior notes and our debt-to-equity ratios for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and the four immediately preceding quarters:\n\n(dollars in thousands)  \n---  \nFor the Three Months Ended| Quarterly Average| End of Period Balance| Maximum Balance of Any Month-End| End of Period Total Borrowings to Equity Ratio| End of Period Net Long (Short) TBA Cost Basis| End of Period Net Payable (Receivable) for Unsettled RMBS| End of Period Economic Debt-to-Equity Ratio (1)  \nSeptember 30, 2024| $| 10,028,325 | $| 10,025,403 | $| 10,061,801 | 4.6:1.0 | $| 5,060,417 | $| 85,366 | 7.0:1.0   \nJune 30, 2024| $| 9,893,287 | $| 9,973,593 | $| 9,973,593 | 4.5:1.0 | $| 4,950,762 | $| — | 6.8:1.0   \nMarch 31, 2024| $| 10,153,275 | $| 10,283,782 | $| 10,352,896 | 4.6:1.0 | $| 3,421,932 | $| (213,264)| 6.0:1.0   \nDecember 31, 2023| $| 10,449,060 | $| 9,913,231 | $| 10,984,022 | 4.5:1.0 | $| 3,170,548 | $| 196,644 | 6.0:1.0   \nSeptember 30, 2023| $| 11,058,648 | $| 11,087,145 | $| 11,138,859 | 5.2:1.0 | $| 2,147,540 | $| — | 6.3:1.0   \n  \n____________________\n\n(1)Defined as total borrowings under repurchase agreements (excluding those collateralized by U.S. Treasuries), revolving credit facilities, warehouse facilities, term notes payable and convertible senior notes, plus implied debt on net TBA cost basis and net payable (receivable) for unsettled RMBS, divided by total equity.\n\nEquity\n\nThe following table provides details of our changes in stockholders’ equity from June 30, 2024 to September 30, 2024.\n\n(in millions, except per share amounts)| Book Value| Common Shares Outstanding| Common Book Value Per Share  \n---|---|---|---  \nCommon stockholders’ equity at June 30, 2024| $| 1,573.5 | 103.6 | $| 15.19   \nNet loss| (238.5)  \nOther comprehensive income| 269.6   \nComprehensive income| 31.1   \nDividends on preferred stock| (11.8)  \nComprehensive income attributable to common stockholders| 19.3   \nDividends on common stock| (46.9)  \nOther| 1.6 | —   \nBalance before capital transactions| 1,547.5 | 103.6   \nIssuance of common stock, net of offering costs| 0.1 | —   \nCommon stockholders’ equity at September 30, 2024| $| 1,547.6 | 103.6 | $| 14.93   \nTotal preferred stock liquidation preference| 621.8   \nTotal stockholders’ equity at September 30, 2024| $| 2,169.4   \n  \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nOur liquidity and capital resources are managed and forecasted on a daily basis. We believe this ensures that we have sufficient liquidity to absorb market events that could negatively impact collateral valuations and result in margin calls. We also believe that it gives us the flexibility to manage our portfolio to take advantage of market opportunities.\n\nOur principal sources of cash consist of borrowings under repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities, warehouse facilities, payments of principal and interest we receive on our target assets, cash generated from our operating results, and proceeds from capital market transactions. We typically use cash to repay principal and interest on our borrowings, to purchase our target assets, to make dividend payments on our capital stock, and to fund our operations. To the extent that we raise additional equity capital through capital market transactions, we anticipate using cash proceeds from such transactions to purchase our target assets and for other general corporate purposes. Such general corporate purposes may include the refinancing or repayment of debt, the repurchase or redemption of common and preferred equity securities, and other capital expenditures.\n\n68\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we held $522.6 million in cash and cash equivalents available to support our operations; $11.4 billion of AFS securities, MSR, mortgage loans held-for-sale and derivative assets held at fair value; and $10.0 billion of outstanding debt in the form of repurchase agreements, borrowings under revolving credit facilities and warehouse facilities and convertible senior notes. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the debt-to-equity ratio funding our Agency and non-Agency investment securities, MSR and related servicing advances and mortgage loans held-for-sale, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes, increased from 4.5:1.0 to 4.6:1.0, which was predominantly driven by an increase in financing on Agency RMBS as a result of purchases, offset by a decrease in MSR financing as a result of MSR sales and portfolio runoff. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the debt-to-equity ratio funding our Agency and non-Agency investment securities, MSR and related servicing advances and mortgage loans held-for-sale, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes, also increased from 4.5:1.0 to 4.6:1.0, which was primarily due to a decrease in equity as a result of our financial results. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our economic debt-to-equity ratio funding our Agency and non-Agency investment securities, MSR and related servicing advances and mortgage loans held-for-sale, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes, implied debt on net TBA cost basis and net payable (receivable) for unsettled RMBS, increased from 6.8:1.0 to 7.0:1.0 and 6.0:1.0 to 7.0:1.0, respectively.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we held approximately $4.8 million of unpledged Agency RMBS and $3.5 million of unpledged non-Agency securities. As a result, we had an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged securities of approximately $6.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, we held approximately $19.6 million of unpledged MSR and $5.4 million of unpledged servicing advances. Overall, on September 30, 2024, we had $60.1 million unused committed and $550.0 million unused uncommitted borrowing capacity on MSR financing facilities, and $90.7 million in unused committed borrowing capacity on servicing advance financing facilities. As of September 30, 2024, all of our mortgage loans were pledged for financing and we had $4.0 million unused committed borrowing capacity on our warehouse facilities. Generally, unused borrowing capacity may be the result of our election not to utilize certain financing, as well as delays in the timing in which funding is provided, insufficient collateral or the inability to meet lenders’ eligibility requirements for specific types of asset classes. On a daily basis, we monitor and forecast our available, or excess, liquidity. Additionally, we frequently perform shock analyses against various market events to monitor the adequacy of our excess liquidity.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not experience any material issues accessing our funding sources. We expect ongoing sources of financing to be primarily repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities, warehouse facilities, convertible notes and similar financing arrangements. We plan to finance our assets with a moderate amount of leverage, the level of which may vary based upon the particular characteristics of our portfolio and market conditions.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had master repurchase agreements in place with 36 counterparties (lenders), the majority of which are U.S. domiciled financial institutions, and we continue to evaluate additional counterparties to manage and optimize counterparty risk. Under our repurchase agreements, we are required to pledge additional assets as collateral to our lenders when the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders, through a margin call, demand additional collateral. Lenders generally make margin calls because of a perceived decline in the value of our assets collateralizing the repurchase agreements. This may occur following the monthly principal reduction of assets due to scheduled amortization and prepayments on the underlying mortgages, or may be caused by changes in market interest rates, a perceived decline in the market value of the investments and other market factors. To cover a margin call, we may pledge additional assets or cash. At maturity, any cash on deposit as collateral is generally applied against the repurchase agreement balance, thereby reducing the amount borrowed. Should the value of our assets suddenly decrease, significant margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position.\n\n69\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nIn addition to our master repurchase agreements that fund our Agency and non-Agency securities, we have one repurchase facility and two revolving credit facilities that provide short- and long-term financing for our MSR portfolio. We also have one revolving credit facility that provides long-term financing for our servicing advances and one warehouse facility that provides short-term financing for our mortgage loans held-for-sale. A summary of our MSR, servicing advance and warehouse facilities is provided in the table below:\n\n(dollars in thousands)  \n---  \nSeptember 30, 2024  \nExpiration Date (1)| Amount Outstanding| Unused Committed Capacity (2)| Unused Uncommitted Capacity| Total Capacity| Eligible Collateral  \nMarch 31, 2026| $| 647,731 | $| 2,269 | $| 250,000 | $| 900,000 | Mortgage servicing rights  \nMarch 8, 2027| $| 292,140 | $| 57,860 | $| 150,000 | $| 500,000 | Mortgage servicing rights (3)  \nMay 22, 2026| $| 650,000 | $| — | $| 150,000 | $| 800,000 | Mortgage servicing rights (4)  \nJune 14, 2026| $| 59,300 | $| 90,700 | $| — | $| 150,000 | Mortgage servicing advances  \nAugust 19, 2025| $| 3,017 | $| 6,983 | $| — | $| 10,000 | Mortgage loans held-for-sale  \n  \n____________________\n\n(1)The facilities are set to mature on the stated expiration date, unless extended pursuant to their terms.\n\n(2)Represents unused capacity amounts to which commitment fees are charged.\n\n(3)The revolving period of this facility ceases on March 8, 2026, at which time the facility starts a 12-month amortization period.\n\n(4)This repurchase facility is secured by a VFN issued in connection with our previous securitization of MSR, which is collateralized by our MSR. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, this repurchase facility was amended to prescribe a reduction in the total capacity to $550.0 million starting December 30, 2024.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of financial covenants under our lending agreements. The following represent the most restrictive financial covenants across our lending agreements as of September 30, 2024:\n\n•Total indebtedness to tangible net worth must be less than 8.0:1.0. As of September 30, 2024, our total indebtedness to tangible net worth, as defined, was 4.9:1.0.\n\n•Cash liquidity must be greater than $200.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, our liquidity, as defined, was $522.6 million.\n\n•Net worth must be greater than the higher of $1.5 billion or 50% of the highest net worth during the 24 calendar months prior. As of September 30, 2024, 50% of the highest net worth during the 24 calendar months prior, as defined, was $1.2 billion and our net worth, as defined, was $2.2 billion.\n\nWe are also subject to additional financial covenants in connection with various other agreements we enter into in the normal course of our business. We intend to continue to operate in a manner which complies with all of our financial covenants.\n\nThe following table summarizes assets at carrying values that were pledged or restricted as collateral for the future payment obligations of repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities, warehouse facilities, term notes payable and derivative instruments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\n(in thousands)| September 30,2024| December 31,2023  \n---|---|---  \nAvailable-for-sale securities, at fair value| $| 8,416,131 | $| 8,126,028   \nMortgage servicing rights, at fair value| 2,864,729 | 3,047,890   \nMortgage loans held-for-sale, at fair value| 3,067 | —   \nRestricted cash| 13,998 | 12,575   \nDue from counterparties| 15,108 | 36,420   \nDerivative assets, at fair value| 8,148 | 11,877   \nOther assets| 86,646 | 79,749   \nTotal| $| 11,407,827 | $| 11,314,539   \n  \n70\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nAlthough we generally intend to hold our target assets as long-term investments, we may sell certain of our assets in order to manage our interest rate risk and liquidity needs, to meet other operating objectives and to adapt to market conditions. Our Agency RMBS are generally actively traded and thus, in most circumstances, readily liquid. However, certain of our assets, including MSR and mortgage loans held-for-sale, are subject to longer trade timelines, and, as a result, market conditions could significantly and adversely affect the liquidity of our assets. Any illiquidity of our assets may make it difficult for us to sell such assets if the need or desire arises. Our ability to quickly sell certain assets, such as MSR and mortgage loans, may be limited by delays encountered while obtaining certain Agency approvals required for such dispositions and may be further limited by delays due to the time period needed for negotiating transaction documents, conducting diligence, and complying with Agency requirements regarding the transfer of such assets before settlement may occur. Consequently, even if we identify a buyer for our MSR and mortgage loans, there is no assurance that we would be able to quickly sell such assets if the need or desire arises. \n\nIn addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we previously recorded our assets. Assets that are illiquid are more difficult to finance, and to the extent that we use leverage to finance assets that become illiquid, we may lose that leverage or have it reduced. Assets tend to become less liquid during times of financial stress, which is often the time that liquidity is most needed. As a result, our ability to sell assets or vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited by liquidity constraints, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWe cannot predict the timing and impact of future sales of our assets, if any. Because many of our assets are financed with repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities and warehouse facilities, a significant portion of the proceeds from sales of our assets (if any), prepayments and scheduled amortization are used to repay balances under these financing sources.\n\nThe following table provides the maturities of our repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities, warehouse facilities, term notes payable and convertible senior notes as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\n(in thousands)| September 30,2024| December 31,2023  \n---|---|---  \nWithin 30 days| $| 2,403,179 | $| 2,833,162   \n30 to 59 days| 2,180,469 | 1,918,818   \n60 to 89 days| 3,017 | 2,059,438   \n90 to 119 days| 1,173,329 | 994,789   \n120 to 364 days| 2,356,423 | 833,571   \nOne to three years| 1,908,986 | 1,273,453   \nTotal| $| 10,025,403 | $| 9,913,231   \n  \nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, our restricted and unrestricted cash balance decreased approximately $175.1 million to $611.7 million at September 30, 2024. The cash movements can be summarized by the following:\n\n•Cash flows from operating activities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities increased our cash balances by approximately $87.1 million, primarily driven by our financial results for the quarter. \n\n•Cash flows from investing activities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, investing activities decreased our cash balances by approximately $254.9 million, driven by net purchases of AFS securities and net short sales of derivative instruments, offset by net sales of MSR.\n\n•Cash flows from financing activities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, financing activities decreased our cash balance by approximately $7.3 million, primarily driven by paydowns on our revolving credit facilities and the payment of third quarter dividends, offset by an increase in both AFS securities and MSR repurchase agreement financing.\n\nInflation\n\nOur assets and liabilities are financial in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates and other factors impact our performance far more than does inflation, although inflation rates can often have a meaningful influence over the direction of interest rates. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and dividends are based upon net ordinary income and capital gains as calculated for tax purposes; in each case, our results of operations and reported assets, liabilities and equity are measured with reference to historical cost or fair value without considering inflation.\n\n71\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nWe seek to manage our risks related to the credit quality of our assets, interest rates, liquidity, prepayment speeds and market value while providing an opportunity to stockholders to realize attractive risk-adjusted total return through ownership of our capital stock. Although we do not seek to avoid risk completely, we believe that risk can be quantified from historical experience, and we seek to manage our risk levels in order to earn sufficient compensation to justify the risks we undertake and to maintain capital levels consistent with taking such risks.\n\nTo manage the risks to our portfolio, we employ portfolio-wide and asset-specific risk measurement and management processes in our daily operations. Risk management tools include software and services licensed or purchased from third parties as well as proprietary and third-party analytical tools and models. There can be no guarantee that these tools and methods will protect us from market risks.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors beyond our control. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our assets and related financing obligations. Additionally, rising interest rates are likely to have an adverse impact on the operational efficiency and, thus profitability, of our loan originations platform.\n\nSubject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we engage in a variety of interest rate risk management techniques that seek to mitigate the influence of interest rate changes on the values of our assets. We may enter into a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments to economically hedge interest rate risk or “duration mismatch (or gap)” by adjusting the duration of our floating-rate borrowings into fixed-rate borrowings to more closely match the duration of our assets. This particularly applies to borrowing agreements with maturities or interest rate resets of less than six months. Typically, the interest receivable terms (i.e., OIS or SOFR) of certain derivatives match the terms of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective conversion of the rate of the related borrowing agreement from floating to fixed. The objective is to manage the cash flows associated with current and anticipated interest payments on borrowings, as well as the ability to roll or refinance borrowings at the desired amount by adjusting the duration.\n\nTo help manage the adverse impact of interest rate changes on the value of our portfolio, our cash flows, and our loan origination pipeline (consisting of IRLCs and mortgage loans held-for-sale), we may, at times, enter into various forward contracts, including short securities, TBAs, options, futures, swaps, caps, credit default swaps, total return swaps and forward mortgage loan sale commitments. In executing on our current interest rate risk management strategy, we have entered into TBAs, interest rate swap and swaption agreements, futures, options on futures, and forward mortgage loan sale commitments. In addition, because MSR are negative duration assets, they may provide a hedge to interest rate exposure on our Agency RMBS portfolio. In hedging interest rate risk, we seek to mitigate the impact of changing interest rates on the value of our investments, improve risk-adjusted returns and, where possible, obtain a favorable spread between the yield on our assets and the cost of our financing. Our hedging methods are based on many factors, including, but not limited to, our estimates with regard to future interest rates.\n\nREIT income arising from “clearly identified” hedging transactions that are entered into to manage the risk of interest rate or price changes with respect to borrowings, including gain from the disposition of such hedging transactions, to the extent the hedging transactions hedge indebtedness incurred, or to be incurred, by the REIT to acquire or carry real estate assets, will not be treated as gross income for purposes of either the 75% or the 95% gross income tests. In general, for a hedging transaction to be “clearly identified,” (i) it must be identified as a hedging transaction before the end of the day on which it is acquired, originated, or entered into, and (ii) the items of risks being hedged must be identified “substantially contemporaneously” with entering into the hedging transaction (generally not more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction). We intend to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our qualification as a REIT, although this determination depends on an analysis of the facts and circumstances concerning each hedging transaction. We also implement part of our hedging strategy through our TRSs, which are subject to U.S. federal, state and, if applicable, local income tax.\n\nWe treat our TBAs as qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% asset test, to the extent set forth in an opinion from Sidley Austin LLP substantially to the effect that, for purposes of the 75% asset test, our ownership of a TBA should be treated as ownership of the underlying Agency RMBS. We also treat income and gains from our TBAs as qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, to the extent set forth in an opinion from Sidley Austin LLP substantially to the effect that, for purposes of the 75% gross income test, any gain recognized by us in connection with the settlement of our TBAs should be treated as gain from the sale or disposition of the underlying Agency RMBS.\n\n72\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nInterest Rate Effect on Net Interest Income\n\nOur operating results depend in large part on differences between the income earned on our assets and our cost of borrowing and hedging activities. The costs associated with our borrowings are generally based on prevailing market interest rates. During a period of rising interest rates, our borrowing costs generally will increase while the coupon interest earned on our existing portfolio of leveraged fixed-rate Agency RMBS and mortgage loans held-for-sale will remain static. Both of these factors could result in a decline in our net interest spread and net interest margin. The inverse result may occur during a period of falling interest rates. The severity of any such decline or increase in our net interest spread and net interest margin would depend on our asset/liability composition at the time, as well as the magnitude and duration of the interest rate increase or decrease.\n\nOur hedging techniques are partly based on assumed levels of prepayments of our target assets. If prepayments are slower or faster than assumed, the life of the investment will be longer or shorter, which could reduce the effectiveness of any hedging strategies we may use and may cause losses on such transactions. Hedging strategies involving the use of derivative securities are highly complex and may produce volatile returns.\n\nThe following analyses of risks are based on our experience, estimates, models and assumptions. The analysis is based on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity. Actual economic conditions or implementation of decisions may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models.\n\nWe perform interest rate sensitivity analyses on various measures of our financial results and condition by examining how our assets, financing and hedges will perform in various interest rate “shock” scenarios. Two of these measures are presented below in more detail. The first measure is change in annualized net interest income over the next 12 months, including interest spread from our interest rate swaps and float income from custodial accounts associated with our MSR. The second measure is change in value of financial position, including the value of our derivative assets and liabilities. All changes in value are measured as the change from the September 30, 2024 financial position. All projected changes in annualized net interest income are measured as the change from the projected annualized net interest income based off current performance returns.\n\nComputation of the cash flows for the rate-sensitive assets underpinning change in annualized net interest income are based on assumptions related to, among other things, prepayment speeds, yield on future acquisitions, slope of the yield curve, and size of the portfolio (for example, the assumption for prepayment speeds for Agency RMBS and MSR is that they do not change in response to changes in interest rates). Assumptions for the interest rate sensitive liabilities relate to, among other things, collateral requirements as a percentage of borrowings and amount/term of borrowing. These assumptions may not hold in practice; realized net interest income results may therefore be significantly different from the net interest income produced in scenario analyses. We also note that the uncertainty associated with the estimate of a change in net interest income is directly related to the size of interest rate move considered.\n\nComputation of results for portfolio value involves a two-step process. The first is the use of models to project how the value of interest rate sensitive instruments will change in the scenarios considered. The second, and equally important, step is the improvement of the model projections based on application of our experience in assessing how current market and macroeconomic conditions will affect the prices of various interest rate sensitive instruments. Judgment is best applied to localized (less than 25 basis points, or bps) interest rate moves. The more an instantaneous interest rate move exceeds 25 bps, the greater the likelihood that accompanying market events are significant enough to warrant reconsideration of interest rate sensitivities. As with net interest income, the uncertainty associated with the estimate of change in portfolio value is therefore directly related to the size of interest rate move considered.\n\n73\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nThe following interest rate sensitivity table displays the potential impact of instantaneous, parallel changes in interest rates of +/- 25 and +/- 50 bps on annualized net interest income and portfolio value, based on our interest sensitive financial instruments at September 30, 2024. The preceding discussion shows that the results for the 25 bps move scenarios are the best representation of our interest rate exposure, followed by those for the 50 bps move scenarios. This hierarchy reflects our localized approach to managing interest rate risk: monitoring rates and rebalancing our hedges on a day-to-day basis, where rate moves only rarely exceed 25 bps in either direction.\n\nChanges in Interest Rates  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands)| -50 bps| -25 bps| +25 bps| +50 bps  \nChange in annualized net interest income (1):| $| (6,779)| $| (3,377)| $| 3,333 | $| 6,685   \n% change in net interest income(1)| (4.4)| %| (2.2)| %| 2.2 | %| 4.3 | %  \nChange in value of financial position:  \nAvailable-for-sale securities| $| 167,461 | $| 87,034 | $| (92,847)| $| (190,941)  \nAs a % of common equity| 10.8 | %| 5.6 | %| (6.0)| %| (12.4)| %  \nMortgage servicing rights (2)| $| (139,605)| $| (71,966)| $| 64,487 | $| 115,636   \nAs a % of common equity (2)| (9.0)| %| (4.7)| %| 4.2 | %| 7.5 | %  \nMortgage loans held-for-sale| $| 35 | $| 19 | $| (24)| $| (52)  \nAs a % of common equity| — | %| — | %| — | %| — | %  \nDerivatives, net| $| (38,935)| $| (16,031)| $| 9,391 | $| 12,354   \nAs a % of common equity| (2.5)| %| (1.0)| %| 0.6 | %| 0.8 | %  \nReverse repurchase agreements| $| 75 | $| 37 | $| (37)| $| (75)  \nAs a % of common equity| — | %| — | %| — | %| — | %  \nRepurchase agreements| $| (7,191)| $| (3,596)| $| 3,596 | $| 7,191   \nAs a % of common equity| (0.5)| %| (0.2)| %| 0.2 | %| 0.5 | %  \nRevolving credit facilities| $| (236)| $| (117)| $| 117 | $| 235   \nAs a % of common equity| — | %| — | %| — | %| — | %  \nWarehouse facilities| $| (3)| $| (2)| $| 2 | $| 3   \nAs a % of common equity| — | %| — | %| — | %| — | %  \nConvertible senior notes| $| (1,006)| $| (501)| $| 498 | $| 994   \nAs a % of common equity| (0.1)| %| — | %| — | %| 0.1 | %  \nTotal Net Assets| $| (19,405)| $| (5,123)| $| (14,817)| $| (54,655)  \nAs a % of total assets| (0.2)| %| — | %| (0.1)| %| (0.4)| %  \nAs a % of common equity| (1.3)| %| (0.3)| %| (1.0)| %| (3.5)| %  \n  \n____________________\n\n(1)Amounts include the effect of interest spread from our interest rate swaps and float income from custodial accounts associated with our MSR, but do not reflect any potential changes to dollar roll income associated with our TBA positions or U.S. Treasury futures income, which are accounted for as derivative instruments in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \n\n(2)Includes the effect of unsettled MSR.\n\nCertain assumptions have been made in connection with the calculation of the information set forth in the foregoing interest rate sensitivity table and, as such, there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur or that other events will not occur that would affect the outcomes. The base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at September 30, 2024. As discussed, the analysis utilizes assumptions and estimates based on our experience and judgment. Furthermore, future purchases and sales of assets could materially change our interest rate risk profile.\n\nThe information set forth in the interest rate sensitivity table above and all related disclosures constitutes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. While this table reflects the estimated impact of interest rate changes on the static portfolio, we actively manage our portfolio and continuously make adjustments to the size and composition of our asset and hedge portfolio. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the foregoing interest rate sensitivity table.\n\n74\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nPrepayment Risk\n\nPrepayment risk is the risk that the principal amount of a mortgage loan will be repaid at a different rate than anticipated. As we receive prepayments of principal on our Agency RMBS, premiums paid on such assets will be amortized against interest income. In general, an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums, thereby reducing the interest income earned on the assets.\n\nWe believe that we will be able to reinvest proceeds from scheduled principal payments and prepayments at acceptable yields; however, no assurances can be given that, should significant prepayments occur, market conditions would be such that acceptable investments could be identified and the proceeds timely reinvested.\n\nMSR are also subject to prepayment risk in that, generally, an increase in prepayment rates on the mortgage loans underlying the MSR would result in a decline in value of the MSR as the prepayment acts to cut short the anticipated life of the servicing income stream.\n\nMarket Risk\n\nMarket Value Risk. Our AFS securities are reflected at their estimated fair value, with the difference between amortized cost net of allowance for credit losses and estimated fair value for all AFS securities except certain AFS securities for which we have elected the fair value option reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The estimated fair value of these securities fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates, market valuation of credit risks, and other factors. Generally, in a rising interest rate environment, we would expect the fair value of these securities to decrease; conversely, in a decreasing interest rate environment, we would expect the fair value of these securities to increase. As market volatility increases or liquidity decreases, the fair value of our assets may be adversely impacted.\n\nOur MSR are reflected at their estimated fair value. The estimated fair value fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, in a rising interest rate environment, we would expect prepayments to decrease and the fair value of our MSR to increase. Conversely, in a decreasing interest rate environment, we would expect prepayments to increase and the fair value of our MSR to decrease.\n\nOur mortgage loans held-for-sale are reflected at their estimated fair value. The estimated fair value fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates, market valuation of credit risks and other factors. Generally in a rising rate environment, we would expect the fair value of these loans to decrease; conversely, in a decreasing rate environment, we would expect the fair value of these loans to increase. \n\nReal Estate Risk. Residential property values are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including national, regional and local economic conditions; local real estate conditions (such as the supply of housing); changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; retroactive changes to building or similar codes; and impacts of climate change, natural disasters and other catastrophes. Decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral for residential mortgage loans and the potential proceeds available to borrowers to repay the loans, which may impact the value of our Agency RMBS due to changes in voluntary and involuntary prepayment speeds, and/or may increase costs to service the residential mortgage loans underlying our MSR.\n\nLiquidity Risk\n\nOur liquidity risk is principally associated with our financing of long-maturity assets with shorter-term borrowings in the form of repurchase agreements and borrowings under revolving credit facilities and warehouse facilities. Although the interest rate adjustments of these assets and liabilities fall within the guidelines established by our operating policies, maturities are not required to be, nor are they, matched.\n\nShould the value of our assets pledged as collateral suddenly decrease, lender margin calls could increase, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position. Moreover, the portfolio construction of MSR, which generally have negative duration, combined with levered RMBS, which generally have positive duration, may in certain market scenarios lead to variation margin calls, which could negatively impact our excess cash position. Additionally, if one or more of our repurchase agreement, revolving credit facility or warehouse facility counterparties chose not to provide ongoing funding, our ability to finance would decline or exist at possibly less favorable terms. As such, we cannot provide assurance that we will always be able to roll over our repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities and warehouse facilities. See Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information about our liquidity and capital resource management.\n\nCredit Risk\n\nWe believe that our investment strategy will generally keep our risk of credit losses low to moderate. However, we retain the risk of potential credit losses on our mortgage loans held-for-sale and all of the loans underlying our non-Agency securities. \n\n75\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n\nA review and evaluation was performed by our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and Interim Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that review and evaluation, the CEO and Interim CFO have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures, as designed and implemented, were effective as of September 30, 2024. Although our CEO and Interim CFO have determined our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the reports we submit under the Exchange Act.\n\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n76\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\n\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\n\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in various legal and regulatory matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. As previously disclosed, on July 15, 2020, we provided PRCM Advisers with a notice of termination of the Management Agreement for “cause” in accordance with Section 15(a) of the Management Agreement. We terminated the Management Agreement for “cause” on the basis of certain material breaches and certain events of gross negligence on the part of PRCM Advisers in the performance of its duties under the Management Agreement. On July 21, 2020, PRCM Advisers filed a complaint against us in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, or the Court. Subsequently, Pine River Domestic Management L.P. and Pine River Capital Management L.P. were added as plaintiffs to the matter. As amended, the complaint, or the Federal Complaint, alleges, among other things, the misappropriation of trade secrets in violation of both the Defend Trade Secrets Act and New York common law, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unfair competition and business practices, unjust enrichment, conversion, and tortious interference with contract. The Federal Complaint seeks, among other things, an order enjoining us from making any use of or disclosing PRCM Advisers’ trade secret, proprietary, or confidential information; damages in an amount to be determined at a hearing and/or trial; disgorgement of our wrongfully obtained profits; and fees and costs incurred by the plaintiffs in pursuing the action. We have filed our answer to the Federal Complaint and made counterclaims against PRCM Advisers and Pine River Capital Management L.P. On May 5, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, seeking judgment in their favor on all but one of our counterclaims and on one of our affirmative defenses. We opposed the motion for judgment on the pleadings. On August 10, 2023, the motion for judgment on the pleadings was granted in part and denied in part. The discovery period has ended. On November 8, 2023, the Company and the plaintiffs filed motions for summary judgment, seeking judgment in their favor on the pending claims and counterclaims. Each party opposed the other party’s motion for summary judgment. The motions for summary judgment are fully briefed. Our board of directors believes the Federal Complaint is without merit and that we fully complied with the terms of the Management Agreement.\n\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n\nExcept as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth under the heading “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The materialization of any risks and uncertainties identified in our Forward-Looking Statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, together with those previously disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K or those that are presently unforeseen could result in significant adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. See Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Forward-Looking Statements” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\nWe may not be able to grow or realize the benefits of our direct-to-consumer loan origination platform, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nLate in the second quarter of 2024, through our wholly owned subsidiary, RoundPoint, we began operating an in-house, direct-to-consumer residential mortgage loan originations platform, which was established primarily as a MSR portfolio defense strategy to retain or recapture our existing borrowers. The originations platform also originates loans for borrowers that do not currently have a mortgage loan serviced by RoundPoint and also brokers second lien loans to our borrowers. For our own MSR portfolio, adding new or recaptured MSR through our origination platform is intended to hedge faster than expected MSR prepayment speeds in a refinance environment, and requires less capital relative to acquiring MSR through flow and bulk purchases from third-party originators. In addition, origination activities are generally counter-cyclical to MSR, which provides supplementary sources of profitability to our stockholders while also hedging our MSR. It is possible that the full benefits of the originations platform may not be realized as expected, or at all. Our ability to grow our mortgage loan originations business may be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including without limitation competition from new and existing market participants, rising interest rates, reductions in the overall level of refinancing activity or a decline in our brand and reputation. Any failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of our originations platform could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n77\n\n[Table of Contents ](#i8350aaee52a140c0bb6b18606a43b49b_10)\n\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about mortgage loan borrowers and any misrepresented information could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIn deciding whether to approve loans through our originations platform, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of borrowers, including financial statements and other information. We also may rely on representations of borrowers as to the accuracy and completeness of financial and other information provided. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, the fair value of the loan may be significantly lower than expected. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the loan applicant, another party or one of our employees, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation and the loan may be unsalable or subject to repurchase. Our controls and processes may not have detected or may not detect all misrepresented information in our loan originations. Any such misrepresented information could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIf our warehouse facilities are terminated or reduced, we may be unable to find replacement financing on favorable terms, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nTo finance our origination activities, we have entered into warehouse facilities collateralized by the value of the mortgage loans pledged until they are sold to the GSEs or other third-party investors in the secondary market. Our borrowings are generally repaid with the proceeds we receive from mortgage loan sales. We depend upon multiple lenders to provide warehouse lines of credit for our loans. In the event that any of our warehouse facilities are terminated or not renewed, or if the principal amount that may be drawn under our funding agreements were to decrease significantly, we may be unable to find replacement financing on commercially favorable terms, or at all, which could limit our ability to maintain or grow our originations business. \n\nIf our ability to sell loans in the secondary market is impaired, it could affect our volume and margins and we may not be able to continue to originate mortgage loans.\n\nWe originate residential mortgage loans and sell them to the GSEs or other third-party investors in the secondary market. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to sell our loans into the secondary market at attractive prices, or at all. If we are unable to sell our mortgage loans to the GSEs or other third-party investors, or the prices for such loans decline, our liquidity may be negatively impacted, we may be unable to continue to fund such loans, our revenues and margins on new loan originations could be reduced and our ability to repay our warehouse facilities could be impaired. \n\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\n\n(a)None.\n\n(b)None.\n\n(c)Our preferred share repurchase program allows for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of the company’s preferred stock, which includes the 8.125% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, 7.625% Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and 7.25% Series C Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. Preferred shares may be repurchased from time to time through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, pursuant to trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, or by any combination of such methods. The manner, price, number and timing of preferred share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and applicable SEC rules. The preferred share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and, subject to SEC rules, purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. The preferred share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of September 30, 2024, we had repurchased an aggregate of 4,179,183 preferred shares under the program for a total cost of $77.3 million. We did not repurchase preferred shares during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nOur common share repurchase program allows for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of 9,375,000 shares of the company’s common stock. Common shares may be repurchased from time to time through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act or by any combination of such methods. The manner, price, number and timing of common share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and applicable SEC rules. The common share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and, subject to SEC rules, purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. The common share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of September 30, 2024, we had repurchased 3,637,028 common shares under the program for a total cost of $208.5 million. We did not repurchase common shares during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nItem 3.

Statements (unaudited)\nNote 1. Organization and Operations\nTwo Harbors Investment Corp. is a Maryland corporation founded in 2009 that, through its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the Company), invests in, finances and\nmanages mortgage servicing rights, or MSR, and Agency residential mortgage-backed securities, or Agency RMBS, and, through its operational platform, RoundPoint Mortgage\nServicing LLC, or RoundPoint, is one of the largest servicers of conventional loans in the country. Agency refers to a U.S. government sponsored enterprise, or GSE, such as the\nFederal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, or a U.S. government agency such as the Government\nNational Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae. The Company is structured as an internally-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, and its common stock is listed on the\nNew York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol “TWO”.\nThe Company seeks to leverage its core competencies of understanding and managing interest rate and prepayment risk to invest in its portfolio of MSR and Agency RMBS,\nwith the objective of delivering more stable performance, relative to RMBS portfolios without MSR, across changing market environments. The Company is acutely focused on\ncreating sustainable stockholder value over the long term.\nEffective September 30, 2023, one of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries, TH MSR Holdings LLC (formerly Matrix Financial Services Corporation), acquired\nRoundPoint from Freedom Mortgage Corporation, or Freedom, after the completion of customary closing conditions and receiving the required regulatory and GSE approvals.\nUpon closing, all servicing and origination licenses and operational capabilities remained with RoundPoint, and RoundPoint became a wholly owned subsidiary of TH MSR\nHoldings. Management believes this acquisition will add value for stakeholders of the Company through cost savings achieved by bringing the servicing of its MSR portfolio in-\nhouse, greater control over the Company’s MSR portfolio and the associated cash flows, and the ability to participate more fully in the mortgage finance space as opportunities\narise.\nThe Company has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, as defined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. As long as the Company continues to comply with a number of requirements under federal tax law and maintains its qualification as a REIT, the\nCompany generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes to the extent that the Company distributes its taxable income to its stockholders on an annual basis and does\nnot engage in prohibited transactions. However, certain activities that the Company may perform may cause it to earn income which will not be qualifying income for REIT\npurposes. The Company has designated certain of its subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, as defined in the Code, to engage in such activities.\nNote 2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nConsolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission, or the SEC. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, have been condensed or omitted according to such SEC rules and regulations. However, management believes that the disclosures included\nin these interim condensed consolidated financial statements are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of all subsidiaries; inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. All\ntrust entities in which the Company holds investments that are considered variable interest entities, or VIEs, for financial reporting purposes were reviewed for consolidation\nunder the applicable consolidation guidance. Whenever the Company has both the power to direct the activities of a trust that most significantly impact the entity’s performance,\nand the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entities that could be significant, the Company consolidates the trust. Certain prior period amounts have\nbeen reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial\nstatements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In the opinion of management, all normal and\nrecurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial condition of the Company at September 30, 2024 and results of operations for all periods presented have been\nmade. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 should not be construed as indicative of the results to be expected for future periods or\nthe full year.\n7\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of significant estimates. These include estimates of fair value\nof certain assets and liabilities, the amount and timing of credit losses, prepayment rates, the period of time during which the Company anticipates an increase in the fair values of\nreal estate securities sufficient to recover unrealized losses in those securities, and other estimates that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities as of the date of\nthe condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during the reported period. It is likely that changes in these estimates\n(e.g., valuation changes due to supply and demand in the market, credit performance, prepayments, interest rates, or other reasons) will occur in the near term. The Company’s\nestimates are inherently subjective in nature and actual results could differ from its estimates and the differences may be material.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nIncluded in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K is a summary of the Company’s significant accounting\npolicies. Provided below is a summary of any additional and/or modified accounting policies that were significant to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nMortgage Loans Held-for-Sale, at Fair Value\nThe Company originates residential mortgage loans with the intention of selling such loans on a servicing-retained basis in the secondary market. As these loans are originated\nwith intent to sell, the loans are classified as held-for-sale, and the Company has elected to measure these loans held-for-sale at fair value. The Company estimates fair value of\nmortgage loans held-for-sale using a market approach by utilizing either: (i) the fair value of securities backed by similar mortgage loans, adjusted for certain factors to\napproximate the fair value of a whole mortgage loan, including the value attributable to mortgage servicing and credit risk; (ii) current commitments to purchase loans; or (iii)\nrecent observable market trades for similar loans, adjusted for credit risk and other individual loan characteristics. In connection with the Company’s election to measure\noriginated mortgage loans held-for-sale at fair value, the Company records the loan origination fees when earned, net of direct loan originations costs associated with these loans.\nLoan origination fees and underwriting fees are recorded within the other income line item in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Gains or\nlosses recognized upon sale of loans and fair value adjustments are recorded within gain on mortgage loans held-for-sale in the condensed consolidated statements of\ncomprehensive income (loss).\nInterest income on mortgage loans held-for-sale is recognized at the loan coupon rate. Loans are considered past due when they are 30 days past their contractual due date.\nInterest income recognition is suspended when mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual status. Generally, mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual status when delinquent for\nmore than 90 days or when determined not to be probable of full collection. Interest accrued, but not collected, at the date mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual is reversed\nand subsequently recognized only to the extent it is received in cash or until it qualifies for return to accrual status. However, where there is doubt regarding the ultimate\ncollectability of loan principal, all cash received is applied to reduce the carrying value of such loans. Mortgage loans are restored to accrual status only when contractually\ncurrent or the collection of future payments is reasonably assured.\nDerivative Financial Instruments, at Fair Value\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or ASC 815, all derivative financial instruments, whether designated for hedging\nrelationships or not, are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities and carried at fair value.\nThe Company enters into interest rate derivative contracts for a variety of reasons, including minimizing fluctuations in earnings or market values on certain assets or\nliabilities, including the Company’s loan origination pipeline, that may be caused by changes in interest rates. The pipeline refers to loan applications that have been initiated and\noffered to borrowers, which remain in the pipeline from the time they are locked until they fall out or are sold into the secondary mortgage market and consists of interest rate\nlock commitments, or IRLCs, and mortgage loans held-for-sale at fair value. The Company may, at times, enter into various forward contracts including short securities, Agency\nto-be-announced securities, or TBAs, options, futures, swaps, caps, credit default swaps, total return swaps and forward mortgage loan sale commitments.\n8\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nAt the inception of a derivative contract, the Company determines whether the instrument will be part of a qualifying hedge accounting relationship or whether the Company\nwill account for the contract as a trading instrument. Due to the volatility of the interest rate and credit markets and difficulty in effectively matching pricing or cash flows, the\nCompany has elected to treat all derivative contracts as trading instruments. Changes in fair value as well as the accrual and settlement of interest associated with derivatives\naccounted for as trading instruments are reported in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as (loss) gain on interest rate swap and swaption\nagreements, (loss) gain on other derivative instruments or gain on mortgage loans held-for-sale, depending on the type of derivative instrument.\nDue to the nature of the Company’s derivative instruments, they may be in a receivable/asset position or a payable/liability position at the end of an accounting period.\nAmounts payable to and receivable from the same party under contracts may be offset as long as the following conditions are met: (i) each of the two parties owes the other\ndeterminable amounts; (ii) the reporting party has the right to offset the amount owed with the amount owed by the other party; (iii) the reporting party intends to offset; and (iv)\nthe right of offset is enforceable by law. If the aforementioned conditions are not met, amounts payable to and receivable from are presented by the Company on a gross basis in\nits consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s centrally cleared interest rate swaps and exchange-traded futures and options on futures require that the Company posts an\n“initial margin” amount determined by the clearing exchange, which is generally intended to be set at a level sufficient to protect the exchange from the derivative instrument’s\nmaximum estimated single-day price movement. The Company also exchanges “variation margin” based upon daily changes in fair value, as measured by the exchange. The\nexchange of variation margin is considered a settlement of the derivative instrument, as opposed to pledged collateral. Accordingly, the Company accounts for the receipt or\npayment of variation margin as a direct reduction to the carrying value of the centrally cleared or exchange-traded derivative asset or liability. The receipt or payment of initial\nmargin is accounted for separate from the derivative asset or liability and is netted on a counterparty basis and classified within restricted cash, due from counterparties, or due to\ncounterparties on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company has provided specific disclosure regarding the location and amounts of derivative instruments in the consolidated financial statements and how derivative\ninstruments and related hedged items are accounted for. See Note 9 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities of these notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nWarehouse Facilities\nTo finance origination activities, the Company enters into warehouse facilities collateralized by the value of the mortgage loans pledged for a period of up to 90 days per loan.\nBorrowings under these warehouse facilities are considered short-term debt. The Company’s warehouse facilities generally bear interest rates based on an index plus a spread.\nBorrowings under warehouse facilities are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are carried at contractual amounts, as specified in the respective agreements.\nRecently Issued and/or Adopted Accounting Standards\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, which requires public entities to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and\ninterim basis and to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Public entities with a\nsingle reportable segment are required to provide the new disclosures and all the disclosures required under ASC 280, Segment Reporting. The ASU does not change how a\npublic entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates them or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. The ASU is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The guidance should be applied retrospectively to\nall periods presented in the financial statements, unless it is impracticable. The segment expense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior periods should be based on the\nsignificant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. The Company has early adopted this ASU, which did not have a material impact on the\nCompany's financial condition, results of operations or financial statement disclosures.\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, which requires entities to provide additional information about federal, state and foreign income taxes and reconciling\nitems in the rate reconciliation table, and to disclose further disaggregation of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) by federal (national), state and foreign taxes by\njurisdiction. For public business entities, the ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The guidance should be\napplied prospectively, but entities have the option to apply it retrospectively for each period presented. The Company has determined this ASU will not have a material impact on\nthe Company's financial condition, results of operations or financial statement disclosures.\n9\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nEnhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures\nIn March 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, issued Release No. 33-11275, its final rule on the enhancement and standardization of climate-related\ndisclosures for investors requiring registrants to provide certain climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports. The rules require information\nabout a registrant’s climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on its business, results of operations, or financial condition. The required information\nabout climate-related risks will also include disclosure of a registrant’s greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the rules will require registrants to present certain climate-related\nfinancial metrics in their audited financial statements. For large accelerated filers like the Company, the individual requirements will be phased-in with the first phase being\neffective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2025. Disclosures will be required prospectively, with information for prior periods required only to the extent it was previously\ndisclosed in an SEC filing. On April 4, 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed the final rules pending judicial review. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these final\nrules on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nNote 3. Acquisition of RoundPoint Mortgage Servicing LLC\nEffective September 30, 2023, the Company acquired RoundPoint from Freedom after the completion of customary closing conditions and receiving the required regulatory\nand GSE approvals. The provisional purchase price recognized was $44.7 million, with $23.6 million paid upon closing and $21.1 million recognized as a payable to Freedom\nwithin the other liabilities line item on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2023. The Company performed a provisional allocation of the\nconsideration of $44.7 million to RoundPoint’s assets and liabilities, as set forth below. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a total of\n$0.2 million in measurement period adjustments, resulting in a final purchase price of $44.5 million. The remaining payable to Freedom of $20.9 million was paid in January\n2024. The allocation of the adjusted purchase price of $44.5 million to RoundPoint’s assets and liabilities is also set forth below. The determination of fair value of assets and\nliabilities required the use of significant assumptions and estimates. Significant estimates included, but were not limited to, future expected cash flows, including projected\nrevenues and expenses, and discount rates. These estimates were based on assumptions that management believes to be reasonable as well as a third party-prepared valuation\nanalysis; however, actual results may differ from these estimates. The measurement period adjustments made during the three months ended December 31, 2023 are set forth\nbelow. No measurement period adjustments were made subsequent to December 31, 2023.\nSubsequent Acquisition Date\nAcquisition Date Measurement Period Amounts Recognized,\n(in thousands) Amounts Recognized Adjustments as adjusted\nTotal Consideration $ 44,732 $ (188) $ 44,544\nAssets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 50,366 $ — $ 50,366\nIntangible assets 786 13 799\nOther assets 29,148 — 29,148\nTotal Assets Acquired $ 80,300 $ 13 $ 80,313\nLiabilities:\nAccrued expenses $ 4,483 $ — $ 4,483\nOther liabilities 58,739 — 58,739\nTotal Liabilities Assumed $ 63,222 $ — $ 63,222\nNet Assets $ 17,078 $ 13 $ 17,091\nGoodwill $ 27,654 $ (201) $ 27,453\n10\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nAs a result of the RoundPoint acquisition, the Company identified intangible assets in the form of mortgage servicing and origination state licenses, insurance state licenses,\nGSE servicing approvals and trade names. The Company recorded the intangible assets at fair value at the acquisition date and amortizes the value of finite-lived intangibles into\nexpense over the expected useful life. Trade names, with a total acquisition date fair value of $0.2 million, are amortized straight-line over a finite life of six months based on the\nCompany’s determination of the time to change a trade name. The Company determined the licenses and approvals, with a total acquisition date fair value of $0.6 million, have\nindefinite useful lives and are periodically evaluated for impairment given there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive or economic factors that would limit their useful\nlives.\nThe total goodwill of $27.5 million was calculated as the excess of the total consideration transferred over the net assets acquired and primarily includes the existence of an\nassembled workforce, synergies and benefits expected to result from combining operations with RoundPoint and adding in-house servicing. The full amount of goodwill for tax\npurposes of $27.5 million is expected to be deductible. The Company will assess the goodwill annually during the fourth quarter and in interim periods whenever events or\ncircumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.\nAcquisition-related costs are expensed in the period incurred and included within the other operating expenses line item in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements\nof comprehensive income (loss). During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized $1.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively, of\nacquisition-related costs. The Company did not recognize any further acquisition-related costs in 2024.\nAs discussed above, the acquisition of RoundPoint closed effective September 30, 2023. Accordingly, RoundPoint’s consolidated balance sheet is included within the\nCompany’s consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. Beginning October 1, 2023, RoundPoint’s results of operations have been consolidated with the Company’s in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP; inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The following table presents unaudited pro forma combined revenues and income\nbefore income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 prepared as if the RoundPoint acquisition had been consummated on January 1, 2023.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue (1) $ (51,527) $ 585,641 $ 646,894 $ 1,044,039\n(Loss) income before income taxes $ (248,943) $ 339,009 $ 37,153 $ 357,636\n____________________\n(1) The Company’s revenue is defined as the sum of the interest income, servicing income and total other income line items on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income\n(loss).\nThe above unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information has not been adjusted for transactions that are now considered inter-company as a result of the acquisition,\nthe conforming of accounting policies, nor the divestiture of RoundPoint’s retail origination business and RPX servicing exchange platform, as required by the stock purchase\nagreement. The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information also does not include any anticipated synergies or other anticipated benefits of the RoundPoint\nacquisition and, accordingly, the unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of either future results of operations or results that might\nhave been achieved had the acquisition been consummated on January 1, 2023.\nAdditionally, in the third quarter of 2022, TH MSR Holdings agreed to engage RoundPoint as a subservicer prior to the closing date and began transferring loans to\nRoundPoint in the fourth quarter of 2022. As such, prior to the acquisition on September 30, 2023, the Company incurred servicing expenses related to RoundPoint’s\nsubservicing of the Company’s MSR of $10.3 million and $23.9 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. These subservicing expenses\nare included within the servicing costs line item on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n11\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nNote 4. Variable Interest Entities\nThe Company enters into transactions with subsidiary trust entities that are established for limited purposes. One of the Company’s subsidiary trust entities, MSR Issuer Trust,\nwas formed for the purpose of financing MSR through securitization, pursuant to which, through two of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries, MSR is pledged to MSR\nIssuer Trust and in return, MSR Issuer Trust issues term notes to qualified institutional buyers and a variable funding note, or VFN, to one of the subsidiaries, in each case\nsecured on a pari passu basis. The Company has one repurchase facility that is secured by the VFN, which is collateralized by the Company’s MSR. During the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, all outstanding term notes previously issued by MSR Issuer Trust matured and were repaid.\nAnother of the Company’s subsidiary trust entities, Servicing Advance Receivables Issuer Trust, was formed for the purpose of financing servicing advances through a\nrevolving credit facility, pursuant to which Servicing Advance Receivables Issuer Trust issued a VFN backed by servicing advances pledged to the financing counterparty.\nBoth MSR Issuer Trust and Servicing Advance Receivables Issuer Trust are considered VIEs for financial reporting purposes and were reviewed for consolidation under the\napplicable consolidation guidance. As the Company has both the power to direct the activities of the trusts that most significantly impact the entities’ performance, and the\nobligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entities that could be significant, the Company is the primary beneficiary and, thus, consolidates the trusts.\nAdditionally, in accordance with arrangements entered into in connection with the securitization transaction and the servicing advance revolving credit facility, the Company has\ndirect financial obligations payable to both MSR Issuer Trust and Servicing Advance Receivables Issuer Trust, which, in turn, support MSR Issuer Trust’s obligations to\nnoteholders under the securitization transaction and Servicing Advance Receivables Issuer Trust’s obligations to the financing counterparty.\nThe following table presents a summary of the assets and liabilities of all consolidated trusts as reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nNote receivable (1) $ — $ 399,317\nRestricted cash 42,696 45,642\nAccrued interest receivable (1) — 551\nOther assets 86,646 79,749\nTotal Assets $ 129,342 $ 525,259\nTerm notes payable $ — $ 399,317\nRevolving credit facilities 59,300 34,300\nAccrued interest payable 403 816\nOther liabilities 42,293 45,377\nTotal Liabilities $ 101,996 $ 479,810\n____________________\n(1) Receivables due from a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company to the trusts are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nAdditionally, the Company entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement on August 2, 2022 to acquire RoundPoint whereby the preliminary purchase price was subject\nto a post-closing adjustment based on RoundPoint’s aggregate “earnings” (as defined in the stock purchase agreement) from October 1, 2022 through the closing date, or the\nInterim Period, in addition to other post-closing adjustments. During the Interim Period, the manner in which the purchase price is calculated represented an implicit guarantee of\nthe value of RoundPoint’s net book value, in which the Company held the variable interests. These terms also indicated that RoundPoint met the criteria to be considered a VIE\nthat the Company must review for consolidation. As the Company had the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits of RoundPoint during the Interim Period\nthat could be significant, but not the power to direct the activities of RoundPoint that most significantly impacted its performance, the Company was not the primary beneficiary\nand, thus, did not consolidate RoundPoint during the Interim Period. Effective September 30, 2023, the parties had satisfied customary closing conditions and received the\nrequired regulatory and GSE approvals to close the transaction. Upon closing, RoundPoint became a consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and was no longer\nconsidered a VIE.\n12\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nNote 5.

Changes in fair value based on 10% and 20% variations in assumptions generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular\nassumption on the fair value of MSR is calculated without changing any other assumptions. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (e.g., increased\nmarket interest rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit losses) that could magnify or counteract the sensitivities. Further, these sensitivities show only the\nchange in the asset balances and do not show any expected change in the fair value of the instruments used to manage the interest rates and prepayment risks associated with\nthese assets.\nRisk Mitigation Activities\nThe primary risks associated with the Company’s MSR are changes in interest rates, mortgage spreads and prepayments. The Company economically hedges interest rate and\nmortgage spread risk primarily with its Agency RMBS portfolio. Prepayment risk is carefully monitored and partially mitigated through the Company’s ability to retain the MSR,\nin certain circumstances, through recapture if the underlying loan is refinanced.\nMortgage Servicing Income and Costs\nThe following table presents the components of servicing income recorded on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nServicing fee income $ 126,597 $ 141,816 $ 400,278 $ 415,423\nAncillary and other fee income 3,928 476 12,220 2,236\nFloat income 41,207 36,333 101,582 89,509\nTotal $ 171,732 $ 178,625 $ 514,080 $ 507,168\nPrior to the acquisition of RoundPoint, the Company did not directly service mortgage loans; instead, it contracted with appropriately licensed third-party subservicers to\nhandle substantially all servicing functions in the name of the subservicer for the mortgage loans underlying the Company’s MSR. These third-party subservicing costs and other\nservicing expenses directly related to the Company’s MSR portfolio are included within the servicing costs line item on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of\ncomprehensive income (loss). Post-acquisition, all servicing-related expenses incurred by RoundPoint as an operating company are included within the compensation and\nbenefits and other operating expenses line items on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n17\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nMortgage Servicing Advances\nAs the servicer of record for the MSR assets, the Company may be required to advance principal and interest payments to security holders, and intermittent tax and insurance\npayments to local authorities and insurance companies on mortgage loans that are in forbearance, delinquency or default. The Company is responsible for funding these\nadvances, potentially for an extended period of time, before receiving reimbursement from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Servicing advances are priority cash flows in the event\nof a loan principal reduction or foreclosure and ultimate liquidation of the real estate-owned property, thus making their collection reasonably assured. These servicing advances\ntotaled $92.0 million and $143.2 million and were included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, mortgage loans in 60+ day delinquent status (whether or not subject to forbearance) accounted for approximately\n0.8% and 0.7%, respectively, of the aggregate principal balance of loans for which the Company had servicing advance funding obligations.\nThe Company has one revolving credit facility to finance its servicing advance obligations. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had pledged\nservicing advances with a carrying value of $86.6 million and $79.7 million, respectively, as collateral for this revolving credit facility. See Note 14 - Revolving Credit Facilities.\nNote 7. Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale, at Fair Value\nThe Company originates residential mortgage loans for the purpose of selling to the GSEs or other third-party investors in the secondary market on a servicing-retained basis,\ntypically within 30 days of origination. The Company also holds a small amount of mortgage loans purchased from the collateral underlying its MSR. Mortgage loans held-for-\nsale are recorded at fair value as a result of a fair value option election.

The Company considers credit\nrisk associated with these loans to be minimal as it holds the loans for a short period of time and the market for these loans continues to be highly liquid.\nThe Company has one warehouse facility to finance its mortgage loans held-for-sale. At September 30, 2024, the Company had pledged mortgage loans held-for-sale with a\ncarrying value of $3.1 million as collateral for this warehouse facility.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents include cash held in bank accounts and cash held in money market funds on an overnight basis.\nThe Company is required to maintain certain cash balances with counterparties for securities and derivatives trading activity, servicing activities and collateral for the\nCompany’s borrowings in restricted accounts. The Company has also placed cash in a restricted account pursuant to a letter of credit on an office space lease.\nThe following table presents the Company’s restricted cash balances as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nRestricted cash balances held by trading counterparties:\nFor securities trading activity $ 450 $ 450\nFor derivatives trading activity 26,649 1,669\nFor servicing activities 47,963 50,345\nAs restricted collateral for borrowings 13,998 12,575\nTotal restricted cash balances held by trading counterparties 89,060 65,039\nRestricted cash balance pursuant to letter of credit on office lease 65 62\nTotal $ 89,125 $ 65,101\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the statements of cash flows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 522,581 $ 729,732\nRestricted cash 89,125 65,101\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 611,706 $ 794,833\nNote 9. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company enters into a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments in connection with its risk management activities. The primary objective for executing these\nderivative and non-derivative instruments is to mitigate the Company’s economic exposure to future events that are outside its control, principally cash flow volatility associated\nwith interest rate risk (including associated prepayment risk). Specifically, the Company enters into derivative and non-derivative instruments to economically hedge interest rate\nrisk or “duration mismatch (or gap)” by adjusting the duration of its floating-rate borrowings into fixed-rate borrowings to more closely match the duration of its assets. This\nparticularly applies to floating-rate borrowing agreements with maturities or interest rate resets of less than six months. Typically, the interest receivable terms (e.g., Overnight\nIndex Swap Rate, or OIS, or Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR) of certain derivatives match the terms of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective conversion of\nthe rate of the related borrowing agreement from floating to fixed. The objective is to manage the cash flows associated with current and anticipated interest payments on\nborrowings, as well as the ability to roll or refinance borrowings at the desired amount by adjusting the duration.\nTo help manage the adverse impact of interest rate changes on the value of the Company’s portfolio, its cash flows, and its loan origination pipeline, the Company may, at\ntimes, enter into various forward contracts, including short securities, Agency to-be-announced securities, or TBAs, options, futures, swaps, caps, credit default swaps, total\nreturn swaps and forward mortgage loan sale commitments.In executing on the Company’s current risk management strategy, the Company has entered into TBAs, interest rate\nswap and swaption agreements, futures, options on futures, IRLCs and forward mortgage loan sale commitments. The Company has also entered into a number of non-derivative\ninstruments to manage interest rate risk, principally MSR and interest-only securities (see discussion below).\n19\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nThe following summarizes the Company’s significant asset and liability classes, the risk exposure for these classes, and the Company’s risk management activities used to\nmitigate these risks. The discussion includes both derivative and non-derivative instruments used as part of these risk management activities. Any of the Company’s derivative\nand non-derivative instruments may be entered into in conjunction with one another in order to mitigate risks. As a result, the following discussions of each type of instrument\nshould be read as a collective representation of the Company’s risk mitigation efforts and should not be considered independent of one another. While the Company uses\nderivative and non-derivative instruments to achieve the Company’s risk management activities, it is possible that these instruments will not effectively mitigate all or a\nsubstantial portion of the Company’s market rate risk. In addition, the Company might elect, at times, not to enter into certain hedging arrangements in order to maintain\ncompliance with REIT requirements.\nBalance Sheet Presentation\nIn accordance with ASC 815, the Company records derivative financial instruments on its condensed consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value. Changes\nin fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative instruments and whether they are designated or qualify as hedge instruments. Due to the volatility of the\ninterest rate and credit markets and difficulty in effectively matching pricing or cash flows, the Company has not designated any current derivatives as hedging instruments.\nThe following tables present the gross fair value and notional amounts of the Company’s derivative financial instruments treated as trading derivatives as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nDerivative Assets Derivative Liabilities\n(in thousands) Fair Value Notional Fair Value Notional\nInverse interest-only securities $ 11,842 $ 142,011 $ — $ —\nInterest rate swap agreements — — — 14,197,205\nSwaptions, net — — — —\nTBAs 184 (34,000) (16,725) 5,098,000\nFutures, net — — — (3,693,900)\nInterest rate lock commitments 478 33,381 — —\nForward mortgage loan sale commitments 68 26,786 (39) 9,612\nTotal $ 12,572 $ 168,178 $ (16,764) $ 15,610,917\nDecember 31, 2023\nDerivative Assets Derivative Liabilities\n(in thousands) Fair Value Notional Fair Value Notional\nInverse interest-only securities $ 12,292 $ 163,735 $ — $ —\nInterest rate swap agreements — — — 17,788,114\nSwaptions, net 19 (200,000) — —\nTBAs 72,980 2,979,000 (21,506) 518,000\nFutures, net — — — (6,203,050)\nInterest rate lock commitments — — — —\nForward mortgage loan sale commitments — — — —\nTotal $ 85,291 $ 2,942,735 $ (21,506) $ 12,103,064\nComprehensive Income (Loss) Statement Presentation\nThe Company has not applied hedge accounting to its current derivative portfolio held to mitigate interest rate risk and credit risk.

Periods of rising interest rates with corresponding decreasing prepayment speeds generally result in a decline in the value of the Company’s fixed-rate Agency\nprincipal and interest (P&I) RMBS. The impact of this effect on the Company’s fixed-rate Agency P&I RMBS portfolio is partially mitigated by the presence of fixed-rate\ninterest-only Agency RMBS, which generally increase in value when prepayment speeds decrease and MSR, which generally increase in value when prepayment speeds decrease\nand interest rates increase. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $17.4 million and $41.9 million, respectively, of interest-only securities, and\n$2.9 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, of MSR. Interest-only securities are included in AFS securities, at fair value, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company monitors its borrowings under repurchase agreements and revolving credit facilities, which are generally floating-rate debt, in relation to the rate profile of its\nportfolio. In connection with its risk management activities, the Company enters into a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments to economically hedge interest rate\nrisk or duration mismatch (or gap) by adjusting the duration of its floating-rate borrowings into fixed-rate borrowings to more closely match the duration of its assets. This\nparticularly applies to borrowing agreements with maturities or interest rate resets of less than six months. Typically, the interest receivable terms (e.g., OIS or SOFR) of certain\nderivatives match the terms of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective conversion of the rate of the related borrowing agreement from floating to fixed. The objective is to\nmanage the cash flows associated with current and anticipated interest payments on borrowings, as well as the ability to roll or refinance borrowings at the desired amount by\nadjusting the duration. To help manage the adverse impact of interest rate changes on the value of the Company’s portfolio, its cash flows and its loan origination pipeline\n(consisting of IRLCs and mortgage loans held-for-sale), the Company may, at times, enter into various forward contracts, including short securities, TBAs, options, futures,\nswaps, caps, credit default swaps, total return swaps and forward mortgage loan sale commitments. In executing on the Company’s current interest rate risk management strategy,\nthe Company has entered into TBAs, interest rate swap and swaption agreements, futures, options on futures and forward mortgage loan sale commitments.\nTBAs. The Company may use TBAs as a means of deploying capital until targeted investments are available or to take advantage of temporary displacements, funding\nadvantages or valuation differentials in the marketplace. Additionally, the Company may use TBAs independently, or in conjunction with other derivative and non-derivative\ninstruments, in order to mitigate risks. TBAs are forward contracts for the purchase (long notional positions) or sale (short notional positions) of Agency RMBS. The issuer,\ncoupon and stated maturity of the Agency RMBS are predetermined as well as the trade price, face amount and future settle date (published each month by the Securities Industry\nand Financial Markets Association). However, the specific Agency RMBS to be delivered upon settlement is not known at the time of the TBA transaction. As a result, and\nbecause physical delivery of the Agency RMBS upon settlement cannot be assured, the Company accounts for TBAs as derivative instruments.\nThe Company may hold both long and short notional TBA positions, which are disclosed on a gross basis according to the unrealized gain or loss position of each TBA\ncontract regardless of long or short notional position.

The Company may use interest rate swaptions (which provide the option to enter into interest rate swap agreements for a predetermined notional\namount, stated term and pay and receive interest rates in the future) independently, or in conjunction with other derivative and non-derivative instruments, in order to mitigate\nrisks. The Company did not hold any interest rate swaptions as of September 30, 2024.

The Company enters into IRLCs to originate residential mortgage loans at specified interest rates and terms within a specified period of time\nwith customers who have applied for a loan and may meet certain credit and underwriting criteria. IRLCs are subject to changes in mortgage interest rates from the date of the\ncommitment through the date of funding the loan or the cancellation or expiration of the lock commitment, generally ranging between 30 and 90 days. IRLCs are considered\nfreestanding derivatives and are recorded at fair value at inception inclusive of the inherent value of servicing the loan. The Company did not hold any IRLCs as of December 31,\n2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding IRLCs of $33.4 million in principal with a net fair value of $0.5 million.\n27\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nForward Mortgage Loan Sale Commitments. The Company uses forward mortgage loan sale commitments to manage exposure to interest rate risk and changes in the fair\nvalue of IRLCs from the date of the commitment through the date of funding or cancellation or expiration of the lock commitment. Forward mortgage loan sale commitments are\nalso used to manage exposure to interest rate risk and changes in the fair value of the Company’s mortgage loans held-for-sale from the date of funding through the date of sale in\nthe secondary market, typically within 30 days of origination. Forward mortgage loan sale commitments are recorded at fair value based on pricing of similar instruments in the\nsecondary market based upon the investor, coupon, and estimated sale or delivery month. The Company’s expectation of the amount of IRLCs that will ultimately close is a key\nfactor in determining the notional amount of derivatives used in economically hedging the position. The Company did not hold any forward mortgage loan sale commitments as\nof December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding forward mortgage loan sale commitments of $36.4 million in principal with a net fair value of\n$29 thousand.\nCredit Risk\nThe Company’s exposure to credit losses on its Agency RMBS portfolio is limited due to implicit or explicit backing from either a GSE or a U.S. government agency. The\npayment of principal and interest on the Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed by those respective agencies, and the payment of principal and\ninterest on the Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\nIn future periods, the Company could enhance its credit risk protection, enter into further paired derivative positions, including both long and short credit default swaps,\nand/or seek opportunistic trades in the event of a market disruption. The Company also has processes and controls in place to monitor, analyze, manage and mitigate its credit\nrisk with respect to non-Agency securities and mortgage loans held-for-sale.\nDerivative financial instruments contain an element of credit risk if counterparties are unable to meet the terms of the agreements. Credit risk associated with derivative\nfinancial instruments is measured as the net replacement cost should the counterparties that owe the Company under such contracts completely fail to perform under the terms of\nthese contracts, assuming there are no recoveries of underlying collateral, as measured by the market value of the derivative financial instruments. As of September 30, 2024, the\nfair value of derivative financial instruments as an asset and liability position was $12.6 million and $16.8 million, respectively.\nThe Company attempts to mitigate its credit risk exposure on derivative financial instruments by limiting its counterparties to banks and financial institutions that meet\nestablished internal credit guidelines. The Company also seeks to spread its credit risk exposure across multiple counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to any single\ncounterparty. Additionally, the Company reduces credit risk on the majority of its derivative instruments by entering into agreements that permit the closeout and netting of\ntransactions with the same counterparty or clearing agency upon the occurrence of certain events. To further mitigate the risk of counterparty default, the Company maintains\ncollateral agreements with certain of its counterparties and clearing agencies, which require both parties to maintain cash deposits in the event the fair values of the derivative\nfinancial instruments exceed established thresholds. The Company’s centrally cleared interest rate swaps and exchange-traded futures and options on futures require the\nCompany to post an “initial margin” amount determined by the clearing exchange, which is generally intended to be set at a level sufficient to protect the exchange from the\nderivative instrument’s maximum estimated single-day price movement. The Company also exchanges “variation margin” based upon daily changes in fair value, as measured by\nthe exchange. The exchange of variation margin is considered a settlement of the derivative instrument, as opposed to pledged collateral. Accordingly, the Company accounts for\nthe receipt or payment of variation margin as a direct reduction to the carrying value of the centrally cleared or exchange-traded derivative asset or liability.\nNote 10. Reverse Repurchase Agreements\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $280.5 million and $286.1 million in amounts due to counterparties as collateral for reverse repurchase\nagreements that could be pledged, delivered or otherwise used, with a fair value of $359.2 million and $284.1 million, respectively.\n28\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nNote 11. Offsetting Assets and Liabilities\nCertain of the Company’s repurchase agreements are governed by underlying agreements that provide for a right of setoff in the event of default by either party to the\nagreement. The Company also has netting arrangements in place with all derivative counterparties pursuant to standard documentation developed by the International Swap and\nDerivatives Association, or ISDA, or central clearing exchange agreements. The Company and the counterparty or clearing agency are required to post cash collateral based upon\nthe net underlying market value of the Company’s open positions with the counterparty. Additionally, the Company’s centrally cleared interest rate swaps and exchange-traded\nfutures and options on futures require the Company to post an initial margin amount determined by the clearing exchange, which is generally intended to be set at a level\nsufficient to protect the exchange from the derivative instrument’s maximum estimated single-day price movement. The Company also exchanges variation margin based upon\ndaily changes in fair value, as measured by the exchange.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, if the Company has a valid right of setoff, it may offset the related asset and liability and report the net amount. Based on rules governing certain central\nclearing and exchange-trading activities, the exchange of variation margin is considered a settlement of the derivative instrument, as opposed to pledged collateral. Accordingly,\nthe Company accounts for the receipt or payment of variation margin on Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or CME, and London Clearing House, or LCH, cleared positions as a\ndirect reduction to the carrying value of the centrally cleared or exchange-traded derivative asset or liability. The receipt or payment of initial margin is accounted for separate\nfrom the derivative asset or liability.\nReverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements with the same counterparty and the same maturity are presented net in the Company’s condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets when the terms of the agreements meet the criteria to permit netting. The Company reports cash flows on repurchase agreements as financing activities and cash\nflows on reverse repurchase agreements as investing activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities\n(other than centrally cleared or exchange-traded derivative instruments) subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements on a net basis, based on derivative type and\ncounterparty, in its condensed consolidated balance sheets. Separately, the Company presents cash collateral subject to such arrangements (other than variation margin on\ncentrally cleared or exchange-traded derivative instruments) on a net basis, based on counterparty, in its condensed consolidated balance sheets. However, the Company does not\noffset repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements or derivative assets and liabilities (other than centrally cleared or exchange-traded derivative instruments) with the\nassociated cash collateral on its condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following tables present information about the Company’s assets and liabilities that are subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements and can potentially\nbe offset on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nGross Amounts Not Offset with Financial\nAssets (Liabilities) in the Balance Sheets\n(1)\nNet Amounts of\nGross Amounts of Gross Amounts Assets (Liabilities)\nRecognized Assets Offset in the Presented in the Financial Cash Collateral\n(in thousands) (Liabilities) Balance Sheets Balance Sheets Instruments (Received) Pledged Net Amount\nAssets:\nDerivative assets $ 47,468 $ (34,896) $ 12,572 $ (12,572) $ — $ —\nReverse repurchase agreements 359,180 — 359,180 — (280,523) 78,657\nTotal Assets $ 406,648 $ (34,896) $ 371,752 $ (12,572) $ (280,523) $ 78,657\nLiabilities:\nRepurchase agreements $ (8,763,400) $ — $ (8,763,400) $ 8,763,400 $ — $ —\nDerivative liabilities (51,660) 34,896 (16,764) 12,572 — (4,192)\nTotal Liabilities $ (8,815,060) $ 34,896 $ (8,780,164) $ 8,775,972 $ — $ (4,192)\n29\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nDecember 31, 2023\nGross Amounts Not Offset with Financial\nAssets (Liabilities) in the Balance Sheets\n(1)\nNet Amounts of\nGross Amounts of Gross Amounts Assets (Liabilities)\nRecognized Assets Offset in the Presented in the Financial Cash Collateral\n(in thousands) (Liabilities) Balance Sheets Balance Sheets Instruments (Received) Pledged Net Amount\nAssets:\nDerivative assets $ 228,227 $ (142,936) $ 85,291 $ (21,506) $ — $ 63,785\nReverse repurchase agreements 284,091 — 284,091 — (284,091) —\nTotal Assets $ 512,318 $ (142,936) $ 369,382 $ (21,506) $ (284,091) $ 63,785\nLiabilities:\nRepurchase agreements $ (8,020,207) $ — $ (8,020,207) $ 8,020,207 $ — $ —\nDerivative liabilities (164,442) 142,936 (21,506) 21,506 — —\nTotal Liabilities $ (8,184,649) $ 142,936 $ (8,041,713) $ 8,041,713 $ — $ —\n____________________\n(1) Amounts presented are limited in total to the net amount of assets or liabilities presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheets by instrument. Excess cash collateral or financial assets\nthat are pledged to counterparties may exceed the financial liabilities subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement, or counterparties may have pledged excess cash collateral to\nthe Company that exceed the corresponding financial assets. These excess amounts are excluded from the table above, although separately reported within restricted cash, due from\ncounterparties, or due to counterparties in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nNote 12. Fair Value\nFair Value Measurements\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820, defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 clarifies that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use\nwhen pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. The fair value hierarchy gives the\nhighest priority to quoted prices available in active markets (i.e., observable inputs) and the lowest priority to data lacking transparency (i.e., unobservable inputs). Additionally,\nASC 820 requires an entity to consider all aspects of nonperformance risk, including the entity’s own credit standing, when measuring fair value of a liability.\nASC 820 establishes a three-level hierarchy to be used when measuring and disclosing fair value. An instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on\nthe lowest level of significant input to its valuation. The following is a description of the three levels:\nLevel 1 Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date under current market conditions. Additionally, the\nentity must have the ability to access the active market and the quoted prices cannot be adjusted by the entity.\nLevel 2 Inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in inactive markets for identical or similar assets or liabilities; or\ninputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means for substantially the full-term of the assets or\nliabilities.\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs are supported by little or no market activity. The unobservable inputs represent the assumptions that market participants would use to\nprice the assets and liabilities, including risk. Generally, Level 3 assets and liabilities are valued using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies,\nor similar techniques that require significant judgment or estimation.\n30\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nThe following are descriptions of the valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models, key inputs to\nthose models and significant assumptions utilized.\nAvailable-for-sale securities. The Company holds a portfolio of AFS securities that are carried at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and primarily\ncomprised of Agency and non-Agency investment securities. The Company determines the fair value of its Agency RMBS based upon prices obtained from third-party brokers\nand pricing vendors received using bid price, which are deemed indicative of market activity. The third-party pricing vendors use pricing models that generally incorporate such\nfactors as coupons, primary and secondary mortgage rates, rate reset period, issuer, prepayment speeds, credit enhancements and expected life of the security. In determining the\nfair value of its non-Agency securities, management judgment may be used to arrive at fair value that considers prices obtained from third-party pricing vendors and other\napplicable market data. If observable market prices are not available or insufficient to determine fair value due principally to illiquidity in the marketplace, then fair value is\nbased upon models that are primarily based on observable market-based inputs but also include unobservable market data inputs (including prepayment speeds, delinquency\nlevels, and credit losses).\nThe Company classified 99.95% and 0.05% of its AFS securities as Level 2 and Level 3 fair value assets, respectively, at September 30, 2024.\nMortgage servicing rights. The Company holds a portfolio of MSR that are carried at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines fair\nvalue of its MSR based on prices obtained from third-party pricing vendors. Although MSR transactions may be observable in the marketplace, the details of those transactions\nare not necessarily reflective of the value of the Company’s MSR portfolio. Third-party vendors use both observable market data and unobservable market data (including\nforecasted prepayment speeds, OAS and cost to service) as inputs into models, which help to inform their best estimates of fair value market price. As a result, the Company\nclassified 100% of its MSR as Level 3 fair value assets at September 30, 2024.\nMortgage loans held-for-sale. The Company’s recognizes on its condensed consolidated balance sheets originated mortgage loans held-for-sale that are carried at fair value as\na result of a fair value option election. The Company estimates fair value of mortgage loans held-for-sale using a market approach by utilizing either: (i) the fair value of\nsecurities backed by similar mortgage loans, adjusted for certain factors to approximate the fair value of a whole mortgage loan, including the value attributable to mortgage\nservicing and credit risk; (ii) current commitments to purchase loans; or (iii) recent observable market trades for similar loans, adjusted for credit risk and other individual loan\ncharacteristics. As these fair values are derived from market observable inputs, the Company classified 100% of its mortgage loans held-for-sale as Level 2 fair value assets at\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nDerivative instruments. The Company may enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments as part of its hedging strategies, including over-the-counter, or OTC,\nderivative contracts, such as interest rate swaps and swaptions. The Company utilizes third-party brokers to value its OTC derivative instruments. The Company classified 100%\nof its interest rate swaps reported at fair value as Level 2 at September 30, 2024. The Company did not hold any interest rate swaptions at September 30, 2024.\nThe Company may also enter into certain other derivative financial instruments, such as inverse interest-only securities, TBAs, futures and options on futures. The Company\nutilizes third-party pricing vendors to value inverse interest-only securities, as these instruments are similar in form to the Company’s AFS securities. The Company classified\n100% of its inverse interest-only securities at fair value as Level 2 at September 30, 2024. TBAs, futures and options on futures are considered to be active markets such that\nparticipants transact with sufficient frequency and volume to provide transparent pricing information for identical instruments. The Company utilizes third-party pricing vendors\nto value TBAs, futures and options on futures. The Company reported 100% of its TBAs and futures as Level 1 as of September 30, 2024. The Company did not hold any options\non futures at September 30, 2024.\nThe Company also enters into IRLCs and forward mortgage loan sale commitments in connection with its origination activities. The Company determines fair value of its\nIRLCs based on valuation models that use the market price for similar loans sold in the secondary market, net of costs to close the loans, subject to the estimated loan funding\nprobability or pull-through rate. Given the significant and unobservable nature of the pull-through rate assumption, the Company classified 100% of its IRLCs as Level 3 at\nSeptember 30, 2024. The valuation model for forward mortgage loan sale commitments utilizes the fair value of related mortgage loans determined using observable market data,\nand therefore, the Company reported 100% of its forward mortgage loan sale commitments as Level 2 as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Company’s policy is to minimize credit exposure related to financial derivatives used for hedging by limiting the hedge counterparties to major banks, financial\ninstitutions, exchanges, and private investors who meet established capital and credit guidelines as well as by limiting the amount of exposure to any individual counterparty.\n31\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nThe Company has netting arrangements in place with all derivative counterparties pursuant to standard documentation developed by ISDA or central clearing exchange\nagreements. Additionally, both the Company and the counterparty or clearing agency are required to post cash margin based upon the net underlying market value of the\nCompany’s open positions with the counterparty. Posting of cash margin typically occurs daily, subject to certain dollar thresholds. Due to the existence of netting arrangements,\nas well as frequent cash margin posting at low posting thresholds, credit exposure to the Company and/or to the counterparty or clearing agency is considered materially\nmitigated. Based on the Company’s assessment, there is no requirement for any additional adjustment to derivative valuations specifically for credit.\nThe following tables display the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company often economically hedges the fair value change\nof its assets or liabilities with derivatives and other financial instruments. The tables below display the hedges separately from the hedged items, and therefore do not directly\ndisplay the impact of the Company’s risk management activities:\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nAvailable-for-sale securities $ — $ 8,502,243 $ 3,859 $ 8,506,102\nMortgage servicing rights — — 2,884,304 2,884,304\nMortgage loans held-for-sale — 3,344 — 3,344\nDerivative assets 184 11,910 478 12,572\nTotal assets $ 184 $ 8,517,497 $ 2,888,641 $ 11,406,322\nLiabilities:\nDerivative liabilities $ 16,725 $ 39 $ — $ 16,764\nTotal liabilities $ 16,725 $ 39 $ — $ 16,764\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nDecember 31, 2023\n(in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nAvailable-for-sale securities $ — $ 8,322,999 $ 4,150 $ 8,327,149\nMortgage servicing rights — — 3,052,016 3,052,016\nMortgage loans held-for-sale — 332 — 332\nDerivative assets 72,980 12,311 — 85,291\nTotal assets $ 72,980 $ 8,335,642 $ 3,056,166 $ 11,464,788\nLiabilities:\nDerivative liabilities $ 21,506 $ — $ — $ 21,506\nTotal liabilities $ 21,506 $ — $ — $ 21,506\nThe Company may be required to measure certain assets or liabilities at fair value from time to time. These periodic fair value measures typically result from application of\ncertain impairment measures under U.S. GAAP. These items would constitute nonrecurring fair value measures under ASC 820. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not\nhave any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the periods presented.\nThe valuation of Level 3 instruments requires significant judgment by the third-party pricing vendors and/or management. The third-party pricing vendors and/or management\nrely on inputs such as market price quotations from market makers (either market or indicative levels), original transaction price, recent transactions in the same or similar\ninstruments, and changes in financial ratios or cash flows to determine fair value. Level 3 instruments may also be discounted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, with\nthe amount of such discount estimated by the third-party pricing vendors in the absence of market information. Assumptions used by the third-party pricing vendors due to lack\nof observable inputs may significantly impact the resulting fair value and therefore the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.\n32\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nThe Company’s valuation committee reviews all valuations that are based on pricing information received from third-party pricing vendors. As part of this review, prices are\ncompared against other pricing or input data points in the marketplace, along with internal valuation expertise, to ensure the pricing is reasonable. In addition, the Company\nperforms back-testing of pricing information to validate price information and identify any pricing trends of a third-party pricing vendors.\nIn determining fair value, third-party pricing vendors use various valuation approaches, including market and income approaches. Inputs that are used in determining fair\nvalue of an instrument may include pricing information, credit data, volatility statistics, and other factors. In addition, inputs can be either observable or unobservable.\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary by instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of instrument, whether the instrument is new and\nnot yet established in the marketplace and other characteristics particular to the instrument. The third-party pricing vendor uses prices and inputs that are current as of the\nmeasurement date, including during periods of market dislocations. In periods of market dislocation, the availability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments.\nThis condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified to or from various levels within the fair value hierarchy.\nSecurities that are priced using third-party broker quotations are valued at the bid price (in the case of long positions) or the ask price (in the case of short positions) at the\nclose of trading on the date as of which value is determined. Exchange-traded securities for which no bid or ask price is available are valued at the last traded price. OTC\nderivative contracts, including interest rate swap and swaption agreements, are valued by the Company using observable inputs, specifically quotations received from third-party\nbrokers. Exchange-traded derivative instruments, including futures and options on futures, are valued based on quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of the Company’s Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAvailable-For-Sale Mortgage Servicing Interest Rate Lock\n(in thousands) Securities Rights Commitments\nBeginning of period level 3 fair value $ 3,942 $ 3,065,415 $ —\nGains (losses) included in net (loss) income:\nRealized (147) (39,521) —\nUnrealized — (1) (93,828)(2) 478 (3)\nReversal of provision for credit losses 11 — —\nNet gains (losses) included in net (loss) income (136) (133,349) 478\nOther comprehensive income 53 — —\nPurchases/additions — 43,254 —\nSales — (91,103) —\nSettlements — 87 —\nGross transfers into level 3 — — —\nGross transfers out of level 3 — — —\nEnd of period level 3 fair value $ 3,859 $ 2,884,304 $ 478\nChange in unrealized gains or losses for the period included in earnings for assets\nheld at the end of the reporting period $ — (4) $ (65,594)(5) $ 478 (6)\nChange in unrealized gains or losses for the period included in other comprehensive\nincome (loss) for assets held at the end of the reporting period $ 53 $ — $ —\n33\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAvailable-For-Sale Mortgage Servicing Interest Rate Lock\n(in thousands) Securities Rights Commitments\nBeginning of period level 3 fair value $ 4,150 $ 3,052,016 $ —\nGains (losses) included in net (loss) income:\nRealized (438) (145,969) —\nUnrealized — (1) 775 (2) 478 (3)\nReversal of provision for credit losses (100) — —\nNet gains (losses) included in net (loss) income (538) (145,194) 478\nOther comprehensive income 247 — —\nPurchases/additions — 87,390 —\nSales — (109,284) —\nSettlements — (624) —\nGross transfers into level 3 — — —\nGross transfers out of level 3 — — —\nEnd of period level 3 fair value $ 3,859 $ 2,884,304 $ 478\nChange in unrealized gains or losses for the period included in earnings for assets\nheld at the end of the reporting period $ — (4) $ 9,505 (5) $ 478 (6)\nChange in unrealized gains or losses for the period included in other comprehensive\nincome (loss) for assets held at the end of the reporting period $ (535) $ — $ —\n____________________\n(1) The change in unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities accounted for under the fair value option was recorded in gain (loss) on investment securities on the condensed\nconsolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n(2) The change in unrealized gains or losses on MSR was recorded in (loss) gain on servicing asset on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n(3) The change in unrealized gains or losses on IRLCs was recorded in gain on mortgage loans held-for-sale on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)\n(4) The change in unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities accounted for under the fair value option that were held at the end of the reporting period was recorded in gain (loss) on\ninvestment securities on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n(5) The change in unrealized gains or losses on MSR that were held at the end of the reporting period was recorded in (loss) gain on servicing asset on the condensed consolidated statements of\ncomprehensive income (loss).\n(6) The change in unrealized gains or losses on IRLCs that were held at the end of the reporting period was recorded in gain on mortgage loans held-for-sale on the condensed consolidated\nstatements of comprehensive income (loss).\nNo transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 were made during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The significant unobservable inputs used by the third-\nparty pricing vendors included expected default, severity and discount rate. Significant increases (decreases) in any of the inputs in isolation may result in significantly lower\n(higher) fair value measurement.\n34\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nThe Company also used multiple third-party pricing vendors in the fair value measurement of its Level 3 MSR.

The Company did not hold any IRLCs at December 31, 2023. The table below presents information about the pull-through rates used in the valuation of\nIRLCs at September 30, 2024:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nUnobservable Input Range Weighted Average (1)\nPull-through rate 59.3% - 97.0% 80.2%\n___________________\n(1) Calculation utilizes underlying loan principal balance for weighting purposes.\nCertain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only\nin certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment. Upon the occurrence of certain events, the Company re-measures the fair value of long-lived assets,\nincluding property, plant and equipment, operating lease right of use assets, intangible assets and goodwill if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the\ncurrent period. No instances requiring re-measurement of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis occurred during the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nIn accordance with ASC 820, the Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized in the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets, for which fair value can be estimated.\nThe following describes the Company’s methods for estimating the fair value for financial instruments.\n• AFS securities, MSR, mortgage loans held-for-sale and derivative assets and liabilities are recurring fair value measurements; carrying value equals fair value. See\ndiscussion of valuation methods and assumptions within the Fair Value Measurements section of this Note 12.\n• Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash have a carrying value which approximates fair value because of the short maturities of these instruments. The Company\ncategorizes the fair value measurement of these assets as Level 1.\n• Reverse repurchase agreements have a carrying value which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The Company categorizes the fair value\nmeasurement of these assets as Level 2.\n35\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\n• The carrying value of repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities and warehouse facilities that mature in less than one year generally approximates fair value due\nto the short maturities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $650.0 million under repurchase agreements and $1.0 billion under\nrevolving credit facilities that are considered long-term. The Company’s long-term repurchase agreements and revolving credit facilities have floating rates based on an\nindex plus a spread and the credit spread is typically consistent with those demanded in the market. Accordingly, the interest rates on these borrowings are at market and\nthus carrying value approximates fair value. The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these liabilities as Level 2.\n• Term notes payable are recorded at outstanding principal balance, net of any unamortized deferred debt issuance costs. In determining the fair value of term notes\npayable, management judgment may be used to arrive at fair value that considers prices obtained from third-party pricing vendors, broker quotes received and other\napplicable market data. If observable market prices are not available or insufficient to determine fair value due principally to illiquidity in the marketplace, then fair\nvalue is based upon internally developed models that are primarily based on observable market-based inputs but also include unobservable market data inputs (including\nprepayment speeds, delinquency levels, and credit losses). The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these liabilities as Level 2.\n• Convertible senior notes are carried at their unpaid principal balance, net of any unamortized deferred issuance costs. The Company estimates the fair value of its\nconvertible senior notes using the market transaction price nearest to September 30, 2024. The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these assets as Level\n2.\nThe following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values of assets and liabilities that are required to be recorded or disclosed at fair value at September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(in thousands) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value\nAssets:\nAvailable-for-sale securities $ 8,506,102 $ 8,506,102 $ 8,327,149 $ 8,327,149\nMortgage servicing rights $ 2,884,304 $ 2,884,304 $ 3,052,016 $ 3,052,016\nMortgage loans held-for-sale $ 3,344 $ 3,344 $ 332 $ 332\nCash and cash equivalents $ 522,581 $ 522,581 $ 729,732 $ 729,732\nRestricted cash $ 89,125 $ 89,125 $ 65,101 $ 65,101\nDerivative assets $ 12,572 $ 12,572 $ 85,291 $ 85,291\nReverse repurchase agreements $ 359,180 $ 359,180 $ 284,091 $ 284,091\nOther assets $ 31,283 $ 31,283 $ 31,373 $ 31,373\nLiabilities:\nRepurchase agreements $ 8,763,400 $ 8,763,400 $ 8,020,207 $ 8,020,207\nRevolving credit facilities $ 999,171 $ 999,171 $ 1,329,171 $ 1,329,171\nWarehouse facilities $ 3,017 $ 3,017 $ — $ —\nTerm notes payable $ — $ — $ 295,271 $ 289,653\nConvertible senior notes $ 259,815 $ 257,994 $ 268,582 $ 254,232\nDerivative liabilities $ 16,764 $ 16,764 $ 21,506 $ 21,506\nNote 13.

The VFN is collateralized by the Company’s MSR. As of December 31, 2023, MSR repurchase agreements of $58.6 million were secured by a portion of the\nterm notes issued in connection with the Company’s securitization of MSR and repurchased by the Company. Prior to their maturity and repayment during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, the term notes were collateralized by the Company’s MSR.\nAlthough the transactions under repurchase agreements represent committed borrowings until maturity, the respective lender retains the right to mark the underlying collateral\nto fair value.

The Company does not anticipate any defaults by its repurchase agreement counterparties. There can be no\nassurance, however, that any such default or defaults will not occur.\nNote 14. Revolving Credit Facilities\nTo finance MSR assets and related servicing advance obligations, the Company has entered into revolving credit facilities collateralized by the value of the MSR and/or\nservicing advances pledged. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding short- and long-term borrowings under revolving credit facilities\nof $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion with a weighted average borrowing rate of 8.11% and 8.66% and weighted average remaining maturities of 1.8 and 1.1 years, respectively.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, borrowings under revolving credit facilities had the following remaining maturities:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nWithin 30 days $ — $ —\n30 to 59 days — —\n60 to 89 days — —\n90 to 119 days — —\n120 to 364 days — 324,300\nOne year and over 999,171 1,004,871\nTotal $ 999,171 $ 1,329,171\nAlthough the transactions under revolving credit facilities represent committed borrowings from the time of funding until maturity, the respective lender retains the right to\nmark the underlying collateral to fair value. A reduction in the value of pledged assets below a designated threshold would require the Company to provide additional collateral or\npay down the facility. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, MSR with a carrying value of $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, was pledged as collateral for\nthe Company’s future payment obligations under its MSR revolving credit facilities.

The Company does not anticipate any defaults by its revolving credit facility counterparties, although there can be no assurance that any such default or defaults\nwill not occur.\nNote 15. Warehouse Facilities\nTo finance origination activities, the Company has entered into warehouse facilities collateralized by the value of the mortgage loans pledged for a period of up to 90 days or\nuntil they are sold to the GSEs or other third-party investors in the secondary market, typically within 30 days of origination. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had\noutstanding short-term borrowings under warehouse facilities of $3.0 million with a weighted average borrowing rate of 7.34% and weighted average remaining maturities of 87\ndays. The Company did not have any outstanding borrowings under warehouse facilities as of December 31, 2023.\n38\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, borrowings under warehouse facilities had the following remaining maturities:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nWithin 30 days $ — $ —\n30 to 59 days — —\n60 to 89 days 3,017 —\n90 to 119 days — —\n120 to 364 days — —\nOne year and over — —\nTotal $ 3,017 $ —\nAlthough the transactions under warehouse facilities represent committed borrowings from the time of funding until maturity, the respective lender retains the right to mark\nthe underlying collateral to fair value.

As of September 30, 2024, mortgage loans held-for-sale with a carrying value of $3.1 million were pledged as collateral for the Company’s future payment\nobligations under its warehouse facilities. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, $0.1 million of cash was held in restricted accounts as collateral for the future payment\nobligations of outstanding warehouse facility balances. The Company does not anticipate any defaults by its warehouse facility counterparties, although there can be no assurance\nthat any such default or defaults will not occur.\nNote 16. Term Notes Payable\nPrior to its maturity and repayment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the debt issued in connection with the Company’s on-balance sheet MSR securitization\nwas classified as term notes payable. Term notes payable were carried at outstanding principal balance, net of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs on the Company’s\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance of the Company’s term notes was $295.8 million and the balance net of\nunamortized deferred debt issuance costs was $295.3 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s outstanding term notes payable had a weighted average interest rate of\n8.27% and weighted average remaining maturity of 0.5 years. At December 31, 2023, the Company pledged MSR with a carrying value of $397.9 million and weighted average\nunderlying loan coupon of 3.32% as collateral for term notes payable. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, $0.2 million of cash was held in restricted accounts as collateral for\nthe future payment obligations of outstanding term notes payable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company’s outstanding term notes matured and were\nrepaid in full.\nNote 17. Convertible Senior Notes\nThe Company’s convertible senior notes are unsecured, pay interest semiannually at a rate of 6.25% per annum and are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of\nthe Company’s common stock. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the notes had a conversion rate of 33.8752 and 33.8752 shares of common stock per $1,000\nprincipal amount of the notes, respectively. The notes will mature in January 2026, unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms.\nThe Company does not have the right to redeem its convertible senior notes prior to maturity, but may repurchase the notes in open market or privately negotiated transactions\nat the same or differing price without giving prior notice to or obtaining any consent of the holders. The Company may also be required to repurchase the notes from holders\nunder certain circumstances. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased $10.0 million principal amount of its convertible senior notes in open\nmarket transactions for an aggregate cost of $9.7 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased $15.6 million principal amount of its\nconvertible senior notes in open market transactions for an aggregate cost of $13.2 million. The difference between the consideration transferred and the carrying value of the\nconvertible notes repurchased resulted in a gain of $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nrecorded within the other income line item on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The Company did not repurchase any of its convertible\nsenior notes during the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\n39\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $261.9 million and $271.9 million principal amount of convertible senior notes, respectively, remained outstanding. The\noutstanding amount due on the notes as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $259.8 million and $268.6 million, respectively, net of unamortized deferred issuance\ncosts.\nNote 18. Commitments and Contingencies\nThe following represent the material commitments and contingencies of the Company as of September 30, 2024:\nLegal and regulatory. The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely involved in numerous legal and regulatory proceedings, including but not limited to judicial, arbitration,\nregulatory and governmental proceedings related to matters that arise in connection with the conduct of the Company’s business. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of\nadjudication, arbitration or investigation and may consist of a variety of claims, including common law tort and contract claims, consumer protection-related claims and claims\nunder other laws and regulations. Any legal proceedings or actions brought against the Company may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, business\nimprovement orders, consent orders, supervisory agreements, restrictions on business activities, or other results adverse to the Company, which could materially and negatively\naffect its business. The Company seeks to resolve all litigation and regulatory matters in the manner management believes is in the best interest of the Company and contests\nliability, allegations of wrongdoing, and, where applicable, the amount of damages or scope of any penalties or other relief sought as appropriate in each pending matter. Under\nASC 450, Contingencies, or ASC 450, liabilities are established for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably\nestimated. The actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts established or the range of reasonably possible loss disclosed for\nthose claims.\nAs previously disclosed, on July 15, 2020, the Company provided PRCM Advisers LLC with a notice of termination of the Management Agreement for “cause” in accordance\nwith Section 15(a) of the Management Agreement. The Company terminated the Management Agreement for “cause” on the basis of certain material breaches and certain events\nof gross negligence on the part of PRCM Advisers in the performance of its duties under the Management Agreement. On July 21, 2020, PRCM Advisers filed a complaint\nagainst the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, or the Court. Subsequently, Pine River Domestic Management L.P. and Pine River\nCapital Management L.P. were added as plaintiffs to the matter. As amended, the complaint, or the Federal Complaint, alleges, among other things, the misappropriation of trade\nsecrets in violation of both the Defend Trade Secrets Act and New York common law, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unfair\ncompetition and business practices, unjust enrichment, conversion, and tortious interference with contract. The Federal Complaint seeks, among other things, an order enjoining\nthe Company from making any use of or disclosing PRCM Advisers’ trade secret, proprietary, or confidential information; damages in an amount to be determined at a hearing\nand/or trial; disgorgement of the Company’s wrongfully obtained profits; and fees and costs incurred by the plaintiffs in pursuing the action. The Company has filed its answer to\nthe Federal Complaint and made counterclaims against PRCM Advisers and Pine River Capital Management L.P. On May 5, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment on\nthe pleadings, seeking judgment in their favor on all but one of the Company’s counterclaims and on one of the Company’s affirmative defenses. The Company opposed the\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings. On August 10, 2023, the motion for judgment on the pleadings was granted in part and denied in part. The discovery period has ended. On\nNovember 8, 2023, the Company and the plaintiffs filed motions for summary judgment, seeking judgment in their favor on the pending claims and counterclaims. Each party\nopposed the other party’s motion for summary judgment. The motions for summary judgment are fully briefed. The Company’s board of directors believes the Federal Complaint\nis without merit and that the Company has fully complied with the terms of the Management Agreement.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements do not recognize a contingency liability or disclose a range of reasonably possible loss\nunder ASC 450 because management does not believe that a loss or expense related to the Federal Complaint is probable or reasonably estimable. The specific factors that limit\nthe Company’s ability to reasonably estimate a loss or expense related to the Federal Complaint are that the matter is not sufficiently advanced and the outcome of litigation is\nuncertain. If and when management believes losses associated with the Federal Complaint are a probable future event that may result in a loss or expense to the Company and the\nloss or expense is reasonably estimable, the Company will recognize a contingency liability and resulting loss in such period.\nBased on information currently available, management is not aware of any other legal or regulatory claims that would have a material effect on the Company’s condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and therefore no accrual is required as of September 30, 2024.\n40\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nNote 19.

Effective as of the fixed-to-floating rate conversion date and onward, dividends will accumulate on a floating rate basis according to the terms\ndisclosed in footnote (3) below.\n(3) On and after the fixed-to-floating rate conversion date, dividends will accumulate and be payable quarterly at a percentage of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference equal to a floating base\nrate plus the spread indicated with respect to each series of preferred stock. The original floating base rate applicable to each preferred series was three-month USD-LIBOR, which ceased to be\npublished on June 30, 2023. Under the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the replacement reference rate for three-month USD-LIBOR is three-\nmonth CME Term SOFR plus a tenor spread adjustment of 0.26161%. As a result, based on the terms of the LIBOR Act, the Company expects that the floating base rate with respect to each\nseries of preferred stock, following the applicable conversion date, will be three-month CME SOFR plus a tenor spread of 0.26161%.\nFor each series of preferred stock, the Company may redeem the stock on or after the redemption eligible date in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time. The\nCompany may also purchase shares of preferred stock from time to time in the open market by tender or in privately negotiated transactions. Each series of preferred stock has a\npar value of $0.01 per share and a liquidation and redemption price of $25.00, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon up to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nThrough September 30, 2024, the Company had declared and paid all required quarterly dividends on the Company’s preferred stock.\n41\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nPreferred Share Repurchase Program\nIn June 2022, the Company’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of the Company’s preferred stock, which includes each\nseries shown in the table above under the heading Redeemable Preferred Stock. Preferred shares may be repurchased from time to time through privately negotiated transactions\nor open market transactions, pursuant to trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, or by any\ncombination of such methods. The manner, price, number and timing of preferred share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and applicable\nSEC rules. The preferred share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and, subject to SEC rules, purchases may be commenced or\nsuspended at any time without prior notice. The preferred share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of September 30, 2024, a total of 699,779 shares of the\nCompany’s 8.125% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, 1,340,800 shares of the Company’s 7.625% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and\n2,138,604 shares of the Company’s 7.25% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock had been repurchased by the Company under the program for an aggregate cost of\n$13.3 million, $25.5 million and $38.5 million, respectively, of which 35,047, 280,060 and 170,502 shares were repurchased for a total cost of $0.8 million, $6.4 million and $3.9\nmillion, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

During the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, 3,583 and 12,031 shares were issued for a total proceeds of $48 thousand and $0.2 million, respectively.\nCommon Share Repurchase Program\nThe Company’s common share repurchase program allows for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of 9,375,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. Common shares\nmay be repurchased from time to time through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-\n18 under the Exchange Act, or by any combination of such methods. The manner, price, number and timing of common share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors,\nincluding market conditions and applicable SEC rules. The common share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and, subject to\nSEC rules, purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. The common share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, a total of 3,637,028 shares of common stock had been repurchased by the Company under the program for an aggregate cost of $208.5 million, of which\n593,453 shares were repurchased for a total cost of $7.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

On July 30, 2024, the\nCompany entered into an amendment to the equity distribution agreement, which increased the maximum number of shares of common stock available for sale under the\nagreement to 15,000,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 117,427 shares of common stock were sold under the current equity distribution agreement for net\nproceeds of $2.1 million.

Equity Incentive Plans\nThe Company’s 2021 Equity Incentive Plan, or the Equity Incentive Plan, provides incentive compensation to attract and retain qualified directors, officers, personnel and\nother parties who may provide significant services to the Company. The Equity Incentive Plan is administered by the compensation committee of the Company’s board of\ndirectors. The compensation committee has the full authority to administer and interpret the Equity Incentive Plan, to authorize the granting of awards, to determine the eligibility\nof potential recipients to receive an award, to determine the number of shares of common stock to be covered by each award (subject to the individual participant limitations\nprovided in the Equity Incentive Plan), to determine the terms, provisions and conditions of each award (which may not be inconsistent with the terms of the Equity Incentive\nPlan), to prescribe the form of instruments evidencing awards and to take any other actions and make all other determinations that it deems necessary or appropriate in\nconnection with the Equity Incentive Plan or the administration or interpretation thereof. In connection with this authority, the compensation committee may, among other things,\nestablish performance goals that must be met in order for awards to be granted or to vest, or for the restrictions on any such awards to lapse.\nThe Equity Incentive Plan provides for grants of restricted common stock, restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance-based awards (including performance share units, or\nPSUs), phantom shares, dividend equivalent rights and other equity-based awards. The Equity Incentive Plan is subject to a ceiling of 4,250,000 shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock. The Company’s Second Restated 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, or the Prior Plan, was subject to a ceiling of 1,625,000 shares of the Company’s common stock;\nhowever, following stockholder approval of the Equity Incentive Plan in May 2021, no new awards will be granted under the Prior Plan. All awards previously granted under the\nPrior Plan, which remained outstanding and valid in accordance with their terms, have since vested or been forfeited.\nThe Equity Incentive Plan allows for the Company’s board of directors to expand the types of awards available under the Equity Incentive Plan to include long-term incentive\nplan units in the future. If an award granted under the Equity Incentive Plan expires or terminates, the shares subject to any portion of the award that expires or terminates without\nhaving been exercised or paid, as the case may be, will again become available for the issuance of additional awards. Unless earlier terminated by the Company’s board of\ndirectors, no new award may be granted under the Equity Incentive Plan after the tenth anniversary of the date that the Equity Incentive Plan was approved by the Company’s\nboard of directors. No award may be granted under the Equity Incentive Plan to any person who, assuming payment of all awards held by such person, would own or be deemed\nto own more than 9.8% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock.\n44\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to RSUs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nWeighted Average Weighted Average\nGrant Date Fair Grant Date Fair\nUnits Market Value Units Market Value\nOutstanding at Beginning of Period 613,699 $ 19.11 468,632 $ 23.54\nGranted 434,428 13.91 371,673 16.19\nVested (370,453) (19.30) (221,575) (23.56)\nForfeited (3,739) (18.52) (5,031) (20.20)\nOutstanding at End of Period 673,935 $ 15.65 613,699 $ 19.11\nThe estimated fair value of RSUs on grant date is based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the NYSE on such date. The shares underlying RSUs\ngranted to independent directors are subject to a one-year vesting period. RSUs granted to certain eligible employees vest in three equal annual installments commencing on the\nfirst anniversary of the grant date, as long as such grantee complies with the terms and conditions of the applicable RSU agreement. All RSUs entitle the grantee to receive\ndividend equivalent rights, or DERs, during the vesting period. A DER represents the right to receive a payment equal to the amount of cash dividends declared and payable on\nthe grantee’s unvested and outstanding equity incentive awards. In the case of RSUs, DERs are paid in cash within 60 days of the quarterly dividend payment date based on the\nnumber of unvested and outstanding RSUs held by the grantee on the applicable dividend record date. In the event that an RSU is forfeited, the related DERs which have not yet\nbeen paid shall be forfeited.\nPerformance Share Units\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to PSUs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nWeighted Average Weighted Average\nGrant Date Fair Grant Date Fair\nTarget Units Market Value Target Units Market Value\nOutstanding at Beginning of Period 485,822 $ 24.89 265,261 $ 26.93\nGranted 292,000 16.19 222,208 22.47\nVested (60,777) (34.68) — —\nForfeited (60,442) (30.56) (1,647) (25.21)\nOutstanding at End of Period 656,603 $ 19.60 485,822 $ 24.89\nThe estimated fair value of PSUs on grant date is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. PSUs vest promptly following the completion of a three year performance\nperiod, as long as such grantee complies with the terms and conditions of the applicable PSU award agreement. The number of underlying shares of common stock that vest and\nthat the grantee becomes entitled to receive at the time of vesting will be determined based on the level of achievement of certain Company performance goals during the\nperformance period and will generally range from 0% to 200% of the target number of PSUs granted. All PSUs entitle the grantee to DERs during the vesting period, which\naccrue in the form of additional PSUs reflecting the value of any dividends declared on the Company’s common stock during the vesting period. In the event that a PSU is\nforfeited, the related accrued DERs shall be forfeited.\n45\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nRestricted Common Stock\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to restricted common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nWeighted Average Weighted Average\nGrant Date Fair Grant Date Fair\nShares Market Value Shares Market Value\nOutstanding at Beginning of Period — $ — 42,884 $ 60.91\nGranted — — — —\nVested — — (42,884) (60.91)\nForfeited — — — —\nOutstanding at End of Period — $ — — $ —\nThe estimated fair value of restricted common stock on grant date is based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the NYSE on such date.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized compensation related to\nRSUs, PSUs and restricted common stock granted pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan and/or the Prior Plan of $1.6 million and $9.4 million, respectively. As of September 30,\n2024, the Company had $5.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements. This cost is expected to be recognized\nover a weighted average period of 1.6 years.\nNote 21. Interest Income and Interest Expense\nThe following table presents the components of the Company’s interest income and interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest income:\nAvailable-for-sale securities $ 101,067 $ 107,827 $ 300,883 $ 309,060\nMortgage loans held-for-sale 25 2 29 7\nOther 11,550 15,779 45,466 48,896\nTotal interest income 112,642 123,608 346,378 357,963\nInterest expense:\nRepurchase agreements 123,552 129,298 355,982 350,599\nRevolving credit facilities 26,873 32,526 87,026 87,866\nWarehouse facilities 11 — 11 —\nTerm notes payable — 6,634 12,426 22,516\nConvertible senior notes 4,495 4,636 13,693 14,164\nTotal interest expense 154,931 173,094 469,138 475,145\nNet interest (expense) income $ (42,289) $ (49,486) $ (122,760) $ (117,182)\n46\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nNote 22. Income Taxes\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company qualified to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As long as the\nCompany qualifies as a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on its taxable income to the extent it annually distributes its net taxable\nincome to stockholders, and does not engage in prohibited transactions. The Company intends to distribute 100% of its REIT taxable income and comply with all requirements to\ncontinue to qualify as a REIT. The majority of states also recognize the Company’s REIT status. The Company’s TRSs file separate tax returns and are fully taxed as standalone\nU.S. C corporations. It is assumed that the Company will retain its REIT status and will incur no REIT level taxation as it intends to comply with the REIT regulations and annual\ndistribution requirements.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a benefit from income taxes of $10.5 million and a provision for income taxes of $15.7\nmillion, respectively. The benefit recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to net losses recognized on MSR and operating expenses, offset\nby net income from MSR servicing and mortgage loan origination activities incurred in the Company’s TRSs. The provision recognized during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was primarily due to net income from MSR servicing and mortgage loan origination activities, offset by net losses recognized on MSR and operating\nexpenses incurred in the Company’s TRSs. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a provision for income taxes of $36.4 million\nand $52.2 million, respectively, which was primarily due to net income from MSR servicing activities and net gains recognized on MSR, offset by net losses recognized on\nderivative instruments and operating expenses incurred in the Company’s TRSs.\nBased on the Company’s evaluation, it has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company’s condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements of a contingent tax liability for uncertain tax positions. Additionally, there were no amounts accrued for penalties or interest as of or during the periods\npresented in these condensed consolidated financial statements.\n47\nTable of Contents\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)\nNote 23.

Segment Reporting\nThe Company generally derives its revenues from its investment portfolio of MSR and Agency RMBS, which includes servicing fee income, float income, ancillary and other\nfee income, and interest income, net of premium amortization and discount accretion, and mortgage loan origination activities established primarily as a MSR portfolio defense\nstrategy. The Company’s investment portfolio is subject to market risks, primarily interest rate risk, basis risk and prepayment risk. Management seeks to offset a portion of its\nAgency pool market value exposure through its investment in MSR and interest-only Agency RMBS. The Company’s strategy of pairing Agency RMBS with MSR, with a focus\non managing various associated risks, including interest rate, basis, prepayment, and credit and financing risk, is intended to generate more stable performance, relative to an\ninvestment portfolio of Agency RMBS without MSR, across changing market environments.\nThe Company’s investment portfolio is managed as a whole and resources are allocated and financial performance is assessed by the Company’s Chief Investment Officer, its\nchief operating decision maker, or the CODM, based on total assets reported on the consolidated balance sheet and comprehensive income (loss) reported on the consolidated\nstatement of comprehensive income (loss). The Company’s CODM views consolidated expense information related to interest expenses, compensation and benefits, other\noperating expenses and tax expenses to be significant. Consolidated comprehensive income (loss) is also used by the CODM to monitor actual results and benchmarking to that\nof its peers, the results of which are used to establish management’s compensation. Investment and hedging decisions are assessed collectively by the CODM, based on the inputs\ndiscussed above. Accordingly, the Company consists of a single operating and reportable segment and the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are\npresented as a single reportable segment.\nNote 25. Subsequent Events\nEvents subsequent to September 30, 2024 were evaluated through the date these condensed consolidated financial statements were issued and no other additional events were\nidentified requiring further disclosure in these condensed consolidated financial statements.\n49\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nGeneral\nWe are a Maryland corporation that invests in, finances and manages MSR and Agency RMBS, and, through our operational platform, RoundPoint Mortgage Servicing LLC,\nor RoundPoint, we are one of the largest servicers of conventional loans in the country. We are structured as an internally-managed REIT and our common stock is listed on the\nNYSE under the symbol “TWO”. We seek to leverage our core competencies of understanding and managing interest rate and prepayment risk to invest in our portfolio of MSR\nand Agency RMBS. Our objective is to deliver more stable performance, relative to RMBS portfolios without MSR, across changing market environments, and we are acutely\nfocused on creating sustainable stockholder value over the long term.\nEffective September 30, 2023, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, TH MSR Holdings LLC (formerly Matrix Financial Services Corporation), acquired RoundPoint from\nFreedom Mortgage Corporation after the completion of customary closing conditions and receiving the required regulatory and GSE approvals. Upon closing, all servicing and\norigination licenses and operational capabilities remained with RoundPoint, and RoundPoint became a wholly owned subsidiary of TH MSR Holdings. Management believes this\nacquisition will add value for stakeholders of Two Harbors through cost savings achieved by bringing the servicing of our MSR portfolio in-house, greater control over our MSR\nportfolio and the associated cash flows, and the ability to participate more fully in the mortgage finance space as opportunities arise.\nTH MSR Holdings holds the requisite approvals from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to own and manage MSR, which represent a contractual right to control the servicing of a\nmortgage loan, the obligation to service the loan in accordance with applicable laws and requirements and the right to collect a fee for the performance of servicing activities,\nsuch as collecting principal and interest from a borrower and distributing those payments to the owner of the loan. TH MSR Holdings acquires MSR from third-party originators\nthrough flow and bulk purchases, as well as through the recapture of MSR on loans in its MSR portfolio that refinance. TH MSR Holdings does not directly service mortgage\nloans; instead, it engages its wholly owned subsidiary, RoundPoint, to handle substantially all servicing functions for the mortgage loans underlying our MSR. Our MSR business\nleverages our core competencies in prepayment and interest rate risk analytics, and the MSR assets may provide offsetting risks to our Agency RMBS, hedging both interest rate\nand mortgage spread risk.\nRoundPoint has approvals from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to service residential mortgage loans, and services mortgage loans underlying TH MSR Holdings’ MSR as well\nas MSR owned by third parties. Late in the second quarter, RoundPoint began operating its in-house, direct-to-consumer originations platform, which was established primarily\nas a MSR portfolio defense strategy to retain or recapture existing borrowers by providing them with competitive refinance and purchase mortgage options. The originations\nplatform also originates loans for new borrowers that do not currently have a mortgage loan serviced by RoundPoint and also brokers second lien loans to our borrowers. For our\nown MSR portfolio, adding new or recaptured MSR through our origination platform is intended to hedge faster than expected MSR prepayment speeds in a refinance\nenvironment, and requires less capital relative to acquiring MSR through flow and bulk purchases from third-party originators. In addition, origination activities are generally\ncounter-cyclical to MSR, which provides supplementary sources of profitability to our stockholders while also hedging our MSR. RoundPoint also intends to offer a suite of\nancillary and home equity products to our customers, including second lien mortgage loans.\nOur Agency RMBS portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed rate mortgage-backed securities backed by single-family and multi-family mortgage loans. All of our principal\nand interest Agency RMBS are Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgage pass-through certificates or collateralized mortgage obligations, or Ginnie Mae mortgage pass-through\ncertificates, which are backed by the guarantee of the U.S. government. The majority of our Agency RMBS portfolio is comprised of whole pool certificates.\nWe seek to deploy moderate leverage as part of our investment strategy. We generally finance our Agency RMBS through short- and long-term borrowings structured as\nrepurchase agreements. We also finance our MSR through revolving credit facilities, repurchase agreements and convertible senior notes. Additionally, we finance our origination\nof mortgage loans through warehouse facilities.\nWe have elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To qualify as a REIT we are required to meet certain investment and operating tests and annual\ndistribution requirements. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable\nincome to stockholders, do not participate in prohibited transactions and maintain our intended qualification as a REIT. However, certain activities that we may perform may\ncause us to earn income which will not be qualifying income for REIT purposes. We have designated certain of our subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, as defined\nin the Code, to engage in such activities. We also operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. Certain of our subsidiaries have obtained the requisite licenses and approvals to own and manage MSR and to originate and directly\nservice residential mortgage loans.\n50\nTable of Contents\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains, or incorporates by reference, not only historical information, but also forward-looking statements within the meaning of\nSection 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, and that are subject\nto the safe harbors created by such sections.

Forward-looking statements speak\nonly as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events,\nor otherwise.\nImportant factors, among others, that may affect our actual results include:\n• changes in interest rates and the market value of our target assets;\n• changes in prepayment rates of mortgages underlying our target assets;\n• the state of the credit markets and other general economic conditions, particularly as they affect the price of earning assets, the credit status of borrowers and home\nprices;\n• legislative and regulatory actions affecting our business;\n• the availability and cost of our target assets;\n• the availability and cost of financing for our target assets, including repurchase agreement financing, revolving credit facilities and convertible notes;\n• the impact of any increases in payment delinquencies and defaults on the mortgages comprising and underlying our target assets, including additional servicing costs\nand servicing advance obligations on the MSR assets we own;\n• changes in liquidity in the market for real estate securities, the re-pricing of credit risk in the capital markets, inaccurate ratings of securities by rating agencies, rating\nagency downgrades of securities, and increases in the supply of real estate securities available-for-sale;\n• changes in the values of securities we own and the impact of adjustments reflecting those changes on our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income\n(loss) and balance sheets, including our stockholders’ equity;\n• our ability to generate cash flow from our target assets;\n• our ability to effectively execute and realize the benefits of strategic transactions and initiatives we have pursued or may in the future pursue;\n• our ability to recognize the benefits of our acquisition of RoundPoint and to manage the risks associated with operating a mortgage loan servicer and originator;\n• our decision to terminate our Management Agreement with PRCM Advisers LLC and the ongoing litigation related to such termination;\n• changes in the competitive landscape within our industry, including changes that may affect our ability to attract and retain personnel;\n• our exposure to legal and regulatory claims, penalties or enforcement activities, including those arising from our ownership and management of MSR and prior\nsecuritization transactions;\n• our exposure to counterparties involved in our MSR business and prior securitization transactions and our ability to enforce representations and warranties made by\nthem;\n• our ability to acquire MSR and successfully operate our seller-servicer subsidiaries;\n• our ability to manage various operational and regulatory risks associated with our business;\n• interruptions in or impairments to our communications and information technology systems;\n• our ability to maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting;\n• our ability to establish, adjust and maintain appropriate hedges for the risks in our portfolio;\n• our ability to maintain our REIT qualification for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and\n51\nTable of Contents\n• limitations imposed on our business due to our REIT status and our status as exempt from registration under the 1940 Act.\nFactors Affecting our Operating Results\nOur net interest income includes income from our securities portfolio, including the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts, and mortgage\nloans held-for-sale. Net interest income, as well as our servicing income, net of servicing costs, will fluctuate primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates, our\nfinancing costs and prepayment speeds on our assets. Interest rates, financing costs and prepayment rates vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial\nmarkets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty.\nFair Value Measurement\nA significant portion of our assets and liabilities are reported at fair value and, therefore, our condensed consolidated balance sheets and statements of comprehensive income\n(loss) are significantly affected by fluctuations in market prices. At September 30, 2024, approximately 88.5% of our total assets, or $11.4 billion, consisted of financial\ninstruments recorded at fair value. See Note 12 - Fair Value to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for descriptions\nof valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models, key inputs to those models and significant assumptions\nutilized. Although we execute various hedging strategies to mitigate our exposure to changes in fair value, we cannot fully eliminate our exposure to volatility caused by\nfluctuations in market prices.\nAny temporary change in the fair value of our AFS securities, excluding certain AFS securities for which we have elected the fair value option, is recorded as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive loss and does not impact our reported income (loss) for U.S. GAAP purposes, or GAAP net income (loss). However, changes in the provision\nfor credit losses on AFS securities are recognized immediately in GAAP net income (loss). Our GAAP net income (loss) is also affected by fluctuations in market prices on the\nremainder of our financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, including interest rate swap and swaption agreements and certain other derivative instruments (i.e., Agency\nto-be-announced securities, or TBAs, options on TBAs, futures, options on futures, inverse interest-only securities, interest rate lock commitments and forward loan sale\ncommitments), which are accounted for as derivative trading instruments under U.S. GAAP, fair value option elected AFS securities, MSR and mortgage loans held-for-sale.\nWe have numerous internal controls in place to help ensure the appropriateness of fair value measurements. Significant fair value measures are subject to detailed analytics\nand management review and approval. Our entire MSR and Agency RMBS investment portfolio reported at fair value is priced by third-party brokers and/or by independent\npricing vendors. We generally receive three or more broker and vendor quotes on pass-through Agency P&I RMBS, and generally receive multiple broker or vendor quotes on all\nother securities, including interest-only and inverse interest-only Agency RMBS. We also receive multiple vendor quotes for the MSR in our investment portfolio. For Agency\nRMBS, the third-party pricing vendors and brokers use pricing models that commonly incorporate such factors as coupons, primary and secondary mortgage rates, rate reset\nperiods, issuer, prepayment speeds, credit enhancements and expected life of the security. For MSR, vendors use pricing models that generally incorporate observable inputs such\nas principal balance, note rate, geographical location, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, FICO, appraised value and other loan characteristics, along with observed market yields and\ntrading levels. Pricing vendors will customarily incorporate servicing fee, ancillary income, and earnings rate on escrow as observable inputs. Unobservable or model-driven\ninputs include forecast per loan annual cost to service, forecast cumulative defaults, default curve, forecast loss severity and forecast voluntary prepayment.\nWe evaluate the prices we receive from both third-party brokers and pricing vendors by comparing those prices to actual purchase and sale transactions, our internally\nmodeled prices calculated based on market observable rates and credit spreads, and to each other both in current and prior periods. We review and may challenge valuations from\nthird-party brokers and pricing vendors to ensure that such quotes and valuations are indicative of fair value as a result of this analysis. We then estimate the fair value of each\nsecurity based upon the median of the final broker quotes received, and we estimate the fair value of MSR based upon the average of prices received from third-party vendors,\nsubject to internally-established hierarchy and override procedures.\nWe utilize “bid side” pricing for our Agency RMBS and, as a result, certain assets, especially the most recent purchases, may realize a markdown due to the “bid-offer”\nspread. To the extent that this occurs on available-for-sale securities not accounted for under the fair value option, any economic effect of this would be reflected in accumulated\nother comprehensive loss.\nConsiderable judgment is used in forming conclusions and estimating inputs to our Level 3 fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs such as interest rate movements,\nprepayments speeds, credit losses and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate. Changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements.\nAccordingly, there is no assurance that our estimates of fair value are indicative of the amounts that would be realized on the ultimate sale or exchange of these assets. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, 22.4% of our total assets were classified as Level 3 fair value assets.\n52\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain judgments and assumptions, based on information available at the time of\nour preparation of the financial statements, in determining accounting estimates used in preparation of the statements. Accounting estimates are considered critical if the estimate\nrequires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates reasonably could have been\nused in the reporting period or changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period that would have a material impact on our financial\ncondition, results of operations or cash flows. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our most critical accounting policies involve our fair valuation of AFS securities, MSR and derivative\ninstruments.\nThe methods used by us to estimate fair value for AFS securities, MSR and derivative instruments may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net\nrealizable value or reflective of future fair value. Furthermore, while we believe that our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use\nof different methodologies, or assumptions, to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. We\nuse prices obtained from third-party pricing vendors or broker quotes deemed indicative of market activity and current as of the measurement date, which in periods of market\ndislocation, may have reduced transparency. For more information on our fair value measurements, see Note 12 - Fair Value to the condensed consolidated financial statements,\nincluded under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Additionally, the key economic assumptions and sensitivity of the fair value of MSR to immediate adverse changes\nin these assumptions are presented in Note 6 - Servicing Activities to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-\nQ.\nMarket Conditions and Outlook\nInterest rates fell and the yield curve steepened in the third quarter of 2024 with the Federal Reserve, or the Fed, cutting rates by 50 basis points at their September 2024\nmeeting. Reports on inflation showed further progress towards the Fed’s two percent target and signs of gradual cooling of the labor market gave the Fed enough evidence to cut\nrates for the first time in this cycle. Prior to the September meeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had characterized rates as being clearly restrictive, and a 50 basis point cut, in\nPowell’s words, was “a good strong start” in getting rates back to neutral in order to avoid a rapid deterioration in the labor market. Updated Fed projections showed another 50\nbasis points in cuts for 2024 (for a total of 100 basis points), followed by another 100 basis points in 2025. At the start of the third quarter, market expectations were for 50 basis\npoints in cuts for all of 2024, marking another quarter of rapidly changing forecasts for the short-end of the yield curve. Ultimately, the 10-year Treasury yield finished the\nquarter 62 basis points lower at 3.75% while the 2-year Treasury yield fell by 111 basis points to 3.64%, resulting in the first positively sloped curve between 2-year and 10-year\nTreasury notes since 2022.\nAgainst a backdrop of the Fed guiding the economy towards a soft landing scenario together with lower interest rates, risk assets performed well over the quarter. The S&P\n500 was higher by about 5.5%, and with interest rates falling and the yield curve steepening, demand remained high for fixed-income assets. Our preferred implied volatility\ngauge, 2-year options on 10-year rates, decreased from 104 to 94 basis points on an annualized basis, close to its lowest level for 2024. The nominal spread on current coupon\nRMBS finished 20 basis points tighter at +107 to the Treasury curve, while the option-adjusted spread finished 6 basis points tighter at +18. Current coupon nominal spreads\nremained wide compared to the longer-term non-QE average of 83 basis points, while option-adjusted spreads finished tighter to the longer-term average of 29 basis points.\nHedged mortgage performance varied across coupons, with longer duration lower coupons outperforming while higher coupons were negatively impacted by the rapid decline in\nrates and increased concerns over prepayments. With regard to supply, projected 2024 net supply of Agency RMBS is running at approximately a $200 billion pace, similar to\n2023.\nPrimary mortgage rates dropped about 75 basis points in the third quarter to just above 6%, which garnered attention from the media and spurred an uptick in prepayments for\nhigh coupon originations from the last two years. Overall constant prepayment rates, or CPRs, for 30-year Agency RMBS increased 8% quarter-on-quarter to 6.5% CPR in the\nOctober 2024 report (reflecting September 2024 activity). Prepayments have begun to display a bifurcated pattern: they are speeding up for those newer high coupon mortgages\nbut they continue to be very slow for the locked-in, low coupon COVID-era borrowers. Because of this, our MSR portfolio has not noticeably responded to the decrease in\nmortgage rates as the quarterly prepayment rate was unchanged at 5.3%.\nThe housing market remains in a state of gridlock. Exiting home sales have slowed, running behind the pace of 2023 and projected to be the weakest year in almost two\ndecades. Inventory has begun to climb off of very low levels and homes are sitting on the market longer. Many sellers withdraw listings that don't sell and are content to keep\ntheir low rate mortgages rather than sell for a price below market. Home prices appear to be headed toward a small gain for 2024 compared to 2023.\n53\nTable of Contents\nRMBS funding markets remained stable and liquid throughout the quarter with ample financing being readily available. Spreads for repurchase agreements widened with\nfinancing for RMBS between SOFR plus 24 to 28 basis points. The widening was primarily due to the uncertainty of the Fed’s actions in September. At quarter-end, bank balance\nsheets were temporarily tight owing to a number of factors that included settlements of auctioned Treasury securities as well as banks managing quarter-end reporting metrics.\nPost quarter-end, liquidity and balance sheet room quickly returned easing financing conditions. Similar effects may occur at year-end and we will seek to minimize our exposure\nto year-end funding pressures.\nThe volume of MSR sales continued to normalize from the record volumes of the past few years. This quarter brought approximately $40 billion UPB of supply, bringing the\nyear-to-date total to about $305 billion, about 70% of the pace of 2023. Traded prices have held steady with the supply being easily absorbed by a deep pool of buyers including\nboth banks and non-banks. The number of banks offering MSR financing has broadened and the increased competition has led to a compression in financing spreads.\nAdditionally, we saw the first MSR financing securitizations of the past two years as spreads for the securities returned to sub-300 basis point spreads to SOFR.\nLooking ahead, we continue to see attractive levered returns on our portfolio composed of Agency MSR and RMBS. Despite the recent tightening of RMBS spreads, nominal\nspreads are still wider than long-term history, reflecting continued higher than average implied volatility. On an option-adjusted spread basis, RMBS look less compelling, which\nindicates that spread tightening will need to be driven by increased demand (most likely by depository institutions) and/or further declines in volatility. Both of these factors will\nbe most influenced by the quantity and timing of more cuts in rates by the Fed, which themselves remain data dependent. We expect that the MSR market will continue to be\nstable and well supported given the overall demand for the asset class. Despite mortgage rates declining, our MSR portfolio, with an average mortgage rate of 3.43% remains far\nout of the money with only 1% of the underlying mortgage loans 50 basis points or more below current mortgage rates. Barring a significant decline in mortgage rates, housing\nturnover will remain the key driver for prepayments of our MSR. Turnover typically slows in the fall and winter months, hence we expect prepayment speeds to decline modestly\nover the fourth quarter, providing a tailwind for our MSR performance. For the small population of loans that can be refinanced, RoundPoint is now offering refinance\nopportunities to mortgagors on our platform which should mitigate the impact of rising prepayment rates and protect the MSR’s asset value.\nThe following table provides the carrying value of our investment portfolio by asset type:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nAgency RMBS $ 8,514,041 74.7 % $ 8,335,245 73.2 %\nMortgage servicing rights 2,884,304 25.3 % 3,052,016 26.8 %\nOther 3,859 — % 4,150 — %\nTotal $ 11,402,204 $ 11,391,411\nPrepayment speeds and volatility due to interest rates\nOur portfolio is subject to market risks, primarily interest rate risk and prepayment risk. We seek to offset a portion of our Agency pool market value exposure through our\nMSR and interest-only Agency RMBS portfolios. During periods of decreasing interest rates with rising prepayment speeds, the market value of our Agency pools generally\nincreases and the market value of our interest-only securities and MSR generally decreases. The inverse relationship occurs when interest rates rise and prepayments fall. Average\nprepayment speeds for our overall portfolio remained relatively consistent with the prior quarter due primarily to the bifurcated pattern discussed above. In addition to changes in\ninterest rates, changes in home price performance, key employment metrics and government programs, among other macroeconomic factors, can affect prepayment speeds. We\nbelieve our active portfolio management approach, including our asset selection process, positions us to respond to a variety of market scenarios. Although we are unable to\npredict future interest rate movements, our strategy of pairing MSR with Agency RMBS, with a focus on managing various associated risks, including interest rate, prepayment,\ncredit, mortgage spread and financing risk, is intended to generate stable performance, relative to RMBS portfolios without MSR, with a low level of sensitivity to changes in the\nyield curve, prepayments and interest rate cycles.\nThe following table provides the three-month average CPR experienced by our Agency RMBS and MSR during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and the four\nimmediately preceding quarters:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30,\n2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\nAgency RMBS 7.2 % 7.3 % 4.8 % 5.2 % 6.5 %\nMortgage servicing rights 5.3 % 5.3 % 3.9 % 3.8 % 4.9 %\n54\nTable of Contents\nOur Agency RMBS are primarily collateralized by pools of fixed-rate mortgage loans. Our Agency portfolio also includes securities with implicit prepayment protection,\nincluding lower loan balances (securities collateralized by loans of less than $300,000 in initial principal balance), higher LTVs (securities collateralized by loans with LTVs\ngreater than or equal to 80%), certain geographic concentrations, loans secured by investor-owned properties and lower FICO scores. Our overall allocation of Agency RMBS\nand holdings of pools with specific characteristics are viewed in the context of our aggregate portfolio strategy, including MSR and related derivative hedging instruments.\nAdditionally, the selection of securities with certain attributes is driven by the perceived relative value of the securities, which factors in the opportunities in the marketplace, the\ncost of financing and the cost of hedging interest rate, prepayment, credit and other portfolio risks. Accordingly, our Agency RMBS capital allocation reflects management’s\nflexible approach to investing in the marketplace.\nThe following tables provide the carrying value of our Agency RMBS portfolio by underlying mortgage loan rate type:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nGross Weighted Weighted\nPrincipal/ Weighted % Prepayment Average Coupon Allowance for Average Loan\n(dollars in thousands) Current Face Carrying Value Average CPR (1) Protected Rate Amortized Cost Credit Losses Age (months)\nAgency RMBS AFS:\n30-Year Fixed:\n≤ 2.5% $ — $ — — % — % — % $ — $ — —\n3.0% 225,307 203,422 6.3 % 85.6 % 3.7 % 200,225 — 35\n3.5% 61,984 57,791 3.4 % 71.8 % 4.2 % 54,562 — 33\n4.0% 598,568 577,359 6.3 % 100.0 % 4.6 % 590,109 — 52\n4.5% 2,176,867 2,160,730 7.0 % 100.0 % 5.1 % 2,225,267 — 49\n5.0% 1,800,755 1,813,816 6.3 % 100.0 % 5.8 % 1,834,228 — 30\n5.5% 1,170,088 1,190,085 5.2 % 99.8 % 6.4 % 1,180,221 — 27\n6.0% 1,091,580 1,122,918 14.0 % 96.0 % 6.9 % 1,115,566 — 23\n≥ 6.5% 751,112 782,336 7.5 % 100.0 % 7.5 % 772,628 — 8\n7,876,261 7,908,457 7.6 % 98.8 % 5.9 % 7,972,806 — 33\nOther P&I 560,987 569,874 0.1 % — % 5.4 % 557,577 — 12\nInterest-only 501,846 23,912 7.0 % — % 5.4 % 29,209 (2,546) 169\nAgency Derivatives 142,011 11,798 8.3 % — % 6.6 % 15,161 — 233\nTotal Agency RMBS $ 9,081,105 $ 8,514,041 91.8 % $ 8,574,753 $ (2,546)\n55\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2023\nGross Weighted Weighted\nPrincipal/ Weighted % Prepayment Average Coupon Allowance for Average Loan\n(dollars in thousands) Current Face Carrying Value Average CPR (1) Protected Rate Amortized Cost Credit Losses Age (months)\nAgency RMBS AFS:\n30-Year Fixed:\n≤ 2.5% $ 420,720 $ 359,801 3.6 % — % 3.3 % $ 359,188 $ — 30\n3.0% 237,874 211,852 2.6 % 85.4 % 3.7 % 210,850 — 26\n3.5% 125,647 115,675 2.0 % 84.9 % 4.3 % 113,092 — 22\n4.0% 503,451 479,715 5.2 % 100.0 % 4.6 % 508,294 — 49\n4.5% 2,331,021 2,281,535 5.2 % 100.0 % 5.1 % 2,384,460 — 40\n5.0% 2,084,422 2,078,510 3.6 % 100.0 % 5.8 % 2,125,950 — 21\n5.5% 1,358,288 1,370,920 5.4 % 99.8 % 6.4 % 1,371,534 — 18\n6.0% 779,560 795,963 6.1 % 99.8 % 6.9 % 799,184 — 17\n≥ 6.5% 8,448 8,853 7.4 % 97.8 % 7.8 % 9,084 — 249\n7,849,431 7,702,824 4.7 % 94.7 % 5.5 % 7,881,636 — 28\nOther P&I 572,302 569,077 0.8 % — % 5.3 % 564,336 — 9\nInterest-only 840,723 51,098 5.3 % — % 4.3 % 58,567 (3,619) 100\nAgency Derivatives 163,735 12,246 8.0 % — % 6.7 % 17,814 — 225\nTotal Agency RMBS $ 9,426,191 $ 8,335,245 87.5 % $ 8,522,353 $ (3,619)\n____________________\n(1) Weighted average actual one-month CPR released at the beginning of the following month based on RMBS held as of the preceding month-end.\nOur MSR portfolio offers attractive spreads and has many risk reducing characteristics when paired with our Agency RMBS portfolio.

In addition, we held short- and long-\nterm borrowings under revolving credit facilities, warehouse facilities and unsecured convertible senior notes. As of September 30, 2024, the debt-to-equity ratio funding our\nAgency and non-Agency investment securities, MSR and related servicing advances and mortgage loans held-for-sale, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible\nsenior notes, was 4.6:1.0.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we held $522.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $4.8 million of unpledged Agency RMBS and $3.5 million of unpledged non-\nAgency securities. As a result, we had an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on our unpledged securities of approximately $6.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, we\nheld approximately $19.6 million of unpledged MSR and $5.4 million of unpledged servicing advances. Overall, on September 30, 2024, we had $60.1 million unused\ncommitted and $550.0 million unused uncommitted borrowing capacity on MSR financing facilities, and $90.7 million in unused committed borrowing capacity on servicing\nadvance financing facilities. As of September 30, 2024, all of our mortgage loans were pledged for financing and we had $4.0 million unused committed borrowing capacity on\nour warehouse facilities. Generally, unused borrowing capacity may be the result of our election not to utilize certain financing, as well as delays in the timing in which funding\nis provided, insufficient collateral or the inability to meet lenders’ eligibility requirements for specific types of asset classes.\nWe also monitor exposure to our MSR counterparties. We may be required to make representations and warranties to investors in the loans underlying the MSR we own;\nhowever, some of our MSR were purchased on a bifurcated basis, meaning the representation and warranty obligations remain with the seller. If the representations and\nwarranties we make prove to be inaccurate, we may be obligated to repurchase certain mortgage loans, which may impact the profitability of our portfolio. Although we obtain\nsimilar representations and warranties from the counterparty from which we acquired the relevant asset, if those representations and warranties do not directly mirror those we\nmake to the investor, or if we are unable to enforce the representations and warranties against the counterparty for a variety of reasons, including the financial condition or\ninsolvency of the counterparty, we may not be able to seek indemnification from our counterparties for any losses attributable to the breach.\nSummary of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nOur book value per common share for U.S. GAAP purposes was $14.93 at September 30, 2024, a decrease from $15.19 per common share at June 30, 2024, and a decrease\nfrom $15.21 per common share at December 31, 2023. The decline in book value for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by losses\nrecognized on MSR and derivatives and dividends declared, offset by net servicing income and unrealized gains recognized on AFS securities. Our comprehensive income\nattributable to common stockholders was $19.4 million and comprehensive loss attributable to common stockholders was $34.7 million for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to comprehensive loss attributable to common stockholders of $56.8 million and $34.1 million for the three and nine months\nended September 30,

rights and advances not shown as these assets do not earn interest.\n(4) U.S. Treasury securities effectively borrowed under reverse repurchase agreements.\nThe increase in yields on AFS securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023 was driven by net purchases of\nAFS securities with lower unamortized premiums. The decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of AFS securities for the three months ended September 30, 2024,\nas compared to the same period in 2023, was due to declining interest rates. The increase in cost of funds associated with the financing of AFS securities for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was due to rising interest rates throughout the first half of 2024.\nYields on reverse repurchase agreements remained consistent for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in yields\non reverse repurchase agreements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was the result of rising interest rates throughout the\nfirst half of 2024. However, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, these yields were offset by the cost of financing the associated repurchase agreements collateralized\nby U.S. Treasury securities. We did not hold any repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe slight decrease in cost of funds associated with the financing of MSR assets and related servicing advance obligations for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily the result of a greater portion of MSR financing from repurchase agreements versus revolving credit facilities. Our\nrepurchase agreements, on average, carry lower floating rate spreads than our revolving credit facilities. We have one revolving credit facility in place to finance our servicing\nadvance obligations, which are included in other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nLate in the second quarter of 2024, RoundPoint began operating its in-house, direct-to-consumer originations platform. Prior to the launch of originations, our mortgage loans\nheld-for-sale consisted of a handful of loans purchased from the collateral underlying our MSR, which were not pledged for any form of financing.\nThe cost of funds associated with our convertible senior notes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was\nconsistent.\n60\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the components of the yield earned on our AFS securities portfolio as a percentage of our average amortized cost of securities for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nGross yield/stated coupon 5.0 % 4.9 % 4.9 % 4.9 %\nNet (premium amortization) discount accretion (0.2)% (0.3)% (0.1)% (0.3)%\nNet yield 4.8 % 4.6 % 4.8 % 4.6 %\nNet Servicing Income\nThe following table presents the components of net servicing income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nServicing fee income $ 126,597 $ 141,816 $ 400,278 $ 415,423\nAncillary and other fee income 3,928 476 12,220 2,236\nFloat income 41,207 36,333 101,582 89,509\nTotal servicing income 171,732 178,625 514,080 507,168\nTotal servicing costs 3,900 29,903 15,494 83,459\nNet servicing income $ 167,832 $ 148,722 $ 498,586 $ 423,709\nThe decrease in total servicing income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to lower servicing fee\nincome on a smaller MSR portfolio as a result of sales and runoff, offset by higher float income as a result of the higher interest rate environment and higher ancillary and other\nfee income as a result of the acquisition of RoundPoint. The increase in total servicing income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in\n2023, was primarily due to higher float income as a result of the higher interest rate environment and higher ancillary and other fee income as a result of the acquisition of\nRoundPoint, offset by lower servicing fee income on a smaller MSR portfolio as a result of sales and runoff.\nPrior to the acquisition of RoundPoint, we did not directly service mortgage loans; instead, we contracted with appropriately licensed subservicers to handle substantially all\nservicing functions in the name of the subservicer for the mortgage loans underlying our MSR. These third-party subservicing costs and other servicing expenses directly related\nto our MSR portfolio are included within the servicing costs line item on our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Post-acquisition, all servicing-\nrelated expenses incurred by RoundPoint as an operating company are included within the other operating expenses line item on our condensed consolidated statements of\ncomprehensive income (loss). The decrease in servicing costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was the\nresult of lower third-party subservicing fees due to the acquisition of RoundPoint.\nGain (Loss) On Investment Securities\nThe following table presents the components of gain (loss) on investment securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nProceeds from sales $ 91,115 $ 119,095 $ 896,520 $ 1,694,891\nAmortized cost of securities sold (91,503) (118,999) (929,064) (1,730,866)\nTotal realized (losses) gains on sales (388) 96 (32,544) (35,975)\nReversal of (provision for) credit losses 276 98 25 217\nOther 1,495 (665) 490 48,257\nGain (loss) on investment securities $ 1,383 $ (471) $ (32,029) $ 12,499\n61\nTable of Contents\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we make investment decisions and allocate capital in accordance with our views on the changing risk/reward dynamics in the market\nand in our portfolio. We do not expect to sell assets on a frequent basis, but may sell assets to reallocate capital into new assets that we believe have higher risk-adjusted returns.\nWe use a discounted cash flow method to estimate and recognize an allowance for credit losses on AFS securities. Subsequent adverse or favorable changes in expected cash\nflows are recognized immediately in earnings as a provision for or reversal of provision for credit losses (within gain (loss) on investment securities).\nThe majority of the “other” component of gain (loss) on investment securities is related to changes in unrealized gains (losses) on certain AFS securities for which we have\nelected the fair value option. Fluctuations in this line item are primarily driven by the reclassification of unrealized gains and losses to realized gains and losses upon sale, as well\nas changes in fair value assumptions.\n(Loss) Gain On Servicing Asset\nThe following table presents the components of (loss) gain on servicing asset for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nChanges in fair value due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions\nused in the valuation model $ (93,828) $ 111,186 $ 775 $ 213,803\nChanges in fair value due to realization of cash flows (runoff) (62,481) (63,999) (174,239) (172,177)\nGains on sales 22,960 20,182 28,270 19,343\n(Loss) gain on servicing asset $ (133,349) $ 67,369 $ (145,194) $ 60,969\nThe increase in loss (decrease in gain) on servicing asset for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was driven by unfavorable\nchange in valuation assumptions used in the fair valuation of MSR, particularly faster prepayment speeds, offset by slightly lower portfolio run-off and higher realized gains on\nsales of MSR. The increase in loss (decrease in gain) on servicing asset for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was driven by\nlower favorable change in valuation assumptions used in the fair valuation of MSR and slightly higher portfolio run-off, offset by higher realized gains on sales of MSR.\n(Loss) Gain On Interest Rate Swap And Swaption Agreements\nThe following table summarizes the net interest spread and gains and losses associated with our interest rate swap and swaption positions recognized during the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet interest spread $ 17,059 $ 6,851 $ 46,369 $ 13,914\nEarly termination, agreement maturation and option expiration losses (86,310) (5,176) (70,032) (23,756)\nChange in unrealized (loss) gain on interest rate swap and swaption\nagreements, at fair value (103,012) 110,234 (28,078) 96,130\n(Loss) gain on interest rate swap and swaption agreements $ (172,263) $ 111,909 $ (51,741) $ 86,288\n62\nTable of Contents\nNet interest spread recognized for the accrual and/or settlement of the net interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps results from receiving either a floating\ninterest rate (OIS or SOFR) or a fixed interest rate and paying either a fixed interest rate or a floating interest rate (OIS or SOFR) on positions held to economically\nhedge/mitigate portfolio interest rate exposure (or duration) risk. We may elect to terminate certain swaps and swaptions to align with our investment portfolio, agreements may\nmature or options may expire resulting in full settlement of our net interest spread asset/liability and the recognition of realized gains and losses, including early termination\npenalties. The change in fair value of interest rate swaps and swaptions during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was a result of changes to floating\ninterest rates (OIS or SOFR), the swap curve and corresponding counterparty borrowing rates. Swaps and swaptions are used for purposes of hedging our interest rate exposure,\nand therefore, their unrealized valuation gains and losses (excluding the reversal of unrealized gains and losses to realized gains and losses upon termination, maturation or\noption expiration) generally offset a portion of the unrealized losses and gains recognized on our Agency RMBS AFS portfolio, which are recorded either directly to\nstockholders’ equity through other comprehensive income (loss) or to gain (loss) on investment securities, in the case of certain AFS securities for which we have elected the fair\nvalue option.\n(Loss) Gain On Other Derivative Instruments\nThe following table provides a summary of the total net gains (losses) recognized on other derivative instruments we hold for purposes of both hedging and non-hedging\nactivities, principally TBAs, futures, options on futures, and inverse interest-only securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(in thousands) September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nTBAs $ 84,073 $ (90,662) $ (2,438) $ (184,909)\nFutures (119,553) 179,697 16,061 166,533\nOptions on futures — (779) (127) (779)\nInverse interest-only securities 2,758 (2,044) 631 (3,243)\n(Loss) gain on other derivative instruments $ (32,722) $ 86,212 $ 14,127 $ (22,398)\nFor further details regarding our use of derivative instruments and related activity, refer to Note 9 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nGain On Mortgage Loans Held-For-Sale\nThe following table provides a summary of the total net realized and unrealized gains (losses) recognized on mortgage loans held-for-sale and the related derivative\ninstruments used to manage exposure to market risks primarily associated with fluctuations in interest rate risks related to our origination pipeline during the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(in thousands) September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nMortgage loans held-for-sale $ 420 $ — $ 417 $ —\nInterest rate lock commitments 478 — 478 —\nForward mortgage loan sale commitments 29 — 29 —\nGain on mortgage loans held-for-sale $ 927 $ — $ 924 $ —\nLate in the second quarter of 2024, RoundPoint began operating its in-house, direct-to-consumer originations platform.

It also includes certain transaction expenses incurred in connection with the\nCompany’s acquisition of RoundPoint.\nThe increase in total operating expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was driven by the addition of\nRoundPoint’s compensation, benefits, operating and loan level expenses, offset by lower expenses incurred in connection with the Company’s ongoing litigation with PRCM\nAdvisers.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a benefit from income taxes of $10.5 million and a provision for income taxes of $15.7 million,\nrespectively. The benefit recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to net losses recognized on MSR and operating expenses, offset by net\nincome from MSR servicing and mortgage loan origination activities incurred in our TRSs. The provision recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was\nprimarily due to net income from MSR servicing and mortgage loan origination activities, offset by net losses recognized on MSR and operating expenses incurred in our TRSs.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a provision for income taxes of $36.4 million and $52.2 million, respectively, which was primarily\ndue to net income from MSR servicing activities and net gains recognized on MSR, offset by net losses recognized on derivative instruments and operating expenses incurred in\nour TRSs.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe following table provides a summary of the components of other comprehensive income (loss) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(in thousands) September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nUnrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities $ 267,864 $ (350,922) $ 104,740 $ (444,519)\nRealized losses on sales of available-for-sale securities reclassified to\ngain (loss) on investment securities 1,757 — 17,730 63,222\nOther comprehensive income (loss) $ 269,621 $ (350,922) $ 122,470 $ (381,297)\n64\nTable of Contents\nWith our accounting treatment for AFS securities, unrealized fluctuations in the market values of AFS securities, excluding certain AFS securities for which we have elected\nthe fair value option and securities with an allowance for credit losses, are recorded directly to stockholders’ equity through other comprehensive income (loss). Additionally,\nwe reclassify unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities in accumulated other comprehensive loss to net (loss) income upon the recognition of any realized gains and losses\non sales as individual securities are sold. Fluctuations in other comprehensive income (loss) are driven by changes in fair value assumptions and the reclassification of\nunrealized gains and losses to realized gains and losses upon sale.\nFinancial Condition\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value\nThe majority of our AFS investment securities portfolio is comprised of fixed rate Agency mortgage-backed securities backed by single-family and multi-family mortgage\nloans. We also hold $3.9 million in tranches of mortgage-backed and asset-backed P&I and interest-only non-Agency securities. All of our P&I Agency RMBS AFS are Fannie\nMae or Freddie Mac mortgage pass-through certificates or collateralized mortgage obligations, or Ginnie Mae mortgage pass-through certificates, which are backed by the\nguarantee of the U.S. government.

Repurchase agreements and\nrevolving credit facilities are collateralized by our pledge of AFS securities, derivative instruments, MSR, servicing advances and certain cash balances. Substantially all of our\nAgency RMBS are currently pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements. Additionally, a substantial portion of our MSR is currently pledged as collateral for repurchase\nagreements and revolving credit facilities, and a portion of our servicing advances have been pledged as collateral for revolving credit facilities. Warehouse facilities are\ncollateralized by our pledge of mortgage loans for a period of up to 90 days or until they are sold to the GSEs or other third-party investors in the secondary market, typically\nwithin 30 days of origination. Substantially all of our funded mortgage loans held-for-sale are currently pledged as collateral for warehouse facilities. In connection with our\nsecuritization of MSR, a variable funding note, or VFN, was issued to one of our subsidiaries. We have one repurchase facility that is secured by the VFN, which is collateralized\nby our MSR. Finally, our convertible senior notes due 2026 are unsecured and pay interest semiannually at a rate of 6.25% per annum.\n66\nTable of Contents\nAt September 30, 2024, borrowings under repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities, warehouse facilities and convertible senior notes had the following\ncharacteristics:\n(dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024\nAmount Weighted Average Weighted Average\nBorrowing Type Outstanding Borrowing Rate Years to Maturity\nRepurchase agreements $ 8,763,400 5.40 % 0.3\nRevolving credit facilities 999,171 8.11 % 1.8\nWarehouse facilities 3,017 7.34 % 0.2\nConvertible senior notes (1) 259,815 6.25 % 1.3\nTotal $ 10,025,403 5.69 % 0.5\n(dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024\nWeighted Average\nAmount Weighted Average Haircut on\nCollateral Type Outstanding Borrowing Rate Collateral Value\nAgency RMBS $ 8,107,734 5.20 % 3.7 %\nNon-Agency securities 207 5.39 % 44.2 %\nAgency Derivatives 5,459 5.88 % 17.2 %\nMortgage servicing rights 1,589,871 8.08 % 31.1 %\nMortgage servicing advances 59,300 7.74 % 12.9 %\nMortgage loans held-for-sale 3,017 7.34 % — %\nOther (1) 259,815 6.25 % N/A\nTotal $ 10,025,403 5.69 % 8.0 %\n____________________\n(1) Includes unsecured convertible senior notes due 2026 paying interest semiannually at a rate of 6.25% per annum on the aggregate principal amount of $261.9 million.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the debt-to-equity ratio funding our Agency and non-Agency investment securities, MSR and related servicing advances and mortgage loans held-\nfor-sale, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes, was 4.6:1.0. Our Agency RMBS, given their liquidity and high credit quality, are eligible for\nhigher levels of leverage, while MSR, with less liquidity and/or more exposure to prepayment risk, utilize lower levels of leverage. Generally, our debt-to-equity ratio is directly\ncorrelated to the composition of our portfolio; typically, the higher the percentage of Agency RMBS we hold, the higher our debt-to-equity ratio will be. However, in addition to\nportfolio mix, our debt-to-equity ratio is a function of many other factors, including the liquidity of our portfolio, the availability and price of our financing, the diversification of\nour counterparties and their available capacity to finance our assets, and anticipated regulatory developments. We may alter the percentage allocation of our portfolio among our\ntarget assets depending on the relative value of the assets that are available to purchase from time to time, including at times when we are deploying proceeds from offerings we\nconduct. We believe the current degree of leverage within our portfolio helps ensure that we have access to unused borrowing capacity, thus supporting our liquidity and the\nstrength of our balance sheet.\n67\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides a summary of our borrowings under repurchase agreements (excluding those collateralized by U.S. Treasuries), revolving credit facilities,\nwarehouse facilities, term notes payable and convertible senior notes and our debt-to-equity ratios for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and the four immediately\npreceding quarters:\n(dollars in thousands)\nEnd of Period Net\nMaximum End of Period End of Period Net Payable End of Period\nEnd of Period Balance of Any Total Borrowings Long (Short) TBA (Receivable) for Economic Debt-to-\nFor the Three Months Ended Quarterly Average Balance Month-End to Equity Ratio Cost Basis Unsettled RMBS Equity Ratio (1)\nSeptember 30, 2024 $ 10,028,325 $ 10,025,403 $ 10,061,801 4.6:1.0 $ 5,060,417 $ 85,366 7.0:1.0\nJune 30, 2024 $ 9,893,287 $ 9,973,593 $ 9,973,593 4.5:1.0 $ 4,950,762 $ — 6.8:1.0\nMarch 31, 2024 $ 10,153,275 $ 10,283,782 $ 10,352,896 4.6:1.0 $ 3,421,932 $ (213,264) 6.0:1.0\nDecember 31, 2023 $ 10,449,060 $ 9,913,231 $ 10,984,022 4.5:1.0 $ 3,170,548 $ 196,644 6.0:1.0\nSeptember 30, 2023 $ 11,058,648 $ 11,087,145 $ 11,138,859 5.2:1.0 $ 2,147,540 $ — 6.3:1.0\n____________________\n(1) Defined as total borrowings under repurchase agreements (excluding those collateralized by U.S. Treasuries), revolving credit facilities, warehouse facilities, term notes payable and convertible\nsenior notes, plus implied debt on net TBA cost basis and net payable (receivable) for unsettled RMBS, divided by total equity.\nEquity\nThe following table provides details of our changes in stockholders’ equity from June 30, 2024 to September 30, 2024.\nCommon Shares Common Book\n(in millions, except per share amounts) Book Value Outstanding Value Per Share\nCommon stockholders’ equity at June 30, 2024 $ 1,573.5 103.6 $ 15.19\nNet loss (238.5)\nOther comprehensive income 269.6\nComprehensive income 31.1\nDividends on preferred stock (11.8)\nComprehensive income attributable to common stockholders 19.3\nDividends on common stock (46.9)\nOther 1.6 —\nBalance before capital transactions 1,547.5 103.6\nIssuance of common stock, net of offering costs 0.1 —\nCommon stockholders’ equity at September 30, 2024 $ 1,547.6 103.6 $ 14.93\nTotal preferred stock liquidation preference 621.8\nTotal stockholders’ equity at September 30, 2024 $ 2,169.4\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital resources are managed and forecasted on a daily basis. We believe this ensures that we have sufficient liquidity to absorb market events that could\nnegatively impact collateral valuations and result in margin calls. We also believe that it gives us the flexibility to manage our portfolio to take advantage of market opportunities.\nOur principal sources of cash consist of borrowings under repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities, warehouse facilities, payments of principal and interest we\nreceive on our target assets, cash generated from our operating results, and proceeds from capital market transactions. We typically use cash to repay principal and interest on our\nborrowings, to purchase our target assets, to make dividend payments on our capital stock, and to fund our operations. To the extent that we raise additional equity capital through\ncapital market transactions, we anticipate using cash proceeds from such transactions to purchase our target assets and for other general corporate purposes. Such general\ncorporate purposes may include the refinancing or repayment of debt, the repurchase or redemption of common and preferred equity securities, and other capital expenditures.\n68\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2024, we held $522.6 million in cash and cash equivalents available to support our operations; $11.4 billion of AFS securities, MSR, mortgage loans\nheld-for-sale and derivative assets held at fair value; and $10.0 billion of outstanding debt in the form of repurchase agreements, borrowings under revolving credit facilities and\nwarehouse facilities and convertible senior notes. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the debt-to-equity ratio funding our Agency and non-Agency investment\nsecurities, MSR and related servicing advances and mortgage loans held-for-sale, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes, increased from 4.5:1.0 to\n4.6:1.0, which was predominantly driven by an increase in financing on Agency RMBS as a result of purchases, offset by a decrease in MSR financing as a result of MSR sales\nand portfolio runoff. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the debt-to-equity ratio funding our Agency and non-Agency investment securities, MSR and related\nservicing advances and mortgage loans held-for-sale, which includes unsecured borrowings under convertible senior notes, also increased from 4.5:1.0 to 4.6:1.0, which was\nprimarily due to a decrease in equity as a result of our financial results. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our economic debt-to-equity ratio funding\nour Agency and non-Agency investment securities, MSR and related servicing advances and mortgage loans held-for-sale, which includes unsecured borrowings under\nconvertible senior notes, implied debt on net TBA cost basis and net payable (receivable) for unsettled RMBS, increased from 6.8:1.0 to 7.0:1.0 and 6.0:1.0 to 7.0:1.0,\nrespectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we held approximately $4.8 million of unpledged Agency RMBS and $3.5 million of unpledged non-Agency securities. As a result, we had an\noverall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged securities of approximately $6.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, we held approximately $19.6 million of\nunpledged MSR and $5.4 million of unpledged servicing advances. Overall, on September 30, 2024, we had $60.1 million unused committed and $550.0 million unused\nuncommitted borrowing capacity on MSR financing facilities, and $90.7 million in unused committed borrowing capacity on servicing advance financing facilities. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, all of our mortgage loans were pledged for financing and we had $4.0 million unused committed borrowing capacity on our warehouse facilities. Generally,\nunused borrowing capacity may be the result of our election not to utilize certain financing, as well as delays in the timing in which funding is provided, insufficient collateral or\nthe inability to meet lenders’ eligibility requirements for specific types of asset classes. On a daily basis, we monitor and forecast our available, or excess, liquidity. Additionally,\nwe frequently perform shock analyses against various market events to monitor the adequacy of our excess liquidity.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not experience any material issues accessing our funding sources. We expect ongoing sources of financing to be\nprimarily repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities, warehouse facilities, convertible notes and similar financing arrangements. We plan to finance our assets with a\nmoderate amount of leverage, the level of which may vary based upon the particular characteristics of our portfolio and market conditions.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had master repurchase agreements in place with 36 counterparties (lenders), the majority of which are U.S. domiciled financial institutions, and\nwe continue to evaluate additional counterparties to manage and optimize counterparty risk. Under our repurchase agreements, we are required to pledge additional assets as\ncollateral to our lenders when the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders, through a margin call, demand\nadditional collateral. Lenders generally make margin calls because of a perceived decline in the value of our assets collateralizing the repurchase agreements. This may occur\nfollowing the monthly principal reduction of assets due to scheduled amortization and prepayments on the underlying mortgages, or may be caused by changes in market interest\nrates, a perceived decline in the market value of the investments and other market factors. To cover a margin call, we may pledge additional assets or cash. At maturity, any cash\non deposit as collateral is generally applied against the repurchase agreement balance, thereby reducing the amount borrowed. Should the value of our assets suddenly decrease,\nsignificant margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position.\n69\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to our master repurchase agreements that fund our Agency and non-Agency securities, we have one repurchase facility and two revolving credit facilities that\nprovide short- and long-term financing for our MSR portfolio. We also have one revolving credit facility that provides long-term financing for our servicing advances and one\nwarehouse facility that provides short-term financing for our mortgage loans held-for-sale. A summary of our MSR, servicing advance and warehouse facilities is provided in the\ntable below:\n(dollars in thousands)\nSeptember 30, 2024\nUnused\nAmount Unused Committed Uncommitted\nExpiration Date (1) Outstanding Capacity (2) Capacity Total Capacity Eligible Collateral\nMarch 31, 2026 $ 647,731 $ 2,269 $ 250,000 $ 900,000 Mortgage servicing rights\nMarch 8, 2027 $ 292,140 $ 57,860 $ 150,000 $ 500,000 Mortgage servicing rights (3)\nMay 22, 2026 $ 650,000 $ — $ 150,000 $ 800,000 Mortgage servicing rights (4)\nJune 14, 2026 $ 59,300 $ 90,700 $ — $ 150,000 Mortgage servicing advances\nAugust 19, 2025 $ 3,017 $ 6,983 $ — $ 10,000 Mortgage loans held-for-sale\n____________________\n(1) The facilities are set to mature on the stated expiration date, unless extended pursuant to their terms.\n(2) Represents unused capacity amounts to which commitment fees are charged.\n(3) The revolving period of this facility ceases on March 8, 2026, at which time the facility starts a 12-month amortization period.\n(4) This repurchase facility is secured by a VFN issued in connection with our previous securitization of MSR, which is collateralized by our MSR. During the three months ended September 30,\n2024, this repurchase facility was amended to prescribe a reduction in the total capacity to $550.0 million starting December 30, 2024.\nWe are subject to a variety of financial covenants under our lending agreements. The following represent the most restrictive financial covenants across our lending\nagreements as of September 30, 2024:\n• Total indebtedness to tangible net worth must be less than 8.0:1.0. As of September 30, 2024, our total indebtedness to tangible net worth, as defined, was 4.9:1.0.\n• Cash liquidity must be greater than $200.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, our liquidity, as defined, was $522.6 million.\n• Net worth must be greater than the higher of $1.5 billion or 50% of the highest net worth during the 24 calendar months prior. As of September 30, 2024, 50% of the\nhighest net worth during the 24 calendar months prior, as defined, was $1.2 billion and our net worth, as defined, was $2.2 billion.\nWe are also subject to additional financial covenants in connection with various other agreements we enter into in the normal course of our business. We intend to continue to\noperate in a manner which complies with all of our financial covenants.\nThe following table summarizes assets at carrying values that were pledged or restricted as collateral for the future payment obligations of repurchase agreements, revolving\ncredit facilities, warehouse facilities, term notes payable and derivative instruments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nAvailable-for-sale securities, at fair value $ 8,416,131 $ 8,126,028\nMortgage servicing rights, at fair value 2,864,729 3,047,890\nMortgage loans held-for-sale, at fair value 3,067 —\nRestricted cash 13,998 12,575\nDue from counterparties 15,108 36,420\nDerivative assets, at fair value 8,148 11,877\nOther assets 86,646 79,749\nTotal $ 11,407,827 $ 11,314,539\n70\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we generally intend to hold our target assets as long-term investments, we may sell certain of our assets in order to manage our interest rate risk and liquidity needs,\nto meet other operating objectives and to adapt to market conditions. Our Agency RMBS are generally actively traded and thus, in most circumstances, readily liquid. However,\ncertain of our assets, including MSR and mortgage loans held-for-sale, are subject to longer trade timelines, and, as a result, market conditions could significantly and adversely\naffect the liquidity of our assets. Any illiquidity of our assets may make it difficult for us to sell such assets if the need or desire arises. Our ability to quickly sell certain assets,\nsuch as MSR and mortgage loans, may be limited by delays encountered while obtaining certain Agency approvals required for such dispositions and may be further limited by\ndelays due to the time period needed for negotiating transaction documents, conducting diligence, and complying with Agency requirements regarding the transfer of such assets\nbefore settlement may occur. Consequently, even if we identify a buyer for our MSR and mortgage loans, there is no assurance that we would be able to quickly sell such assets if\nthe need or desire arises.\nIn addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we previously recorded our assets.\nAssets that are illiquid are more difficult to finance, and to the extent that we use leverage to finance assets that become illiquid, we may lose that leverage or have it reduced.\nAssets tend to become less liquid during times of financial stress, which is often the time that liquidity is most needed. As a result, our ability to sell assets or vary our portfolio in\nresponse to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited by liquidity constraints, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe cannot predict the timing and impact of future sales of our assets, if any. Because many of our assets are financed with repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities\nand warehouse facilities, a significant portion of the proceeds from sales of our assets (if any), prepayments and scheduled amortization are used to repay balances under these\nfinancing sources.\nThe following table provides the maturities of our repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities, warehouse facilities, term notes payable and convertible senior notes as\nof September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nWithin 30 days $ 2,403,179 $ 2,833,162\n30 to 59 days 2,180,469 1,918,818\n60 to 89 days 3,017 2,059,438\n90 to 119 days 1,173,329 994,789\n120 to 364 days 2,356,423 833,571\nOne to three years 1,908,986 1,273,453\nTotal $ 10,025,403 $ 9,913,231\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, our restricted and unrestricted cash balance decreased approximately $175.1 million to $611.7 million at September 30,\n2024. The cash movements can be summarized by the following:\n• Cash flows from operating activities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities increased our cash balances by approximately $87.1 million,\nprimarily driven by our financial results for the quarter.\n• Cash flows from investing activities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, investing activities decreased our cash balances by approximately $254.9 million,\ndriven by net purchases of AFS securities and net short sales of derivative instruments, offset by net sales of MSR.\n• Cash flows from financing activities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, financing activities decreased our cash balance by approximately $7.3 million,\nprimarily driven by paydowns on our revolving credit facilities and the payment of third quarter dividends, offset by an increase in both AFS securities and MSR\nrepurchase agreement financing.\nInflation\nOur assets and liabilities are financial in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates and other factors impact our performance far more than does inflation, although inflation\nrates can often have a meaningful influence over the direction of interest rates. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and dividends are based\nupon net ordinary income and capital gains as calculated for tax purposes; in each case, our results of operations and reported assets, liabilities and equity are measured with\nreference to historical cost or fair value without considering inflation.\n71\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe seek to manage our risks related to the credit quality of our assets, interest rates, liquidity, prepayment speeds and market value while providing an opportunity to\nstockholders to realize attractive risk-adjusted total return through ownership of our capital stock. Although we do not seek to avoid risk completely, we believe that risk can be\nquantified from historical experience, and we seek to manage our risk levels in order to earn sufficient compensation to justify the risks we undertake and to maintain capital\nlevels consistent with taking such risks.\nTo manage the risks to our portfolio, we employ portfolio-wide and asset-specific risk measurement and management processes in our daily operations. Risk management\ntools include software and services licensed or purchased from third parties as well as proprietary and third-party analytical tools and models. There can be no guarantee that\nthese tools and methods will protect us from market risks.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as\nother factors beyond our control. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our assets and related financing obligations. Additionally, rising interest rates are likely to\nhave an adverse impact on the operational efficiency and, thus profitability, of our loan originations platform.\nSubject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we engage in a variety of interest rate risk management techniques that seek to mitigate the influence of interest rate\nchanges on the values of our assets. We may enter into a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments to economically hedge interest rate risk or “duration mismatch (or\ngap)” by adjusting the duration of our floating-rate borrowings into fixed-rate borrowings to more closely match the duration of our assets. This particularly applies to borrowing\nagreements with maturities or interest rate resets of less than six months. Typically, the interest receivable terms (i.e., OIS or SOFR) of certain derivatives match the terms of the\nunderlying debt, resulting in an effective conversion of the rate of the related borrowing agreement from floating to fixed. The objective is to manage the cash flows associated\nwith current and anticipated interest payments on borrowings, as well as the ability to roll or refinance borrowings at the desired amount by adjusting the duration.\nTo help manage the adverse impact of interest rate changes on the value of our portfolio, our cash flows, and our loan origination pipeline (consisting of IRLCs and mortgage\nloans held-for-sale), we may, at times, enter into various forward contracts, including short securities, TBAs, options, futures, swaps, caps, credit default swaps, total return swaps\nand forward mortgage loan sale commitments. In executing on our current interest rate risk management strategy, we have entered into TBAs, interest rate swap and swaption\nagreements, futures, options on futures, and forward mortgage loan sale commitments. In addition, because MSR are negative duration assets, they may provide a hedge to\ninterest rate exposure on our Agency RMBS portfolio. In hedging interest rate risk, we seek to mitigate the impact of changing interest rates on the value of our investments,\nimprove risk-adjusted returns and, where possible, obtain a favorable spread between the yield on our assets and the cost of our financing. Our hedging methods are based on\nmany factors, including, but not limited to, our estimates with regard to future interest rates.\nREIT income arising from “clearly identified” hedging transactions that are entered into to manage the risk of interest rate or price changes with respect to borrowings,\nincluding gain from the disposition of such hedging transactions, to the extent the hedging transactions hedge indebtedness incurred, or to be incurred, by the REIT to acquire or\ncarry real estate assets, will not be treated as gross income for purposes of either the 75% or the 95% gross income tests. In general, for a hedging transaction to be “clearly\nidentified,” (i) it must be identified as a hedging transaction before the end of the day on which it is acquired, originated, or entered into, and (ii) the items of risks being hedged\nmust be identified “substantially contemporaneously” with entering into the hedging transaction (generally not more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction). We\nintend to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our qualification as a REIT, although this determination depends on an analysis of the facts and\ncircumstances concerning each hedging transaction. We also implement part of our hedging strategy through our TRSs, which are subject to U.S. federal, state and, if applicable,\nlocal income tax.\nWe treat our TBAs as qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% asset test, to the extent set forth in an opinion from Sidley Austin LLP substantially to the effect that, for\npurposes of the 75% asset test, our ownership of a TBA should be treated as ownership of the underlying Agency RMBS. We also treat income and gains from our TBAs as\nqualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, to the extent set forth in an opinion from Sidley Austin LLP substantially to the effect that, for purposes of the 75%\ngross income test, any gain recognized by us in connection with the settlement of our TBAs should be treated as gain from the sale or disposition of the underlying Agency\nRMBS.\n72\nTable of Contents\nInterest Rate Effect on Net Interest Income\nOur operating results depend in large part on differences between the income earned on our assets and our cost of borrowing and hedging activities. The costs associated with\nour borrowings are generally based on prevailing market interest rates. During a period of rising interest rates, our borrowing costs generally will increase while the coupon\ninterest earned on our existing portfolio of leveraged fixed-rate Agency RMBS and mortgage loans held-for-sale will remain static. Both of these factors could result in a decline\nin our net interest spread and net interest margin. The inverse result may occur during a period of falling interest rates. The severity of any such decline or increase in our net\ninterest spread and net interest margin would depend on our asset/liability composition at the time, as well as the magnitude and duration of the interest rate increase or decrease.\nOur hedging techniques are partly based on assumed levels of prepayments of our target assets. If prepayments are slower or faster than assumed, the life of the investment\nwill be longer or shorter, which could reduce the effectiveness of any hedging strategies we may use and may cause losses on such transactions. Hedging strategies involving the\nuse of derivative securities are highly complex and may produce volatile returns.\nThe following analyses of risks are based on our experience, estimates, models and assumptions. The analysis is based on models which utilize estimates of fair value and\ninterest rate sensitivity. Actual economic conditions or implementation of decisions may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our\nmodels.\nWe perform interest rate sensitivity analyses on various measures of our financial results and condition by examining how our assets, financing and hedges will perform in\nvarious interest rate “shock” scenarios. Two of these measures are presented below in more detail. The first measure is change in annualized net interest income over the next 12\nmonths, including interest spread from our interest rate swaps and float income from custodial accounts associated with our MSR. The second measure is change in value of\nfinancial position, including the value of our derivative assets and liabilities. All changes in value are measured as the change from the September 30, 2024 financial position. All\nprojected changes in annualized net interest income are measured as the change from the projected annualized net interest income based off current performance returns.\nComputation of the cash flows for the rate-sensitive assets underpinning change in annualized net interest income are based on assumptions related to, among other things,\nprepayment speeds, yield on future acquisitions, slope of the yield curve, and size of the portfolio (for example, the assumption for prepayment speeds for Agency RMBS and\nMSR is that they do not change in response to changes in interest rates). Assumptions for the interest rate sensitive liabilities relate to, among other things, collateral requirements\nas a percentage of borrowings and amount/term of borrowing. These assumptions may not hold in practice; realized net interest income results may therefore be significantly\ndifferent from the net interest income produced in scenario analyses. We also note that the uncertainty associated with the estimate of a change in net interest income is directly\nrelated to the size of interest rate move considered.\nComputation of results for portfolio value involves a two-step process. The first is the use of models to project how the value of interest rate sensitive instruments will change\nin the scenarios considered. The second, and equally important, step is the improvement of the model projections based on application of our experience in assessing how current\nmarket and macroeconomic conditions will affect the prices of various interest rate sensitive instruments. Judgment is best applied to localized (less than 25 basis points, or bps)\ninterest rate moves. The more an instantaneous interest rate move exceeds 25 bps, the greater the likelihood that accompanying market events are significant enough to warrant\nreconsideration of interest rate sensitivities. As with net interest income, the uncertainty associated with the estimate of change in portfolio value is therefore directly related to\nthe size of interest rate move considered.\n73\nTable of Contents\nThe following interest rate sensitivity table displays the potential impact of instantaneous, parallel changes in interest rates of +/- 25 and +/- 50 bps on annualized net interest\nincome and portfolio value, based on our interest sensitive financial instruments at September 30, 2024. The preceding discussion shows that the results for the 25 bps move\nscenarios are the best representation of our interest rate exposure, followed by those for the 50 bps move scenarios. This hierarchy reflects our localized approach to managing\ninterest rate risk: monitoring rates and rebalancing our hedges on a day-to-day basis, where rate moves only rarely exceed 25 bps in either direction.\nChanges in Interest Rates\n(dollars in thousands) -50 bps -25 bps +25 bps +50 bps\nChange in annualized net interest income (1): $ (6,779) $ (3,377) $ 3,333 $ 6,685\n% change in net interest income (1) (4.4)% (2.2)% 2.2 % 4.3 %\nChange in value of financial position:\nAvailable-for-sale securities $ 167,461 $ 87,034 $ (92,847) $ (190,941)\nAs a % of common equity 10.8 % 5.6 % (6.0)% (12.4)%\nMortgage servicing rights (2) $ (139,605) $ (71,966) $ 64,487 $ 115,636\nAs a % of common equity (2) (9.0)% (4.7)% 4.2 % 7.5 %\nMortgage loans held-for-sale $ 35 $ 19 $ (24) $ (52)\nAs a % of common equity — % — % — % — %\nDerivatives, net $ (38,935) $ (16,031) $ 9,391 $ 12,354\nAs a % of common equity (2.5)% (1.0)% 0.6 % 0.8 %\nReverse repurchase agreements $ 75 $ 37 $ (37) $ (75)\nAs a % of common equity — % — % — % — %\nRepurchase agreements $ (7,191) $ (3,596) $ 3,596 $ 7,191\nAs a % of common equity (0.5)% (0.2)% 0.2 % 0.5 %\nRevolving credit facilities $ (236) $ (117) $ 117 $ 235\nAs a % of common equity — % — % — % — %\nWarehouse facilities $ (3) $ (2) $ 2 $ 3\nAs a % of common equity — % — % — % — %\nConvertible senior notes $ (1,006) $ (501) $ 498 $ 994\nAs a % of common equity (0.1)% — % — % 0.1 %\nTotal Net Assets $ (19,405) $ (5,123) $ (14,817) $ (54,655)\nAs a % of total assets (0.2)% — % (0.1)% (0.4)%\nAs a % of common equity (1.3)% (0.3)% (1.0)% (3.5)%\n____________________\n(1) Amounts include the effect of interest spread from our interest rate swaps and float income from custodial accounts associated with our MSR, but do not reflect any potential changes to dollar\nroll income associated with our TBA positions or U.S. Treasury futures income, which are accounted for as derivative instruments in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n(2) Includes the effect of unsettled MSR.\nCertain assumptions have been made in connection with the calculation of the information set forth in the foregoing interest rate sensitivity table and, as such, there can be no\nassurance that assumed events will occur or that other events will not occur that would affect the outcomes. The base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at September 30,\n2024. As discussed, the analysis utilizes assumptions and estimates based on our experience and judgment. Furthermore, future purchases and sales of assets could materially\nchange our interest rate risk profile.\nThe information set forth in the interest rate sensitivity table above and all related disclosures constitutes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the\nSecurities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. While this table reflects the estimated impact of interest rate changes on the static portfolio, we actively manage our\nportfolio and continuously make adjustments to the size and composition of our asset and hedge portfolio. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the\nforegoing interest rate sensitivity table.\n74\nTable of Contents\nPrepayment Risk\nPrepayment risk is the risk that the principal amount of a mortgage loan will be repaid at a different rate than anticipated. As we receive prepayments of principal on our\nAgency RMBS, premiums paid on such assets will be amortized against interest income. In general, an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the amortization of purchase\npremiums, thereby reducing the interest income earned on the assets.\nWe believe that we will be able to reinvest proceeds from scheduled principal payments and prepayments at acceptable yields; however, no assurances can be given that,\nshould significant prepayments occur, market conditions would be such that acceptable investments could be identified and the proceeds timely reinvested.\nMSR are also subject to prepayment risk in that, generally, an increase in prepayment rates on the mortgage loans underlying the MSR would result in a decline in value of the\nMSR as the prepayment acts to cut short the anticipated life of the servicing income stream.\nMarket Risk\nMarket Value Risk. Our AFS securities are reflected at their estimated fair value, with the difference between amortized cost net of allowance for credit losses and estimated\nfair value for all AFS securities except certain AFS securities for which we have elected the fair value option reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The estimated\nfair value of these securities fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates, market valuation of credit risks, and other factors. Generally, in a rising interest rate\nenvironment, we would expect the fair value of these securities to decrease; conversely, in a decreasing interest rate environment, we would expect the fair value of these\nsecurities to increase. As market volatility increases or liquidity decreases, the fair value of our assets may be adversely impacted.\nOur MSR are reflected at their estimated fair value. The estimated fair value fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, in a rising\ninterest rate environment, we would expect prepayments to decrease and the fair value of our MSR to increase. Conversely, in a decreasing interest rate environment, we would\nexpect prepayments to increase and the fair value of our MSR to decrease.\nOur mortgage loans held-for-sale are reflected at their estimated fair value. The estimated fair value fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates, market valuation of\ncredit risks and other factors. Generally in a rising rate environment, we would expect the fair value of these loans to decrease; conversely, in a decreasing rate environment, we\nwould expect the fair value of these loans to increase.\nReal Estate Risk. Residential property values are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including national, regional and local economic\nconditions; local real estate conditions (such as the supply of housing); changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design;\ndemographic factors; retroactive changes to building or similar codes; and impacts of climate change, natural disasters and other catastrophes. Decreases in property values\nreduce the value of the collateral for residential mortgage loans and the potential proceeds available to borrowers to repay the loans, which may impact the value of our Agency\nRMBS due to changes in voluntary and involuntary prepayment speeds, and/or may increase costs to service the residential mortgage loans underlying our MSR.\nLiquidity Risk\nOur liquidity risk is principally associated with our financing of long-maturity assets with shorter-term borrowings in the form of repurchase agreements and borrowings\nunder revolving credit facilities and warehouse facilities. Although the interest rate adjustments of these assets and liabilities fall within the guidelines established by our\noperating policies, maturities are not required to be, nor are they, matched.\nShould the value of our assets pledged as collateral suddenly decrease, lender margin calls could increase, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position. Moreover, the\nportfolio construction of MSR, which generally have negative duration, combined with levered RMBS, which generally have positive duration, may in certain market scenarios\nlead to variation margin calls, which could negatively impact our excess cash position. Additionally, if one or more of our repurchase agreement, revolving credit facility or\nwarehouse facility counterparties chose not to provide ongoing funding, our ability to finance would decline or exist at possibly less favorable terms. As such, we cannot provide\nassurance that we will always be able to roll over our repurchase agreements, revolving credit facilities and warehouse facilities. See Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information about our liquidity\nand capital resource management.\nCredit Risk\nWe believe that our investment strategy will generally keep our risk of credit losses low to moderate. However, we retain the risk of potential credit losses on our mortgage\nloans held-for-sale and all of the loans underlying our non-Agency securities.\n75\nTable of Contents\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nA review and evaluation was performed by our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and Interim Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, of the effectiveness\nof our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q. Based on that review and evaluation, the CEO and Interim CFO have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures, as designed and\nimplemented, were effective as of September 30, 2024. Although our CEO and Interim CFO have determined our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the end of\nthe period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that\nit will detect or uncover failures within the company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the reports we submit under the Exchange Act.\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n76\nTable of Contents\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in various legal and regulatory matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. As previously disclosed, on July 15, 2020, we\nprovided PRCM Advisers with a notice of termination of the Management Agreement for “cause” in accordance with Section 15(a) of the Management Agreement. We\nterminated the Management Agreement for “cause” on the basis of certain material breaches and certain events of gross negligence on the part of PRCM Advisers in the\nperformance of its duties under the Management Agreement. On July 21, 2020, PRCM Advisers filed a complaint against us in the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, or the Court. Subsequently, Pine River Domestic Management L.P. and Pine River Capital Management L.P. were added as plaintiffs to the matter. As\namended, the complaint, or the Federal Complaint, alleges, among other things, the misappropriation of trade secrets in violation of both the Defend Trade Secrets Act and New\nYork common law, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unfair competition and business practices, unjust enrichment, conversion,\nand tortious interference with contract. The Federal Complaint seeks, among other things, an order enjoining us from making any use of or disclosing PRCM Advisers’ trade\nsecret, proprietary, or confidential information; damages in an amount to be determined at a hearing and/or trial; disgorgement of our wrongfully obtained profits; and fees and\ncosts incurred by the plaintiffs in pursuing the action. We have filed our answer to the Federal Complaint and made counterclaims against PRCM Advisers and Pine River Capital\nManagement L.P. On May 5, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, seeking judgment in their favor on all but one of our counterclaims and on one of\nour affirmative defenses. We opposed the motion for judgment on the pleadings. On August 10, 2023, the motion for judgment on the pleadings was granted in part and denied in\npart. The discovery period has ended. On November 8, 2023, the Company and the plaintiffs filed motions for summary judgment, seeking judgment in their favor on the\npending claims and counterclaims. Each party opposed the other party’s motion for summary judgment. The motions for summary judgment are fully briefed. Our board of\ndirectors believes the Federal Complaint is without merit and that we fully complied with the terms of the Management Agreement.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nExcept as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth under the heading “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023. The materialization of any risks and uncertainties identified in our Forward-Looking Statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q, together with those previously disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K or those that are presently unforeseen could result in significant adverse effects on our\nfinancial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. See Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Forward-\nLooking Statements” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nWe may not be able to grow or realize the benefits of our direct-to-consumer loan origination platform, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nLate in the second quarter of 2024, through our wholly owned subsidiary, RoundPoint, we began operating an in-house, direct-to-consumer residential mortgage loan\noriginations platform, which was established primarily as a MSR portfolio defense strategy to retain or recapture our existing borrowers. The originations platform also originates\nloans for borrowers that do not currently have a mortgage loan serviced by RoundPoint and also brokers second lien loans to our borrowers. For our own MSR portfolio, adding\nnew or recaptured MSR through our origination platform is intended to hedge faster than expected MSR prepayment speeds in a refinance environment, and requires less capital\nrelative to acquiring MSR through flow and bulk purchases from third-party originators. In addition, origination activities are generally counter-cyclical to MSR, which provides\nsupplementary sources of profitability to our stockholders while also hedging our MSR. It is possible that the full benefits of the originations platform may not be realized as\nexpected, or at all. Our ability to grow our mortgage loan originations business may be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including without limitation competition from\nnew and existing market participants, rising interest rates, reductions in the overall level of refinancing activity or a decline in our brand and reputation. Any failure to achieve the\nanticipated benefits of our originations platform could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n77\nTable of Contents\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about mortgage loan borrowers and any misrepresented information could adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nIn deciding whether to approve loans through our originations platform, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of borrowers, including financial\nstatements and other information. We also may rely on representations of borrowers as to the accuracy and completeness of financial and other information provided. If any of\nthis information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, the fair value of the loan may be significantly\nlower than expected. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the loan applicant, another party or one of our employees, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the\nmisrepresentation and the loan may be unsalable or subject to repurchase. Our controls and processes may not have detected or may not detect all misrepresented information in\nour loan originations. Any such misrepresented information could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our warehouse facilities are terminated or reduced, we may be unable to find replacement financing on favorable terms, or at all, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nTo finance our origination activities, we have entered into warehouse facilities collateralized by the value of the mortgage loans pledged until they are sold to the GSEs or\nother third-party investors in the secondary market. Our borrowings are generally repaid with the proceeds we receive from mortgage loan sales. We depend upon multiple\nlenders to provide warehouse lines of credit for our loans. In the event that any of our warehouse facilities are terminated or not renewed, or if the principal amount that may be\ndrawn under our funding agreements were to decrease significantly, we may be unable to find replacement financing on commercially favorable terms, or at all, which could limit\nour ability to maintain or grow our originations business.\nIf our ability to sell loans in the secondary market is impaired, it could affect our volume and margins and we may not be able to continue to originate mortgage loans.\nWe originate residential mortgage loans and sell them to the GSEs or other third-party investors in the secondary market. There can be no assurance that we will be able to\ncontinue to sell our loans into the secondary market at attractive prices, or at all. If we are unable to sell our mortgage loans to the GSEs or other third-party investors, or the\nprices for such loans decline, our liquidity may be negatively impacted, we may be unable to continue to fund such loans, our revenues and margins on new loan originations\ncould be reduced and our ability to repay our warehouse facilities could be impaired.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\n(a) None.\n(b) None.\n(c) Our preferred share repurchase program allows for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of the company’s preferred stock, which includes the\n8.125% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, 7.625% Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and 7.25%\nSeries C Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. Preferred shares may be repurchased from time to time through privately negotiated transactions or\nopen market transactions, pursuant to trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, or by any\ncombination of such methods. The manner, price, number and timing of preferred share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and applicable\nSEC rules. The preferred share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and, subject to SEC rules, purchases may be commenced or\nsuspended at any time without prior notice. The preferred share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of September 30, 2024, we had repurchased an\naggregate of 4,179,183 preferred shares under the program for a total cost of $77.3 million. We did not repurchase preferred shares during the three months ended September 30,\n2024.\nOur common share repurchase program allows for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of 9,375,000 shares of the company’s common stock. Common shares may be\nrepurchased from time to time through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18\nunder the Exchange Act or by any combination of such methods. The manner, price, number and timing of common share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors,\nincluding market conditions and applicable SEC rules. The common share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and, subject to\nSEC rules, purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. The common share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we had repurchased 3,637,028 common shares under the program for a total cost of $208.5 million. We did not repurchase common shares during the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\n78\nTable of Contents\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNone.\nItem 5. Other Information\n(a) None.\n(b) None.\n(c) During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company adopted, modified or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or\n“non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nItem 6.
