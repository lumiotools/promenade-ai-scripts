(NASDAQ: CRVO), a clinical-stage company focused on developing treatments for age-related neurologic disorders, today announced that its oral investigational drug neflamapimod has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of frontotemporal dementia (FTD).\n\n“We are pleased to have received Orphan Drug Designation as it implicitly recognizes the scientific rationale and potential for neflamapimod to treat this debilitating condition. Patients diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia have no available treatment options, and this rare condition is extremely burdensome to patients and caregivers alike,” said John Alam, MD, Chief Executive Officer of CervoMed. “Within this year, there have been multiple scientific presentations and publications that indicate neflamapimod targets specific pathogenic mechanisms associated with FTD. We are in active discussions with clinical thought leaders regarding the design of a proof-of-principle study in FTD, while continuing to prepare to advance neflamapimod into a Phase 3 trial in DLB in mid-2025.”\n\nFDA Orphan Drug Designation is granted to investigational therapies addressing rare medical diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Importantly, the FDA also requires sufficient preclinical and/or clinical data to establish a medically plausible basis for expecting the drug to be effective in the rare disease for which orphan drug status is granted. Orphan Drug status provides benefits to drug developers, including assistance in the drug development process, tax credits for clinical costs, exemptions from certain FDA fees and seven years of post-approval marketing exclusivity.\n\n**About Frontotemporal Dementia** FTD is a rare neurodegenerative disease, but it is one of the most common causes of early onset dementia. It affects an estimated 50,000 to 60,000 people in the United States and roughly 110,000 in the European Union, with potentially higher prevalence in Asia and Latin America. Pathologically FTD is characterized by significant neuronal loss (i.e. atrophy by MRI or at autopsy) in the frontal and temporal regions of the cortex. The pathogenic drivers underlying the neuronal loss are in most cases, in roughly equal proportions, intraneuronal inclusions in those two regions of the brain containing either the protein tau or TDP-43 (transactive response DNA binding protein); intranuclear inclusions of fused in sarcoma (FUS) are also seen, but in fewer than 10% of patients. Patients with FTD frequently develop symptoms such as behavioral changes, lapses in judgment, and diminished language skills when they are in their 40s and 50s with the disease running its course in 7-10 years. There are no FDA- or EMA-approved treatment options available for any form of FTD.\n\n**About Neflamapimod** Neflamapimod is an investigational, orally administered small molecule brain penetrant drug that inhibits alpha isoform of the p38MAP kinase. In preclinical studies, neflamapimod reversed synaptic dysfunction, including and particularly within the part of the brain most impacted in DLB – the basal forebrain cholinergic system. In Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies involving more than 300 participants, neflamapimod has been shown to be generally well tolerated. Results from the AscenD-LB Phase 2a clinical study demonstrated that neflamapimod significantly improved dementia severity (assessed by Clinical Dementia Rating Sum-of-boxes, or CDR-SB) compared to placebo and significantly improved functional mobility (assessed by Timed Up and Go Test, or TUG test) compared to placebo. At the highest dose evaluated, neflamapimod also improved results on a cognitive test battery. The treatment response in AscenD-LB in patients with early-stage DLB (i.e., those without biomarker evidence of tau pathology in the brain) was substantial (effect size > 0.7) and greater than the overall patient population. Neflamapimod is currently being evaluated in the ongoing RewinD-LB Phase 2b study, a randomized, 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating oral neflamapimod (40mg TID) in 159 patients with early-stage DLB. Topline results from the RewinD-LB study are expected in December 2024.\n\n**About CervoMed**\n\nCervoMed Inc. (the “Company”) is a clinical-stage company focused on developing treatments for age-related neurologic disorders. The Company is currently developing neflamapimod, an investigational, orally administered small molecule brain penetrant that inhibits p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase alpha. Neflamapimod has the potential to treat synaptic dysfunction, the reversible aspect of the underlying neurodegenerative processes that causes disease in DLB and certain other major neurological disorders. Neflamapimod is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2b study in patients with early-stage DLB.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release includes express and implied forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, regarding the intentions, plans, beliefs, expectations or forecasts for the future of the Company, including, but not limited to, the therapeutic potential of neflamapimod and the anticipated timing and achievement of clinical and development milestones, including neflamapimod’s potential as a treatment for FTD, the completion and achievement of primary endpoints of the RewinD-LB Phase 2b clinical trial, the Company’s announcement of topline or other data therefrom, and the Company’s intent to initiate a Phase 3 trial in DLB in mid-2025 assuming positive topline results in the RewinD-LB trial.

A replay is accessible on CervoMed’s [website](https://ir.cervomed.com/news-events/events-and-presentations).\n  * On July 1, 2024, CervoMed was added to the Russell 2000® and Russell 3000® Indexes as part of the 2024 Russell U.S. Indexes annual reconstitution.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Cash Position:** As of September 30, 2024, CervoMed had approximately $46.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as compared to approximately $50.9 million and $7.8 million as of June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in cash on-hand compared to year-end was primarily attributable to the upfront proceeds received in CervoMed’s private placement completed in April 2024. Based on its current operating plan, CervoMed believes its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand as of September 30, 2024, along with the remaining funds to be received from its National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health (NIA) grant, will enable the Company to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through 2025.\n\n**Grant Revenue:** In January 2023, CervoMed was awarded a $21.0 million grant from the NIA to support the RewinD-LB trial and, in August 2024, CervoMed was awarded an additional $0.3 million under the grant. Grant revenue was approximately $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately $1.5 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was related to an increase in services performed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of, among other things, a larger number of trial sites being active in the RewinD-LB trial during the current year period.\n\n**Research and Development (R &D) Expenses: **R&D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were approximately $5.1 million, compared to approximately $1.8 million in the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in outsourced contract research organization costs and related site expenses related to the RewinD-LB trial, services for which ramped up progressively between initiation in the third quarter of 2023 and the completion of enrollment in June 2024.\n\n**General and Administrative (G &A) Expenses:** G&A expenses were approximately $2.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus approximately $2.4 million in the same period in 2023. The slight decrease of $0.2 million was primarily due to fewer one-time professional fee costs incurred related to the Company’s reverse merger in August 2023, including D&O insurance, public relations, and accounting services.\n\n**Operating Loss:** Operating loss was approximately $5.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately $2.7 million for the same period in 2023.\n\n**Net Loss:** Net loss was approximately $4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of approximately $2.2 million for the same period in 2023. The net income in the prior year period was driven primarily by a non-cash fair value adjustment to previously outstanding convertible notes, which converted into shares of CervoMed common stock in connection with the reverse merger in August 2023.\n\n**About the RewinD-LB Phase 2b Study in Dementia with Lewy Bodies** CervoMed’s ongoing Phase 2b study, RewinD-LB, is a randomized, 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating oral neflamapimod (40mg TID) in 159 patients with early-stage DLB. In early-stage DLB patients – who are estimated to comprise approximately 50% of the total diagnosed DLB patient population at any given time – the disease has not progressed to a point where the patient has significant neuronal loss in the hippocampus. Patients with advanced DLB – in whom there is significant, irreversible neuronal loss in the hippocampus and associated Alzheimer’s Disease co-pathology – as assessed by a blood biomarker (plasma ptau181), were excluded from the study. The primary endpoint in the study is change in the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes, and secondary endpoints include the Timed Up and Go test, a cognitive test battery, and the Clinician’s Global Impression of Change. The RewinD-LB study is funded by a $21.3 million grant from the NIA, which is being disbursed over the course of the study as costs are incurred. The study includes 43 sites (32 in the United States, eight in the United Kingdom, and three in the Netherlands) and completed enrollment in June 2024, with topline data expected in December 2024. Patients completing the 16-week placebo-controlled study period will be able to continue in the study while receiving open label neflamapimod treatment for an additional 32 weeks. More information on the RewinD-LB study, including contact information on active clinical trial sites, is available at [clinicaltrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov).\n\n**About CervoMed** CervoMed is a clinical-stage company focused on developing treatments for age-related neurologic disorders. The Company is currently developing neflamapimod, an investigational, orally administered small molecule brain penetrant that inhibits p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase alpha.
