In addition, Clearside’s technology and recent ODYSSEY topline data results for CLS-AX in wet AMD were highlighted at the Ophthalmology Innovation Summit (OIS) event November 22-23, 2024 in San Diego, CA and will be presented at the upcoming FLORetina 12th International Congress on OCT and OCT Angiography in Florence, Italy being held December 5-8 2024.\n\n“We were excited to make a significant impact at the APVRS Congress in Singapore with multiple presentations and activities featuring our topline ODYSSEY results, XIPERE® real-world data, and four posters on our suprachoroidal delivery platform,” said Victor Chong, M.D., MBA, Chief Medical Officer and EVP, Head of Research and Development.\n\nDr. Chong continued, “As our partner Arctic Vision continues to advance XIPERE towards potential approval in China, Australia, and Singapore, we have seen growing interest in our delivery approach from the medical community in the region. As a result, we hosted three separate sessions to provide demonstrations of our suprachoroidal injection procedure. These sessions enabled attendees to familiarize themselves with our SCS Microinjector® technology with hands-on testing while learning more about our novel delivery approach. We were pleased that each session reached maximum attendance capacity.”\n\n“Concurrently with APVRS, our patent protected, proprietary suprachoroidal space (SCS®) injection treatment approach was also featured at the OIS Summit. With well over 10,000 injections performed to date with our SCS Microinjector, we were able to showcase our commercial, clinical and regulatory expertise to establish Clearside as the leader in delivery of a wide variety of therapeutic agents to the suprachoroidal space. We also look forward to extending the discussion of our progress and positive ODYSSEY results at the FLORetina Congress early next month. As we close out 2024, I am more energized than ever about our prospects heading into 2025,” concluded Dr. Chong.\n\n**_APVRS ACTIVITIES:_**\n\n**Oral Presentations:**\n\nSession: New/Upcoming Therapies for Retinal Disease Presentation: _Topline Results from the ODYSSEY Trial_ Presenter: Victor Chong, MD, MBA, Chief Medical Officer, Clearside Biomedical\n\nSession: General Ophthalmology Late Breaking ReportsPresentation: _Real World Use of Suprachoroidal Triamcinolone: An Iris Database Analysis_ Presenter: Michael Singer, MD, Medical Center Ophthalmology Associates, San Antonio, Texas\n\n**Poster Presentations:**\n\n_Biomechanics Considerations in Suprachoroidal Drug Delivery_ Presenter: Chen-rei Wan, PhD, Senior Director, Engineering, Clearside Biomedical\n\n_Targeting, Compartmentalization & Durability of Suprachoroidally Injected Small Molecule Suspensions _Presenter: Sobha Sivaprasad, DM, FRCOphth, Moorfields Eye Hospital, London\n\n_Suprachoroidal Delivery of Small Molecules and Gene Therapies for Ocular Diseases_ Presenter: Sobha Sivaprasad, DM, FRCOphth, Moorfields Eye Hospital, London\n\n_Expert Guidance of Suprachoroidal Space Injection Technique_ Presenter: Judy E.

The Company’s unique platform is inherently flexible and intended to work with established and new formulations of medications. Clearside’s patented SCS Microinjector® can deliver a wide variety of drug candidates into the suprachoroidal space, providing targeted delivery to potentially improve efficacy and compartmentalization of medication to reduce or eliminate toxic effects on non-diseased cells. The SCS Microinjector system comprises a syringe, a custom-designed hub, and two 30-gauge hollow microneedles of varying lengths, each approximately one millimeter, optimizing insertion and suprachoroidal administration of drugs.\n\n**About ODYSSEY Phase 2b Clinical Trial**\n\nODYSSEY was a randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, active-controlled, multicenter, 36-week, Phase 2b clinical trial in participants with wet AMD previously treated with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) standard of care therapy. A total of 60 participants were treated for 36 weeks and randomized to either CLS-AX (1 mg) or aflibercept (2 mg) with a 2:1 randomization schedule (40 participants in CLS-AX arm and 20 participants in aflibercept arm). CLS-AX was administered via suprachoroidal injection using Clearside’s SCS Microinjector, and aflibercept was administered via intravitreal injection. Participants in the trial were determined to have active disease with a median duration of wet AMD diagnosis of 9.9 months.\n\nThe ODYSSEY trial achieved its objectives, including primary outcomes in mean change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity and safety and tolerability of CLS-AX, and secondary outcomes in visual function and ocular anatomy, the need for supplemental treatment, and treatment burden as measured by total injections over the trial duration. CLS-AX demonstrated compelling intervention-free rates with 100% of CLS-AX participants not requiring any additional treatment up to 3 months, 90% up to 4 months, 81% up to 5 months, and 67% up to 6 months after the initial CLS-AX dose. In the CLS-AX group, the injection frequency was reduced by approximately 84% compared to the average monthly injections in the 24 weeks prior to screening.\n\n**About CLS-AX (axitinib injectable suspension)**\n\nClearside is developing CLS-AX as a longer-acting therapy for the treatment of retinal diseases. CLS-AX (axitinib injectable suspension) is a proprietary suspension of axitinib for suprachoroidal injection. Axitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), currently approved as an oral tablet formulation to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma, that achieves pan-VEGF blockade, directly inhibiting VEGF receptors-1, -2, and -3 with high potency and specificity. Clearside believes this broad VEGF blockade may have efficacy advantages over existing retinal therapies by acting at a different level of the angiogenesis cascade and may benefit patients who sub-optimally respond to current, more narrowly focused anti-VEGF therapies. Suprachoroidal injection of this proprietary suspension of axitinib has demonstrated meaningful potential in Phase 1/2a and Phase 2b wet AMD clinical trials in which CLS-AX was well tolerated and demonstrated a positive safety profile. With suprachoroidal administration of axitinib, there is the potential to achieve prolonged duration and targeted delivery to affected tissue layers by compartmentalizing axitinib behind the retina, thereby limiting drug exposure to the front of the eye.\n\n**About XIPERE****®****(triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension) for suprachoroidal use**\n\nXIPERE® (triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension) for suprachoroidal use is a proprietary suspension of the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide for administration to the suprachoroidal space for the treatment of macular edema associated with uveitis. XIPERE is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is commercially available in the United States. Bausch + Lomb, a leading global eye health company dedicated to helping people see better to live better, has the exclusive license for the commercialization and development of XIPERE in the U.S. and Canada. Arctic Vision, a specialty ophthalmology company based in China, has the exclusive license for the commercialization and development of XIPERE, which they refer to as Arcatus®, in Greater China, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, India and the ASEAN Countries.

We are positioning CLS-AX for real-world success by focusing on a Phase 3 program in wet AMD designed to evaluate extended efficacy duration compared to current standard of care intravitreal products and produce data supportive of a prescribing label that enables physicians to take advantage of flexible maintenance dosing between 3 and 6 months. We look forward to conducting an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in early 2025 to align on the essential components of our Phase 3 program.”\n\n“As we work to expand the overall value of our suprachoroidal drug delivery platform, we are seeing significant interest among the retinal specialist community and from leading biopharmaceutical companies in applying our innovative approach to treating serious retinal diseases. The recent commercial collaboration announced by Santen Pharmaceutical Co. and our Asia-Pacific partner, Arctic Vision, is a compelling validation of our suprachoroidal platform from a well-respected leader in the global ophthalmic industry. The licensing of ARVN001, branded as XIPERE® in the U.S., is part of Santen’s commitment to bringing innovative eyecare solutions to patients in China,” concluded Dr. Lasezkay.\n\nVictor Chong, M.D., MBA, Chief Medical Officer and EVP, Head of Research & Development, added, “In addition to our partners’ promising programs, our research team is currently evaluating various small molecules through in vivo models for the potential treatment of geographic atrophy (GA), with a market size valued at over $20 billion in sales. We believe that GA is primarily a choroidal disease. Delivery of small molecules via suprachoroidal injection enables comprehensive drug coverage of both the retina and choroid, while potentially minimizing systemic and anterior segment side effects.”\n\n**Key Highlights**\n\n  * The ODYSSEY Phase 2b clinical trial of CLS-AX (axitinib injectable suspension) for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) achieved its primary and secondary outcomes, demonstrated extended duration, stable vision and anatomic measures and a well-tolerated safety profile.\n  * Clearside’s Asia-Pacific partner, Arctic Vision, signed a new commercial collaboration with Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. for commercial rights in China to ARVN001, Arctic Vision’s triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension for suprachoroidal use, in the treatment of uveitic macular edema (UME) and certain other ophthalmic indications under development. ARVN001 is branded as XIPERE in the U.S. and ARCATUS® in China.\n  * Arctic Vision reported positive topline results from its Phase 3 clinical trial of ARCATUS for the treatment of UME in China and announced that New Drug Applications for ARCATUS are under review by regulators in Australia and Singapore.\n  * Tony Gibney was appointed Chair of Clearside’s Board of Directors, effective November 1, 2024, succeeding Clay Thorp, who will continue serving as a member of the Board. Mr. Gibney joined Clearside’s Board as an independent director in April 2024 and is an experienced biotechnology executive and former investment banker, most recently serving as Executive Vice President, Chief Business & Strategy Officer, of Iveric Bio, Inc. until the company’s acquisition by Astellas Pharma Inc. in July 2023.\n  * Glenn Yiu, MD, PhD, Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of California, Davis, was appointed to Clearside’s Scientific Advisory Board in July 2024. Dr. Yiu, a board-certified vitreoretinal surgeon, leads the translational research program at UC Davis studying AMD and other retinal diseases, with a focus on ocular imaging technologies, gene editing and delivery, and animal models of retinal disease.\n  * An article was published titled “Early Adoption of Triamcinolone Acetonide Suprachoroidal Injection for UME: A Physician Survey” by Christopher R. Henry et al. that summarizes physicians’ “real-world” perspectives on early experiences with XIPERE for the treatment of patients with UME. Findings from this survey indicate that the suprachoroidal injection technique was easy to learn (92% found the injection procedure relatively easy post-training) and resulted in favorable patient outcomes consistent with clinical trial data. The full publication can be accessed [here](https://clearsidebio.com/technology/publications-presentations/).\n  * Clearside’s gene therapy partner, REGENXBIO, reported on both of their programs administering ABBV-RGX-314 via Clearside’s SCS Microinjector. Based on positive interim results to date from the Phase 2 ALTITUDE® trial in diabetic retinopathy (DR), AbbVie and REGENXBIO announced that they have accelerated a planned End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA expected this quarter. REGENXBIO expects to initiate the first global pivotal trial in DR in the first half of 2025. In addition, the ALTITUDE trial is enrolling a new cohort of patients with center-involved diabetic macular edema. In wet AMD, based on a favorable safety profile and to evaluate dose levels for a planned pivotal program, the Phase 2 AAVIATE® trial is enrolling a new cohort.\n  * In September 2024, Clearside’s ocular oncology partner, Aura Biosciences, presented positive Phase 2 end-of-study results evaluating bel-sar (AU-011) for the first-line treatment of early-stage choroidal melanoma at The Retina Society Annual Meeting. Bel-sar is being administered via Clearside’s SCS Microinjector.\n  * Multiple presentations were delivered at the 2024 Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) and preceding events that highlighted encouraging safety and efficacy data from clinical trials of therapies utilizing Clearside’s SCS Microinjector to deliver drugs into the suprachoroidal space to treat a variety of retinal diseases.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * License and other revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.0 million, compared to $0.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The revenue primarily related to payments pursuant to Clearside’s license agreements and revenue for services and the sales of SCS Microinjector kits to licensees.\n  * Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $4.1 million, compared to $5.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a $1.9 million decrease in costs related to the CLS-AX program, which was partially offset by increases in employee-related costs and device development and a research and development tax credit received in the prior year.\n  * General and administrative expenses were $2.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $2.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in patent-related expenses and consulting fees.\n  * Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $7.7 million, or $0.10 per share of common stock, compared to net loss of $9.3 million, or $0.15 per share of common stock, for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, Clearside’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $23.6 million. The Company believes it will have sufficient resources to fund its planned operations into the third quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call & Webcast Details**\n\nClearside’s management will host a webcast and conference call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the financial results and provide a corporate update.

(Nasdaq: CLSD), a biopharmaceutical company revolutionizing the delivery of therapies to the back of the eye through the suprachoroidal space (SCS®), announced today that the Company’s Asia-Pacific partner, Arctic Vision, has signed a new commercial collaboration agreement with Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. for ARVN001, branded in the U.S. as XIPERE®, for the treatment of uveitic macular edema (UME) and certain other ophthalmic indications under development. Under the terms and conditions of the agreement, Arctic Vision has granted the rights of ARVN001 to Santen to commercialize the product candidate in China excluding Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. XIPERE® (triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension) for suprachoroidal use was developed by Clearside and is currently being sold in the United States by Bausch + Lomb.\n\n“This commercialization agreement provides additional strategic validation of our suprachoroidal delivery platform by another global pharmaceutical company,” said George Lasezkay, Pharm.D., J.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Clearside. “Our innovative drug delivery platform is now being used in commercial products and promising clinical development programs by Santen, Bausch + Lomb, AbbVie Inc., REGENXBIO Inc., Aura Biosciences, Inc. and BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.”\n\n“Arctic Vision has made excellent progress advancing our product in the Asia-Pacific region with a positive Phase 3 trial, regulatory review ongoing in Australia and Singapore, and a pending submission for approval in China. Leveraging the global capabilities of Santen to commercialize ARVN001, if approved in China, is another successful step to bring this important treatment to UME patients in the Asia-Pacific region. This partnership will enable training and use of our SCS Microinjector® in major international markets, which provides benefit to Clearside and all of our partners in driving the adoption of SCS delivery. Recently published data from a survey of U.S.-based retinal specialists indicated that the suprachoroidal injection technique was easy to learn and resulted in favorable patient outcomes consistent with clinical trial data,” Dr. Lasezkay concluded.\n\nArctic Vision is a specialty ophthalmology company based in China that has the exclusive license for the commercialization and development of XIPERE, which they refer to as ARVN001, in Greater China, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, India and the ASEAN Countries. In July 2024, Arctic Vision announced positive topline results from its Phase 3 clinical trial in China in UME. They also have New Drug Applications for ARVN001 under review in Australia and Singapore for the treatment of UME. In addition, Arctic Vision is developing ARVN001 for other ocular retinal diseases including diabetic macular edema.\n\nThe joint press release issued by Arctic Vision and Santen can be accessed [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-KrFs9Jdyl4MigR0-Wi22CCMOYY6uLjNrZr_6Sp2SUTNkQSY7R7xZgRPZ_iga4dZ5ca7earCHYvEqH0SUiaXU4WyH8gjnH3n13BB4heyyd4=).\n\n**About Clearside’s Suprachoroidal Space (SCS** ®**) Injection Platform and SCS Microinjector** ®\n\nClearside’s patent protected, proprietary suprachoroidal space (SCS®) injection treatment approach offers unprecedented access to the back of the eye, where sight-threatening disease often occurs. The Company’s unique platform is inherently flexible and intended to work with established and new formulations of medications. Clearside’s patented SCS Microinjector® can deliver a wide variety of drug candidates into the suprachoroidal space, providing targeted delivery to potentially improve efficacy and compartmentalization of medication to reduce or eliminate toxic effects on non-diseased cells. The SCS Microinjector system comprises a syringe, a custom-designed hub, and two 30-gauge hollow microneedles of varying lengths, each approximately one millimeter, optimizing insertion and suprachoroidal administration of drugs.\n\n**About XIPERE****®****(triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension) for suprachoroidal use**\n\nXIPERE® (triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension) for suprachoroidal use is a proprietary suspension of the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide for administration to the suprachoroidal space for the treatment of macular edema associated with uveitis. XIPERE is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is commercially available in the United States.

Approximately one-third of these patients develop uveitic macular edema, a build-up of fluid in the macula, the area of the retina responsible for sharp, straight-ahead vision. Macular edema is the leading cause of vision loss and blindness in uveitis patients and can occur from uveitis affecting any anatomic location - anterior, intermediate, posterior or pan. The uveitis market is expected to grow by 2024 to nearly $550 million in the United States and over $1 billion globally. \n\n**About Clearside Biomedical, Inc.**\n\nClearside Biomedical, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company revolutionizing the delivery of therapies to the back of the eye through the suprachoroidal space (SCS®) to improve patient outcomes. Clearside’s SCS injection platform, utilizing the Company’s patented SCS Microinjector®, enables an in-office, repeatable, non-surgical procedure for the targeted and compartmentalized delivery of a wide variety of therapies to the macula, retina, or choroid to potentially preserve and improve vision in patients with sight-threatening eye diseases.

We are positioning CLS-AX for real-world success by focusing on a Phase 3 program in wet AMD designed to evaluate extended efficacy duration compared to current standard of care intravitreal products and produce data supportive of a prescribing label that enables physicians to take advantage of flexible maintenance dosing between 3 and 6 months. We look forward to conducting an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in early 2025 to align on the essential components of our Phase 3 program.”\n\n“As we work to expand the overall value of our suprachoroidal drug delivery platform, we are seeing significant interest among the retinal specialist community and from leading biopharmaceutical companies in applying our innovative approach to treating serious retinal diseases. The recent commercial collaboration announced by Santen Pharmaceutical Co. and our Asia-Pacific partner, Arctic Vision, is a compelling validation of our suprachoroidal platform from a well-respected leader in the global ophthalmic industry. The licensing of ARVN001, branded as XIPERE® in the U.S., is part of Santen’s commitment to bringing innovative eyecare solutions to patients in China,” concluded Dr. Lasezkay.\n\nVictor Chong, M.D., MBA, Chief Medical Officer and EVP, Head of Research & Development, added, “In addition to our partners’ promising programs, our research team is currently evaluating various small molecules through in vivo models for the potential treatment of geographic atrophy (GA), with a market size valued at over $20 billion in sales. We believe that GA is primarily a choroidal disease. Delivery of small molecules via suprachoroidal injection enables comprehensive drug coverage of both the retina and choroid, while potentially minimizing systemic and anterior segment side effects.”\n\n**Key Highlights**\n\n  * The ODYSSEY Phase 2b clinical trial of CLS-AX (axitinib injectable suspension) for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) achieved its primary and secondary outcomes, demonstrated extended duration, stable vision and anatomic measures and a well-tolerated safety profile.\n  * Clearside’s Asia-Pacific partner, Arctic Vision, signed a new commercial collaboration with Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. for commercial rights in China to ARVN001, Arctic Vision’s triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension for suprachoroidal use, in the treatment of uveitic macular edema (UME) and certain other ophthalmic indications under development. ARVN001 is branded as XIPERE in the U.S. and ARCATUS® in China.\n  * Arctic Vision reported positive topline results from its Phase 3 clinical trial of ARCATUS for the treatment of UME in China and announced that New Drug Applications for ARCATUS are under review by regulators in Australia and Singapore.\n  * Tony Gibney was appointed Chair of Clearside’s Board of Directors, effective November 1, 2024, succeeding Clay Thorp, who will continue serving as a member of the Board. Mr. Gibney joined Clearside’s Board as an independent director in April 2024 and is an experienced biotechnology executive and former investment banker, most recently serving as Executive Vice President, Chief Business & Strategy Officer, of Iveric Bio, Inc. until the company’s acquisition by Astellas Pharma Inc. in July 2023.\n  * Glenn Yiu, MD, PhD, Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of California, Davis, was appointed to Clearside’s Scientific Advisory Board in July 2024. Dr. Yiu, a board-certified vitreoretinal surgeon, leads the translational research program at UC Davis studying AMD and other retinal diseases, with a focus on ocular imaging technologies, gene editing and delivery, and animal models of retinal disease.\n  * An article was published titled “Early Adoption of Triamcinolone Acetonide Suprachoroidal Injection for UME: A Physician Survey” by Christopher R. Henry et al. that summarizes physicians’ “real-world” perspectives on early experiences with XIPERE for the treatment of patients with UME. Findings from this survey indicate that the suprachoroidal injection technique was easy to learn (92% found the injection procedure relatively easy post-training) and resulted in favorable patient outcomes consistent with clinical trial data. The full publication can be accessed [here](https://clearsidebio.com/technology/publications-presentations/).\n  * Clearside’s gene therapy partner, REGENXBIO, reported on both of their programs administering ABBV-RGX-314 via Clearside’s SCS Microinjector. Based on positive interim results to date from the Phase 2 ALTITUDE® trial in diabetic retinopathy (DR), AbbVie and REGENXBIO announced that they have accelerated a planned End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA expected this quarter. REGENXBIO expects to initiate the first global pivotal trial in DR in the first half of 2025. In addition, the ALTITUDE trial is enrolling a new cohort of patients with center-involved diabetic macular edema. In wet AMD, based on a favorable safety profile and to evaluate dose levels for a planned pivotal program, the Phase 2 AAVIATE® trial is enrolling a new cohort.\n  * In September 2024, Clearside’s ocular oncology partner, Aura Biosciences, presented positive Phase 2 end-of-study results evaluating bel-sar (AU-011) for the first-line treatment of early-stage choroidal melanoma at The Retina Society Annual Meeting. Bel-sar is being administered via Clearside’s SCS Microinjector.\n  * Multiple presentations were delivered at the 2024 Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) and preceding events that highlighted encouraging safety and efficacy data from clinical trials of therapies utilizing Clearside’s SCS Microinjector to deliver drugs into the suprachoroidal space to treat a variety of retinal diseases.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * License and other revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.0 million, compared to $0.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The revenue primarily related to payments pursuant to Clearside’s license agreements and revenue for services and the sales of SCS Microinjector kits to licensees.\n  * Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $4.1 million, compared to $5.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a $1.9 million decrease in costs related to the CLS-AX program, which was partially offset by increases in employee-related costs and device development and a research and development tax credit received in the prior year.\n  * General and administrative expenses were $2.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $2.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in patent-related expenses and consulting fees.\n  * Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $7.7 million, or $0.10 per share of common stock, compared to net loss of $9.3 million, or $0.15 per share of common stock, for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, Clearside’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $23.6 million. The Company believes it will have sufficient resources to fund its planned operations into the third quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call & Webcast Details**\n\nClearside’s management will host a webcast and conference call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the financial results and provide a corporate update.
