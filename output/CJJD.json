BUSINESS.\nOverview\nWe are a retailer and distributor of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products typically found in retail pharmacies in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC” or\n“China”). Prior to acquiring Zhejiang Jiuxin Medicine Co., Ltd. (“Jiuxin Medicine”) in August 2011 (see “Our Corporate History and Structure - HJ Group” below), we were\nprimarily a retail pharmacy operator. We currently have one hundred and eighteen (118) store locations under the store brand “Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy” in Hangzhou city and its\nadjacent town Lin’an. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company dissolved eight independent pharmacies. Among the eight dissolved pharmacies, two stores had\nmerged into Jiuzhou Pharmacy, as defined below, and became Jiuzhou Pharmacy stores in Hangzhou. The other six stores’ licenses of government medical insurance, which qualify\nthe stores for reimbursement from government, were transferred to six Jiuzhou Pharmacy stores in Hangzhou City. Additionally, we acquired a local drugstore chain with ten stores\nin January 2020. Then we dissolved the chain and transferred its certificates to Jiuzhou Pharmacy stores. Furthermore, we closed three stores in calendar 2019 due to their\nunderperformance and opened a new store in April 2020. Amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, we experienced a decline in the number of customer visits during the first three months of\ncalendar 2020 due to the implementation of the lockdown policy in China. However, as China is gradually controlling the spread of COVID-19, we believe these negative impacts are\ntemporary.\nWe currently operate in four business segments in China: (1) retail drugstores, (2) online pharmacy, (3) wholesale business selling products similar to those we carry in\nour pharmacies, and (4) farming and selling herbs used for traditional Chinese medicine (“TCM”). All of the above business are performed in China with no other international\nsales.\nOur stores provide customers with a wide variety of pharmaceutical products, including prescription and over-the-counter (“OTC”) drugs, nutritional supplements, TCM,\npersonal and family care products, and medical devices, as well as convenience products, including consumable, seasonal, and promotional items. Additionally, we have doctors\nlicensed in both western medicine and TCM on site for consultation, examination and treatment of common ailments at scheduled hours. Three (3) stores have adjacent medical\nclinics offering urgent care (to provide treatment for minor ailments such as sprains, minor lacerations, and dizziness that can be treated on an outpatient basis), TCM (including\nacupuncture, therapeutic massage, and cupping) and minor outpatient surgical treatments (such as suturing). Our stores vary in size, but presently average close to 200 square\nmeters per store. We attempt to tailor each store’s product offerings, physician access, and operating hours to suit the community where the store is located.\nWe operate our pharmacies (including the medical clinics) through the following companies in China that we control through contractual arrangements (refer to\n“Contractual Arrangements with HJ Group and the Key Personnel” below in this report regarding the details of contractual arrangements:\n● Hangzhou Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy Chain Co., Ltd. (“Jiuzhou Pharmacy”), which we control contractually, operates our “Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy” stores;\n● Hangzhou Jiuzhou Clinic of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine (General Partnership) (“Jiuzhou Clinic”), which we control contractually, operates one (1) of\nour three (3) medical clinics; and\n● Hangzhou Jiuzhou Medical & Public Health Service Co., Ltd. (“Jiuzhou Service”), which we control contractually, operates our other medical clinics.\nIn addition, we operate pharmacies through Lin’An Jiuzhou Pharmacy Co., Ltd (“Lin’An Jiuzhou”), which are directly held by Jiuxin Investments Management Co. Ltd.\nWe have also opened two clinics adjacent to our drugstores under Zhejiang Jiuzhou Linjia Medical Investment and Management Co. Ltd. (“Linjia Medical”), which are controlled\nby Jiuzhou Pharmacy.\nWe also offer OTC drugs and nutritional supplements for sale through a website (www.dada360.com) operated by Jiuzhou Pharmacy. For the fiscal year ended March 31,\n2020, retail revenue, including pharmacies, medical clinics accounted for approximately 63.1% of our total revenue, while online pharmacy revenue accounted for 11.6% of our total\nrevenue.\nSince August 2011, we have operated a wholesale business through Zhejiang Jiuxin Medicine Co., Ltd. (“Jiuxin Medicine”), distributing third-party pharmaceutical\nproducts (similar to those carried by our pharmacies) primarily to trading companies throughout China. Jiuxin Medicine is wholly owned by Jiuzhou Pharmacy. For the fiscal year\nMarch 31, 2020, wholesale revenue accounted for approximately 25.3% of our total revenue.\nWe also have an herb farming business cultivating and wholesaling herbs used for TCM. This business is conducted through Hangzhou Qianhong Agriculture\nDevelopment Co., Ltd. (“Qianhong Agriculture”), a wholly-owned subsidiary. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we generated no revenue from our herb farming\nbusiness.\nThroughout this report, we will sometimes refer to Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service, Lin’An Jiuzhou, as well as the subsidiaries of Jiuzhou Pharmacy,\ncollectively as “HJ Group.”\nOur Corporate History and Structure\nWe were incorporated in Nevada on December 19, 2006, under the name “Kerrisdale Mining Corporation,” with a principal business objective to acquire and develop\nmineral properties. Although we had acquired certain mining claims, we were not operational.\n1\nOn July 14, 2008, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to increase our authorized capital stock from 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to\n500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and authorized the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. With\nrespect to the preferred shares, our Board of Directors has the right to set its designations, preferences, limitations, privileges, qualifications, dividend, conversion, voting, and\nother special or relative rights.\nOn September 17, 2009, we acquired control of Renovation Investment (Hong Kong) Co., Ltd., a limited liability company incorporated in Hong Kong on September 2, 2008\n(“Renovation”), pursuant to a share exchange agreement.\nOn September 24, 2009, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name from “Kerrisdale Mining Corporation” to “China Jo-Jo Drugstores, Inc.”\nOn April 9, 2010, we implemented a 1-for-2 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock and a proportional reduction of our authorized\nshares of common stock, by filing a Certificate of Change pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 78.209 with the Nevada Secretary of State on April 6, 2010. All share information in\nthis report takes into account this reverse stock split.\nOn April 28, 2010, we completed a registered public offering of 3,500,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $5.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to us, prior\nto deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, of approximately $17,500,000.\nOn July 24, 2015, we closed a registered direct offering of 1.2 million shares of common stock at $2.50 per share with gross proceeds of approximately $3 million from our\neffective shelf registration statement on Form S-3.\nOn January 23, 2017, we completed a private offering of 4,840,000 shares of the common stock at a price of $2.20 per share with gross proceeds of $10,648,000.\nOn April 15, 2019, we closed a registered direct offering of 4,000,008 shares of common stock at $2.50 per share with gross proceeds of $10,000,020 from our effective shelf\nregistration statement on Form S-3. In a concurrent private placement we issued to the investors unregistered warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,000,006 shares of\ncommon stock at an exercise price of $3.00 per share. The placement agent receives warrants to purchase up to 240,000 shares of the common stock with an exercise price of $3.125\nper share.\nOn June 3, 2020, we closed a registered direct offering of 5,000,004 shares of common stock at $2.00 per share with gross proceeds of $10,000,008 from our effective shelf\nregistration statement on Form S-3. In a concurrent private placement we issued to the investors unregistered warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,750,003 shares of\ncommon stock at an exercise price of $2.60 per share. The placement agent receives warrants to purchase up to 300,000 shares of the common stock with an exercise price of $2.57\nper share.\nRenovation\nRenovation was formed by the owners of HJ Group, as defined below, as a special purpose vehicle to raise capital overseas, in accordance with the requirements of\nChina’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”). SAFE issued the Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for Financing and\nRound-Trip Investment Undertaken by Domestic Residents Through Overseas Special-Purpose Vehicles (“Circular No. 75”) on October 21, 2005. To further clarify the\nimplementation of Circular 75, on May 31, 2007, SAFE issued a supplementary official notice known as Hui ZhongFa [2007] No. 106 (“Circular 106”). Circular 75 and Circular 106\nrequire the owners of any Chinese company to obtain SAFE’s approval before establishing any offshore holding company structure for foreign financing as well as subsequent\nacquisition matters in China. Accordingly, the owners of HJ Group submitted their applications to SAFE on July 25, 2008. On August 16, 2008, SAFE approved the applications,\npermitting these Chinese nationals to establish Renovation as an offshore, special purpose vehicle which was permitted to have foreign ownership and participate in foreign capital\nraising activities. After SAFE’s approval, the owners of HJ Group became holders of one hundred percent (100%) of Renovation’s issued and outstanding capital stock on\nSeptember 2, 2008. See “ Relevant PRC Regulations - SAFE Registration ” below.\nJiuxin Management\nZhejiang Jiuxin Investment Management Co., Ltd. (“Jiuxin Management”) was organized in the PRC on October 14, 2008. Since all of its issued and outstanding capital\nstock is held by Renovation, a Hong Kong company, Jiuxin Management is deemed a “wholly foreign owned enterprise” (“WFOE”) under applicable PRC laws.\nJiutong Medical\nHangzhou Jiutong Medical Technology Co., Ltd. (“Jiutong Medical”) was organized in the PRC on December 20, 2011. Like Jiuxin Management, Jiutong Medical is also\ndeemed a WFOE because it is wholly owned by Renovation. In November 2013, Jiutong Medical acquired the right to use of a piece of land, for which we intended to establish a\nherb processing plant. However, as our herb business has not grown, we have not started constructing the plant as of March 31, 2020. In the future, we may sell the land.\nShouantang Technology\nShouantang Technology was organized in the PRC on July 16, 2010. Like Jiuxin Management and Jiutong Medical, it is also deemed a WFOE because it is wholly owned\nby Renovation.\n2\nIn November 2010, Shouantang Technology acquired one hundred percent (100%) of Quannuo Technology and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Hangzhou Quannuo Grand\nPharmacy Co., Ltd. (“Hangzhou Quannuo”), pursuant to an equity ownership transfer agreement. Quannuo Technology was organized in the PRC on July 7, 2009, and Hangzhou\nQuannuo was established on July 8, 2010. Hangzhou Quannuo has terminated its State Administration of Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”) license in April 2015 and currently has\nno operations.\nIn November 2015, we sold all of the equity interests of Quannuo Technology to six individuals for approximately $17,121 (RMB107,074). Quannuo Technology previously\nprovided technical support to our online pharmacy and incurred accumulated losses over the last five years of its operations. After the sale, its technical support function has been\ntransferred back to Jiuzhou Pharmacy, which hosts our online pharmacy.\nQianhong Agriculture\nQianhong Agriculture was organized in the PRC on August 10, 2010 for our herb farming business. We planted ginkgo, also known as maidenhair, trees during the year\nended March 31, 2013. A ginkgo tree may have a growth period of up to twenty years before it is mature enough for harvest. Usually, the longer it grows the more valuable it\nbecomes. As of March 31, 2020, we have not harvested or sold any herbs.\nShouantang Bio\nOn October 11, 2014, the Company, through Jiuzhou Pharmacy, formed Shouantang Bio-technology Co., Ltd. (“Shouantang Bio”) by contributing $0.16 million (RMB1\nmillion) as its registered capital. Shouantang Bio was formed to sell nutritional supplements under its own brand name, Shouantang.\nJiuyi Technology\nOn September 10, 2015, Renovation set up an entity named Hangzhou Jiuyi Medical Technology Co. Ltd, (“Jiuyi Technology”) with registered capital of $5 million, which\nwas originally intended to provide additional technical support such as webpage development to our online pharmacy business. Later on, we decided to move online technical\nsupports back to Jiuzhou Pharmacy, so Jiuyi Technology had no significant online technical operations. Jiuyi Technology is located in Hangzhou, China. As it now has no\noperation, we may close it in the future.\nLin’an Jiuzhou\nOn March 31, 2017, the Company, through Jiuxin Management, formed Lin’an Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy Co. Ltd, (“Lin’an Jiuzhou”) with registered capital of $725,570\n(RMB 5 million), to expand our retail pharmacies in Lin’an City.\nLinjia Medical\nOn September 27, 2017, the Company, through Jiuzhou Pharmacy, formed and held 51% of Zhejiang Jiuzhou Linjia Medical Investment and Management Co. Ltd. with\nregistered capital of $2,979,460 (RMB20 million), to expand our clinics network adjacent to our drugstores. After extensive market research, Linjia Medical started operation of its\nclinics in late calendar year 2018. However, Linjia Medical has not been profitable. As of March 31, 2020, we kept running two clinics under the brand of Linjia Medical.\nAyi Health\nOn March 29, 2019, the Company, through Jiuzhou Pharmacy, formed and currently holds 51% of the equity of Zhejiang AyiGe Medical Health Management Co., Ltd.\n(“Ayi Health”), which is intended to provide technical support such as IT and customer support to our health management business in the future.\nHJ Group\nJiuzhou Pharmacy is a PRC limited liability company established on September 9, 2003 by Mr. Lei Liu (55%), Mr. Chong’an Jin (23%) and Ms. Li Qi (22%). Hangzhou\nKuaileren Grand Pharmacy Co., Ltd. (“Kuaileren”), originally a subsidiary of Jiuzhou Pharmacy, was dissolved on April 9, 2011. Prior to its dissolution, Kuaileren operated a\n“Kuaileren Grand Pharmacy” store, which is now a “Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy” store. On July 1, 2014, Mr. Chong’an Jin transferred all of the equity interests he held in Jiuzhou\nPharmacy to Mr. Lei Liu and Ms. Li Qi. As a result of this transfer, Mr. Lei Liu held 61% and Ms. Li Qi held 39% equity interests of Jiuzhou Pharmacy. On August 21, 2017, after Mr.\nLei Liu transferred certain shares to Ms. Li Qi, Mr. Lei Liu held 56.7% and Ms. Li Qi held 43.3%. On April 25, 2018, Mr. Wei Chen, who is associated with CareRetail Holdings\nLimited, agreed to invest RMB200,000 and hold 1% of Jiuzhou Pharmacy. As a result, Mr. Lei Liu held 56.13% and Ms. Li Qi has held 42.87% equity interests of Jiuzhou Pharmacy.\nMr. Lei Liu and Ms. Li Qi are from time to time referred to in this report as Key Personnel.\nJiuzhou Pharmacy currently has one subsidiary, Jiuxin Medicine, which was organized in the PRC on December 31, 2003. In April 2011, Jiuzhou Pharmacy entered into an\nequity ownership transfer agreement with the owners of Jiuxin Medicine, and its business license was transferred to Jiuzhou Pharmacy, although no consideration was paid. On\nAugust 25, 2011, the acquisition of Jiuxin Medicine was completed for $4.7 million (RMB 30 million).\nJiuzhou Clinic is a PRC general partnership established on October 10, 2003 by Mr. Liu (39%), Mr. Jin (31%) and Ms. Qi (30%). Jiuzhou Clinic is a medical practice currently\noperating adjacent to the “Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy” store in Daguan, providing primary, urgent, minor surgical, and traditional medical care services. Additionally, Jiuzhou Clinic’s\nphysicians consult with and examine patients at other “Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy” stores.\n3\nJiuzhou Service is a PRC limited liability company established on November 2, 2005 by Mr. Liu (39%), Mr. Jin (31%) and Ms. Qi (30%). Jiuzhou Service is licensed as a\nhealthcare management company and currently manages the medical clinic operating adjacent to the “Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy” stores in Wenhua and Xiasha, providing services\nsimilar to those at the Daguan clinic. In November 30, 2017, Mr. Jin transferred his shares to Mr. Liu and Ms. Qi. After the transfer, Mr. Liu owns 56.7% and Ms. Qi owns 43.3% of\nthe Jiuzhou Service.\nWe control HJ Group through contractual arrangements. See “Contractual Arrangements with HJ Group and the Key Personnel” below.\nContractual Arrangements with HJ Group and the Key Personnel\nOur relationships with HJ Group and the Key Personnel are governed by a series of contractual arrangements that they have entered into with Jiuxin Management.\nPRC regulations on foreign investment currently permit foreign companies to establish or invest in WFOEs or joint ventures that engage in wholesale or retail sales of\npharmaceuticals in China. For retail sales, however, these regulations restrict the number and size of pharmacies that a foreign investor may own. If a chain operates more than\nthirty (30) stores and sells branded pharmaceutical products from different suppliers, a foreign investor may own only up to forty nine percent (49%) of such chain. The contractual\narrangements with Jiuzhou Pharmacy render such restrictions inapplicable to us, since neither we nor our subsidiaries own equity interests in Jiuzhou Pharmacy, while at the same\ntime we retain control of its drugstore chain by virtue of the contractual arrangements.\nSimilarly, PRC regulations place certain restrictions on foreign ownership of medical practices. Foreign investors can only acquire ownership interests through a Sino-\nforeign joint venture and not through a WFOE. Since we do not have actual equity interests in Jiuzhou Clinic or Jiuzhou Service, and instead control these entities through\ncontractual arrangements, such regulations do not apply to us or our structure.\nUnder PRC laws, Jiuxin Management, Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Service and Jiuzhou Clinic are each independent business entities not exposed or subject to the liabilities\nincurred by any of the other three (3) entities. The contractual arrangements constitute valid and binding obligations of the parties to such agreements. Each of the contractual\narrangements, and the rights and obligations of the parties thereto, are enforceable and valid in accordance with the laws of the PRC. These contractual arrangements, as amended\nand in effect, include the following:\nConsulting Services Agreements. Pursuant to certain exclusive consulting services agreements (the “Consulting Services Agreements”), Jiuxin Management has the\nexclusive right to provide Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Service and Jiuzhou Clinic with general business operation services, including advisory and strategic planning services, as\nwell as consulting services related to their current and future operations (the “Services”). Additionally, Jiuxin Management owns the intellectual property rights developed or\ndiscovered through research and development, in the course of providing the Services, or derived from the provision of the Services. Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Service and\nJiuzhou Clinic must each pay a quarterly consulting services fee in RMB to Jiuxin Management that is equal to its profits for such quarter. This agreement is in effect until and\nunless terminated by written notice of a party to the agreement in the event that: (a) a party becomes bankrupt, insolvent, is the subject of proceedings or arrangements for\nliquidation or dissolution, ceases to carry on business, or becomes unable to pay its debts as they become due; (b) Jiuxin Management terminates its operations; or (c)\ncircumstances arise which would materially and adversely affect the performance or the objectives of the agreement. Jiuxin Management may also terminate the agreement with any\nof Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Service or Jiuzhou Clinic if one of them breaches the terms of the agreement, or without cause.\nOperating Agreements. Pursuant to certain operating agreements (the “Operating Agreements”), Jiuxin Management agrees to guarantee the contractual performance by\nJiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Service and Jiuzhou Clinic of their agreements with any third party. In return, the Key Personnel must appoint designees of Jiuxin Management to the\nboards of directors and senior management of Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Service and Jiuzhou Clinic. In addition, each of Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Service and Jiuzhou Clinic\nagrees to pledge its accounts receivable and all of its assets to Jiuxin Management. Moreover, without the prior consent of Jiuxin Management, Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Service\nand Jiuzhou Clinic cannot engage in any transactions that could materially affect their respective assets, liabilities, rights or operations, including, without limitation, incurrence or\nassumption of any indebtedness, sale or purchase of any assets or rights, incurrence of any encumbrance on any of their assets or intellectual property rights in favor of a third\nparty, or transfer of any agreements relating to their business operations to any third party. They must also abide by corporate policies set by Jiuxin Management with respect to\ntheir daily operations, financial management and employment issues. The term of this agreement is from August 1, 2009 until the maximum period of time permitted by law. Jiuzhou\nPharmacy, Jiuzhou Service and Jiuzhou Clinic cannot terminate this agreement.\nEquity Pledge Agreements. Pursuant to certain equity pledge agreements (the “Equity Pledge Agreement”), the Key Personnel have pledged all of their equity interests in\nJiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Service and Jiuzhou Clinic to Jiuxin Management in order to guarantee these companies’ performance of their respective obligations under the\nConsulting Services Agreement. If these companies or the Key Personnel breach their respective contractual obligations, Jiuxin Management, as pledgee, will be entitled to certain\nrights, including the right to sell the pledged equity interests. The Key Personnel have also agreed that upon occurrence of any event of default, Jiuxin Management shall be\ngranted an exclusive, irrevocable power of attorney to take actions in the place and stead of the Key Personnel to carry out the security provisions of this agreement, and to take\nany action and execute any instrument that Jiuxin Management may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this agreement. The Key Personnel agree not to\ndispose of the pledged equity interests or take any actions that would prejudice Jiuxin Management’s interests. This agreement will expire two (2) years after the obligations of\nJiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Service and Jiuzhou Clinic under the Consulting Services Agreement have been fulfilled.\n4\nOption Agreements. Pursuant to the option agreements, the Key Personnel irrevocably grant Jiuxin Management or its designee an exclusive option to purchase, to the\nextent permitted under PRC law, all or part of their equity interests in Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Service and Jiuzhou Clinic for the cost of the initial contributions to the registered\ncapital or the minimum amount of consideration permitted by applicable PRC law. Jiuxin Management or its designee has sole discretion to decide when to exercise the option,\nwhether in part or in full. The term of this agreement commenced from August 1, 2009 and continues for the maximum period of time permitted by law.\nVoting Rights Proxy Agreements. Pursuant to the voting rights proxy agreements, the Key Personnel irrevocably grant a designee of Jiuxin Management the right to\nexercise the voting and other ownership rights of the Key Personnel in Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Service and Jiuzhou Clinic, including the rights to (i) attend any meeting of the\nKey Personnel (or participate by written consent in lieu of such meeting) in accordance with applicable laws and each company’s incorporating documents, (ii) sell or transfer all or\nany of the equity interests of the Key Personnel in these companies, and (iii) appoint and vote for the companies’ directors. The proxy agreement may be terminated by mutual\nconsent of the parties or upon thirty (30) days’ written notice from Jiuxin Management.\nOther than as pursuant to the foregoing contractual arrangements, Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Service and Jiuzhou Clinic cannot transfer any funds generated from their\nrespective operations. The contractual arrangements were originally entered into on August 1, 2009, and amended on October 27, 2009.\nOur Current Corporate Structure\nThe following diagram illustrates our current corporate structure as of June 28, 2020:\n5\nThe table below summarizes the status of the registered capital of our PRC subsidiaries and controlled companies as of the date of this report:\nDue Date for\nEntity Registered Registered Unpaid Registered\nEntity Name Type Capital Capital Paid Capital\nJiutong Medical Subsidiary USD 2,600,000 USD 2,600,000 N/A\nJiuzhou Clinic VIE N/A N/A N/A\nJiuzhou Pharmacy VIE USD 733,500 USD 733,500 N/A\nJiuzhou Service VIE USD 73,350 USD 73,350 N/A\nJiuxin Management Subsidiary USD 14,500,000 USD 14,500,000 N/A\nJiuxin Medicine VIE USD 1,564,000 USD 1,564,000 N/A\nQianhong Agriculture Subsidiary USD 1,497,000 USD 1,497,000 N/A\nShouantang Technology Subsidiary USD 11,000,000 USD 11,000,000 N/A\nShouantang Bio Subsidiary USD 162,900 USD 162,900 N/A\nJiuyi Technology Subsidiary USD 5,000,000 USD 2,500,000 September 25, 2026\nLin’an Jiuzhou Subsidiary USD 725,570 USD 72,557 March 31, 2027\nLinjia Medical VIE USD 2,979,460 USD 1,489,730 N/A\nAyi Health VIE USD 1,489,730 None N/A\nOur Business\nPharmacies\nAs of March 31, 2020, We currently have one hundred and eighteen (118) pharmacies throughout Hangzhou, the provincial capital of Zhejiang and neighborhood cities.\nPharmacy sales accounted for approximately 84.5% of our retail revenue, and 63.1% of our total revenue, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. We offer primarily third-party\nproducts at our pharmacies, including:\n● Approximately 1,469 prescription drugs (295 of which require a physician’s prescription and the remainder requiring customer personal information registration only),\nsales of which accounted for approximately 35.2% of our retail revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020;\n● Approximately 1,704 OTC drugs, sales of which accounted for approximately 42.6% of our retail revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020;\n● Approximately 482 nutritional supplements, including a variety of healthcare supplements, vitamin, mineral and dietary products, sales of which accounted for\napproximately 8.1% of our retail revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020;\n● TCM, including drinkable herbal remedies and pre-packaged herbal mixtures for making soup, sales of which accounted for approximately 7.2% of our retail revenue\nfor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020;\n● Sundry products (i.e., personal care products such as skin care, hair care and beauty products, convenience products such as soft drinks, packaged snacks, and\nother consumable, cleaning agents, stationeries, and seasonal and promotional items tailored to local consumer demand for convenience and quality), sales of which\naccounted for approximately 1.8% of our retail revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020; and\n● Medical devices (i.e., family planning and birth control products, early pregnancy test products, portable electronic diagnostic apparatus, rehabilitation equipment,\nand surgical tools such as hemostats, needle forceps and surgical scissors), sales of which accounted for approximately 5.2% of our retail revenue for the fiscal year\nended March 31,2020.\n6\nWe favor retail locations in well-established residential communities with relatively concentrated consumer purchasing power or are located in close proximity to local\nhospitals, and evaluate potential store sites to assess consumer traffic, visibility and convenience. Depending on its size, each drugstore has between two (2) to twenty-five (25)\npharmacists on staff, all of whom are properly licensed. We only accept prescriptions from licensed health care providers, and verify the validity, accuracy, and completeness of all\nprescriptions. We also ask all prescription customers to disclose their drug allergies, current medical conditions, and current medications. Most pharmacies also maintain a TCM\ncounter staffed by licensed herbalists.\nAfter opening, a location without SHI coverage may take up to one year to achieve our projected revenue goals for that particular location. Various factors influence\nindividual store revenue including, but not limited to: location, nearby competition, local population demographics, square footage, and government insurance coverage.\nAll of our one hundred and eighteen (118) of our drugstores are located in Hangzhou city and its adjacent town Lin’an.\nTo enhance our customers’ experience, we have licensed physicians available at several of our “Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy” locations for consultation, examination and\ntreatment of common ailments at scheduled hours. In addition, our Daguan, Wenhua, Xiasha and Yueming stores have adjoining medical clinics that provide urgent care (for\nconditions such as sprains, minor lacerations, and dizziness), TCM treatments (including acupuncture, therapeutic massage, moxibustion, and cupping), and minor outpatient\nsurgical treatments (such as suturing).\nTo ensure quality and personal attention for patients, we employ only licensed doctors and certified nurses and technicians. Patient treatment at our four (4) Jiuzhou\nClinics and Jiuzhou Service, and all Linjia Clinics follow nationally established clinical practice guidelines from China’s Ministry of Health. We currently have eighty-two (82)\nphysicians and sixty-one (61) clinic staff. In-store consultations and examinations by our physicians are provided free-of-charge to ensure that customers are being prescribed and\ntaking the appropriate medication for their ailments, and to afford customers convenience.\nWe view our medical services as more consumer-driven than other health care specialties, because consumers requiring the types of medical services that we provide\noften seek treatment on their own accord. We have developed our medical services to respond to the public need for convenient access to medical consultations and/or care and\nthe significant savings that we can provide as compared to a more traditional medical setting such as a hospital. Many of our patients often need immediate access to medical\nservices, do not have a regular physician, or may lack suitable alternatives. Patient flow is derived from the physical presence of our drugstores, not from pre-existing doctor-\npatient relationships or referrals from other healthcare providers.\nWe generate limited revenue directly from our clinics. However, our clinic brings patients into our stores, where they then purchase medical products.\nOnline Sales\nSince May 2010, we have been retailing OTC drugs and nutritional supplements on the Internet at www.dada360.com. Before November 2015, our subsidiary Quannuo\nTechnology operated and maintained the website pursuant to the Internet Pharmaceutical Transaction Service Qualification Certificate issued by the State Food and Drug\nAdministration (the “SFDA”) of Zhejiang Province, which allows us to engage in online retail pharmaceutical sales throughout China. As we sold all our equity interests in\nQuannuo Technology in November 2015, we have transferred our online pharmacy operation function to Jiuzhou Pharmacy. We have established payment methods with banks\nand online intermediaries such as Alipay, and are cooperating with business-to-consumer online vendors such as Taobao. By using Taobao’s platform in addition to our own\nwebsite as mentioned above, we can be exposed to a wider range of customers.\nOnline sales accounted for approximately 11.6% of our total revenue, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Online sales accounted for approximately 10.8% of our retail\nrevenue, and 8.1% of our total revenue, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.\nWholesale\nSince acquiring Jiuxin Medicine in August 2011, we have been distributing third-party products primarily to drug distributors throughout China, including:\n● Approximately 1,455 prescription drugs, the sales of which accounted for approximately 83.7% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 as\ncompared to approximately 1,154 prescription drugs, the sales of which accounted for approximately 63.4% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March\n31, 2019;\n● Approximately 1,662 OTC drugs, the sales of which accounted for approximately 14.1% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 as\ncompared to approximately 1,282 OTC drugs, the sales of which accounted for approximately 33.9% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31,\n2019;\n7\n● Approximately 350 nutritional supplements, the sales of which accounted for approximately 0.7% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020\nas compared to approximately 307 nutritional supplements, the sales of which accounted for approximately 1.1% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended\nMarch 31, 2019;\n● TCM products, the sales of which accounted for approximately 1.1% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, as compared to TCM\nproducts, the sales of which accounted for approximately 1.0% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019;\n● Sundry products, the sales of which accounted for approximately 0.1% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 as compared to Sundry\nproducts, the sales of which accounted for approximately 0.1% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019; and\n● Medical devices, the sales of which accounted for approximately 0.3% and 0.5%, of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\nWholesale revenue increased primarily as a result of our ability to resell certain products, which our retail stores made large orders on, to other vendors. As our retail\ndrugstores achieved large quantity sales of certain brand name merchandise, we were able to negotiate for lower purchase prices than the market level on such merchandise. As a\nresult, certain vendors who were unable to obtain better prices than ours, will turn to us for such merchandise, leading the wholesale volume to grow. On the other side, we have\nbeen trying to act as a local agent for well-known health products in Zhejiang Province. For example, we signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Dong’a Gelatin (DEEJ) and\nact as its local sale agent in Zhejiang Province. Until we can establish a new customer base and secure the status to serve as provincial or national exclusive sale agent for certain\npopular drugs, we do not expect our wholesale business to increase significantly in the immediate future.\nHerb Farming\nFrom 2010 to the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we had been cultivating and harvested ten (10) types of herbs, such as fructusrubi (used in TCM to promote blood\ncirculation), white atractylodes rhizome (used in TCM to treat physical and mental fatigue), atractylodesmacrocephala (used in TCM to control sweating), ginkgo seeds (used in\nTCM to treat asthma), and ginkgo trees used for TCM on approximately forty eight (48) acres of leased land in Lin’an, approximately thirty (30) miles from Hangzhou.\nWe planted ginkgo trees during the year ended March 31, 2013. A ginkgo tree may have a growth period of up to twenty years before it is mature enough to harvest.\nTypically, the longer the plant grows, the more valuable it becomes. We plan to continue cultivating the trees in order to maximize their market value in the future. We may continue\ngrowing trees and cultivating other herbs in the future.\nHerb farming revenue accounted for no revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.\nOur Customers\nRetail Customers\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, our pharmacies collectively served an average of 13,475 customers per day. We periodically conduct qualitative customer\nsurveys to help us build a stronger understanding of our market position and our customers’ purchasing habits.\nPharmacy customers pay by cash, debit or credit cards, mobile devices or medical insurance cards under Hangzhou and Zhejiang’s medical insurance programs. During\nthe fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, approximately 15% of our pharmacy revenue came from cash sales, 50% from Hangzhou’s medical insurance cards (where most of our\npharmacies are located), and 35% from debit and credit cards, Zhejiang’s medical insurance cards, Alipay and other charge cards.\n8\nWe maintain strict cash control procedures at our pharmacies. Our integrated information management system records the details of each sale, which we control from our\nheadquarters. Depending on each location’s sales activities, cash may be deposited daily or several times per week in designated bank accounts.\nFor sales made to eligible participants in the national medical insurance program, we generally obtain payments from the relevant government social security bureaus on a\nmonthly basis. See “Relevant PRC Regulations - Reimbursement under the National Medical Insurance Program.” According to relevant regulations, a drugstore usually needs\nto operate for at least one (1) year before it can apply to be licensed to accept Hangzhou’s medical insurance cards. As of the date of this report, one hundred and five (105) of our\none hundred and eighteen (118) “Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy” stores are licensed to accept medical insurance cards. Those of our stores that accept medical insurance cards are\ndesignated as such by clear signage on their storefront windows.\nOnline Sales Customers\nOur online customers consist primarily of consumers between the ages of 20 and 40. While our website is accessible throughout China, approximately thirty percent (30%)\nof our online sales during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, were from Zhejiang and neighboring Jiangsu and Shanghai.\nWholesale Customers\nOur wholesale customers are primarily third-party trading companies that purchase from us to resell to pharmacies throughout China. We also supply some hospitals and\npharmacies, although they collectively make up less than 10.0% of our wholesale customers currently.\nHerb Farming Customers\nOur farming customers primarily include local herb vendors. For the fiscal year ended March, 31, 2020, we had not harvested or sold any herbs.\nMarketing and Promotion\nOur marketing and promotion efforts are focused on our retail segment, specifically, our pharmacies, and our strategy is to build brand recognition, increase customer\nflow, build strong customer loyalty, maximize repetitive customer visits, and develop incremental revenue opportunities.\nOur marketing department designs chain-wide marketing efforts while each store designs local promotions based on local demographics and market conditions. We also\nlaunch single store promotional campaigns and community activities in connection with the opening of new stores. Our store managers and staff are also encouraged to propose\ntheir own advertising and promotional plans, including holiday promotions, posters and billboards. In addition, we offer special discounts and gift promotions for selected\nmerchandise periodically in conjunction with our suppliers’ marketing programs. We also provide ancillary services such as providing free blood pressure readings in our stores.\nMany of our promotional programs are designed to encourage manufacturers to invest resources to market their brands within our stores. We charge manufacturers\npromotional fees in exchange for the right to promote and display their products in our stores during promotional periods. We also allow manufacturers and distributors to station\nsalespeople in our stores to promote their products, for which we receive a fee. Since manufacturers provide purchasing incentives and information to help customers make\ninformed purchase decisions, we believe that manufacturer-led promotions improve our customers’ shopping experience. We work to maintain strong inventory positions for\nmerchandise featured in our promotions, as we believe this increases the effectiveness of our spending on promotional activities.\nWe regularly run advertisements in selected newspapers to promote our brands and the products carried in our stores. Under our agreements with certain newspapers, we\nrun one-page weekly and monthly advertisements, as applicable, and the newspapers publish healthcare-related feature articles relating to our advertised products on or around\nthe dates of our advertisements. We also promote our brands and products using billboards and radio and television commercials. Depending on our agreement with a particular\nmanufacturer, advertising expenses are borne either by us, the manufacturer of the products being advertised, or are shared as a joint expense. Our advertisements are designed to\npromote our brands, our corporate image and the prices of products available for sale in our stores.\nAs part of our marketing campaign, we offer rewards cards to customers, which provide certain exclusive discounts. After a customer signs up for the rewards card, we\ncommunicate via the customer’s preferred method: e-mail, traditional mail or text messages. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, approximately 69.7% of our customers used\ntheir rewards cards to make purchases. We intend to further extend this program to enhance the customer experience and for customer retention. For every 10 Yuan spent at our\nstores, we award 1 membership point. Every 20 points can be exchanged for a 1 Yuan coupon, redeemable towards merchandise purchased at our stores. The reward points never\nexpire, but cannot be applied towards products reimbursed by the local SIC agent. As a result, we recorded unused membership points as accrued expense.\n9\nOur clinic staff also regularly offers free seminars and outreach programs covering various health issues that are topical to the communities where our stores are located.\nSuch events are designed not only to raise public health awareness, but to reach potential customers for our drugstores.\nTo promote our online business, we are cooperating with Taobao, the largest online vendor in China, to help raise awareness among potential customers. Taobao lists our\nproducts on its platform, which then directs consumers back to our website to make their purchases.\nLogistics\nBefore March 31, 2018, we used Jiuxin Medicine’s resources to support our logistics needs in Hangzhou. Beginning March 31, 2018, we outsourced our logistics service\nto Astro Boy Cloud Pan (Hangzhou) Storage and Logistic Co. Ltd (“Astro Boy Logistic”). As a result, Jiuxin Medicine’s warehouse lease has been terminated. Astro Boy Logistic\nprovides us with approximately 14,000 square meters facility located approximately eighteen (18) miles from our headquarters, which served as our central distribution center. Astro\nBoy Logistics’ staff and vehicles make regular deliveries to our pharmacies and wholesale customers. Jiuxin Medicine, however, continues to negotiate with various suppliers and\nmake orders.\nWe employ third-party logistics companies for deliveries to wholesale customers outside Hangzhou. We believe that reliable logistics providers are readily available and\ncan be replaced without any material interruptions to our business.\nSuppliers\nWe currently source retail products from approximately 120 suppliers, including trading companies and direct manufacturers. We source wholesale products from\napproximately 340 suppliers, including many of those that provide our retail products. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, one supplier, HuaDong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.\naccounted for more than twenty-eight and half percent (28.5%) and twenty-six and point two percent (26.2%) of our total purchases and total purchase deposits. The suppliers are\nneither related to nor affiliated with us. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, one supplier, HuaDong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. accounted for more than twenty-two percent\n(22.0%) and twenty-two and point seven percent (22.7%) of our total purchases and total purchase deposits. The suppliers are neither related to nor affiliated with us.\nWe believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we require for our retail and wholesale businesses. As such, we believe that\nwe can change suppliers without any material interruption to our business. To date, we have not experienced any significant difficulty in sourcing our suppliers.\nQuality Control\nWe strongly emphasize quality control, which starts with procurement. In addition to their market acceptance and costs, we select products based on Good\nManufacturing Practice and Good Supply Practice (“GSP”) compliance status of their suppliers. We also assess product quality based on the manufacturer’s facilities and\ncapabilities, including technology, packaging and logistics. We conduct random quality inspections of each batch of products we procure, and replace any supplier who fails to\npass such inspections.\nWe also enforce strict quality control measures at our distribution center. All products are screened upon their arrival, and those with evidence of defects or damages are\nimmediately rejected. Products that pass the screening process are recorded and stored strictly according to each manufacturer’s temperature and other requirements. Products (for\nboth our pharmacies and wholesale customers) are verified against the appropriate delivery orders prior to leaving the facility. We use vehicles with cold-temperature storage to\nmake deliveries as necessary.\nAll of our pharmacy employees participate in a mandatory thirty-six (36) hour training program regarding quality control annually, and we regularly dispatch quality\ninspectors to our stores to monitor the service quality of our staff.\nCompetition\nThe drugstore industry in China is intensely competitive, rapidly evolving and highly fragmented. We compete on the basis of store location, merchandise selection,\nprices and brand recognition. Many of our competitors include large, national drugstore chains that may have more financial resources, stronger brand strength, and management\nexpertise than us, including China Nepstar Chain Drugstore Ltd., LBX Pharmacy, and TianTianHao Grand Pharmacy. Other competitors include local and independent drugstores\nand government-operated pharmacies, as well as discount stores, convenience stores, and supermarkets with respect to sundry and other non-medicinal products that we carry.\nThe wholesale pharmaceutical distribution industry in China is likewise competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with regional distributors, such as Zhengchen\nPharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Hangzhou Xiaoran Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., as well as national operators such as Fengwoda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Jiuzhoutong Pharmaceutical\nCo., Ltd. These competitors have substantially greater logistics capacities and more financial resources, as well as more industry-relevant experience, than us.\n10\nThe online pharmacy is an emerging business in China. We are competing with other online vendors that may be supported by major drugstore chains or initiated by\nsmaller local drugstore chains. In order to compete effectively, we are cooperating with Taobao, the largest online vendor in China. We also invest significant resources in\nselecting products we believe are most suitable for online sales, such as those we have the exclusive right to sell. We have invested significant resources identifying popular\nproducts that we believe can drive sales, while simultaneously controlling costs. In fiscal 2020, we have continued working with large insurance companies in China such as the\nPeople’s Insurance Company (Group) of China Limited and Yingda Taihe Life Insurance Co., Ltd., which sell online products to their enrolled insurance customers. Commercial\nhealth insurance has expanded rapidly in recent years in China, especially after the government began restricting its Social Health Insurance (“SHI”) budget. We expect the close\ncooperation with commercial insurance companies and active strategy on e-commerce platforms will drive up our online sales.\nChina’s herb market is highly specialized. We have not incurred any herb sales in fiscal 2020.\nIntellectual Property\nWe currently have the following trademarks registered with the Trademark Office of the SAIC:\n● “Jiuzhou Tongxin” is a Classes 5 and 35 trademark (for pharmaceuticals and advertisement) issued on February 14, 2011 and March 7, 2013 respectively, registered\nunder Jiuzhou Pharmacy, which we plan to use to brand certain products that we may sell in our stores;\n● “Jiuzhou” is a Classes 5, 35 and 44 trademark (for medical services) issued in April and May 2012, registered under Jiuzhou Pharmacy, which we plan to use to brand\nour medical services;\n● “Shouantang” a Classes 5, 10, 30, 35 and 44 trademark (for pharmaceuticals, construction, food, advertisement and medical services) issued on October 2011, and a\nClasses 3、42、6、19、20、24、31、26、32 and 29 (for oil, diary and others) trademark issued in August and October 2015, registered under Jiuzhou Pharmacy, which\nwe are using to brand certain products that we sell in our stores; and\n● “Jinyuliangyan” is a Class 29 trademark (for food and oil) issued in June 2011, registered under Jiuzhou Pharmacy, which we are using to brand certain products that\nwe sell in our stores; and\n● “Jiuying” is a Classes 5, 35 and 44 trademark (for healthcare and nutritional supplement) issued in December 2012 and February 2013, registered under Jiuzhou\nService, which we are using to brand our service and products that we sell in our clinics.\nWe own and operate the following websites: www.dada360.com (for online sales), www.jiuzhou-drugstore.com (our corporate website used in China), and\nwww.jiuzhou360.com (our English-language corporate website). We also own two (2) inactive domain names. We do not own any patents, nor do we have any pending patent\napplications, and we are not a beneficiary of any licenses, franchises, concessions or royalty agreements.\nAll of our employees are required to enter into written employment agreements with us, pursuant to which they are subject to confidentiality obligations.\nEmployees\nAs of March 31, 2020, we had 1,074 employees combined in our retail and wholesale operations, consisting of 1,014 full-time and 60 part-time employees. The number of\nemployees for each area of operations, and such employees as a percentage of our total workforce, are as follows:\nAs of\nMarch 31, 2020\nEmployees Percentage\nNon-pharmacist store staff 372 34.6%\nPharmacists 348 32.4%\nManagement - non-pharmacists 128 11.9%\nPhysicians 82 7.6%\nNon-physician clinic staff 61 5.7%\nWholesale - non-warehouse 31 2.9%\nOnline pharmacy - technicians 2 0.2%\nOnline pharmacy - non-technicians 50 4.7%\nTotal 1,074 100.00%\n11\nWe strongly emphasize the quality of our employees at all levels, including in-store pharmacists and store staff who directly interact with our customers. We provide\nextensive training for newly recruited employees in the first three (3) months of their employment. The training is designed to encompass a number of areas, such as knowledge of\nour products and effective customer service. In addition, we regularly carry out training programs on medicinal information, nutritional information, and selling skills for our store\nstaff and in-store pharmacists. We believe these programs have played an important role in strengthening the capabilities of our employees.\nVarious drug manufacturers also pay us to have their representatives in our drugstores, and accordingly, we train them under our store policies and procedures.\nRelevant PRC Regulations\nSAFE Registration\nIn October 2005, SAFE issued Circular 75. Circular 75 regulates foreign exchange matters in relation to the use of a special purpose vehicle by PRC residents to seek\noffshore equity financing and conduct “round trip investment” in China. The Key Personnel, who are PRC residents, are in compliance with Circular 75 and its implementing\ncirculars.\nDividend Distribution\nUnder current applicable laws and regulations, each of our consolidated PRC entities, including WFOEs and domestic companies, may pay dividends only out of their\naccumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of our consolidated PRC entities is required to deposit at\nleast ten percent (10%) of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year into its statutory surplus reserve fund until the accumulative amount of such reserve\nreaches fifty percent (50%) of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. As of March 31, 2020 the accumulated balance of our statutory reserve\nfunds reserves amounted to $1.31 million, and the accumulated losses of our consolidated PRC entities amounted to $20.94 million.\nTaxation\nThe current PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (the “EIT Law”), and the implementation regulations for the EIT Law issued by China’s State Council, became effective as of\nJanuary 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law, enterprises are classified as either resident or non-resident enterprises. An enterprise established outside of China with its “de facto\nmanagement bodies” located within China is considered a “resident enterprise,” meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax\npurposes. The implementing rules of the EIT Law defines a “de facto management body” as a managing body that in practice exercises “substantial and overall management and\ncontrol over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties” of the enterprise; however, it remains unclear whether the PRC tax authorities would deem our\nmanaging body as being located within China. Due to the relatively short history of the EIT Law and lack of applicable legal precedents, the PRC tax authorities determine the PRC\ntax resident treatment of entities organized under the laws of foreign jurisdictions on a case-by-case basis.\nIf the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of PRC tax consequences could follow. First, we\nmay be subject to enterprise income tax at a rate of twenty five percent (25%) on our respective worldwide taxable income, as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting\nobligations. Second, although the EIT Law provides that “dividends, bonuses and other equity investment proceeds between qualified resident enterprises” is exempted income,\nand the implementing rules of the EIT Law refer to “dividends, bonuses and other equity investment proceeds between qualified resident enterprises” as the investment proceeds\nobtained by a resident enterprise from its direct investment in another resident enterprise, it is still unclear whether the dividends we receive from Jiuxin Management would be\nclassified as “dividends between qualified resident enterprises” and therefore qualify for tax exemption.\nIf we are treated as a non-resident enterprise under the EIT Law, any dividends that we receive from Jiuxin Management (assuming such dividends are deemed to be\nsourced from within the PRC) (i) may be subject to a five percent (5%) PRC withholding tax, provided that we own more than twenty five percent (25%) of the registered capital of\nJiuxin Management incessantly within twelve (12) months immediately prior to obtaining such dividends from Jiuxin Management, and if the Arrangement between the Mainland\nof China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the\n“Arrangement”) is applicable, or (ii) if the Arrangement does not apply (i.e. the PRC tax authorities may deem us to be a conduit not entitled to treaty benefits), may be subject to a\nten percent (10%) PRC withholding tax. Similarly, if we are treated as a non-resident enterprise, and Renovation is treated as a resident enterprise, then any dividends that we\nreceive from Renovation (assuming such dividends were considered sourced within the PRC) may be subject to a ten percent (10%) PRC withholding tax. Any such taxes on\ndividends could materially reduce the amount of dividends, if any, that we could pay to our shareholders.\n12\nFinally, the new “resident enterprise” classification could result in a situation in which a ten percent (10%) PRC tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our investors that\nare non-resident enterprises so long as such non-resident enterprise investors do not have an establishment or place of business in China or, despite the existence of such\nestablishment of place of business in China, the relevant income is not effectively connected with such establishment or place of business in China, to the extent that such\ndividends have their sources within the PRC. Similarly, any gain realized on the transfer of our shares by such investors is also subject to a ten percent (10%) PRC income tax if\nsuch gain is regarded as income derived from sources within China. In such event, we may be required to withhold a ten percent (10%) PRC tax on any dividends paid to our\ninvestors that are non-resident enterprises. Our investors that are non-resident enterprises also may be responsible for paying PRC tax at a rate of ten percent (10%) on any gain\nrealized from the sale or transfer of our common shares in certain circumstances. We would not, however, have an obligation to withhold PRC tax with respect to such gain.\nMoreover, the State Administration of Taxation issued the Notice on Strengthening the Administration of Enterprise Income Tax on Share Transfer Income of Non-\nResident Enterprises No. 698 (“Circular 698”) on December 10, 2009, which reinforces taxation on transfer of non-listed shares by non-resident enterprises through overseas\nholding vehicles. Circular 698 applies retroactively and was deemed to be effective as of January 2008. Pursuant to Circular 698, where (i) a foreign investor who indirectly holds\nequity interest in a PRC resident enterprise through an offshore holding company indirectly transfers equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise by selling the shares of the\noffshore holding company, and (ii) the offshore holding company is located in a jurisdiction where the effective tax rate is lower than twelve and a half percent (12.5%) or where the\noffshore income of its residents is not taxable, the foreign investor is required to provide the tax authority in charge of that PRC resident enterprise with certain relevant information\nwithin thirty (30) days of the transfer. The tax authorities in charge will evaluate the offshore transaction for tax purposes. In the event that the tax authorities determine that such\ntransfer is abusing forms of business organization and there is no reasonable commercial purpose other than avoidance of PRC enterprise income tax, the tax authorities will have\nthe power to conduct a substance-over-form re-assessment of the nature of the equity transfer. A reasonable commercial purpose may be established when the overall offshore\nstructure is set up to comply with the requirements of supervising authorities of international capital markets. If the State Administration of Taxation’s challenge of a transfer is\nsuccessful, they will deny the existence of the offshore holding company that is used for tax planning purposes. Since Circular 698 has a brief history, there is uncertainty as to its\napplication.\nGeneral PRC Government Approval\nAs a wholesale distributor and retailer of pharmaceutical products, we are subject to regulation and oversight by different levels of the food and drug administration in\nChina, in particular, the SFDA. The Drug Administration Law of the PRC, as amended, provides the basic legal framework for the administration of the production and sale of\npharmaceutical products in China and governs the manufacturing, distributing, packaging, pricing, and advertising of pharmaceutical products in China. The corresponding\nimplementation regulations set out detailed rules with respect to the administration of pharmaceuticals in China. We are also subject to other PRC laws and regulations that are\napplicable to business operators, retailers, and foreign-invested companies.\nDistribution of Pharmaceutical Products\nA distributor of pharmaceutical products must obtain a distribution permit from the relevant provincial or designated municipal- or county-level SFDA. The grant of such\npermit is subject to an inspection of the distributor’s facilities, warehouses, hygienic environment, quality control systems, personnel, and equipment. The distribution permit is\nvalid for five (5) years, and the holder must apply for renewal of the permit within six (6) months prior to its expiration. In addition, a pharmaceutical product distributor needs to\nobtain a business license from the relevant administration for industry and commerce prior to commencing its business. All of our consolidated entities that engage in the retail\npharmaceutical business have obtained necessary pharmaceutical distribution permits, and we do not expect to face any difficulties in renewing these permits and/or certifications.\nIn addition, under the Supervision and Administration Rules on Pharmaceutical Product Distribution, promulgated by the SFDA on January 31, 2007, and effective May\n1, 2007, a pharmaceutical product distributor is responsible for its procurement and sales activities and is liable for the actions of its employees or agents in connection with their\nconduct of distribution on behalf of the distributor. A retail distributor of pharmaceutical products is not allowed to sell prescription pharmaceutical products or Tier A OTC\npharmaceutical products listed in the national or provincial medical insurance catalogs without the presence of a certified in-store pharmacist. See “Reimbursement under the\nNational Medical Insurance Program .”\nRestrictions on Foreign Ownership of Wholesale or Retail Pharmaceutical Business in China\nPRC regulations on foreign investment currently permit foreign companies to establish or invest in WFOEs or joint ventures that engage in wholesale or retail sales of\npharmaceuticals in China. For retail sales, these regulations restrict the number and size of pharmacies that a foreign investor may establish. If a foreign investor owns more than\nthirty (30) stores that sell a variety of branded pharmaceutical products sourced from different suppliers, the foreign investor’s ownership interests in the stores are limited to forty\nnine percent (49%).\nIn lieu of equity ownership, our WFOE, Jiuxin Management, has entered into contractual arrangements with Jiuzhou Pharmacy and the Key Personnel.\n13\nGood Supply Practice Standards\nGSP standards regulate wholesale and retail pharmaceutical product distributors to ensure the quality of distribution of pharmaceutical products in China. All wholesale\nand retail pharmaceutical product distributors are required to apply for GSP certification within thirty (30) days after obtaining drug distribution permits. The current applicable GSP\nstandards require pharmaceutical product distributors to implement strict controls on the distribution of medicine products, including standards regarding staff qualifications,\ndistribution premises, warehouses, inspection equipment and facilities, management, and quality control. Specifically, the warehouse must be able to store the pharmaceutical\nproducts at various required temperatures and humidity, and handle transport, warehouse entries, delivery, and billing by computerized logistics management systems. The GSP\ncertificate is usually valid for five (5) years. Currently, Jiuzhou Pharmacy, and Jiuxin Medicine are all GSP certified.\nPrescription Administration\nUnder the Rules on Administration of Prescriptions promulgated by the SFDA, effective May 1, 2007, doctors are required to include the chemical ingredients of the\nmedicine they prescribe in their prescription and are not allowed to include brand names in their prescription. This regulation is designed to provide consumers with choices among\ndifferent pharmaceutical products that contain the same chemical ingredients.\nAdvertisement of Pharmaceutical Products\nUnder the Advertising Law of PRC, the contents of an advertisement must be true, lawful, without falsehood, and must neither deceive nor mislead consumers.\nAccordingly, advertisement must be examined by the competent authority prior to its publication or broadcast through any form of media. In addition, advertisement of\npharmaceutical products may only be based on a drug’s approved indication of use statement, and may not contain any assurance of a product’s efficiency, treatment efficiency,\ncurative rate, or any other information prohibited by law. Advertisement for certain drugs should include an admonishment to seek a doctor’s advice before purchasing and\napplication. Advertising is prohibited for certain drugs such as anesthetics and psychotropic drugs.\nTo further prevent misleading advertising of pharmaceutical products, the SAIC and the SFDA jointly promulgated the Standards for Examination and Publication of\nAdvertisements of Pharmaceutical Products and Measures for Examination of Advertisement of Pharmaceutical Products in March 2007. Under these regulations, an approval\nmust be obtained from the provincial level of food and drug administration before a pharmaceutical product may be advertised. In addition, once approved, an advertisement’s\ncontent may not be altered without further approval. Such approval, once obtained, is valid for one (1) year.\nProduct Liability and Consumers Protection\nProduct liability claims may arise if the products sold have any harmful effect on consumers. The injured party may make a claim for damages or compensation. The\nGeneral Principles of the Civil Law of the PRC, which became effective in January 1987, state that manufacturers and sellers of defective products causing property damage or\ninjury shall incur civil liabilities for such damage or injuries.\nThe Product Quality Law of the PRC was enacted in 1993 and amended in 2000 to strengthen the quality control of products and protect consumers’ rights and interests.\nUnder this law, manufacturers and distributors who produce or sell defective products may be subject to confiscation of earnings from such sales, revocation of business licenses,\nimposition of fines, and, in severe circumstances, may be subject to criminal liability.\nThe Administrative Measures for Drug Recalls was issued by the SFDA in December 2007, and covers two (2) types of drug recalls, namely voluntary recalls and\ncompulsory recalls. Under such regulation, wholesalers are obliged to assist drug manufacturers with any drug recall. In addition, a wholesaler must immediately cease to sell any\ndrug that the wholesaler learns has any safety issues, and must immediately notify the manufacturer or its supplier as well as report the matter to the SFDA.\nThe Law of the PRC on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Consumers was promulgated on October 31, 1993 and became effective on January 1, 1994 to protect\nconsumers’ rights when they purchase or use goods or services. All business operators must comply with this law when they manufacture or sell goods and/or provide services to\ncustomers. In extreme situations, pharmaceutical product manufacturers and distributors may be subject to criminal liability if their goods or services lead to the death or injuries of\ncustomers or other third parties.\nThe Tort Law of the PRC was promulgated on December 26, 2009 and went into effect on July 1, 2010. The Tort Law provides that manufacturers and distributors who\nproduce or sell defective products shall be responsible for the damage caused by the defective products.\nReimbursement under the National Medical Insurance Program\nEligible participants in the national medical insurance program, consisting primarily of urban residents, are entitled to purchase medicine when presenting their medical\ninsurance cards in an authorized pharmacy, provided that the medicine they purchase has been included in the national or provincial medical insurance catalogs. Depending on\nrelevant local regulations, authorized pharmacies can either (i) sell medicine on credit and obtain reimbursement from relevant government social security bureaus on a monthly\nbasis, or (ii) receive payments from the participants at the time of their purchases, and the participants in turn obtain reimbursement from relevant government social security\nbureaus.\n14\nMedications included in the national and provincial medical insurance catalogs are divided into two (2) tiers. Purchases of Tier A pharmaceutical products are generally\nfully reimbursable, except that certain Tier A pharmaceutical products are only reimbursable to the extent the medications are used specifically for the purposes stated in the\nmedical insurance catalogs. Purchasers of Tier B pharmaceutical products, which are generally more expensive than those in Tier A, are required to make a certain percentage of co-\npayments, with the remaining amount being reimbursable. The percentage of reimbursement for Tier B OTC products varies in different regions in the PRC. Factors that affect the\ninclusion of medicine in the medical insurance catalogs include whether the medicine is consumed in large volumes and commonly prescribed for clinical use in China and whether\nit is considered to be important in meeting the basic healthcare needs of the general public.\nChina’s Ministry of Labor and Social Security, together with other government authorities, has the power to determine which medicines are included in the national\nmedical insurance catalog every two (2) years, under which of the two (2) tiers the included medicine falls, and whether an included medicine should be removed from the catalog.\nSales of Nutritional Supplements and other Food Products\nA distributor of nutritional supplements and other food products must obtain a food circulation permit from its local Administration of Industry and Commerce. The grant\nof such permit is subject to an inspection of the distributor’s facilities, warehouses, hygienic environment, quality control systems, personnel, and equipment. The food circulation\npermit is valid for three (3) years, and the holder must apply for renewal of the certificate within thirty (30) days prior to its expiration. Currently, Jiuxin Medicine, Jiuzhou Pharmacy,\nand our drugstores all hold a valid Food Circulation Permit, except for our Lin’an store and Ren’airu store, which do not sell food products and therefore is not required to hold\nsuch a permit. Currently all of our stores hold valid permits.\nMedical Practice\nHealthcare providers in China are required to comply with many laws and regulations at the national and local government levels. The laws and regulations applicable to\nour medical practice include the following:\n● We must register with and maintain an operating license from the local public health authority for each clinic that we operate, each of which is subject to annual\nreview by the public health authority;\n● The Licensed Physician Act requires that we only hire PRC licensed physicians;\n● All waste material from our clinics must be properly collected, sterilized, deposited, transported and disposed of, and we are required to keep records of the origin,\ntype and amount of all waste materials that we generate for at least three (3) years;\n● We must have at least three (3) physicians, five (5) nurses and one (1) technician on staff at each clinic; and\n● We must establish and follow protocols to prevent medical malpractice, which require us to: (i) insure that patients are adequately informed before they consent to\nmedical operations or procedures; (ii) maintain complete medical records which are available for review by the patient, physicians and the courts; (iii) voluntarily\nreport any event of malpractice to a local government agency; and (iv) support and justify the medical services we provide in any administrative investigation or\nlitigation. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer penalties, including the loss of our license to operate.\nInterim Regulations on Administration of Sino-Foreign Joint Venture and Cooperative Medical Institutions\nAs per China’s commitments to the World Trade Organization, “Foreign service suppliers are permitted to establish joint venture hospitals or clinics with local Chinese\npartners with quantitative limitations in line with China’s needs. Foreign majority ownership is permitted.” In accordance with the Interim Regulations on Administration of Sino-\nForeign Joint Venture and Cooperative Medical Institutions issued jointly by the Ministry of Health (“MOH”) and the Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”) in 2000, the Chinese\nparty of Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperative medical institutions shall hold no less than thirty percent (30%) of shares and legal rights or interest, which also mean foreign\ninvestors are allowed to hold a maximum stake of seventy percent (70%). Such regulations also specify that the establishment of Sino-foreign joint venture and cooperative medical\ninstitutions should be approved respectively by MOH and MOFCOM. In other words, foreigners are allowed to run hospitals or clinics in the form of equity or co-operative joint\nventures with an equity interest of up to seventy percent (70%) lasting up to twenty (20) years.\n15\nInternet Pharmaceutical Sales\nChina’s central government regulates Internet access, the distribution of online information and the conduct of online commerce through strict business licensing\nrequirements and other government regulations. Companies which sell pharmaceutical products to consumers through the Internet are required to obtain: (1) a drug distribution\npermit; (2) an Internet pharmaceutical information provider qualification certificate, renewable every five (5) years; (3) an Internet pharmaceutical transaction service qualification\ncertificate, renewable every five (5) years; (4) a value-added telecommunication operation permit; and (5) registration with the Administration of Information Industry. Internet\npharmacies are not allowed to distribute prescription drugs. The websites that sell pharmaceutical products must ensure transaction security and enable the consumers to consult\nwith licensed pharmacists. Also, an Internet-based business in China is required to obtain and maintain certain assets relevant to its business, such as delivery and storage\nfacilities. Jiuzhou Pharmacy obtained all above-mentioned certificates and registrations and launched www.dada360.com in May 2010 and renewed the certificates in 2015. During\nthe year ended March 31, 2020, the Company also sold pharmaceutical and other products via certain third-party platforms such as Tmall and JD.com.\nTCM Manufacturing\nThe SFDA has adopted a non-mandatory licensing process for TCM manufacturers according to Good Agricultural Practice (“GAP”) for Chinese Crude Drugs.\nManufacturers who meet the government-set requirements will be granted a GAP certificate. Since we do not process the herbs that we harvest and the GAP certification is not\nmandatory, we have not applied for such certification, and currently have no plan of doing so.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur drugstore and wholesale operations do not involve any activities subject to specific PRC environmental regulations. Our medical clinics are in compliance with\napplicable regulations regarding the administration of medical wastes, including collections, temperate storage, and packaging and labeling of medical wastes. Pursuant to such\nregulations, we contract with DadiWeikang Medical Wastes Disposal Center to dispose of all medical wastes generated by our clinics.\nPrincipal Executive Office\nOur principal executive office is located at 6th Floor, Hai Wai Hai Tongxin Mansion, Gong Shu District, Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China. Our main telephone\nnumber is +86-571-88219579, and fax number is +86-571-8821-9579.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this report before making an investment decision with\nregard to our securities. The statements contained in or incorporated into this report that are not historic facts are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and\nuncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occurs,\nour business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of\nyour investment.\n16\nRisks Relating to Our Business in General\nFuture acquisitions are expected to be a part of our growth strategy, and could expose us to significant business risks.\nWe have grown our business, in part, through the acquisition of stores over the years. One of our strategies going forward is to continue our growth by acquiring\nadditional drugstores. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to identify and secure suitable acquisition opportunities. Our ability to consummate and\nintegrate effectively any future acquisitions on terms that are favorable to us may be limited by the number of attractive acquisition targets, internal demands on our resources and,\nto the extent necessary, our ability to obtain any necessary financing for larger acquisitions on terms that are satisfactory to us. Moreover, if an acquisition target is identified, the\nthird parties with whom we seek to cooperate may not select us as a potential partner or we may not be able to enter into arrangements on commercially reasonable terms. The\nnegotiation and completion of potential acquisitions, whether or not ultimately consummated, could also significantly divert management’s time and resources and may potentially\ndisrupt our existing business. Furthermore, we cannot provide any assurance that the expected synergies from future acquisitions will actually materialize. Additionally, future\nacquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional indebtedness, costs, and contingent liabilities, causing us to significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt\nservice requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment, issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders’ percentage ownership, or\nincur write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses. Future acquisitions may also expose us to potential risks, including risks associated with:\n● the integration of new operations, services and personnel;\n● unforeseen or hidden liabilities;\n● the diversion of financial or other resources from our existing businesses;\n● difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience;\n● our inability to generate sufficient revenue to recover costs and expenses of the acquisitions; and\n● potential loss of, or harm to, relationships with employees or customers.\nAny of the above could significantly disrupt our ability to manage our business and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nWe face significant competition, and if we do not compete successfully against existing and new competitors, our revenue and profitability could be materially and adversely\naffected.\nBoth the drugstore, online pharmacy and wholesale pharmaceutical distribution industries in China are highly competitive, and we expect competition to intensify in the\nfuture. Our primary drugstore competitors include other drugstore chains and independent drugstores. Increasingly, we also face competition from discount stores, convenience\nstores and supermarkets as we expand our offering of non-drug convenience products and services. We compete for customers and revenue primarily on the basis of store\nlocation, merchandise selection, price, services offered, and our brand name. Our online pharmacy competitors include other online pharmaceutical vendors. As more large\ntraditional drugstore chain companies entered into the online sales, we face competition ranging from prices to service. Our primary wholesale competitors include regional and\nnational players. In addition, we may be subject to additional competition from new entrants to both industries in China. We could also face increased competition from foreign\ncompanies if the Chinese government removes the restrictions on the entry of foreign companies into these industries.\nSome of our larger competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as:\n● greater financial and other resources;\n● larger variety of products;\n● more extensive and advanced supply chain management systems;\n● greater pricing flexibility;\n● larger economies of scale and purchasing power;\n● more extensive advertising and marketing efforts;\n● greater knowledge of local market conditions;\n● stronger brand recognition; and\n● larger sales and distribution networks.\n17\nAs a result of the aforementioned advantages, we may be unable to offer products similar to, or more desirable than, those offered by our competitors, market our\nproducts as effectively as our competitors, or otherwise respond successfully to competitive pressures. As competition increases in the markets in which we operate, a significant\nincrease in general pricing pressures could occur, which could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive. Our competitors may be able to offer larger\ndiscounts on competing products, and we may not be able to profitably match those discounts. Furthermore, our competitors may offer products that are more attractive to our\ncustomers or that render our products uncompetitive. In addition, the timing of the introduction of competing products into the market could affect the market acceptance and\nmarket share of our products. Our failure to successfully compete could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation, and prospects.\nChanges in economic conditions and consumer confidence in China may influence the drugstore industry, consumer preferences and spending patterns.\nOur business and revenue growth primarily depend on the size of the pharmaceutical market in China. As a result, our revenue and profitability may be negatively affected\nby changes in national, regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence in China. In particular, as we focus on our expansion of pharmacies in metropolitan\nmarkets, where living standards and consumer purchasing power are relatively high, we are especially susceptible to changes in economic conditions, consumer confidence and\ncustomer preferences of the urban Chinese population. External factors beyond our control that affect consumer confidence include unemployment rates, levels of personal\ndisposable income, national, regional or local economic conditions, and acts of war or terrorism. Changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect\nconsumer preferences, purchasing power and spending patterns. A decrease in overall consumer spending as a result of changes in economic conditions could adversely affect\nour front-end and pharmacy sales and negatively impact our profitability. In addition, acts of war or terrorism may cause damage to our facilities, disrupt the supply of the products\nand services we offer in our stores, or adversely impact consumer demand. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe may not be able to timely identify or otherwise effectively respond to changing customer preferences, and we may fail to optimize our product offering and inventory\nposition.\nThe pharmaceutical industry in China is rapidly evolving and is subject to rapidly changing customer preferences that are difficult to predict. Our success depends on our\nability to anticipate and identify customer preferences, and adapt our product selection to meet these preferences. In particular, we must optimize our product selection and\ninventory positions based on sales trends. We cannot provide assurance that our product selection, especially our selection of nutritional supplements and food products, will\naccurately reflect customer preferences at any given time. If we fail to accurately anticipate either the market for our products or customers’ purchasing habits or fail to respond to\ncustomers’ changing preferences promptly and effectively, we may not be able to adapt our product selection to customer preferences or make appropriate adjustments to our\ninventory positions, which could significantly reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to establish effective advertising, marketing and promotional programs.\nOur success depends on our ability to establish effective advertising, marketing and promotional programs, including pricing strategies implemented in response to\ncompetitive pressures and/or to drive demand for our products. Our advertisements are designed to promote our brand, our corporate image and the prices of products available\nfor sale in our stores. Our pricing strategies and value propositions must be appropriate for our target customers. If we are not able to maintain and increase the awareness of our\npharmacy’s brand and the products and services we provide, we may not be able to attract and retain customers and our reputation may also suffer. We expect to incur substantial\nexpenses in our marketing and promotional efforts to both attract and retain customers. However, our marketing and promotional activities may be less successful than we\nanticipate, and may not be effective at building our brand awareness and customer base. In addition, the government may impose restrictions on how marketing and promotional\nactivities can be conducted. We cannot provide assurance that our current and proposed budget for marketing activities will be adequate to support our future growth. Failure to\nsuccessfully execute our advertising, marketing and promotional programs may result in material decreases in our revenue and profitability.\nOur ability to grow our business may be constrained by our inability to find suitable new store locations at acceptable prices or by the expiration of our current leases.\nOur ability to grow our business may be constrained if suitable new store locations cannot be identified with lease terms or purchase prices that are acceptable to us. We\ncompete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. Local land use regulations and other regulations applicable to the kinds of stores we seek to\nconstruct may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing our stores. The expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect\nus if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores. Furthermore, changing local demographics at existing store locations\ncould materially and adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores, and overall our business, financial condition, results of operation, and prospects.\n18\nWe have significant cash deposits with our suppliers and landlords in order to obtain and maintain our inventory and maintain and establish store locations, which we may\nnot be able to recover in the event of bankruptcy by our suppliers or landlords or other events beyond our control.\nOur ability to obtain products and maintain inventory at, and to establish and maintain leases for, our pharmacies, is dependent upon our ability to post and maintain\nsignificant cash deposits with our suppliers and landlords. Many vendors in China are unwilling to ship merchandise on credit and instead require cash deposits, and landlords\nmay require security deposits consisting of the equivalent of twelve (12) months of rent . As of March 31, 2020, we had approximately $2.2 million deposited with suppliers and\napproximately $2.8 million deposited with landlords for our pharmacies. If we are unable or unwilling to establish such advances and deposits, our ability to generate sales and\nexpand our business could be adversely affected. In general, we expect the amounts required for advances and deposits to increase as we undertake our expansion plans, complete\nstore openings and expand our business through acquisitions or otherwise. We do not generally receive interest on the deposits made to suppliers or landlords, and such deposits\nare subject to the risk of loss as a result of the creditworthiness or bankruptcy of the party who holds our funds, as well as the risk from any illegal acts associated with the third\nparty, such as conversion, fraud, theft or dishonesty. If these circumstances were to arise, we could find it difficult or impossible, due to the unpredictability of legal proceedings in\nChina, to recover all or a portion of the amount on deposit with our vendors or landlords.\nIf we are unable to optimize management of our procurement and distribution activities, we may be unable to meet customer demand while increasing the burden on\nmanaging our supply chain.\nSince May 2011, we have been using Jiuxin Medicine’s facility as our distribution center for both our retail and wholesale businesses. Starting from March 31, 2018, we\noutsourced our logistic service to Astro Boy Cloud Pan (Hangzhou) Storage and Logistic Co. Ltd (“Astro Boy Logistic”). As a result, Jiuxin Medicine’s warehouse lease has been\nterminated. Astro Boy Logistic provides us with a facility with approximately 14,000 square meters located approximately eighteen (18) miles from our headquarters, which served\nas our central distribution center. Astro Boy Logistic’s staff and vehicles make regular deliveries to our pharmacies and wholesale customers. Our ability to meet customer demand\nmay be significantly limited if we do not successfully and efficiently conduct our distribution activities, or if Astro Boy Logistic’s facility is destroyed or shut down for any reason,\nincluding as the result of natural disasters. Any disruption in the operation of our distribution activities could result in higher costs or longer lead times associated with\ndistributing our products. Since it is difficult to predict accurate sales volume in our industry, we may be unable to optimize our distribution activities, which may result in excess or\ninsufficient inventory, warehousing, fulfillment or distribution capacity. Furthermore, failure to effectively control product damage during the distribution process could decrease\nour operating margins and reduce our profitability.\nAll product procurement is handled through our corporate headquarters. Such centralization is intended to reduce the cost of goods sold as a result of volume purchase\nbenefits. However, we may be less successful than anticipated in achieving these volume purchase benefits. In addition, such centralization is expected to increase the complexity\nof tracking inventory and could place additional burdens on the management of our supply chain. If we cannot successfully reduce our costs through centralizing procurement,\nour profitability and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nFailure to maintain optimal inventory levels could increase our inventory holding costs or cause us to lose sales, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe need to maintain sufficient inventory levels to operate both of our retail and wholesale businesses successfully as well as meet customer expectations. However, we\nmust also guard against the risk of accumulating excess inventory. We are exposed to inventory risks as a result of rapid changes in product life cycles, changing consumer\npreferences, uncertainty of the success of product launches, seasonality, and manufacturer backorders and other vendor-related problems. We cannot provide assurance that we\ncan accurately predict these trends and events and avoid over-stocking or under-stocking products. In addition, demand for products could change significantly between the time\nproduct inventory is ordered and the time it is available for sale.\nWhen we begin selling a new product, it is particularly difficult to accurately forecast product demand. The purchase of certain types of inventory may require significant\nlead-time. As we carry a broad selection of products and maintain significant inventory levels for a substantial portion of our merchandise, we may be unable to sell such inventory\nin sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons. Carrying excess inventory could increase our inventory holding costs, and failure to have inventory in stock when a\ncustomer orders or purchases it could cause us to lose that order or that customer, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe rely on computer software and hardware systems in managing our operations, the capacity of which may restrict our growth and the failure of which could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon our integrated information management system to monitor daily operations of our retail and wholesale businesses, and to maintain accurate and\nup-to-date operating and financial data for the compilation of management information. In addition, we rely on our computer hardware and network for the storage, delivery and\ntransmission of the data of our retail and wholesale systems. If our computer software and hardware systems fail to meet the increasing needs of our expanding operations, our\nability to grow may be constrained. Furthermore, any system failure which causes interruptions to the input, retrieval and transmission of data or causes lags in service time could\ndisrupt our normal operations. Although we believe that our computer software and hardware systems are up to date and that our disaster recovery plan is adequate in handling\npotential failures, we cannot provide assurance that we can effectively carry out this disaster recovery plan and that we will be able to restore our operation within a sufficiently\nshort time frame to avoid our business being disrupted. Furthermore, our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications\nfailures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, natural disasters, catastrophic events and human error, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all\neventualities. If any of our computer software and/or hardware systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to\nrepair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions. Due to the limited coverage of\nbusiness interruption insurance policies offered in China, we do not carry business interruption insurance and, as a result, any business disruption or natural disaster could\nseverely disrupt our business and operations and, in turn, significantly decrease our revenue and profitability.\n19\nWe depend substantially on the continuing efforts of the Key Personnel, and our business and prospects may be severely disrupted if we lose their services.\nOur future success is dependent on the continued services of the Key Personnel but we do not maintain key-man insurance. If we lose the services of any one of the Key\nPersonnel, we may not be able to locate suitable or qualified replacements, which could severely disrupt our business and prospects. Each of the Key Personnel has entered into\nconfidentiality and non-competition agreements with us. However, if any disputes arise between us and the Key Personnel, we cannot provide assurance, in light of uncertainties\nassociated with the PRC legal system, that any of these agreements can be enforced in China, the jurisdiction in which the Key Personnel reside and hold some of their assets. See\n“Risks Related to Doing Business in China - You may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in\nChina based on United States or other foreign laws against us or our management. ”\nWe depend on the continued service of, and on the ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified and skilled personnel for our business.\nThe implementation of our business strategy and our future success also depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified and skilled\npersonnel. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to attract, hire and retain sufficient numbers of skilled personnel necessary to continue to develop and grow our\nbusiness. We face competition for personnel from both retail and wholesale pharmaceutical distribution operators. This competition could require us to offer higher compensation\nand other benefits in order to attract and retain qualified individuals, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. On the other\nhand, we may be unable to attract or retain the personnel required to achieve our business objectives, and that failure could severely disrupt our business and prospects. The\nprocess of hiring suitably qualified personnel is often lengthy. If our recruitment and retention efforts are unsuccessful in the future, it may be more difficult for us to execute our\nbusiness strategy.\nOur retail and wholesale operations require a number of permits and licenses in order to carry on their business.\nWe are required to obtain certain permits and licenses from various PRC governmental authorities, including a Drug Distribution Permit and a GSP certification. We are\nalso required to obtain food hygiene certificates for the distribution of nutritional supplements and food products. We cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain all\nrequired licenses, permits and certifications to carry on our business at all times, and from time to time we may have not been in the past, or may not be in the future, in compliance\nwith all such required licenses, permits and certifications. Moreover, these licenses, permits and certifications are subject to periodic renewal and/or reassessment by the relevant\nPRC governmental authorities and the standards of such renewal or reassessment may change from time to time. We intend to apply for renewal of these licenses, permits and\ncertifications when required by applicable laws and regulations. Any failure by us to obtain and maintain all licenses, permits and certifications necessary to carry on our business\nat any time could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any inability to renew any of these licenses, permits and\ncertifications could severely disrupt our business, and prevent us from continuing to carry on our business. Any changes in the standards used by governmental authorities in\nconsidering whether to renew or reassess our business licenses, permits and certifications, as well as any enactment of new regulations that may restrict the conduct of our\nbusiness, may also decrease our revenue and/or increase our costs, materially reducing our profitability and prospects. Furthermore, if the interpretation or implementation of\nexisting laws and regulations changes or if new regulations come into effect requiring us to obtain any additional licenses, permits or certifications that were previously not\nrequired to operate our existing businesses, we cannot provide assurance that we can successfully obtain such licenses, permits or certifications.\nWe may need additional capital, and the sale of equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders, while debts may require us to make covenants restricting how we\noperate.\nWe believe that the aggregate amount of our current cash, anticipated cash flow from operations, available borrowings under our existing bank facilities, and personal\nloans from our principal shareholders should be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the near future. We may, however, require additional cash resources due to\nchanged business conditions or other future developments. If our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt\nsecurities or obtain credit facilities. The sale of additional equity securities could result in the dilution of our existing stockholders. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to\nobtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain any requisite financing, the incurrence of additional indebtedness would\nresult in increased debt service obligations, and could result in further operating and financing covenants that would restrict our freedom to operate our business, such as\nconditions that:\n● limit our ability to pay dividends or require us to seek consent for the payment of dividends;\n● increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n● require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital\nexpenditures, working capital and other general corporate purposes; and\n● limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.\n20\nRisks Relating to Our Pharmacy Operations\nOur brand names, trade secrets and other intellectual property are valuable assets. If we are unable to protect them from infringement, our business and prospects may be\nharmed.\nWe consider our pharmacy brand names to be valuable assets. We may be unable to prevent third parties from using such brand names without authorization, which may\nadversely affect our business and reputation, including the perceived quality and reliability of our products and services. We have five (5) registered trademarks. We also own\nthree (3) domain names that we actively use in our business.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our know-how and other proprietary information, including pricing, purchasing, promotional strategies, customer lists and/or suppliers\nlists. As a result, our employees are required to sign employment agreements that contain confidentiality provisions as a condition of their employment with us. However, trade\nsecrets are difficult to protect. While we believe we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors or advisors may unintentionally or\nwillfully disclose our information to competitors. In addition, confidentiality agreements executed by the aforementioned individuals may not be enforceable or provide meaningful\nprotection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure.\nIf we were to enforce a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, such efforts could be expensive and time-consuming, and the\noutcome unpredictable. Additionally, if our competitors independently develop information that is equivalent to our trade secrets or other proprietary information, we have little\nrecourse to enforce our rights, and our business and prospects could be harmed.\nLitigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others.\nHowever, since the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in the PRC are uncertain and still evolving, we may not be successful in\nprosecuting these cases. In addition, any litigation, proceeding or other efforts to protect our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs and diversion of our\nresources, and could seriously harm our business and operating results. Furthermore, the degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain and may not adequately\nprotect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. If we are unable to protect our trade names, trade secrets and other propriety information from\ninfringement, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be exposed to intellectual property infringement and other claims by third parties which, if successful, could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect\non our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to use our proprietary information and know-how without infringing third party intellectual property rights. As litigation\nbecomes more common in China, we face a higher risk of being the subject of claims for intellectual property infringement, invalidity or indemnification relating to other parties’\nproprietary rights. Our current or potential competitors, many of whom have substantial resources, may have or may obtain intellectual property protection that will prevent, limit or\ninterfere with our ability to conduct our business in China. Moreover, the defense of intellectual property suits, including trademark infringement suits and related legal and\nadministrative proceedings, can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our management personnel. Furthermore, an adverse\ndetermination in any such litigation or proceeding to which we may become a party could cause us to:\n● pay damage awards;\n● seek licenses from third parties;\n● pay ongoing royalties;\n● redesign our product offerings; or\n● be restricted by injunctions,\nEach of which could effectively prevent us from pursuing some or all of our business and result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their\npurchase from our stores, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe continued penetration of counterfeit products into the pharmaceutical market in China may damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCounterfeit products have continued to make their way into the Chinese pharmaceutical market. Counterfeit products are generally sold at lower prices compared to their\nauthentic counterparts due to their low production costs, and in some cases may be very similar in appearance to their authentic counterparts. Counterfeit pharmaceuticals may or\nmay not have the same chemical content as their authentic counterparts, and are typically manufactured without proper licenses or approvals as well as fraudulently mislabeled\nwith respect to their content and/or manufacturer. Although China’s central government has been increasingly active in combating counterfeit pharmaceutical and other products,\nChina does not yet have effective regulatory control or an enforcement system over counterfeit pharmaceutical products. Although we have implemented a series of quality control\nprocedures in our procurement process, we cannot provide assurance that we may not be inadvertently selling counterfeit pharmaceutical products. Any unintentional sale of\ncounterfeit products may subject us to negative publicity, fines and/or other administrative penalties, or may even result in litigation against us. Moreover, the increased\ndistribution of counterfeit products and other products in recent years may reinforce the negative image of drug distributors among consumers in China. The continued\nproliferation of counterfeit products in China could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition, and results of operation.\n21\nAs a distributor of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products, we are exposed to inherent risks relating to product liability and personal injury claims.\nDistributors of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of such products. Such risks include\nunintentional distribution of counterfeit, mislabeled or contaminated drugs, and, with respect to our pharmacies, improper filling of prescriptions, labeling of prescriptions and\nadequacy of warnings. Errors in the packaging or dispensing of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury or death. Furthermore, the applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations\nrequire our in-store pharmacists to offer counseling to our customers, without additional charge, about medication, dosage, delivery systems, common side effects, and other\ninformation the in-store pharmacists deem significant. Our in-store pharmacists sometimes also have a duty to warn customers regarding any potential negative effects of a\nprescription drug if the warning could reduce or negate these effects, and we may be liable for claims arising from any advice given by our in-store pharmacists. Product liability or\npersonal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide, and we may be required to pay for\nsubstantial monetary damages for any successful product liability or personal injury claim against us. We may, however, in product liability claims, have the right under applicable\nPRC laws, rules and regulations to recover from the relevant manufacturer any compensation we paid to our customers in connection with such claim. Even if we successfully\ndefend ourselves against this type of claim, we could be required to spend significant management, financial and other resources in the process, which could disrupt our business.\nOur reputation and our brand names may also suffer as a result of any product liability or personal injury claims against us. Like many other similar companies in China, we do not\ncarry product liability insurance. A product recall or damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability or personal injury claim or judgment against us could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to fines and penalties if we fail to comply with the applicable PRC laws and regulations governing sales of medicines under China’s National Medical\nInsurance Program.\nEligible participants in China’s national medical insurance program, mainly consisting of urban residents in China, are entitled to buy medicines using their medical\ninsurance cards from an authorized pharmacy, provided that the medicines they purchase have been included in the national or provincial medical insurance catalogs. The\npharmacy, in turn, obtains reimbursement from the relevant government social security bureaus. Moreover, the applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations prohibit pharmacies from\nselling goods other than pre-approved medicines when purchases are made with medical insurance cards. We have established procedures to prohibit our drugstores from selling\nunauthorized goods to customers who make purchases with medical insurance cards. However, we cannot provide assurance that those procedures will be strictly followed by all\nof our employees in all of our stores.\nRisks Relating to Our Medical Services\nIf we do not attract and retain qualified physicians and other medical personnel, our ability to provide medical services would be adversely affected.\nThe success of our medical services will, in part, be dependent upon the number and quality of doctors, nurses and other medical support personnel that we employ and\nour ability to maintain good relationships with them. Our medical staff may terminate their employment with us at any time. If we are unable to successfully maintain good\nrelationships with them, our ability to provide medical services may be adversely affected.\nThe provision of medical services is heavily regulated in the PRC and failure to comply with those regulations could result in penalties, loss of licensure, additional\ncompliance costs or other adverse consequences.\nHealthcare providers in China, as in most other populous countries, are required to comply with many laws and regulations at the national and local government levels.\nThese laws and regulations relate to: licensing; the conduct of operations; the ownership of facilities; the addition of facilities and services; advertising; confidentiality,\nmaintenance and security issues associated with medical records; billing for services; and prices for services. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could\nsuffer penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate. In addition, further healthcare legislative reform is likely, and could materially and adversely affect our business and\nresults of operations in the event that we do not comply or if the cost of compliance is prohibitive. The above list of certain regulated areas is not exhaustive, and it is not possible\nto anticipate the exact nature of future healthcare legislative reform in China. Depending on the priorities set by the Chinese Ministry of Health, the political climate at any given\ntime, the continued development of the Chinese healthcare system and many other factors, future legislative reforms may be highly comprehensive, including stringent infection\ncontrol policies, improved rural healthcare facilities, increased regulation of the distribution of pharmaceuticals, and numerous other policy matters. Consequently, the implications\nof these future reforms could result in penalties, loss of licensure, additional compliance costs or other adverse consequences we cannot foresee at the present time.\n22\nAs a provider of medical services, we are exposed to inherent risks relating to malpractice claims.\nAs a provider of medical services, any misdiagnosis or improper treatment may result in negative publicity regarding us or our services, which would harm our reputation.\nIf we are found liable for malpractice, we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages. Furthermore, even if we successfully defend ourselves against a malpractice claim,\nwe could be required to spend significant management, financial and other resources in the process, which could disrupt our business, and our reputation and brand name may\nalso suffer. Since malpractice claims are not common in China, we do not carry malpractice insurance. As a result, any imposition of malpractice liability could materially harm our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face competition that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur clinics compete with a large number and variety of healthcare facilities in their respective markets. There are numerous government-run and private hospitals and\nclinics available to the general populace. There can be no assurance that these or other clinics, hospitals or other facilities will not commence or expand such operations, which\nwould increase their competitive position. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a healthcare organization that having greater resources in the provision or management of\nhealthcare services will not decide to engage in operations similar to those being conducted by us in Hangzhou.\nRisks Related to Our Herb Farming\nOur herb farming business is subject to the volatility of prices for raw TCM herbs.\nWe currently planted gingko trees in our leased farm land. However, in the future, we may continue to cultivate and sell certain herbs in bulk to third-party vendors, based\non local market prices primarily determined by TCM manufacturers and trading companies. Such market prices have increased significantly in recent years in response to changes\nin the supply of and demand for raw herbs, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, including inflation, changes in weather, disease\noutbreaks, domestic government regulation, market speculation and overall economic conditions. There can be no assurance that market prices, which historically have fluctuated\nwidely, will continue to increase or remain stable, and any future declines in prices may negatively impact the viability of our herb farming business.\nUnforeseen and severe weather can reduce cultivation activities and lead to a decrease in anticipated harvest.\nSeasonal climate change and weather variations such as levels of rainfall and temperature may, among other things, affect the quality, overall supply and availability of\nraw herbs. Sustained adverse weather conditions in Zhejiang Province in general and in Lin’an in particular where our herbs are planted, such as rain, extreme cold or snow, could\ndisrupt or curtail cultivation activities. This in turn could reduce our anticipated harvest yields, delay the timing of our anticipated harvest and distribution, and negatively affect\nthe quality of our harvest. In addition, natural disasters such as fires, earthquakes, snowstorms, floods or droughts, or natural conditions such as crop disease, pests or soil\nerosion, may also negatively impact our cultivation and harvest.\nIn addition, the actual climatic conditions of Zhejiang Province and of Lin’an in particular may not conform to historical patterns and may be affected by variations in\nweather patterns, including any potential impact of climate change. The effects of climate change may produce more unpredictable weather events that may adversely affect our\nability to cultivate and harvest successfully.\nThe occurrence of any of these may materially harm our herb farming business.\nWe have limited control over the availability and the quality of the local farmers with whom we cooperate because we do not employ them directly.\nWe rely on local farmers to farm and harvest our herbs, but do not employ them directly. Instead, they are recruited and employed by the local villagers’ committees with\nwhom we negotiate. We have limited control over the availability and the quality of this labor force. A shortage of suitable laborers may adversely affect our harvest yields.\nRisks Related to Our Online Sales\nWe rely on computer software and hardware systems in managing our online sales, the capacity of which may restrict our growth and the failure of which could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon our electronic commerce system to carry out our online sales. Any system failure which causes interruptions to the input, retrieval and\ntransmission of data, or increases in service time could disrupt our normal operations. Although we believe we have a disaster recovery plan that can handle the failure of our\ncomputer software and hardware systems, we cannot provide assurance that we can effectively carry out this disaster recovery plan and that we will be able to restore our\noperation within a sufficiently short time frame to avoid disruption to our business. Any failure in our computer software and/or hardware systems could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if the capacity of our computer software and hardware systems fails to meet the increasing needs\nof our operations, our ability to grow may be constrained.\n23\nThe operation results of our online business fluctuates and we cannot assure our efforts for alternative vendors will result in the stable increase in revenues from online\npharmacy in the coming years\nOur online pharmacy sales increased by approximately $4,756,756, or 54.1% for the year ended March 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2019. The\nincrease was caused by both an increase in sales via e-commerce platforms such as Tmall and an increase in sales via our official site. Popular products at reasonable prices are key\nto success in online business. In order to promote our sales, we focused on the selection of medical equipment suitable to local customers. For example, sales of blood glucose\nmeters and contact lens contributed significantly to our revenue in the year ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the same period a year ago. Additionally, we maintained a\nmembership care program which targeted at chronic disease customers. We have closely interacted with our members via Wechat by providing healthcare knowledge and\nreminding our customers to refill medicine. By implementing a personalized customer care program, we were able to promote our sales. As a result, our sales via these e-commerce\nplatforms increased by 58.3% period over period. The sales via our official website were primarily made by certain pharmacy benefit management providers and insurance\ncompanies. There can be of no assurance that our online pharmacy sales will continue to increase in the future despite of our relentless efforts. If our online pharmacy sales do not\ngrow as we expect in the future, our operation results may be materially impacted in a negative manner.\nIf our online business fails to obtain and maintain the requisite assets, licenses, qualified personnel and approvals required under the complex regulatory environment for\nInternet-based businesses in China, the business prospects for such business may be materially and adversely affected.\nInternet-based businesses in China are highly regulated by China’s central government, and numerous regulatory authorities are empowered to issue and implement\nregulations governing various aspects of these businesses. Our online business is operated by our PRC subsidiary, Jiuzhou Pharmacy, which is required to obtain and maintain\ncertain assets relevant to its business, such as computers and other electrical equipment, as well as applicable licenses or approvals from different regulatory authorities. These\nassets and licenses are essential to the operation of an e-commerce business and are generally subject to annual review by the relevant governmental authorities. Furthermore, we\nmay be required to obtain additional licenses. If we fail to obtain or maintain any of the required assets, licenses or approvals, our Internet business may be deemed illegal and it\nmay be subject to various penalties, such as confiscation of illegal income, fines, and/or the discontinuation or restriction of its operations. Any such disruption may materially and\nadversely affect the prospects of our online business.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure\nChinese regulations limit foreign ownership of any pharmacy operator with thirty (30) or more stores, and limit foreign ownership of medical clinics to Sino-foreign joint\nventure. The entities that operate our pharmacies and clinics are controlled by us through contractual arrangements. The validity of such contractual arrangements is\nuncertain. If the Chinese government determines that these contractual arrangements do not comply with applicable regulations, we could be subject to severe penalties and\nour business could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in the relevant Chinese laws and regulations may materially and adversely affect our business.\nCurrent PRC regulations limit foreign ownership of a pharmacy operator to forty nine percent (49%) if such operator owns interests in thirty (30) or more drugstores in\nChina that sell a variety of branded pharmaceutical products sourced from different suppliers. Since we do not own any equity interests in Jiuzhou Pharmacy (or its subsidiary\nJiuxin Medicine), but instead control it through contractual arrangements, we do not believe that the regulations limiting foreign ownership apply to us even if Jiuzhou Pharmacy or\nJiuxin Medicine expands beyond thirty (30) stores. In fact, Jiuzhou Pharmacy has expended to one hundred and eighteen (118) stores as of March 31, 2020.\nSimilarly, PRC regulations restrict foreign ownership of medical practices in China to Sino-foreign joint ventures. Since we do not have any actual equity interest in\nJiuzhou Clinic or Jiuzhou Service, but control these entities through contractual arrangements, we do not believe that such PRC regulations are applicable to us or our structure.\n24\nThere are, however, uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to the laws, rules and\nregulations governing the validity and enforcement of our contractual arrangements. Although the structures for operating our business in China (including our corporate\nstructure and contractual arrangements with Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic, Jiuzhou Service and the Key Personnel) comply with all applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations,\nand do not violate, breach, contravene or otherwise conflict with any applicable PRC laws, rules or regulations, we cannot provide assurance that a regulatory authority will not\ndetermine that our corporate structure and contractual arrangements violate PRC laws, rules or regulations. If any such authority determines that our contractual arrangements are\nin violation of applicable PRC laws, rules or regulations, our contractual arrangements may become invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to consolidate the operations\nof HJ Group with our results of operations. In addition, new PRC laws, rules and regulations may be introduced from time to time to impose additional requirements that may be\napplicable to our contractual arrangements. For example, pursuant to the PRC Property Rights Law that became effective on October 1, 2007 (the “Property Law”), the pledge of any\nequity interests of a PRC private entity shall become effective once it is duly registered with the local branches of the SAIC. Following the promulgation of the Property Law, the\nSAIC further issued the Administrative Measures for Registrations of Share Pledge on September 1, 2008, which provided detailed procedural guidance for the local SAIC offices\nto handle the registrations of pledged shares. The Equity Pledge Agreement that forms a part of the contractual arrangements creates a legally binding obligation on the parties\nupon the execution date; however, the pledge established under such agreement does not become effective until due registration with the local SAIC office. On May 18, 2010,\nregistration of the pledged equity interests in Jiuzhou Pharmacy was completed.\nThe Chinese government has broad discretion in dealing with violations of laws and regulations, including levying fines, revoking business and other licenses, and\nrequiring actions necessary for compliance. In particular, licenses and permits issued or granted to us by the relevant governmental bodies may be revoked at a later time by higher\nregulatory bodies. We cannot predict the effect of the interpretation of existing or new Chinese laws or regulations on our businesses. We cannot provide assurance that our\ncurrent ownership and operating structure will not be found in violation of any current or future Chinese laws or regulations. As a result, we may be subject to sanctions, including\nfines, and could be required to restructure our operations or cease the provision of certain services. Any of these or similar actions could significantly disrupt our business\noperations or restrict us from conducting a substantial portion of our business operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results\nof operations.\nIf we are determined to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws, rules or regulations, or fail to obtain or maintain any of the required governmental permits or\napprovals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations, including:\n● revoking the business and operating licenses of the HJ Group entities;\n● discontinuing or restricting the operations of the HJ Group entities;\n● imposing conditions or requirements with which we or the HJ Group entities may not be able to comply;\n● requiring us or the HJ Group entities to restructure the relevant ownership structure or operations; and/or\n● imposing fines.\nThe imposition of any of these penalties would severely disrupt our ability to conduct business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects.\nWe may be adversely affected by complexity, uncertainties and changes in Chinese regulation of drugstores and the practice of medicine.\nThe Chinese government regulates drugstores and the practice of medicine, including foreign ownership and requirements for licenses and permits. These laws and\nregulations are relatively new and evolving, and their interpretation and enforcement involve significant uncertainty. As a result, in certain circumstances it may be difficult to\ndetermine what actions or omissions may be deemed to be a violation of applicable laws and regulations.\nThe interpretation and application of existing Chinese laws, regulations and policies and possible new laws, regulations or policies have created substantial uncertainties\nregarding the legality of existing and future foreign investments in, and the businesses and activities of, pharmaceutical businesses in China, including our business. We currently\nonly have contractual control over the HJ Group entities, and do not own them due to the restrictions on foreign ownership of such companies. However, changes to laws in the\nPRC may force us to restructure our ownership structure or our operations, which would severely disrupt our ability to conduct business and have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nUncertainties relating to the regulation of drugstores and medical practice in China also extend to evolving licensing practices, which means that permits, licenses or\noperations at our company may be subject to challenge. This may disrupt our business or subject us to sanctions, requirements to increase capital, or other conditions or\nenforcement. In turn, this could compromise enforceability of related contractual arrangements, or have other harmful effects on us.\n25\nOur contractual arrangements with HJ Group and the Key Personnel may not be as effective in providing control over these entities as direct ownership.\nWe have no equity ownership interest in HJ Group, and rely on contractual arrangements to control and operate the HJ Group companies and their businesses. These\ncontractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing control over these companies as direct ownership. For example, any one of them could fail to take actions required\nfor our business despite its contractual obligation to do so. Under such circumstances, we may have to rely on legal remedies under Chinese law, which may not be effective in\nproviding us any relief. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that the Key Personnel will act in our best interests.\nSince we rely on contractual arrangements to control HJ Group and for substantially all of our revenue, the termination of such agreements will severely and detrimentally\naffect our continuing business viability under our current corporate structure.\nSince we do not own equity interests of HJ Group, the termination of our contractual arrangements with them would sever our ability to continue receiving payments from\nthem under our current holding company structure. We cannot provide assurance that there will not be any event or reason that may cause the contractual arrangements to\nterminate. In the event that the contractual arrangements terminate, we will lose our control over them and their business operations and, as a result, over our primary sources of\nrevenue. This may have a severe and detrimental effect on our continuing business viability under our current corporate structure, which in turn may affect the value of your\ninvestment. Should this occur, we may seek to acquire control of HJ Group through other means, although we cannot guarantee that we will do so, nor can we guarantee that we\nwill be successful if we do.\nWe rely principally on dividends paid by our consolidated operating entities to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have, and any limitation on the ability of\nour consolidated PRC entities to pay dividends to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business.\nWe are a holding company and rely principally on dividends paid by our consolidated PRC operating entities for cash requirements, including the funds required to\nservice any debt we may incur, which are passed on to us through Jiuxin Management. If any of the consolidated operating entities incurs debt in its own name in the future, the\ninstruments governing the debt may restrict dividends or other distributions on our equity interest to us. In addition, the PRC tax authorities may require us to adjust our taxable\nincome under the contractual arrangements in a manner that would materially and adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and other distributions on our equity interest.\nFurthermore, applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations permit payment of dividends by our consolidated PRC entities only out of their retained earnings, if any,\ndetermined in accordance with PRC accounting standards. Under PRC laws, rules and regulations, our consolidated PRC entities are required to set aside at least ten percent (10%)\nof their after-tax profit each year, based on PRC accounting standards, into their statutory surplus reserve funds until the accumulative amount of such reserves reaches fifty\npercent (50%) of their respective registered capital. As a result, our consolidated PRC entities are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net income to us whether in\nthe form of dividends, loans or advances. As of March 31, 2020, our restricted reserves totaled $1,309,109(RMB 9,460,695). Our restricted reserves are not distributable as cash\ndividends. Any limitation on the ability of our consolidated operating entities to pay dividends to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or\nacquisitions that could be beneficial to our businesses, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nCertain management members of HJ Group have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may adversely affect our business and your ability for recourse.\nMr. Lei Liu, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, is also the executive director of Jiuzhou Pharmacy, a general partner of Jiuzhou Clinic, and\nthe supervising director of Jiuzhou Service. In addition, Mr. Liu has also lent us money out of his personal funds to help facilitate our payments of expenses in the U.S., as well as\nto purchase a land use right. Ms. Li Qi, our Corporate Secretary and a member of our Board of Directors, is the general manager of each of Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic and\nJiuzhou Service, and a general partner of Jiuzhou Clinic. Conflicts of interests between their respective duties to our company and HJ Group may arise. As our directors and\nexecutive officers, they have a duty of loyalty and care to us under U.S. and Hong Kong law when there are any potential conflicts of interests between our company and HJ\nGroup. We cannot provide assurance, however, that when any conflicts of interest arise, both of them will act completely in our interests or that conflicts of interests will be\nresolved in our favor. For example, they may determine that it is in HJ Group’s interests to sever the contractual arrangements with Jiuxin Management, irrespective of the effect\nsuch action may have on us. In addition, either one of them could violate his or her legal duties by diverting business opportunities from us to others, thereby affecting the amount\nof payment that HJ Group is obligated to remit to us under the Consulting Services Agreement.\nIn the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under securities laws or otherwise as a result of any one of the circumstances described above, it may\nbe difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against HJ Group, or our officers or directors who are members of the management, all of whom reside within China. Even if you\nare successful in bringing an action, the laws of China may render you unable to enforce a judgment against the assets of HJ Group and its management, all of which are located in\nChina.\n26\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nWe rely on contractual arrangements with our VIE for our operations, which may not be as effective in providing control over these entities as direct ownership.\nOur operations and financial results are dependent on our VIEs, Jiuzhou Pharmacy (including its subsidiaries and controlled entities), Jiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service,\nin which we have no equity ownership interest and must rely on contractual arrangements to control and operate the businesses of our VIEs. These contractual arrangements are\nnot as effective in providing control over the VIEs as direct ownership. For example, the VIEs may be unwilling or unable to perform its contractual obligations under our\ncommercial agreements. Consequently, we would not be able to conduct our operations in the manner currently planned. In addition, the VIEs may seek to renew its agreements on\nterms that are disadvantageous to us. Although we have entered into a series of agreements that provide us with substantial ability to control the VIEs, we may not succeed in\nenforcing our rights under them insofar as our contractual rights and legal remedies under PRC law are inadequate. In addition, if we are unable to renew these agreements on\nfavorable terms when these agreements expire or enter into similar agreements with other parties, our business may not be able to operate or expand, and our operating expenses\nmay significantly increase.\nIn January 2015, China’s Ministry of Commerce released draft legislation that could change how the government regulates corporate structures, especially for VIEs\ncontrolled by foreign investments. Instead of looking at “ownership”, the draft law focused on the entities or individuals hold control of a VIE. If a VIE is deemed to be controlled\nby foreign investors, it may be barred from operating in restricted sectors or the prohibited sectors listed on a “negative list”, where only companies controlled by Chinese\nnationals could operate, even if structured as VIEs. As of the report date, no formal legislation has been implemented.\nIn the event that the draft law is implemented in any form, and that the Company’s business was characterized as one of the “restricted” or “prohibited” sectors, the VIEs\nthe Company currently maintains contractual arrangements with may be barred from operation which will materially adversely affect our business.\nChanges in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and the profitability of such\nbusiness.\nPolicies of the PRC government can have significant effects on economic conditions in China. Our interests may be adversely affected by changes in policies by the PRC\ngovernment, including:\n● changes in laws, regulations or their interpretation;\n● confiscatory taxation;\n● restrictions on currency conversion, imports or sources of supplies and export tariff; and\n● expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises.\nAlthough the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than two (2) decades, we cannot assure you that the government will continue to\npursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or other circumstances\naffecting the PRC’s political, economic and social life.\nUncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system could adversely affect us.\nWe conduct our business through our subsidiaries and controlled companies in the PRC. Our operations in China are governed by Chinese laws and regulations. We are\ngenerally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable to WFOE. The Chinese legal system is based on written\nstatutes. Prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value.\nSince 1979, Chinese legislation and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, China\nhas not developed a fully integrated legal system and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China. In particular,\nbecause these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published decisions and their nonbinding nature, the interpretation and enforcement of\nthese laws and regulations involve uncertainties. In addition, the Chinese legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules (some of which are not published\non a timely basis or at all) that may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. In\naddition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and our management’s attention.\n27\nYou may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in China against us or our management based\non United States or other foreign laws.\nWe are a holding company and conduct our business through our subsidiaries and controlled companies in the PRC. In addition, all of our operating assets are located in,\nand all of our other senior executive officers reside within, China. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process within the United States or elsewhere outside China\nupon those of our senior executive officers and directors that do not reside in the United States, including with respect to matters arising under U.S. federal securities laws or\napplicable state securities laws. Moreover, our Chinese counsel has advised us that China does not have treaties with the United States or many other countries providing for the\nreciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgment of courts. As a result, our public shareholders may face substantially more difficulty in protecting their interests through\nactions against our management or directors than would shareholders of a corporation with assets and management located in the United States.\nWe may need to obtain additional governmental approvals to open new drugstores. Our inability to obtain such approvals will have a material adverse effect on our business\nand growth.\nAccording to the Measures on the Administration of Foreign Investment in the Commercial Sector (the “Measures”) promulgated by China’s Ministry of Commerce (the\n“MOC”), which became effective on June 1, 2004, a company that is directly owned by a foreign invested enterprise needs to obtain relevant governmental approvals before it\nopens new retail stores. However, there are no specific laws, rules or regulations with respect to whether such approvals are necessary for a company that is contractually\ncontrolled by a foreign invested enterprise. In addition, the Measures state that the MOC will promulgate a detailed implementation regulation to govern foreign invested\nenterprises engaging in drug sale. However, such implementation regulation has not yet been promulgated. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that the MOC will not require\nsuch approvals to be obtained, or as to when any regulation of such requirements may be implemented. If additional governmental approvals are deemed to be necessary and we\nare unable to obtain such approvals on a timely basis or at all, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as the trading price of our common\nstock, will be materially and adversely affected.\nThe advent of recent healthcare reform directives from China’s central government may increase both competition and our cost of doing business.\nUnder the auspices of the Healthy China 2020 program (the “Program”), published by China’s National Development and Reform Commission in October 2008, the central\ngovernment has set in motion a series of policies in fairly rapid succession aimed to improve China’s healthcare system. Such policies include (1) discouraging hospitals from both\nprescribing and dispensing medication, (2) the unveiling in April 2009 of formal healthcare reform guidelines aimed at improving the availability of and subsidies for “essential”\ndrugs, and (3) the announcement in August 2009 of China’s National Essential Drugs List (“NEDL”), initially listing approximately three hundred (300) medicines to be sold at\ngovernment-controlled prices. While an underlying goal of these policies is to make drugs more accessible to China’s poorer population, these policies also serve to create\nopportunities that in turn will intensify business competition in the Chinese retail drugstore industry, as well as competition for skilled labor and retail spaces. Additionally, we\nexpect the NEDL to result in a rise in the number of government-subsidized community healthcare service centers, which in turn may erode the convenience and price advantage\nthat our drugstores traditionally enjoy against hospitals.\nThe PRC’s labor law restricts our ability to reduce our workforce in the PRC in the event of an economic downturn and may increase our production costs.\nIn June 2007, the National People’s Congress of the PRC enacted new labor law legislation called the Labor Contract Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008 (the\n“LC Law”). The LC Law formalized workers’ rights concerning overtime hours, pensions, layoffs, employment contracts and the role of trade unions. Considered one of the\nstrictest labor laws in the world, among other things, the LC Law provides for specific standards and procedures for the termination of an employment contract and places the\nburden of proof on the employer. In addition, the law requires the payment of a statutory severance pay upon the termination of an employment contract in most cases, including\nthe case of the expiration of a fixed-term employment contract. Further, the LC Law requires an employer to conclude an “employment contract without a fixed-term” with any\nemployee who either has worked for the same employer for ten (10) consecutive years or more or has had two (2) consecutive fixed-term contracts with the same employer. An\n“employment contract without a fixed term” can no longer be terminated on the ground of the expiration of the contract, although it can still be terminated pursuant to the\nstandards and procedures set forth under the new law. Because of the lack of implementing rules for the LC Law and the precedents for the enforcement of such a law, the\nstandards and procedures set forth under the LC Law in relation to the termination of an employment contract have raised concerns among foreign investment enterprises in the\nPRC that such “employment contract without a fixed term” might in fact become a “lifetime, permanent employment contract.” Finally, under the LC Law, downsizing of either more\nthan twenty (20) people or more than ten percent (10%) of the workforce may occur only under specified circumstances, such as a restructuring undertaken pursuant to the PRC’s\nEnterprise Bankruptcy Law, or where a company suffers serious difficulties in production and/or business operations, or where there has been a material change in the objective\neconomic circumstances relied upon by the parties at the time of the conclusion of the employment contract, thereby making the performance of such employment contract\nimpossible. To date, there has been very little guidance and precedent as to how such specified circumstances for downsizing will be interpreted and enforced by the relevant PRC\nauthorities. All of our employees working for us exclusively within the PRC are covered by the LC Law and thus, our ability to adjust the size of our operations when necessary in\nperiods of recession or less severe economic downturns may be curtailed. Accordingly, if we face future periods of decline in business activity generally or adverse economic\nperiods specific to our business, the LC Law can be expected to exacerbate the adverse effect of the economic environment on our results of operations and financial condition.\n28\nWe cannot be certain that the Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of the Renminbi, especially with respect to\nforeign exchange transactions.\nFluctuations in the value of the Renminbi may have a material and adverse effect on your investment. The change in value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar is\naffected by, among other things, changes in PRC’s political and economic conditions. We receive substantially all of our revenues in RMB. Under our current structure, our income\nis primarily derived from payments from the three (3) HJ Group companies. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability of our subsidiaries and our PRC\naffiliated entities to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to us, or otherwise satisfy their foreign currency denominated obligations. Under existing\nChinese foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions, can be\nmade in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from appropriate government authorities is\nrequired where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses, such as the repayment of bank loans denominated in foreign\ncurrencies. The Chinese government may also, at its discretion, restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control\nsystem prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our stockholders.\nFrom 1995 until July 2005, the People’s Bank of China intervened in the foreign exchange market to maintain an exchange rate of approximately Renminbi 8.3 per U.S. dollar.\nOn July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed this policy and began allowing modest appreciation of the Renminbi versus the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy, the Renminbi was\npermitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. This change in policy caused the Renminbi to appreciate approximately\n21.5% against the U.S. dollar over the following three years. As a consequence, the Renminbi has fluctuated sharply since July 2008 against other freely traded currencies, in\ntandem with the U.S. dollar. It is difficult to predict how long the current situation may last and when and how it may change again. There remains significant international pressure\non the PRC government to adopt a substantial liberalization of its currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation in the value of the Renminbi\nagainst the U.S. dollar. Significant revaluation of the Renminbi may have a material and adverse effect on your investment. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S.\ndollars we receive from securities offering into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi\namount we would receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our\ncommon stock or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us. In\nAugust 2015, the PRC Government devalued its currency by approximately 3%, represented the largest yuan depreciation for 20 years. Concerns remain that China’s slowing\neconomy, and in particular its exports, will need a stimulus that can only come from further cuts in the exchange rate.\nFluctuations in the value of RMB may have a material adverse effect on your investment.\nThe value of RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. Our\nrevenues, costs, and financial assets are mostly denominated in RMB, while our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, this may result in gains or losses from currency\ntranslation on our financial statements. We rely entirely on fees paid to us by our affiliated entities in China. Therefore, any significant fluctuation in the value of RMB may\nmaterially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenues, earnings, financial position, and the value of, and any dividends payable on, our stock in U.S. dollars. For example, an\nappreciation of RMB against the U.S. dollar would, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into RMB for such purposes, make any new RMB denominated investments or\nexpenditures more costly to us. An appreciation of RMB against the U.S. dollar would result in foreign currency translation gains for financial reporting purposes when we\ntranslate our RMB denominated financial assets into U.S. dollars, as the U.S. dollar is our reporting currency.\nIn addition, appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollars without giving\neffect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. The income statements of our operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in\neach applicable period. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currencies denominated transactions results in reduced\nrevenue, operating expenses and net income for our international operations. Similarly, to the extent the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these\nforeign currency denominated transactions results in increased revenue, operating expenses and net income for our international operations. We are also exposed to foreign\nexchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange\nrates, the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss, which is recorded as a component of other\ncomprehensive income. Very limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any\nhedging transactions. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited, and we may not be able to\nsuccessfully hedge our exposure at all.\nOur management will have broad discretion over the use of the proceeds we receive from our financing activities and might not apply the proceeds in ways that increase the\nvalue of your investment.\nOur management will have broad discretion to use the net proceeds from any offerings we may conduct from time to time, and the shareholders will be relying on the\njudgment of our management regarding the application of these proceeds. Except as described in our offering books, the net proceeds received by us from our offerings will be\nadded to our general funds and will be used for general corporate purposes. Our management might not apply the net proceeds from offerings of our securities in ways that\nincrease the value of your investment and might not be able to yield a significant return, if any, on any investment of such net proceeds. You may not have the opportunity to\ninfluence our decisions on how to use such proceeds.\n29\nJiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service are subject to restrictions on making payments to us.\nWe rely substantially on our contractual arrangements with Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service for our revenue. The Chinese government also imposes\ncontrols on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of China. We may experience difficulties in completing the administrative\nprocedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency. Furthermore, if these companies incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict\ntheir ability to make payments. If we are unable to receive all of the revenues from our operations through these contractual arrangements, we may be unable to pay dividends on\nour common shares.\nDividends we receive from our subsidiaries located in the PRC may be subject to PRC withholding tax.\nThe EIT Law provides that a maximum income tax rate of twenty percent (20%) is applicable to dividends payable to non-PRC investors that are “non-resident\nenterprises,” to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC. However, the State Council has reduced such rate to ten percent (10%) through the\nimplementation regulations. We are a Nevada holding company and substantially all of our income is derived from our subsidiaries and controlled companies located in the PRC.\nTherefore, dividends paid to us from China may be subject to the ten percent (10%) income tax if we are considered a “non-resident enterprise” under the EIT Law. If we are\nrequired to pay income tax for any dividends we receive from our PRC subsidiaries under the EIT Law and its implementation regulations, it may have a material and adverse effect\non our net income and materially reduce the amount of dividends, if any, we may pay to our shareholders.\nWe face risks related to disease epidemics and other outbreaks.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the current outbreak of respiratory illness caused by\nthe novel coronavirus. Any outbreak of contagious diseases, and other adverse public health developments, particularly in China, could have a material and adverse effect on our\nbusiness operations. These could include disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel or to distribute our products, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the\nfacilities of our suppliers or customers. Any disruption or delay of our suppliers, manufacturers or customers would likely impact our sales and operating results. In addition, a\nsignificant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of\nChina and many other countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and significantly impact our operating results. Amidst the COVID-19\noutbreak, we experienced a decline in the number of customer visits during the first three months of calendar 2020 due to the implementation of the lockdown policy in China. In\naddition, because some of our employees could not come to the workplace, we were short of staff which slowed down our logistic service and impacted our customer service at\nstores. However, as China is gradually controlling the spread of COVID-19, we believe these negative impacts are temporary. Currently we are unable to accurately predict the\nfuture impact of COVID-19 due to the developing circumstances and uncertainty surrounding this current pandemic, including the ultimate geographic spread of COVID-19, the\nseverity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, and effectiveness of the actions that may be taken by governmental authorities. The management has been closely monitoring\nthe impact caused by COVID-19 and we will continue to operate our business as steadily and safely as we can.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other\nprohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, are not subject to these\nprohibitions, and therefore may have a competitive advantage over us. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices may occur in the PRC. If our\ncompetitors engage in these practices, they may receive preferential treatment in the PRC, giving them an advantage in securing business, which would put us at a disadvantage.\nWe cannot provide assurance that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are\nfound to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nIf relations between the United States and China worsen, investors may be unwilling to hold or buy our stock and our stock price may decrease.\nAt various times in recent years, the United States and China have had significant disagreements over political and economic issues. Controversies may arise in the future\nbetween the two countries. Any political or trade controversies between the United States and China, whether or not directly related to our business, could reduce the price of our\ncommon stock.\nOur auditor, like other independent registered public accounting firms operating in China, is not permitted to be subject to inspection by Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board, and consequently investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm issued an audit opinion on the financial statements included in our annual reports filed with the SEC. Our independent\nregistered public accounting firm’s audit documentation related to their audit reports included in our annual reports is located in China, and audit procedures take place within\nChina’s borders. As auditors of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB,\nour auditor is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB. However, work papers located in China are not currently inspected by the\nPCAOB because the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the PRC authorities.\nInspections of certain other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside of China have identified deficiencies in those firms’ audit procedures and quality control\nprocedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. However, the PCAOB is currently unable to inspect an auditor’s audit work\nrelated to a company’s operations in China and where such documentation of the audit work is located in China. As a result, our investors may be deprived of the benefits of the\nPCAOB’s oversight of auditors that are located in China through such inspections.\n30\nOn December 7, 2018, the SEC and the PCAOB issued a joint statement highlighting continued challenges faced by the U.S. regulators in their oversight of financial\nstatement audits of U.S.-listed companies with significant operations outside United States, especially in China. On April 21, 2020, the SEC and the PCAOB issued another joint\nstatement highlighting the significant disclosure, financial reporting and other risks associated with emerging market investments, including the PCAOB’s continued inability to\ninspect audit work papers in China. These joint statements reflect a heightened interest in an issue that has vexed U.S. regulators in recent years. However, it remains unclear what\nfurther actions the SEC and the PCAOB will take to address the problem and its impact on Chinese companies listed in the United States.\nThe inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of an auditor’s work papers in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of any of our auditor’s audit\nprocedures or quality control procedures that may be located in China as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to PCAOB inspections. Investors may\nconsequently lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements.\nIn June 2019, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced bills in both houses of the U.S. Congress, and passed requiring the SEC to maintain a list of issuers for which the\nPCAOB is not able to inspect or investigate an auditor report issued by a foreign public accounting firm. The proposed Ensuring Quality Information and Transparency for\nAbroad-Based Listings on our Exchanges (EQUITABLE)Act prescribes increased disclosure requirements for these issuers and, beginning in 2025, the delisting from U.S. national\nsecurities exchanges of issuers included on the SEC’s list for three consecutive years. On May 20, 2020, the U.S. Senate passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act,\nwhich in effect would prohibit securities of any registrant from being listed on any of the U.S. securities exchanges or traded “over-the-counter” if registrant’s financial statements\nhave, for a period of three years, been audited by an accounting firm branch or office that is not subject to PCAOB inspection. Enactment of any of such legislations or other\nefforts to increase U.S. regulatory access to audit information could cause investor uncertainty for affected issuers, including us, and the stock price could be adversely affected.\nThere is uncertainty as to whether and when these bills or legislations will be enacted in the proposed form, or at all.\nThe slowing economic growth in China may assert a negative impact on our operation and financial results.\nAccording to several articles published by the Wall Street Journal, CNN, and BBC News in January 2016, after experiencing rapid growth for more than a decade, China’s\neconomy has been hit by shrinking foreign and domestic demand, weak investment, factory overcapacity and oversupply in the property market, and has experienced a painful\nslowdown in the last two years. In 2016, China’s economy grew by 6.7%, compared with 6.9% a year earlier, marking its slowest growth in a quarter of a century. As the\ngovernment tried to shift the growth engine away from manufacturing and debt-fueled investment toward the services sector and consumer spending, the outlook of the Chinese\neconomy is uncertain.\nIn the next two to three years, China’s growth performance could deteriorate because of the overhang of its real estate bubble, massive manufacturing overcapacity, and\nthe lack of new growth engines. The International Monetary Fund expected China’s economy to grow by 6.4% in 2018-2020. If China’s economy slows down further, it may\nnegatively affect our business operation and financial results.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Securities\nTo date, we have not paid any cash dividends and no cash dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and we may not have sufficient funds legally available to pay dividends. Even\nif the funds are legally available for distribution, we may nevertheless decide not to pay any dividends. We intend to retain all earnings for our operations.\nNASDAQ may delist our common stock from trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market for failing to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00, which could limit investors’\nability to effect transactions in our common stock and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOn May 9, 2013, we received a letter from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”), notifying us of our failure to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 over\nthe then preceding thirty (30) consecutive trading days for its common stock, as required by NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Bid Price Rule”). The letter stated that the\ncompany had until November 5, 2013, to demonstrate compliance by maintaining a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive trading days. In\nthe meantime, we were included in a list of non-compliant companies posted on NASDAQ’s website commencing on May 16, 2013.\nOn November 6, 2013, NASDAQ granted us an additional 180-day period, or until May 5, 2014, to remain listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and to regain compliance\nwith the Bid Price Rule. Under NASDAQ Listing Rules, we were granted this extension because we met the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares\nand all other applicable NASDAQ listing requirements, except the bid price requirement.\n31\nOn January 16, 2014, we received a letter from NASDAQ notifying us that we had regained compliance with the Bid Price Rule, as the closing bid price of our common\nstock had been at or above $1.00 per share for at least 10 consecutive trading days. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will remain compliant with the Bid Price Rule in\nthe future. In the year ended March 31, 2020, our stock prices range from $1.01 to $3.35. If NASDAQ delists our common stock from trading on its exchange, we could face\nsignificant material adverse consequences including:\n● a limited availability of market quotations for our common stock;\n● a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n● a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nAlthough publicly traded, the trading market in our common stock may be substantially less liquid than the average stock quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market, and such\nlow trading volume may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nAlthough our common stock has been listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market since April 22, 2010, the historical trading volume of our common stock has generally been\nlow. Limited trading volume will subject our shares of common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for you to sell your shares of common stock at a price that is\nattractive to you.\nThe market price for our stock may be volatile, and such volatility may subject us to securities litigation.\nThe market price for our stock may be volatile and, when compared to seasoned issuers, subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are\nbeyond our control, including the following:\n● actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n● changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts;\n● conditions in the retail pharmacy markets;\n● changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other retail pharmacy operators;\n● announcements by us or our competitors of new products, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n● addition or departure of key personnel;\n● fluctuations of exchange rates between RMB and the U.S. dollar;\n● intellectual property litigation; and\n● general economic or political conditions in China.\nAs an illustration of such volatility, the closing price of our common stock during the fifty two (52) weeks preceding the date of this report ranged from a low of $1.02 to a\nhigh of $3.46. In addition, the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of\nparticular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nIn the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in\nthe future, be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management’s attention and resources.\nTechniques employed by manipulative short sellers in Chinese small-cap stocks may drive down the market price of our common stock.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities\nback at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from the difference in the sale price of the borrowed securities and the purchase price of the replacement\nshares. As it is therefore in the short seller’s best interests for the price of the stock to decline, there have been incidents of short sellers publishing, or arranging to publish\nnegative opinions in order to create negative market momentum. While traditionally these disclosed shorts have been limited in their ability to access mainstream business media or\nto otherwise create negative market rumors, the rise of the Internet and technological advancements regarding document creation, videotaping and publication by weblog\n(“blogging”) have allowed many disclosed shorts to publicly attack a company’s credibility, strategy and veracity by means of so-called research reports that mimic the type of\ninvestment analysis performed by large Wall Street firms and independent research analysts. These short attacks have, in the past, resulted in the selling of shares in the market,\non occasion on a large scale and broad base. Issuers with business operations based in the PRC, that have limited trading volumes and that are susceptible to higher volatility\nlevels than U.S. domestic large-cap stocks can be particularly vulnerable to such short attacks.\nThese short seller publications are not regulated by any governmental, self-regulatory organization or other official authority in the U.S., are not subject to the certification\nrequirements imposed by the SEC in Regulation Analyst Certification and, accordingly, the opinions they express may be based on distortion of the actual facts or, in some cases,\nfabrication of the facts. In light of the limited risks involved in publishing such information, and the enormous profit that can be made from running just one successful short\nattack, unless the short sellers become subject to significant penalties, it is more likely than not that disclosed shorts will continue to issue such reports.\n32\nWhile we intend to strongly defend our public filings against any such short seller attacks, oftentimes we are constrained, either by principles of freedom of speech,\napplicable state law (often called Anti-SLAPP statutes), or issues of commercial confidentiality, in the manner in which we can proceed against the relevant short seller. You should\nbe aware that in light of the relative freedom to operate that such persons enjoy – oftentimes blogging from outside the U.S. with little or no assets or identity requirements –\nshould we be targeted for such an attack and the rumors not dismissed by market participants, our stock will likely suffer from a temporary, or possibly long term, decline in market\nprice.\nOur officers and directors own a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock, which will enable them to influence many significant corporate actions and in certain\ncircumstances may prevent a change in control that would otherwise be beneficial to our shareholders.\nAs of June 11, 2020, our directors and executive officers collectively controlled approximately 9,433,482 or 28.4% of our outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote on all\ncorporate actions. These stockholders, acting together, could have a substantial impact on matters requiring the vote of the shareholders, including the election of our directors\nand most of our corporate actions. This control could delay, defer or prevent others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change in our control, even if these actions\nwould benefit us and our shareholders. This control could adversely affect the voting and other rights of our other shareholders and could depress the market price of our common\nstock.\nThe elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under Nevada law and the existence of indemnification rights for our directors, officers\nand employees may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees.\nOur bylaws contain specific provisions that eliminate the liability of our directors for monetary damages to our company and shareholders, and we are prepared to give\nsuch indemnification to our directors and officers to the extent provided by Nevada law. We may also have contractual indemnification obligations under our employment\nagreements with our officers. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in our company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage\nawards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and any costs resulting therefrom may also discourage our company from bringing a\nlawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our directors\nand officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit our company and shareholders.\nLegislative actions, potential new accounting pronouncements and higher insurance costs may impact our future financial position and results of operations.\nOver the last decade or so, there have been many regulatory changes, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) and the Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. There may potentially be new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings or changes that will have an impact on our\nfuture financial position and results of operations. In addition, insurers are likely to increase premiums as a result of high claims rates over the past several years, which we expect\nwill increase our premiums for insurance policies. These and other potential changes could materially increase the expenses we report under generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nWe are subject to reporting obligations under U.S. securities laws. The SEC, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as amended, adopted rules requiring\nevery public company to include a management report on such company’s internal controls over financial reporting in its annual report, which contains management’s assessment\nof the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. We reported certain material weaknesses involving control activities, specifically internal control weaknesses\nrelating to finance personnel, in light of the continuing lack of sufficient experience by our accounting staff in U.S. GAAP-based reporting and SEC rules and regulations. Such\nmaterial weaknesses were noted for the past five (5) fiscal years, based on factors including: (i) the number of adjustments proposed by our independent auditors during our\nquarterly review and annual audit processes; (ii) the significance of the audit adjustments and their impact on the overall financial statements; (iii) how appropriately we complied\nwith U.S. GAAP on transactions; and (iv) how accurately we prepared supporting information to provide to our independent auditors on a quarterly and annual basis. As such, we\ndid not maintain effective controls and did not implement adequate and proper supervisory review to ensure that significant internal control deficiencies could be detected and/or\nprevented.\nAlthough we believe that we have made significant efforts to address the foregoing weaknesses, we believe that our efforts to date have not yet been sufficient to fully\nremediate such weaknesses. We will continue our efforts during the current fiscal year, although there can be no assurance that compliance will be achieved in this time frame.\nOur reporting obligations as a public company will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable\nfuture. Effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent\nfraud. As a result, our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our\nfinancial statements, which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will incur considerable\ncosts and use significant management time and other resources in an effort to comply with Section 404 and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n33\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.\nNot applicable to a smaller reporting company like us.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nWe are headquartered in Hangzhou, China. We own three properties. Additionally, our current leased properties are as follows:\nDescription Location Size (square meters) Lease expiration date\nPrincipal executive office Hai Wai Hai Tongxin Mansion Floor 5&6 4,000 December 27, 2021\nGong Shu District, Hangzhou City\nZhejiang Province, China\nPharmacies (1) Various locations in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China Range from September 2018 to\n79 to 1,713 October 2033\nFarmland for herb cultivation (2) Qianhong Township, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China 196,677 February 1, 2040\nLand (2) Qianhong Township, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China 18,616 February 1, 2040\n(1) As of the date of this report, we maintain operating leases in connection with our 118 pharmacies. See Note 10, “Long Term Deposits”. The leases do not contain any material\nescalating lease payments or contingent rental payment terms. We must negotiate with the landlords for an extension of the current leases or enter into new leases upon their\ntermination, upon which our landlords may request a rent increase. Under applicable PRC law, we have priority over other potential lessees with respect to the leased store\nspace on the same terms. We also do not expect any significant difficulties in renewing the existing leases upon their expiration, where desired. Our community stores are\nnormally relatively small in size and the fixtures inside such stores are easily movable. As a result, we do not expect our drugstore operations to be materially and adversely\naffected by any failure to renew current leases or enter into new leases.\n(2) We lease the land from The People’s Government of Qianhong Village under a 30-year lease entered in February 2010. The rent for the land was prepaid in full in May 2010.\nSee Note 11, “Other Noncurrent Assets,” and Note 13, “Intangible Assets,” to the Financial Statements.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nWe know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no\nproceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder holding more than five percent of our common stock, is an adverse party\nor has a material interest adverse to our company.\nITEM 4.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.\nNot applicable.\n35\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 should be read in\nconjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included elsewhere in this report. Our discussion includes forward-looking\nstatements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of\nevents could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under the “Risk Factors,”\n“Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Description of Business” sections and elsewhere in this report. We use words such as “anticipate,”\n“estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “continuing,” “ongoing,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “predict” and similar expressions to identify\nforward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions within the bound of\nour knowledge of our business, our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these statements. Factors that could contribute to such differences include, but\nare not limited to, those discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of this report. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason\neven if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future other than in compliance with the SEC rules and regulations.\nOur financial statements are prepared in U.S. Dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. See “Exchange Rates” at\nthe end of this section for information concerning the exchanges rates at which Renminbi (“RMB”) were translated into U.S. Dollars (“USD” or “$”) at various pertinent dates\nand for pertinent periods.\nOverview\nWe currently operate in four business segments in China: (1) retail drugstores, (2) online pharmacy, (3) wholesale of products similar to those that we carry in our\npharmacies, and (4) farming and selling herbs used for traditional Chinese medicine (“TCM”).\nOur drugstores offer customers a wide variety of pharmaceutical products, including prescription and over-the-counter (“OTC”) drugs, nutritional supplements, TCM,\npersonal and family care products, medical devices, and convenience products, including consumable, seasonal, and promotional items. Additionally, we have licensed doctors of\nboth western medicine and TCM on site for consultation, examination and treatment of common ailments at scheduled hours. As of March 31, 2020, we had 118 pharmacies in\nHangzhou city and its adjacent town Lin’an under the store brand of “Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy”. During the year ended March 31, 2020, we dissolved eight independent\npharmacies. Among the eight dissolved pharmacies, two stores have merged into Jiuzhou Pharmacy and became Jiuzhou Pharmacy stores in Hangzhou. The other six stores’\nlicenses of government medical insurance, which qualify the stores for reimbursement from government, were transferred to six Jiuzhou Pharmacy stores in Hangzhou City.\nIn January 2020, in order to continue expanding and strengthening our local drugstore network, we acquired a local drugstore chain with ten stores. The owners of the\nacquired chain agreed to cease their stores’ business and liquidate all of the stores’ accounts after Jiuzhou Pharmacy acquired them. In March 2020, the chain was dissolved. We\nwere able to transfer the certificates to our new stores opened at the same time.\nSince May 2010, we have also been selling certain OTC drugs, medical devices, nutritional supplements and other sundry products online. Our online pharmacy sells\nthrough several third-party platforms such as Alibaba’s Tmall, JD.com and Amazon.com, and the Company’s own platform all over China. In fiscal year 2020, in order to keep\ncompetitive in certain third-party platforms such as Tmall, we have spent reasonable resources on marketing our products through these third-party platforms. Our sales through\nour own platform are primarily generated by customers who use their private commercial medical insurances package.\nWe operate a wholesale business through Jiuxin Medicine distributing third-party pharmaceutical products (similar to those carried by our pharmacies) primarily to trading\ncompanies and other local drugstores in China. We also farm certain herbs used in TCM but have not made sales in the year ended March 31, 2020.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn preparing our audited consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we are required to\nmake judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect: (i) the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities; (ii) the disclosure of our contingent assets and liabilities at the end of\neach reporting period; and (iii) the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during each reporting period. We continually evaluate these estimates based on our own historical\nexperience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions, our expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable\nassumptions, which together form our basis for making judgments about matters that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral\ncomponent of the financial reporting process, our actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nWe believe that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. To the\nextent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the statement of operations and corresponding balance sheet accounts would be necessary.\nThese adjustments would be made in future financial statements.\nWhen reading our financial statements, you should consider: (i) our critical accounting policies; (ii) the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such\npolicies; and (iii) the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. The critical accounting policies and related judgments and estimates used to prepare\nour financial statements are identified in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements accompanying in this report.\n36\nRevenue recognition\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, which creates Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The new guidance outlines a single comprehensive\nmodel for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict\nthe transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and\nservices. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosure to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue\nthat is recognized. The new guidance supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The standard is effective for annual reporting\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, and permits early adoption on a limited basis. The update permits the use of either\nthe retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. On April 1, 2018, we adopted the guidance in ASC 606 and all the related amendments and applied the new revenue\nstandard to all contracts using the modified retrospective method. Based on the new standard our revenue recognition policies related to membership rewards programs has\nchanged. Membership rewards, usually membership points, are accumulated by customers based on their historical spending levels. The Company has determined that there is an\nadditional performance obligation to those customers at the time of the initial transaction. The customers can then redeem these points against the prices of merchandises they\npurchase in the future. At the end of each period, unredeemed membership rewards are reflected as a contract liability. The adoption of the new revenue standard was not material\nand is not expected to be material to our net income on an ongoing basis.\nImpairment of definite-lived intangible assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset\nmay not be recoverable. These long-lived assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. When evaluating\nthese long-lived assets for potential impairment, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group’s estimated future cash flows\n(undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than that carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared.\nThe impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). If\nrequired, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group’s carrying value that exceeds the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest\ncharges).\nThe long-lived asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate each asset group’s future sales, profitability and\ncash flows. When preparing these estimates, the Company considers historical results and current operating trends and consolidated sales, profitability and cash flow results and\nforecasts. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic and regulatory conditions, efforts of third party organizations to\nreduce their prescription drug costs and/or increased member co-payments, the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns.\nIn the year ended March 31, 2020, we evaluated the licenses of insurance applicable drugstores acquired in the past based on their discounted positive cash value. Due to\nthe stricter government insurance policy in fiscal year 2021, the value of these licenses has declined. As a result, we recorded an impairment of $628,192 as of March 31, 2020.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019:\nYears ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nPercentage Percentage\nof total of total\nAmount revenue Amount revenue\nRevenue $ 117,327,689 100.0% $ 107,551,012 100.0%\nCost of goods sold $ 91,801,259 78.2% 82,442,969 76.7%\nGross profit $ 25,526,430 21.8% $ 25,108,043 23.3%\nSelling expenses $ 23,793,603 20.3% $ 24,265,184 22.6%\nGeneral and administrative expenses $ 8,108,377 6.9% $ 1,718,989 1.6%\nImpairment of long-lived assets $ 628,192 0.5% $ - -%\nLoss from operations $ (7,003,742) (6.0)% $ (876,130) (0.8)%\nOther Income(expense), net $ 562,323 0.5% $ (306,876) (0.3)%\nChange in fair value of derivative liability $ 401,158 (0.3)% $ (326,452) (0.3)%\nIncome tax expense $ 16,258 0.0% $ 134,763 0.1%\nNet loss $ (6,457,677) (5.5)% $ (1,317,769) (1.2)%\nRevenue\nPrimarily due to the rise in our online pharmacy and wholesale business, revenue increased by $9,776,677 or 9.1% for the year ended March 31, 2020, as compared to the\nyear ended March 31, 2019.\n37\nRevenue by Segment\nThe following table breaks down the revenue for our four business segments for the year ended March 31, 2020 and 2019:\nFor the year ended March 31,\n2020 2019\n% of total % of total Variance by % of\nAmount revenue Amount revenue amount change\nRevenue from retail drugstores $ 74,081,237 63.1% $ 72,334,409 67.3% $ 1,746,828 2.4%\nRevenue from online sales 13,541,215 11.6% 8,784,459 8.1% 4,756,756 54.1%\nRevenue from wholesale business 29,705,237 25.3% 26,432,144 24.6% 3,273,093 12.4%\nRevenue from farming business - -% - -% - -%\nTotal revenue $ 117,327,689 100.0% $ 107,551,012 100.0% $ 9,776,677 9.1%\nRetail drugstores sales, which accounted for approximately 63.1% of total revenue for the year ended March 31, 2020, increased by $1,746,828, or 2.4% compared to the\nyear ended March 31, 2019, to $74,081,237. Same-store sales increased by approximately $2,021,002, or 2.9%, while new stores contributed approximately $53,241 in revenue in the\nyear ended March 31, 2020. Excluding the RMB depreciation effect, the same store sales increased by approximately 6.9% period over period.\nThe increase in our retail drugstore sales is primarily due to consumer-facing benefits such as emphasis on on-site medical care, chronic disease management services,\nincremental DTP (Direct-to-Patient) business caused by continuous hospital medical reform, and maturing of stores opened a year ago. Convenient on-site medical support at our\npharmacies has been our hallmark from the beginning of our business. Suitable medical support from our doctors has proven to be critical to our superior store sales. Linking\ndoctor care with drug sales has become our business guidance for the future. By adding more doctor-provided services at stores, we have been able to promote our store sales.\nAs the PRC medical reform goes on, more and more drug prescriptions have flowed out of hospitals. DTP drugs are usually new medicines with low profit margins. As part\nof such medical reform package, local governments require the revenue percentage from drug sales at public hospitals to decline year by year. In order to achieve lower drug sales\npercentage out of their total revenue, the public hospitals chose to abandon sales of low profit margin DTP products first. As a result, the DTP drug manufacturers or vendors\nswitched to local drugstores to explore the market. As a large drugstore network in Hangzhou City, quite a few of our stores are located adjacent to local hospitals. Additionally, we\nhave actively approached local vendors of certain DTP products, which we have not sold at our stores in the past. By opening special counters at some stores and selling more\nDTP products, sales in our drugstores increased.\nFurthermore, since fiscal year 2018, we have accelerated our expansion of new stores, which is expected to generate more retail drugstore revenues. Eighteen stores have\nbecome qualified for municipal government insurance reimbursement after about two years’ operation. Sales reimbursed from municipal government insurance program usually\naccount for more than 50% of our total sales at maturing stores. As these stores gained such qualifications, their sales increased quickly as compared to the previous year. Our\nstore count is 121 at March, 2019 and 117 at March 31, 2020.\nOur online pharmacy sales increased by approximately $4,756,756, or 54.1% for the year ended March 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2019. The\nincrease was caused by both an increase in sales via e-commerce platforms such as Tmall and an increase in sales via our official site. Popular products at reasonable prices are key\nto success in online business. In order to promote our sales, we focused on the selection of medical equipment suitable to local customers. For example, sales of blood glucose\nmeters and contact lens contributed significantly to our revenue in the year ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the same period a year ago. Additionally, we maintained a\nmembership care program targeted at chronic disease customers. We have closely interacted with our members via Wechat by providing healthcare knowledge and reminding our\ncustomers to refill medicine. By implementing a personalized customer care program, we were able to promote our sales. As a result, our sales via these e-commerce platforms\nincreased by 58.3% period over period.\nThe sales via our official website were primarily made by certain pharmacy benefit management providers and insurance companies. For example, we have signed a service\ncontract with Yingda Taihe Life Insurance Co. Ltd. (“Yingda”), a national insurance company. State Grid Corporation of China has bought health insurance package for its\nemployees from Yingta. In the year ended March 31, 2020, we served a local factory of State Grid and sold healthcare products to its employees who used their insurance card to\nmake payments. The sales from these customers contributed significantly to our official website sales. Additionally, in the first quarter of calendar 2020, at the outbreak of COVID-\n19, we sold a large quantity of health protective products such as masks. Our official website sales increased by 847,899 or 40.8% year over year.\nWholesale revenue increased by $3,273,093 or 12.4%, primarily as a result of our ability to resell certain products, which our retail stores made large order on, to other\nvendors. As our retail drugstores achieved large quantity sales of certain brand name products, we were able to bargain for lower purchase prices than the market level on these\nmerchandises. As a result, vendors who were unable to obtain a better price than ours, turned to us for these products, causing the increase in the wholesale volume. However,\nhospitals are still the dominant drug retailers in China. Local hospitals usually have strong ties with their existing suppliers and we have not been able to make significant progress\nin becoming a major supplier to local hospitals.\nIn the year ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, we have not harvested and generated revenue from our farming business. We planted ginkgo trees during the year ended\nMarch 31, 2013. A ginkgo tree may have a growth period of up to twenty years before it is mature enough for harvest. Usually, the longer it grows the more valuable it becomes.\nWe plan to continue cultivating the trees in order to maximize their market value in the future.\n38\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased by $418,387 or 1.7% period over period primarily as a result of an increase in gross profit provided by both wholesale business and online sale,\nwhich increased significantly in the year ended March 31, 2020. At the same time, gross margin decreased from 23.3% to 21.8% due to lower online and offline retail profit margins.\nThe average gross margins for each of our four business segments are as follows:\nYear ended\nMarch 31,\n2020 2019\nAverage gross margin for retail drugstores 28.1% 29.2%\nAverage gross margin for online sales 10.6% 11.8%\nAverage gross margin for wholesale business 11.0% 11.3%\nAverage gross margin for farming business N/A N/A\nRetail gross margins decreased primarily because of price restriction from local government on sale of drugs reimbursed by the National Public Health Insurance Program\nand rising proportion of sales DTP (“Direct-to-Patient”) medicine with low profit margin. In order to control increasing budget on medical insurance spending, government has\ndrafted and executed a series of policies to reduce the price of drugs reimbursed by its insurance program. For example, the government has invited bidders, usually manufacturers,\nfor the drugs used in large quantity every year. In exchange for large quantity, manufacturers have to surrender a low price. These drugs are usually prescription drugs primarily\nused at hospitals. However, our drugstores also sell some of these drugs. As a result, our profit margin decreased. Additionally, as we described above, DTP drug sales have taken\na larger proportion of our sales at stores. DTP drugs have extremely low profit margins. Hence, our retail profit margin decreased.\nGross margin of online pharmacy sales decreased primarily due to intense market competition. We conduct our business either through certain e-commerce platforms such\nas Tmall and JD.com or via our own official online pharmacy website, www.dada360.com. The online prices of healthcare products are transparent as customers can easily compare\nprices from websites. In order to promote our sales through e-commerce platforms, we have to lower our prices leading to lower profit margin. As a way to retain new customers\nfrom insurance companies, we also kept low prices on our official online pharmacy websites. As a result, our profit margin for online sales decreased.\nWholesale gross margin decreased primarily due to various products with different profit margins we carried and sold to certain pharmaceutical vendors. In the year ended\nMarch 31, 2020, certain prescription drugs we sold are at low profit margin. As a result, the overall profit margin is lower as compared to the same period last year. Although we\nhave attempted to market our products to major local hospitals and other pharmacies, we have not been able to make significant progress. Until we are able to obtain status as a\nprovincial or national exclusive sale agent for certain popular drugs or have sales access to large local hospitals, we may have to maintain low profit margins in order to drive sales\non our wholesale business.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses decreased by $471,581 or 1.9% year over year, primarily due to decrease in rent. As we closed several stores, rent expense went down.\nAdditionally, we have closely monitored our marketing expense such as small gifts. As a result, our sale and marketing expense declined slightly.\n39\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $6,389,388 or 371.7% period over period. Such expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 6.9% from 1.6% for the\nsame period a year ago. In the year ended March 31, 2020, we recorded bad debt expense of $455,159 as compared to a reduction in the allowance for bad debts of $3,346,886 in\nFY2019. Additionally, we incurred additional labor cost of approximately $1.5 million as we have expanded certain business. For example, we have been operating two Linjia Clinics\nand hired more doctors. In addition, in order to obtain business from commercial health insurance providers, we formed a marketing team. Although these business have not\ncontributed significantly to our revenue, they incurred labor costs. Excluding such an effect, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1.1 million, which\nreflects the increase in management cost as a result of our business expansion.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe recorded an impairment of long-lived assets of $628,192 and $0 for the year ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. In the year ended March 31, 2020, we evaluated the\nlicenses of insurance applicable drugstores acquired in the past based on their discounted positive cash value. Due to the stricter government insurance policy in fiscal year 2021,\nthe value of these licenses has declined. As a result, we recorded an impairment of $628,192 as of March 31, 2020.\nLoss from Operations\nAs a result of the above, we had loss from operations of $7,003,742, as compared to loss from operations of $876,130 a year ago. Our operating margin for the year ended\nMarch 31, 2020 and 2019 was (6.0)% and (0.8)%, respectively.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nIn the year ended March 31, 2020, other income is $(204,064) as compared to other income of $(93,311) in the year ended March 31, 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense decreased by $118,505 period over period due to a decrease in the effective rate resulting from a decline in profits in several business lines.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the foregoing, net loss is $6,457,677 in the year ended March 31, 2020 as compared to a net loss of $1,317,769 in the year ended March 31, 2019.\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable, which are unsecured, are stated at the amount we expect to collect. We continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers (our\ndistributors) and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses. To prepare for potential loss in such accounts, we made corresponding reserves.\nOur accounts receivable aging was as follows for the periods described below:\nRetail Online Drug Herb Total\nFrom date of invoice to customer drugstores Pharmacy wholesale farming amount\n1- 3 months $ 7,097,422 $ 766,988 $ 541,975 $ - $ 8,406,385\n4- 6 months 77,195 - 1,531,512 - 1,608,707\n7- 12 months 10,848 - 3,149 - 13,997\nOver one year 1,919,409 60,873 25,355 - 2,005,637\nAllowance for doubtful accounts (1,752,952) (68,542) (442,576) - (2,264,070)\nTotal accounts receivable $ 7,351,922 $ 759,319 $ 1,659,415 $ - $ 9,770,656\nAccounts receivable from our retail business mainly consist of reimbursements from local government health insurance bureaus and commercial health insurance\nprograms. In the year ended March 31, 2020, we wrote off an approximately $212,338 collectible from provincial and Hangzhou City government insurance, as such amounts have\nbeen determined by the health insurance bureaus to be unqualified for reimbursement.\n40\nAccounts receivables from our online pharmacy business mainly consist of receivables from insurance company and a service company handling with insurance\ncompanies. As we continue to expand our business with commercial insurance company, our receivables from them increased. Additionally, certain receivables are from third-party\nplatforms such as JD.com where we sell products. Usually the third-party platforms will collect from customers ordering on their platforms and then reimburse us at a later date,\nsuch reimbursement periods times ranging from several days to a month after orders are placed.\nAccounts receivable from our drug wholesale business consist of receivables from our customers such as pharmaceutical distributors and local drugstores primarily in\nZhejiang Province. In fiscal 2019, we accelerated collection of certain aged accounts from customers which we no longer or rarely sold products to. By doing so, we are able to take\nbetter use of our cash. As a result, the overall reserve on wholesale accounts receivables decreased.\nSubsequent to March 31, 2020 and through May 31, 2020, we collected approximately $5.3 million in receivables relating to our drugstore business, approximately $0.5\nmillion in receivables relating to our online pharmacy business, approximately $1.7 million relating to our wholesale business, and $0 relating to our herb farming business.\nAdvances to suppliers\nAdvances to suppliers are mainly prepayments to secure certain products or services at favorable pricing. The aging of our advances to suppliers is as follows for the\nperiods described below:\nRetail Online Drug Herb Total\nFrom date of cash prepayment to suppliers drugstores Pharmacy wholesale farming amount\n1- 3 months $ 41,889 $ - $ 480,417 $ - $ 522,306\n4- 6 months 104,131 - 245,407 - 349,538\n7- 12 months 198,397 - 300,033 - 498,430\nOver one year 82,357 - 746,232 - 828,589\nAllowance for doubtful accounts (140,743) - (883,320) - (1,024,063)\nTotal advances to suppliers $ 286,031 $ - $ 888,769 $ - $ 1,174,800\nSince the acquisition of Jiuxin Medicine, we have gradually transferred almost all logistics services of our retail drugstores to Jiuxin Medicine. Jiuzhou Pharmacy only\npurchases certain non-medical products such as sundry. As a result, our retail chain made few advances to suppliers as of March 31, 2020. At the end of 2019 we had outstanding\nadvances to suppliers with which we have ceased doing business. These advances have been fully reserved.\nAdvances to suppliers for our drug wholesale business consist of prepayments to our vendors such as pharmaceutical manufacturers and other distributors. We typically\nreceive products from vendors within three to nine months after making prepayments. We continuously monitor delivery from and payments to our vendors while maintaining a\nprovision for estimated credit losses based upon past experience and any supplier-specific issues such as the discontinuation of inventory supply that have been identified. If we\nare having difficulty receiving products from a vendor, we take the following steps: cease purchasing products from the vendor, ask for return of our prepayment promptly, and if\nnecessary, take legal action. If all of these steps are unsuccessful, management then determines whether or not the prepayments should be reserved or written off. In fiscal 2019, in\norder to use our cash more efficiently, we accelerated the collection of deposits from quite a few suppliers, especially aged accounts. We chose to only leave deposits with critical\nsuppliers who supply large quantities of merchandise. As a result, the outstanding advances to suppliers decreased dramatically.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur cash flows for the periods indicated are as follows:\nFor the year ended\nMarch 31,\n2020 2019\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (6,907,945) $ (5,603,216)\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (4,836,613) $ (7,326,181)\nNet cash provided by financing activities $ 19,013,706 $ 8,078,581\n41\nFor the year ended March 31, 2020 cash used in operating activities amounted to $(6,907,945), as compared to $(5,603,216) a year ago. The change is primarily attributable\nto a decrease in cash provided by advances to suppliers of $3,463,815, a decrease in cash provided by other current assets of $1,195,461, a decrease in cash provided by accounts\nreceivable of $1,450,964 offset by an increase of $2,988,231 in customer deposits, an increase in cash provided by bad debt direct write-off and provision of $3,804,205 and an\nincrease in cash provided by inventories and biological assets of $2,370,758.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities amounted to $(4,836,613), as compared to $(7,326,181) provided by investing activities a year\nago. The change is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash provided by investment in a joint venture of $2,567,083, offset by an increase of $4,794,637 in acquisition of\nequipment.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities amounted to $19,013,706, as compared to $8,078,581 a year ago. The financing proceeds were\nderived from the private placement in 2019 as described below. Additionally, we borrowed an one-year loan of $1,435,620 from Hangzhou United Bank. Furthermore, we borrowed\n$7,178,100 from Haihui Commercial Factoring (Tianjin) Co. Ltd. as of March 31, 2020.\nAs of March 31, 2020, we had cash of approximately $16,176,318. Our total current assets as of March 31, 2020, were $60,987,212 and total current liabilities were\n$57,437,974, which resulted in a working capital of $3,549,238. On April 15, 2019, we closed a registered direct offering of 4,000,008 shares of common stock at $2.50 per share with\ngross proceeds of $10,000,020 from our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3. On June 3, 2020, we closed a registered direct offering of 5,000,004 shares of common\nstock at $2.00 per share with gross proceeds of $10,000,008 from our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations:\nContractual obligations Payments due by period\nLess than More than\nTotal 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years\nShort-term loan payable $ 1,410,130 1,410,130 - - -\nNotes payable 26,605,971 26,605,971 - - -\nLong-term loan payable 4,115,958 - 4,115,958 - -\nLong-Term Debt Obligations - - - - -\nCapital Lease Obligations - - - - -\nOperating Lease Obligations 20,030,665 981,090 10,629,771 5,572,313 2,847,491\nPurchase Obligations - - - - -\nOther Long-Term Liabilities Reflected on the Registrant’s Balance Sheet\nunder GAAP* 64,090 - 64,090 - -\nTotal $ 52,226,814 28,997,191 14,809,819 5,572,313 2,847,491\n* This refers to warrants to purchase shares of common stock issued to an institutional investor and a placement agent (See Note 19).\n42\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any outstanding financial guarantees or commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. We have not entered into any derivative\ncontracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as stockholder’s equity or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any\nretained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable\ninterest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services\nwith us.\nExchange Rates\nOur subsidiaries and affiliated companies in the PRC maintain their books and records in RMB, the lawful currency of the PRC. In general, for consolidation purposes, we\ntranslate their assets and liabilities into USD using the applicable exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date, and the statement of income is translated at average exchange\nrates during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation of their financial statements are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income.\nThe exchange rates used to translate amounts in RMB into USD for the purposes of preparing the audited consolidated financial statements or otherwise disclosed in\nthis report were as follows:\nMarch 31, March 31,\n2020 2019\nBalance sheet items, except for the registered and paid-up capital, as of end of period/year USD1: RMB 0.1410 USD1: RMB 0.1490\nAmounts included in the statement of Operations and statement of cash flows for the period/ year ended USD1: RMB 0.1436 USD1: RMB 0.1491\nInflation\nWe believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our operations to date.\nITEM 7A.

Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” and are set forth beginning on page F-1 immediately following the signature pages to this\nreport.\n43\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange\nAct”)), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that\nany controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management\nnecessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nAs of March 31, 2020, the end of the fiscal year covered by this report, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer\nand Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures.\nBased on the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2020, our disclosure controls and procedures were\nineffective. They reached this conclusion due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting as described below. Management anticipates that\nour disclosure controls and procedures will remain ineffective until such material weaknesses are remediated.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth\nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (COSO) in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework. We are responsible for\nestablishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting\nwas ineffective as of March 31, 2020 due to the following material weaknesses:\nAccounting and Finance Personnel Weaknesses - As noted in Item 9A of our annual reports on Form 10-K for the preceding fiscal years, management concluded that in\nlight of the inexperience of our accounting staff with respect to the requirements of U.S. GAAP-based reporting and SEC rules and regulations, we did not maintain effective\ncontrols and did not implement adequate and proper supervisory review to ensure that significant internal control deficiencies can be detected or prevented.\nManagement’s assessment of the control deficiency over accounting and finance personnel as of March 31, 2020 considered the same factors, including:\n● the number of adjustments proposed by our independent auditors during our quarterly review and annual audit processes;\n● how adequately we complied with U.S. GAAP on transactions; and\n● how accurately we prepared supporting information to provide to our independent auditors on a quarterly and annual basis.\nBased on the above factors, management concluded that the lack of timely reconciliation of booking and recording from China GAAP to US GAAP and lack of accounting\nstaff with sufficient US GAAP experience are material weaknesses as of March 31, 2020.\nRemediation of Material Weakness for the year ended March 31, 2020\nSubsequent to the identification of the material weakness, we have enhanced existing controls and design and implemented new controls. We have devoted significant\ntime and attention to remediate the above material weaknesses. For example, we redesigned our system to retrieve data faster, so we are able to identify and reconcile the GAAP\ndifference more efficiently. In addition, we trained our accounting staff with US GAAP knowledge, so they can meet the requirement from our auditors more efficiently. These\nimprovements to our internal control infrastructure were implemented, and were in place in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended March 31,\n2020. As such, we believe that the remediation initiative outlined above will be sufficient to remediate as the changes become operational for future years the material weakness in\ninternal control over financial reporting as discussed.\n44\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn the quarter ended March 31, 2020, we linked our SAP system, a leading ERP system from Germany that was installed in 2017 with a series of local banks, so it can\nprovide a view of overall and instant cash information. In addition, we hired specialized managers who are able to program and develop improved procedure in the system.\nFurthermore, we have been training our staff in implementing the management system continually. We expect to continually improve our internal control system. There have been\nno other changes in our internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15\nthat occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2020, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Controls\nManagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and fraud. Any\ncontrol system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be\nmet. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if\nany, within the Company have been detected.\nITEM 9B.

The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Plan is 2,025,000 shares of our common stock. The Plan was approved by\nour shareholders at our annual meeting held on November 2, 2010. On February 24, 2015, our Board of Directors adopted and approved Amendment No. 1 to the Plan to increase\nthe number of shares of the Company’s common stock available for issuance thereunder from 2,025,000 share limit to 4,325,000 shares. Amendment No. 1 was approved by the\nstockholders at the annual shareholders meeting on March 23, 2015. On January 27, 2016, our Board of Directors adopted and approved Amendment No. 2 to the Plan to increase\nthe number of shares of the Company’s common stock available for issuance thereunder from 4,325,000 share limit to 7,175,000 shares. Amendment No. 2 was approved by the\nstockholders at the annual shareholders meeting on March 23, 2016. Under the Plan, the Company may issue common stock and/or options to purchase common stock to our\nofficers, directors, employees and consultants. The Plan is administered either by our Board of Directors or a committee that it designates comprising of at least two (2) “non-\nemployee” directors. The board (or the committee, if one is designated) has full and complete authority, in its discretion, but subject to the express provisions of the Plan, to grant\nawards, to determine the number of awards to be granted and the time or times at which awards shall be granted; to establish the terms and conditions upon which awards may be\nexercised; to remove or adjust any restrictions and conditions upon awards; to specify, at the time of grant, provisions relating to exercisability of awards and to accelerate or\notherwise modify the exercisability of any awards; and to adopt such rules and regulations and to make all other determinations deemed necessary or desirable for the\nadministration of the Plan. On February 14, 2017, our Board of Directors adopted and approved Amendment No. 3 to the Plan to increase the number of shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock available for issuance thereunder from 7,175,000 share limit to 9,696,468 shares. Amendment No. 3 was approved by the stockholders at the annual shareholders\nmeeting on March 29, 2017. On March 26, 2018, the shareholders of the Company approved the Amendment No. 4 to the Plan which increased the total shares of common stock\navailable for issuance thereunder to 12,196,468. On June 30, 2018, the Compensation Committee of the Board approved the Amendment No. 5 to the Plan as The Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct of 2017 removed the 162(m) qualified performance based compensation exemption to the $1 million cap on deductions for compensation to covered executives. Section 1.3.2\nwas in the Plan to permit grants under the Plan to fit within that exemption. As that exemption no longer applies for grants made in 2018 or thereafter, the Plan had been amended to\nremove the provisions intended to comply with that exemption, including the one in Section 1.3.2. of the Plan. On March 5, 2020, the shareholders of the Company approved the\nAmended and Restated 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, which in addition to the incorporation of the Amendment No. 4 and Amendment No. 5 to the Plan, clarified the term of the Plan\nin order to render the Plan being available for incentive stock options grants in the future and approved the proposal of adding a ten-year term to the Plan. The Plan, effective since\nNovember 2, 2010, shall terminate automatically on January 14, 2030 (the tenth anniversary of the Board’s approval of this Plan), unless terminated earlier by the Board, except with\nrespect to Awards then outstanding. The Plan, as amended and restated, has authorized, with the stockholders’ approval previously obtained, to reserve a total of 12,196,468\nshares of our common stock for issuance under the Plan. As of March 31, 2020, there were 3,840,546 shares of our common stock available for future issuance under the Plan.\n51\nDirector Compensation\nThe following table provides compensation information for our directors during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020:\nDirector Compensation Table\nNonqualified\nFiscal Fees Earned Non-Equity Deferred\nYear or Paid in Stock Option Incentive Plan Compensation All Other\nended Cash Awards Awards Compensation Earnings Compensation Total\nName March 31, ($) ($)(1) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($)\nLei Liu (2) 2020 68,910 -- -0- -0- -0- -0- 68,910\nLi Qi (2) 2020 51,682 -0- -0- -0- -0- -0- 51,682\nCaroline Wang 2020 11,485 -0- -0- -0- -0- -0- 11,485\nGenghua Gu 2020 6,000 -0- -0- -0- -0- -0- 6,000\nJiangliang He 2020 5,168 -0- -0- -0- -0- -0- 5,168\nPingfan Wu 2020 8,614 -0- -0- -0- -0- -0- 8,614\n(1) Reflects dollar amount expensed by the Company during the applicable fiscal year for financial statement reporting purposes.\n(2) Compensation is reflected in the Summary Compensation Table on page 51 above.\nWe do not currently have an established policy to provide compensation to members of our Board of Directors for their services in that capacity, although we have\nentered into certain agreements with some of our directors as described below.

(the “Company”) as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated\nstatements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the\n“consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at March 31,\n2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, effective April 1, 2019, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases due to the adoption of ASC\n842, Leases.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to\nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to\nperform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not\nfor the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ BDO China Shu Lun Pan Certified Accountants LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since year 2015.\nShanghai, People’s Republic of China\nJuly 10, 2020\nF-1\nPART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nITEM 1.

(“Jo-Jo Drugstores” or the “Company”), was incorporated in Nevada on December 19, 2006, originally under the name “Kerrisdale Mining\nCorporation”. On September 24, 2009, the Company changed its name to “China Jo-Jo Drugstores, Inc.” in connection with a share exchange transaction as described below.\nOn September 17, 2009, the Company completed a share exchange transaction with Renovation Investment (Hong Kong) Co., Ltd. (“Renovation”), whereby 7,900,000 shares of\ncommon stock were issued to the stockholders of Renovation in exchange for 100% of the capital stock of Renovation. The completion of the share exchange transaction resulted\nin a change of control. The share exchange transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization and, as a result, the consolidated financial statements of the\nCompany (the legal acquirer) are, in substance, those of Renovation (the accounting acquirer), with the assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses, of the Company being\nincluded effective from the date of the share exchange transaction. Renovation has no substantive operations of its own except for its holdings of Zhejiang Jiuxin Investment\nManagement Co., Ltd. (“Jiuxin Management”), Zhejiang Shouantang Medical Technology Co., Ltd. (“Shouantang Technology”) and Hangzhou Jiutong Medical Technology Co.,\nLtd (“Jiutong Medical”), Hangzhou Jiuyi Medical Technology Co. Ltd. (“Jiuyi Technology”), its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nThe Company is an online and offline retailer and wholesale distributor of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products in the People’s Republic of China (“China” or the “PRC”).\nThe Company’s offline retail business is comprised primarily of pharmacies, which are operated by Hangzhou Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy Chain Co., Ltd. (“Jiuzhou Pharmacy”), a\ncompany that the Company controls through contractual arrangements. On March 31, 2017, Jiuxin Management established a subsidiary, Lin’An Jiuzhou Pharmacy Co., Ltd\n(“Lin’An Jiuzhou”) to operates drugstores in Lin’an City.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company dissolved eight independent pharmacies. Among the eight dissolved pharmacies, two stores have merged into Jiuzhou\nPharmacy and became Jiuzhou Pharmacy stores in Hangzhou. The other six stores’ licenses of government medical insurance, which qualify the stores for government\nreimbursement, were transferred to six Jiuzhou Pharmacy stores in Hangzhou City.\nOn January 9, 2020, in order to continue expanding and strengthening its local drugstore network, the Company acquired a local drugstores chain with ten stores at a price of $0.14\n(RMB 1). The acquired chain agreed to cease their stores’business and liquidate all of the stores ‘accounts after Jiuzhou Pharmacy acquired them. In March 2020, the chain was\ndissolved and its government insurance reimbursement certificates have been transferred to Jiuzhou Pharmacy.\nThe Company’s offline retail business also includes four medical clinics through Hangzhou Jiuzhou Clinic of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine (“Jiuzhou Clinic”) and\nHangzhou Jiuzhou Medical and Public Health Service Co., Ltd. (“Jiuzhou Service”), both of which are also controlled by the Company through contractual arrangements. In May\n2014, Shouantang Technology established Hangzhou Shouantang Bio-technology Co., Ltd. (“Shouantang Bio”). In May 2016, Shouantang Bio set up and held 49% of Hangzhou\nKahamadi Bio-technology Co., Ltd.(“Kahamadi Bio”), a joint venture specializing in brand name development for nutritional supplements. In 2018, Jiuzhou Pharmacy invested a\ntotal of $741,540 (RMB5,100,000) in and held 51% of Zhejiang Jiuzhou Linjia Medical Investment and Management Co. Ltd (“Linjia Medical”), which operates two new clinics in\nHangzhou as of March 31, 2020. On March 29, 2019, Jiuzhou Pharmacy formed and currently holds 51% of the equity of Zhejiang AyiGe Medical Health Management Co., Ltd.\n(“Ayi Health”), which is intended to provide technical support such as IT and customer support to our health management business in the future.\nThe Company currently conducts its online retail pharmacy business through Jiuzhou Pharmacy, which holds the Company’s online pharmacy license. On September 10, 2015,\nRenovation set up Jiuyi Technology to provide additional technical support such as webpage development to our online pharmacy business. In November 2015, the technical\nsupport function was transferred back to Jiuzhou Pharmacy, which hosts our online pharmacy.\nThe Company’s wholesale business is primarily conducted through Zhejiang Jiuxin Medicine Co., Ltd. (“Jiuxin Medicine”), which is licensed to distribute prescription and non-\nprescription pharmaceutical products throughout China. Jiuzhou Pharmacy acquired Jiuxin Medicine on August 25, 2011. On April 20, 2018, 10% of Jiuxin Medicine shares were\nsold to Hangzhou Kangzhou Biotech Co. Ltd. for a total proceeds of $79,625 (RMB 507,760).\nF-6\nThe Company’s herb farming business is conducted by Hangzhou Qianhong Agriculture Development Co., Ltd. (“Qianhong Agriculture”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jiuxin\nManagement. Due to the complexity of the cultivation business, Qianhong Agriculture has not grown herbs in fiscal 2020.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the activities of the Company and each of the following entities:\nEntity Name Background Ownership\nRenovation ● Incorporated in Hong Kong SAR on September 2, 2008 100%\nJiuxin Management ● Established in the PRC on October 14, 2008 100%\n● Deemed a wholly foreign owned enterprise (“WFOE”) under PRC law\n● Registered capital of $14.5 million fully paid\nShouantang Technology ● Established in the PRC on July 16, 2010 by Renovation with registered capital 100%\nof $20 million\n● Registered capital requirement reduced by the SAIC to $11 million in July 2012\nand is fully paid\n● Deemed a WFOE under PRC law\n● Invests and finances the working capital of Quannuo Technology\nQianhong Agriculture ● Established in the PRC on August 10, 2010 by Jiuxin Management 100%\n● Registered capital of RMB 10 million fully paid\n● Carries out herb farming business\nJiuzhou Pharmacy (1) ● Established in the PRC on September 9, 2003 VIE by contractual arrangements (2)\n● Registered capital of RMB 5 million fully paid\n● Operates the “Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy” stores in Hangzhou\nJiuzhou Clinic (1) ● Established in the PRC as a general partnership on October 10, 2003 VIE by contractual arrangements (2)\n● Operates a medical clinic adjacent to one of Jiuzhou Pharmacy’s stores\nJiuzhou Service (1) ● Established in the PRC on November 2, 2005 VIE by contractual arrangements (2)\n● Registered capital of RMB 500,000 fully paid\n● Operates a medical clinic adjacent to one of Jiuzhou Pharmacy’s stores\nJiuxin Medicine ● Established in PRC on December 31, 2003 VIE by contractual arrangements as a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of Jiuzhou Pharmacy (2)\n● Acquired by Jiuzhou Pharmacy in August 2011\n● Registered capital of RMB 10 million fully paid\n● Carries out pharmaceutical distribution services\nJiutong Medical ● Established in the PRC on December 20, 2011 by Renovation 100%\n● Registered capital of $2.6 million fully paid\n● Currently has no operation\nF-7\nEntity Name Background Ownership\nShouantang Bio ● Established in the PRC in October, 2014 by Shouantang Technology 100%\n● 100% held by Shouantang Technology\n● Registered capital of RMB 1,000,000 fully paid\n● Sells nutritional supplements under its own brand name\nJiuyi Technology ● Established in the PRC on September 10, 2015 100%\n● 100% held by Renovation\n● Technical support to online pharmacy\nKahamadi Bio ● Established in the PRC in May 2016 49%\n● 49% held by Shouantang Bio\n● Registered capital of RMB 10 million\n● Develop brand name for nutritional supplements\nLin’An Jiuzhou ● Established in the PRC in March 31, 2017 100%\n● 100% held by Jiuxin Management\n● Registered capital of RMB 5 million\n● Explore retail pharmacy market in Lin’An City\nLinjia Medical ● Established in the PRC in September27, 2017 VIE by contractual arrangements as a controlled\nsubsidiary of Jiuzhou Pharmacy (2)\n● 51% held by Jiuzhou Pharmacy\n● Registered capital of RMB 20 million\n● Operates local clinics\nAyi Health ● Established in the PRC in March 29, 2019 VIE by contractual arrangements as a controlled\nsubsidiary of Jiuzhou Pharmacy (2)\n● 51% held by Jiuzhou Pharmacy\n● Registered capital of RMB 10 million\n● Provide technical Support for medial service\n(1) Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service had been under the common control of Mr. Lei Liu and Ms. Li Qi, the three shareholders (the “Owners”) since their\nrespective establishment dates, pursuant to agreements among the Owners to vote their interests in concert as memorialized in a voting rights agreement. Based on such\nvoting agreement, the Company has determined that common control exists among these three companies. The Owners have operated these three companies in\nconjunction with one another since each company’s respective establishment date. Jiuxin Medicine is also deemed under the common control of the Owners as a\nsubsidiary of Jiuzhou Pharmacy.\n(2) To comply with certain foreign ownership restrictions of pharmacy and medical clinic operators, Jiuxin Management entered into a series of contractual arrangements with\nJiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service on August 1, 2009. These contractual arrangements are comprised of five agreements: a consulting services\nagreement, operating agreement, equity pledge agreement, voting rights agreement and option agreement. Because such agreements obligate Jiuxin Management to\nabsorb all of the risks of loss from the activities of Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service, and enable the Company (through Jiuxin Management) to\nreceive all of their expected residual returns, the Company accounts for each of the three companies (as well as subsidiaries of Jiuzhou Pharmacy) as a variable interest\nentity (“VIE”) under the accounting standards of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). Accordingly, the financial statements of Jiuzhou Pharmacy,\nJiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service, as well as the subsidiaries under the control of Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuxin Medicine and Shouantang Bio are consolidated into the\nfinancial statements of the Company.\nF-8\nNote 2 – LIQUIDITY\nThe Company’s accounts have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) on a going concern\nbasis. The going concern basis assumes that assets are realized and liabilities are extinguished in the ordinary course of business at amounts disclosed in the financial statements.\nThe Company’s ability to continue as a going concern depends upon aligning its sources of funding (debt and equity) with its expenditure requirements and repayment of the\nshort-term debts as and when they become due.\nThe drug retail business is a highly competitive industry in the PRC. Several large drugstore chains and a variety of single stores operate in Hangzhou City and Zhejiang Province.\nIn order to increase the Company’s competitive advantages and gain more local retail pharmacy market share, from fiscal year 2018, we opened fifty-nine new stores in Hangzhou.\nAs a result, the Company incurred significant incremental expense related to rental, labor hiring and training, and marketing activities. As the retail pharmaceutical market becomes\nmore competitive in recent years, a new store usually cannot make profit in its operation until a year later. In fact, the Company incurred significant expenses with limited\nincremental revenue in the period it opened new stores. At their openings, except for four stores, almost all of the new stores were without government insurance reimbursement\ncertificates. In fact, it usually takes more than one year for a new store to apply for and obtain the local government insurance reimbursement certificate. As of March 31, 2020, the\nCompany had obtained thirty-six reimbursement certificates for stores opened in fiscal 2018 and thereafter. Historically in a mature store, more than half of the total revenue were\ncollected from the individual customers’ government insurance program. The Company is in the process of actively applying certificates for all of its new stores. In the future, as\nmore and more stores obtain certificates, the Company expect its new store revenue to increase and eventually contribute positive operating cash flow.\nThe Company’s principal sources of liquidity consist of existing cash, equity financing, bank facilities from local banks as well as personal loans from its principal shareholders if\nnecessary. On April 15, 2019, the Company closed a registered direct offering of 4,000,008 shares of common stock at $2.50 per share with gross proceeds of $10,000,020 from its\neffective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement dated April 11, 2019 (the “2019 Securities Purchase Agreement”), by and among the\nCompany and the investors named therein. On June 3, 2020, the Company closed a registered direct offering of 5,000,004 shares of common stock at $2.00 per share with gross\nproceeds of $10,000,008 from its effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement dated June 1, 2020 (the “2020 Securities Purchase\nAgreement”), by and among the Company and the investors named therein.\nThe Company has a credit line agreement from a local bank as displayed in detail in Note 14. As of March 31, 2020, approximately $0.53 million of the aforementioned bank credit\nline was available for further borrowing. Additionally, Jiuzhou Pharmacy obtained a credit line of approximately $7,175,000 (RMB50,000,000) from Haihui Commercial Factoring\n(Tianjin) Co. Ltd. (“Haihui Commercial”) for three years beginning July 26, 2019. As of March 31, 2020, the full amount has been borrowed from Haihui Commercial. Any borrowing\nthereunder is guaranteed by a third-party guarantor company, and secured by the Company’s assets pursuant to a collateral agreement, as well as personal guarantees of some of\nits principal shareholders.\nThe Company has also obtained additional government insurance reimbursement certificates for its stores opened in the last two years. As the sales reimbursed from the\ngovernment account for more than half of sales in a mature store, the certificates may significantly increase the sales of these stores in the next 12 months. Additionally, with the\nproceeds from the registered direct financing closed on April 15, 2019 and June 3, 2020, and increased credit line, the Company believes it can support its operations for at least the\nnext 12 months.\nF-9\nNote 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of presentation and consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). The\nconsolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and VIEs. All significant inter-company transactions and\nbalances between the Company, its subsidiaries and VIEs are eliminated upon consolidation.\nConsolidation of variable interest entities\nIn accordance with accounting standards regarding consolidation of variable interest entities, VIEs are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities\nwithout additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making ability. All VIEs with which the Company is involved must be\nevaluated to determine the primary beneficiary of the risks and rewards of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the VIE for financial reporting purposes.\nThe Company has concluded, based on the contractual arrangements, that Jiuzhou Pharmacy (including its subsidiaries and controlled entities), Jiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service\nare each a VIE and that the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Jiuxin Management, absorbs a majority of the risk of loss from the activities of these companies, thereby enabling\nthe Company, through Jiuxin Management, to receive a majority of their respective expected residual returns.\nControl and common control are defined under the accounting standards as “an individual, enterprise, or immediate family members who hold more than 50 percent of the voting\nownership interest of each entity.” Because the Owners collectively own 100% of Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service, and have agreed to vote their interests in\nconcert since the establishment of each of these three companies as memorialized in the voting rights agreement, the Company believes that the Owners collectively have control\nand common control of the three companies. Accordingly, the Company believes that Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service were constructively held under\ncommon control by Jiuxin Management as of the time the Contractual Agreements were entered into, establishing Jiuxin Management as their primary beneficiary. Jiuxin\nManagement, in turn, is owned by Renovation, which is owned by the Company.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe operations of the Company are located in the PRC. Accordingly, the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations may be influenced by political,\neconomic, and legal environments in the PRC, as well as by the general state of the PRC economy. The Company’s operations in the PRC are subject to special considerations and\nsignificant risks not typically associated with companies in North America and Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic and\nlegal environment and foreign currency exchange. The Company’s results may be adversely affected by changes in the political, regulatory and social conditions in the PRC.\nAlthough the Company has not experienced losses from these situations and believes that it is in compliance with existing laws and regulations including its organization and\nstructure disclosed in Note 1, this may not be indicative of future results.\nThe Company has significant cash deposits with suppliers in order to obtain and maintain inventory. The Company’s ability to obtain products and maintain inventory at existing\nand new locations is dependent upon its ability to post and maintain significant cash deposits with its suppliers. In the PRC, many vendors are unwilling to extend credit terms for\nproduct sales that require cash deposits to be made. The Company does not generally receive interest on any of its supplier deposits, and such deposits are subject to loss as a\nresult of the creditworthiness or bankruptcy of the party who holds such funds, as well as the risk from illegal acts such as conversion, fraud, theft or dishonesty associated with\nthe third party. If these circumstances were to arise, the Company would find it difficult or impossible, due to the unpredictability of legal proceedings in China, to recover all or a\nportion of the amount on deposit with its suppliers.\nF-10\nMembers of the current management team own controlling interests in the Company and are also the Owners of the VIEs in the PRC. The Company only controls the VIEs through\ncontractual arrangements which obligate it to absorb the risk of loss and to receive the residual expected returns. As such, the controlling shareholders of the Company and the\nVIEs could cancel these agreements or permit them to expire at the end of the agreement terms, as a result of which the Company would not retain control of the VIEs.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiod. The significant estimates made in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements relate to the assessment of the carrying values of accounts\nreceivable, advances to suppliers and related allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives of property and equipment, inventory reserve and fair value of its purchase option\nderivative liability. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nFair value measurements\nThe Company establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy of valuation techniques based on observable and unobservable inputs, which may be used to measure fair value and\ninclude the following:\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 – Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not\nactive; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nClassification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities, which include financial instruments as defined by FASB ASC 820, include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, financial\nassets available for sales, accounts receivable, notes receivables, other receivable, accounts payable, notes payable, other payable, long-term debt and derivatives. The carrying\namounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, notes receivables, and accounts payable are a reasonable approximation of fair value due to the short\nmaturities of these instruments (Level 1). The carrying amount of notes payable approximates fair value based on borrowing rates of similar bank loan currently available to the\nCompany (Level 2) (See Note 16). The carrying amount of Long-term loan payable approximates fair value based on borrowing rates of similar bank loan currently available to the\nCompany (Level 2) (See Note 17).The carrying amount of the Company’s derivative instruments is recorded at fair value and is determined based on observable inputs that are\ncorroborated by market data (Level 2) (See Note 21). The carrying amount of the financial assets available for sale is recorded at fair value and is determined based on unobservable\ninputs (Level 3) (See Note 4). The carrying amount of the financial liability is recorded at fair value and is determined based on unobservable inputs (Level 3) (See Note 22).\nF-11\nActive Market\nfor Identical Observable Unobservable Total\nAssets Inputs Inputs Carrying\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Value\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 30,982,606 - - 30,982,606\nFinancial assets available for sale - - 157,159 157,159\nAccount receivable 9,770,656 9,770,656\nNotes receivable 57,005 57,005\nOther receivable 5,069,442 5,069,442\nAccounts payable 21,559,494 21,559,494\nNotes payable - 26,605,971 - 26,605,971\nOther payable 2,522,330 2,522,330\nLong-term loan payable 6,403,700 6,403,700\nFinancial liability 70,507 70,507\nWarrants liability - 64,090 - 64,090\nTotal $ 69,961,533 33,073,761 227,666 103,262,960\nRevenue recognition\nEffective March 31, 2018, the Company began recognizing revenue under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC\n606”), using the modified retrospective transition method. The impact of adopting the new revenue standard was not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nThe core principle of this new revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:\n● Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer\n● Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract\n● Step 3: Determine the transaction price\n● Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n● Step 5: Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation\nIn order to identify the performance obligations in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify each promised\ngood or service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606’s definition of a “distinct” good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if both of the following criteria\nare met:\n● The customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or service is\ncapable of being distinct).\n● The entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the good or\nservice is distinct within the context of the contract).\nF-12\nIf a good or service is not distinct, the good or service is combined with other promised goods or services until a bundle of goods or services is identified that is distinct.\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding\namounts collected on behalf of third parties (for example, some sales taxes). The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts,\nor both. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized\nwill not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.\nThe transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The transaction price allocated to each performance obligation is\nrecognized when that performance obligation is satisfied, at a point in time or over time as appropriate.\nThe Company’s revenue is net of value added tax (“VAT”) collected on behalf of the PRC tax authorities with respect to the sales of merchandise. VAT collected from customers,\nnet of VAT paid for purchases, is recorded as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until it is paid to the relevant PRC tax authorities.\nCertain contract liabilities primarily represent the Company’s obligation to transfer additional goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration,\nfor example, membership points. The consideration received remains a contract liability until goods or services have been provided to the retail customer. The estimated amount\nbased on accrued membership points was deducted from sales revenue.\nThe following is a discussion of the Company’s revenue recognition policies by segment under the new revenue recognition accounting standard:\nPharmacy retail sales\nThe physical pharmacies sell prescription drugs, over-the-counter (“OTC”) drugs, traditional Chinese medicine, nutritional supplements, medical devices and sundry products.\nRevenue from sales of prescription medicine at drugstores is recognized when the prescription is filled and the customer picks up and pays for the prescription. Revenue from sales\nof other merchandise at drugstores is recognized at the point of sale, which is when a customer pays for and receives the merchandise. Usually the majority merchandise, such as\nprescription and OTC drugs, are not refundable after the customers leave the counter. Returns of other products, such as sundry products, are minimal. Sales of drugs reimbursed\nby the local government medical insurance agency and receivables from the agency are recognized when a customer pays for the drugs at a store. The Company based on\nhistorical experience, a reserve for potential losses from denial of reimbursement on certain unqualified drugs is made to the receivables from the government agency. Additionally,\nseveral onsite clinics adjacent to pharmacies provide limited medical services. Revenue from medical services is recognized after the service has been rendered to a customer. As\nrevenue from medical services is minimal compared to pharmacy retail sales, it is included as part of the pharmacy retail sales.\nThe Company deduct the membership rewards directly from the retail revenue, and present such amounts in net sales as opposed to the current reduction of operation expense\nclassification. Membership rewards, usually membership points, are accumulated by customers based on their historical spending levels. The Company has determined that there is\nan additional performance obligation to those customers at the time of the initial transaction. The customers can then redeem these points against the prices of merchandises they\npurchasse in the future. At the end of each period, unredeemed membership rewards are reflected as a contract liability.\nOnline pharmacy sales\nThe online pharmacy sells various health products except for prescription drugs. Revenue from online pharmacy sales is recognized when merchandise is shipped to customers.\nWhile most deliveries take one day, certain deliveries may take longer depending on a customer’s location. Any loss caused in a shipment will be reimbursed by the Company’s\ncourier company. The Company’s sales policy allows for the return of certain merchandises without reason within seven days after a customer’s receipt of the applicable\nmerchandise. Historically, sales returns seven days after merchandise receipts have been minimal.\nF-13\nWholesale\nJiuxin Medicine purchases medicine in quantity and distributes products primarily to local pharmacies and medical products dealers. Revenue from sales of merchandise to non-\nretail customers is recognized when the merchandise is transferred to customers. Historically, sales returns have been minimal.\nThe Company’s revenue is net of VAT collected on behalf of PRC tax authorities in respect to the sales of merchandise. VAT collected from customers, net of VAT paid for\npurchases, is recorded as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until it is paid to the relevant PRC tax authorities.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table disaggregates the Company’s revenue by major source in each segment for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019:\nFor the year ended March 31 2020 2019\nRetail drugstores\nPrescription drugs $ 26,045,423 $ 23,516,046\nOTC drugs 31,532,248 31,401,328\nNutritional supplements 6,013,622 6,354,108\nTCM 5,325,008 6,529,790\nSundry products 1,312,293 941,491\nMedical devices 3,852,643 3,591,646\nTotal retail revenue $ 74,081,237 $ 72,334,409\nOnline pharmacy\nPrescription drugs $ 1,447,469 $ -\nOTC drugs 5,721,638 3,127,976\nNutritional supplements 742,809 737,315\nTCM 266,638 74,262\nSundry products 2,082,601 2,736,070\nMedical devices 3,280,060 2,108,836\nTotal online revenue $ 13,541,215 $ 8,784,459\nDrug wholesale\nPrescription drugs $ 24,857,708 $ 16,745,862\nOTC drugs 4,196,841 8,964,587\nNutritional supplements 205,881 290,534\nTCM 314,769 271,280\nSundry products 43,854 24,846\nMedical devices 86,184 135,035\nTotal wholesale revenue $ 29,705,237 $ 26,432,144\nTotal revenue $ 117,327,689 $ 107,551,012\nContract Balances\nContract liabilities primarily represent the Company’s obligation to transfer additional goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration, for\nexample membership points and membership rewards. The consideration received remains a contract liability until goods or services have been provided to the retail customer.\nThe following table provides information about receivables and contract liabilities from contracts with customers:\nMarch 31, March 31,\n2020 2019\nTrade receivable(included in accounts receivable, net) $ 9,770,656 $ 8,692,514\nContract liabilities (included in accrued expenses) 1,106,982 1,689,099\nF-14\nRestricted cash\nThe Company’s restricted cash consists of cash and long-term deposits in a bank as security for its notes payable. The Company has notes payable outstanding with the bank and\nis required to keep certain amounts on deposit that are subject to withdrawal restrictions. The notes payable are generally short term in nature due to their short maturity period of\nsix to nine months; thus, restricted cash is classified as a current asset.\nThe following represents a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets to total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the\nConsolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows as of March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019:\nMarch 31, March 31,\n2020 2019\nCash and cash equivalents $ 16,176,318 $ 9,322,463\nRestricted cash 14,806,288 15,422,739\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 30,982,606 $ 24,745,202\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable represents the following: (1) amounts due from banks relating to retail sales that are paid or settled by the customers’ debit or credit cards, (2) amounts due\nfrom government social security bureaus and commercial health insurance programs relating to retail sales of drugs, prescription medicine, and medical services that are paid or\nsettled by the customers’ medical insurance cards, (3) amounts due from non-bank third party payment instruments such as Alipay and certain e-commerce platforms and (4)\namounts due from non-retail customers for sales of merchandise.\nAccounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value consisting of the carrying amount less an allowance for uncollectible accounts, as necessary. In the Company’s retail\nbusiness, accounts receivable mainly consist of reimbursements due from the government insurance bureaus and commercial health insurance programs and are usually collected\nwithin two or three months. The Company directly writes off delinquent account balances, which it determines to be uncollectible after confirming with the appropriate bureau or\nprogram each month. Additionally, the Company also makes estimated reserves on related outstanding accounts receivable based on historical trends.\nIn the Company’s online pharmacy business, accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from non-bank third party payment instruments such as Alipay and certain e-\ncommerce platforms. To purchase pharmaceutical products from an e-commerce platforms such as Tmall, customers are required to submit payment to certain non-bank third party\npayment instruments, such as Alipay, which, in turn, reimburse the Company within seven days to a month. Except for customer returns of sold products, the receivables from\nthese payments instruments are rarely uncollectible.\nIn its wholesale business, the Company uses the aging method to estimate the allowance for anticipated uncollectible receivable balances. Under the aging method, bad debt\npercentages are determined by management, based on historical experience and the current economic climate, are applied to customers’ balances categorized by the number of\nmonths the underlying invoices have remained outstanding. At each reporting period, the allowance balance is adjusted to reflect the amount computed as a result of the aging\nmethod. When facts subsequently become available to indicate that the allowance provided requires an adjustment, a corresponding adjustment is made to the allowance account\nas a change in estimate.\nAdvances to suppliers\nAdvances to suppliers consist of prepayments to its vendors, such as pharmaceutical manufacturers and other distributors. Since the acquisition of Jiuxin Medicine, the Company\nhave transferred almost all logistics services of its retail drugstores to Jiuxin Medicine. Jiuzhou Pharmacy only directly purchases certain non-medical products, such as certain\nnutritional supplements. As a result, almost all advances to suppliers are made by Jiuxin Medicine.\nAdvances to suppliers for its drug wholesale business consist of prepayments to its vendors, such as pharmaceutical manufacturers and other distributors. The Company typically\nreceive products from vendors within three to nine months after making prepayments. The Company continuously monitor delivery from, and payments to, its vendors while\nmaintaining a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific supplier issues, such as discontinuing of inventory supply, that have been\nidentified.\nF-15\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first in first out (FIFO) method. The Company carries out physical inventory counts\non a monthly basis at each store and warehouse location. Herbs that the Company farms are recorded at their cost, which includes direct costs such as seed selection, fertilizer,\nlabor costs that are spent in growing herbs on the leased farmland, and indirect costs such as amortization of farmland development cost. All costs are accumulated until the time\nof harvest and then allocated to harvested herbs costs when the herbs are sold. The Company periodically reviews its inventory and records write-downs to inventories for\nshrinkage losses and damaged merchandise that are identified. The Company provides a reserve for estimated inventory obsolescence or excess quantities on hand equal to the\ndifference, if any, between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value.\nFarmland assets\nHerbs that the Company farms are recorded at their cost, which includes direct costs such as seed selection, fertilizer, and labor costs that are spent in growing herbs on the leased\nfarmland, and indirect costs such as amortization of farmland development costs. Since April 2014, amortization of farmland development costs has been expensed instead of\nallocated into inventory due to unpredictable future market value of planted gingko trees.\nAll related costs described in the above are accumulated until the time of harvest and then allocated to harvested herbs when they are sold.\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation or amortization. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of\nthe assets, taking into consideration the assets’ estimated residual value. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of lease term or remaining lease period of the\nunderlying assets. Following are the estimated useful lives of the Company’s property and equipment:\nEstimated\nUseful Life\nLeasehold improvements 3-10 years\nMotor vehicles 3-5 years\nOffice equipment & furniture 3-5 years\nBuildings 35 years\nMaintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to expenses as incurred. Major additions and betterment to property and equipment are capitalized.\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets are acquired individually or as part of a group of assets, and are initially recorded at their fair value. The cost of a group of assets acquired in a transaction is\nallocated to the individual assets based on their relative fair values.\nThe estimated useful lives of the Company’s intangible assets are as follows:\nEstimated\nUseful Life\nLand use rights 50 years\nSoftware 3 years\nlicense Infinite\nThe Company evaluates intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired.\nImpairment of long lived assets\nThe Company evaluates long lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be\nrecoverable from its estimated future cash flows. Recoverability is measured by comparing the assets’ net book value to the related projected undiscounted cash flows from these\nassets, considering a number of factors including past operating results, budgets, economic projections, market trends and product development cycles. If the net book value of\nthe asset exceeds the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset is considered impaired, and a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the year\nended March 31, 2020, the Company evaluated the licenses of insurance applicable drugstores acquired in the past based on their discounted positive cash value. Due to the\nstricter government insurance policy in fiscal year 2021, the value of these licenses has declined. As a result, The Company recorded an impairment of $628,192 as of March 31,\n2020..\nNotes payable\nDuring the normal course of business, the Company regularly issues bank acceptance bills as a payment method to settle outstanding accounts payables with various material\nsuppliers. The Company records such bank acceptance bills as notes payable. Such notes payable are generally short term in nature due to their short maturity period of six to nine\nmonths.\nF-16\nIncome taxes\nThe Company follows FASB ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of\nevents that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of\ndifferences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates, applicable to\nthe periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount\nexpected to be realized.\nThe accounting standards clarify the accounting and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions and prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for\nrecognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The accounting standards also provide guidance on de-recognition, classification,\ninterest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures, and transition. No significant penalties, uncertain tax provisions or interest relating to income taxes were incurred\nduring the periods ended March 31, 2020 and 2019.\nValue added tax\nSales revenue represents the invoiced value of goods, net of VAT. All of the Company’s products are sold in the PRC and are subject to a VAT on the gross sales price. The VAT\nrates range up to 17%, depending on the type of products sold. The VAT may be offset by VAT paid by the Company on raw materials and other materials included in the cost of\nproducing or acquiring its finished products. The Company recorded a VAT payable net of payments in the accompanying financial statements.\nStock based compensation\nThe Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 718, “Compensation — Stock Compensation,” which establishes accounting standards for non-employee and employee stock-\nbased awards. Under the provisions of FASB ASC 718, the fair value of stock issued is used to measure the fair value of services received as the Company believes such approach\nis a more reliable method of measuring the fair value of the services. For non-employee stock-based awards, fair value is measured based on the value of the Company’s common\nstock on the date that the commitment for performance by the counterparty has been reached or the counterparty’s performance is complete. The fair value of the equity instrument\nis calculated and then recognized as compensation expense over the requisite performance period. For employee stock-based awards, share-based compensation cost is measured\nat the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense with graded vesting on a straight–line basis over the requisite service period for the entire\naward.\nAdvertising and promotion costs\nAdvertising and promotion costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to $262,553 and $1,023,461 for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Such costs consist\nprimarily of print and promotional materials such as flyers to local communities.\nForeign currency translation\nThe Company uses the United States dollar (“U.S. dollars” or “USD”) for financial reporting purposes. The Company’s subsidiaries and VIEs maintain their books and records in\ntheir functional currency the Renminbi (“RMB”), the currency of the PRC.\nF-17\nIn general, for consolidation purposes, the Company translates the assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries and VIEs into U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rates prevailing\nat the balance sheet date, and the statements of income and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates during the reporting period. As a result, amounts related to assets\nand liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheet. Equity accounts are translated at\nhistorical rates. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the financial statements of the subsidiaries and VIEs are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income.\nThe balance sheet amounts, with the exception of equity, at March 31, 2020 and 2019 were translated at 1 RMB to 0.1410 USD and at 1 RMB to 0.1490 USD, respectively. The\naverage translation rates applied to income and cash flow statement amounts for years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were at 1 RMB to 0.1436 USD and at 1 RMB to 0.1491 USD,\nrespectively.\nConcentrations and credit risk\nCertain financial instruments, which subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist of cash and restricted cash. The Company has cash balances at financial\ninstitutions located in Hong Kong and PRC. Balances at financial institutions in Hong Kong may, from time to time, exceed Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board’s insured limits.\nSince March 31, 2015, balances at financial institutions and state-owned banks within the PRC are covered by insurance up to RMB 500,000 (USD 79,600) per bank. As of March 31,\n2020 and March 31, 2019, the Company had deposits totaling $30,974,714 and $24,730,736 that were covered by such limited insurance, respectively. Any balance over RMB\n500,000 (USD 79,600) per bank in PRC will not be covered. To date, the Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, two vendors collectively accounted for 50.4% of the Company’s total purchases and two suppliers accounted for more than 10% of total\nadvances to suppliers. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, two vendors collectively accounted for 40.3% of the Company’s total purchases and two suppliers accounted for\nmore than 10% of total advances to suppliers.\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, no customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total sales and more than 10% of total accounts receivable. For the fiscal\nyear ended March 31, 2019, no customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total sales or more than 10% of total accounts receivable.\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all of their leases (other\nthan leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease). The liability is equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset is based on the liability, subject to certain\nadjustments, such as for initial direct costs. For income statement purposes, a dual model was retained, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance leases.\nOperating leases result in straight-line expense (similar to operating leases under the prior accounting standard) while finance leases result in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar\nto capital leases under the prior accounting standard). Lessor accounting is similar to the prior model, but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model (e.g., certain\ndefinitions, such as initial direct costs, have been updated) and the new revenue standard, ASU 2014-9.\nF-18\nThe Company adopted this new accounting standard on April 1, 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and applied the new standard to all leases through a cumulative-effect\nadjustment to beginning retained earnings. As a result, comparative financial information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in\neffect for those periods. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which includes, among other\nthings, the ability to carry forward the existing lease classification. On April 1, 2019, the Company recorded an after-tax transition adjustment to increase retained earnings by\napproximately $422,354. The new standard had a material impact on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet, but did not materially impact the Company’s\nconsolidated operating results and had no impact on the Company’s cash flows. The following is a discussion of the Company’s lease policy under the new lease accounting\nstandard:\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the\nlease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the\ncommencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments. As the interest rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable,\nthe Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include\nlease payments made before commencement and exclude lease incentives.\nThe Company leases premises for retail drugstores, and offices under non-cancellable operating leases. Operating lease payments are expensed over the term of lease using\nstraight line method. A majority of the Company’s retail drugstore leases have a 3 to 10 year term. Usually within one to three months prior to the expiration date of a lease, the\nCompany is required to notify the lessor and has a priority to continue renting the lease property if a lessor intends to lease property. The lease itself does not have restriction or\ncovenants. If both parties agree to continue, a new lease contract with new lease terms has to been signed by both parties. Usually the rent may increase year by year based on the\nlease contract. Sublease is typically not allowed. Any damage, if made by the lessee, to the property and equipment within the property has to been fixed or reimbursed by the\nlessee. The Company does not have any leases entered into but which have not yet commenced. The Company has historically been able to renew a majority of its drugstores\nleases. The weighted average remaining lease term is 3 years and the weighted average discount rate is 4.19%. Under the terms of the lease agreements, the Company has no legal\nor contractual asset retirement obligations at the end of the leases. See Note 14 “Leases” for additional information.\nImpact of New Lease Standard on Balance Sheet Line Items\nAs a result of applying the new lease standard using a modified retrospective method, the following adjustments were made to accounts on the condensed consolidated balance\nsheet as of April 1, 2019:\nImpact of Change in Accounting Policy\nAs Reported Adjusted\nMarch 31, April 1,\n2019 Adjustments 2019\nOther current assets 2,063,375 (717,414) 1,345,961\nTotal current assets 56,202,981 (717,414) 55,485,567\nOperating lease right-of-use assets - 15,276,388 15,276,388\nTotal assets 72,730,636 14,558,974 87,289,610\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities - 4,718,610 4,718,610\nTotal current liabilities 55,212,286 4,718,610 59,930,896\nLong-term operating lease liabilities - 9,418,011 9,418,011\nTotal liabilities 55,759,469 14,136,621 69,896,090\nRetained earnings (30,587,468) 422,354 (30,165,114)\nTotal shareholders’ equity 18,165,206 422,354 18,587,560\nTotal equity 16,971,167 422,354 17,393,521\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting pronouncements adopted\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” providing financial\nstatement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity\nat each reporting date. For public business entities that are U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filers, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The FASB has voted to defer the effective date for public companies that are smaller\nreporting companies to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. All entities may adopt the amendments in this Update earlier as of the fiscal years beginning after December\n15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.\nF-19\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13 Disclosure Framework — Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which eliminates, adds, and\nmodifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements under ASC 820. This ASU is to be applied on a prospective basis for certain modified or new disclosure\nrequirements, and all other amendments in the standard are to be applied on a retrospective basis. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2018-13 has no impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting pronouncements not yet effective to adopt\nIn July 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-11, “Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): I.\nAccounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features; II. Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain\nNonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception”. Part I of this Update addresses the complexity of accounting for certain\nfinancial instruments with down round features. Part II of this Update addresses the difficulty of navigating Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, because of the\nexistence of extensive pending content in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification®. For public business entities, the amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for\nfiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for all entities, including adoption in an interim period. If\nan entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. ASU No.\n2017-11 has no impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment” (“ASU 2017-04”), which removes\nStep 2 from the goodwill impairment test. An entity will apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying\namount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The new guidance does not amend the optional qualitative assessment of\ngoodwill impairment. Public business entity that is a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filer should adopt the amendments in this ASU for its annual or any interim goodwill\nimpairment test in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after\nJanuary 1, 2017. ASU 2017-4 has no impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, “Income Taxes” (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”). ASU 2019-12 will simplify the\naccounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for\nother areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods\nwithin those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim\nperiods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company do not expect that the requirements of ASU 2019-12 will have a material impact on its consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nF-20\nNOTE 4 – FINANCIAL ASSETS AVAILABLE FOR SALE\nAs of March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019, financial assets available for sale amounted to $157,159 (RMB 1,114,500) and $180,928 (RMB 1,214,500), respectively.

Usually within one to three months prior to\nthe expiration date of a lease, the Company is required to notify the lessor and has a priority to continue renting the lease property if a lessor intends to lease property. The lease\nitself does not have restriction or covenants. If both parties agree to continue, a new lease contract with new lease terms has to been signed by both parties. Usually the rent may\nincrease year by year based on the lease contract. Sublease is typically not allowed. Any damage, if made by the lessee, to the property and equipment within the property has to\nbeen fixed or reimbursed by the lessee.

The\nlicenses allow patients to pay by using insurance cards at stores. The stores are reimbursed from the Human Resource and Social Security Department of Hangzhou City. In\n2014, the Company acquired Sanhao Pharmacy, a drugstore chain. In September 2017, the Company acquired several new stores for the purpose of the Municipal Social\nMedical Reimbursement Qualification Certificates. On January 9, 2020, the Company acquired a local drugstore chain. The acquired drugstores ceased their stores’ business\nand liquidate all of the stores’ accounts after Jiuzhou Pharmacy acquired them. In March 2020, the drugstore chain has dissolved and its certificates were transferred to new\nstores opened at the same time.\n(2) They are primarily the SAP ERP system, the Internet Clinic Diagnosis Terminal system and the Chronic Disease Management system. In 2017, we have installed a leading ERP\nsystem, SAP from Germany. SAP is a well-known management system used by many fortune 500 companies. It is being amortized over three years since its installation. In\n2020, we have installed a internet Clinic Diagnosis System used to strengthen our ability to perform online diagnosis which may increase more customer spending and a\nChronic Disease Management System used to better manage and monitor our members’ health. As of March 31, 2020, the SAP system has a net value of $228,133\n(RMB1,617,816),the internet Clinic Diagnosis System has a net value of approximately $379,143 (RMB 2,688,709), the Chronic Disease Management System has a net value of\napproximately $16,411 (RMB116,379) .\nF-24\n(3) In July 2013, the Company purchased the land use rights of a plot of land in Lin’an, Hangzhou, intended for the establishment of an herb processing plant in the future.\nHowever, as the Company’s farming business in Lin’an has not grown, the Company does not expect completion of the plant in the near future.\n(4) In the year ended March 31, 2020, the company evaluated the licenses of insurance applicable drugstores acquired in the past based on the discounted positive cash value.\nDue to the stricter government insurance policy in fiscal year 2021, the value of these licenses has declined. As a result, the company recorded an impairment.\nNote 16 – NOTES PAYABLE\nThe Company has credit facilities with Hangzhou United Bank (“HUB”), Zhejiang Tailong Commercial Bank (“ZTCB”), Bank of Hangzhou (“BOH”), and China Merchant Bank\n(“CMB”) that provided working capital in the form of the following bank acceptance notes at March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019:\nOrigination Maturity March 31, March 31,\nBeneficiary Endorser date date 2020 2019\nJiuzhou Pharmacy(1) HUB 11/06/18 05/06/19 - 500,857\nJiuzhou Pharmacy(1) HUB 12/12/18 06/12/19 - 2,236,559\nJiuzhou Pharmacy(1) HUB 12/20/18 06/20/19 - 1,072,606\nJiuzhou Pharmacy(1) HUB 12/29/18 06/29/19 - 5,504,943\nJiuzhou Pharmacy(1) HUB 02/14/18 08/14/19 - 2,587,331\nJiuzhou Pharmacy(1) HUB 03/06/18 09/06/19 - 6,600,727\nJiuxin Medicine(1) HUB 10/11/18 04/11/19 - 4,461,531\nJiuxin Medicine(1) HUB 11/06/18 05/06/19 - 2,987,119\nJiuzhou Pharmacy(1) HUB 10/09/19 04/09/20 3,478,259\nJiuzhou Pharmacy(1) HUB 11/06/19 05/06/20 164,582\nJiuzhou Pharmacy(1) HUB 12/05/19 06/05/20 3,106,474 -\nJiuzhou Pharmacy(1) HUB 12/31/19 06/30/20 2,289,308 -\nJiuzhou Pharmacy(1) HUB 01/06/20 07/06/20 129,457 -\nJiuzhou Pharmacy(1) HUB 02/19/20 08/19/20 5,105,096 -\nJiuzhou Pharmacy(1) HUB 03/10/20 09/10/20 5,324,871 -\nJiuxin Medicine(1) HUB 12/26/19 06/26/20 1,371,992 -\nJiuxin Medicine(1) HUB 12/31/19 06/30/20 3,943,776 -\nJiuxin Medicine(1) HUB 03/31/20 09/30/20 1,692,156 -\nTotal $ 26,605,971 $ 25,951,673\n(1) As of March 31, 2019, the Company had $25,951,673 (RMB 174,203,868) of notes payable from HUB.

The Company has an option to pay off the debts earlier than the repayment schedule upon approval from Haihui Commercial.\nNote 18 – TAXES\nIncome tax\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to\ndifferences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred\ntax assets and liabilities are calculated using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or\nsettled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided\nagainst deferred income tax assets for amounts which are not considered “more likely than not” to be realized.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes on an entity basis on income arising in or derived from the tax jurisdiction in which each entity is domiciled.\nEntity Income Tax Jurisdiction\nJo-Jo Drugstores United States\nRenovation Hong Kong, PRC\nAll other entities Mainland, PRC\nFor the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the components of income tax expense consist of the following:\nFor the year ended\nMarch 31,\n2020 2019\nCurrent:\nFederal - -\nState - -\nForeign 16,258 134,763\n16,258 134,763\nDeferred:\nFederal - -\nState - -\nForeign - -\n- -\nProvision for income taxes 16,258 134,763\nA reconciliation of the income tax provision at the federal statutory rate and the effective rate is as follows:\nFor the year\nEnded March 31,\n2020 2019\nU.S. Statutory rates 21.0% 21.0%\nForeign income not recognized in the U.S. (21.0) (21.0)\nChina income taxes 25.0 25.0\nChange in valuation allowance (1) (25.0) (25.0)\nNon-deductible expenses-permanent difference (2) (0.3) (11.4)\nEffective tax rate (0.3)% (11.4)%\n(1) Represents a non-taxable expense reversal due to overall decrease in allowance for accounts receivable and advances to suppliers.\n(2) The (0.3)% and (11.4)% rate adjustments for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 represent expenses that primarily include stock option expenses and other expenses\nincurred by the Company that are not deductible for PRC income tax.\nF-26\nThe components of the Company’s net deferred tax assets are as follows:\nAs of As of\n3/31/2020 3/31/2019\nAllowance 948,951 986,665\nLong-lived assets impairment 709,230 586,298\nAccrued expense 1,443,191 1,569,683\nNet operating loss carry forward 1,157,900 1,164,735\nForeign Tax Credit Carryover 195,000 195,000\nTotal deferred tax assets (liabilities): 4,454,272 4,502,381\nValuation allowance (4,454,272) (4,502,381)\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities) - -\nThe Company regularly assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax\nassets will not be realized. We weigh all available positive and negative evidence, including earnings history and results of recent operations, scheduled reversals of deferred tax\nliabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. Assumptions used to forecast future taxable income often require significant judgment. More weight is given\nto objectively verifiable evidence. In the event we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance will be\nestablished against deferred tax assets in the period in which we make such determination. The need to establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause\ngreater volatility in our effective tax rate.\nAs of March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019, the estimated net operating loss carry forwards for U.S. income tax purposes amounted to $816,908, which may be available to reduce\nfuture years’ taxable income. These carry forwards will expire if not utilized by 2032. In addition, the Company carries a foreign tax credit of $195,000. As of March 31, 2020 and\nMarch 31, 2019, the estimated net operating loss carry forwards for Hong Kong income tax purposes amounted to $2,248,203 and $1,960,933, which may be available to reduce\nfuture years’ taxable income. As of March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019, the estimated net operating loss carry forwards for China income tax purposes amounted to $2,461,582 and\n$2,678,523, which may be available to reduce future years’ taxable income. These carry forwards will expire if not utilized in the next five years.\nThe Company recorded net unrecognized tax benefits of $0.0 million as of March 31, 2020. It is our policy to classify accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the provision for income taxes.\nAudit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed, which in the PRC is usually 5 years as the Company’s most significant tax jurisdiction. The\ncompletion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the Company’s liability for income taxes. Any such\nadjustment could be material to the Company’s results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based, in part, upon the results of operations for the given period.\nF-27\nNote 19 – POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nRegulations in the PRC require the Company to contribute to a defined contribution retirement plan for all permanent employees. The contribution for each employee is based on a\npercentage of the employee’s current compensation as required by the local government. The Company contributed $1,341,167 and $1,423,449 in employment benefits and pension\nfor the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNote 20 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND ARRANGEMENTS\nAmounts payable to related parties are summarized as follows:\nMarch 31, March 31,\n2020 2019\nDue to a director and CEO (1) : 490,218 795,179\n(1) Due to foreign exchange restrictions, the Company’s director and CEO, Mr. Lei Liu personally lent U.S. dollars to the Company to facilitate its payments of expenses in the\nUnited States.\nThe Company leases a retail space from Mr. Lei Liu. The lease expires in September 2020. Rent expenses totaled $26,582 and $27,605 for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020\nand 2019, respectively. The amounts owed under the lease for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were not paid to Mr. Liu as of March 31, 2019.\nOn April 28, 2018, 10% of Jiuxin Medicine was sold to Hangzhou Kangzhou Biotech Co. Ltd. for a total proceeds of approximately $75,643 (RMB507, 760). Mr. Lei Liu owns 51% of\nHangzhou Kangzhou Biotech Co. Ltd.\nNote 21 – WARRANTS\nIn connection with the registered direct offering closed on July 19, 2015, the Company issued to an investor a warrant to purchase up to 600,000 shares of common stock at an\nexercise price of $3.10 per share. The warrant became exercisable on January 19, 2016 and will expire on January 18, 2021. In connection with the offering, the Company also issued a\nwarrant to its placement agent of this offering, pursuant to which the agent may purchase up to 6% of the aggregate number of shares of common stock sold in the offering, i.e.\n72,000 shares. Such warrant has the same terms as the warrant issued to investor in the offering.\nThe fair value of the warrants issued to purchase 672,000 shares as described above was estimated by using the binominal pricing model with the following assumptions:\nCommon Stock Common Stock\nWarrants Warrants\nMarch 31, March 31,\n2020(1) 2019\nStock price $ 1.77 $ 2.62\nExercise price $ 3.10 $ 3.10\nAnnual dividend yield -% -%\nExpected term (years) 0.81 1.80\nRisk-free interest rate 0.71% 2.27%\nExpected volatility 62.08% 67.69%\n(1) As of March 31, 2020, the warrants had not been exercised.\nUpon evaluation, the warrants meet the definition of a derivative under FASB ASC 815, as the Company cannot avoid a net cash settlement under certain circumstances.\nAccordingly, the fair value of the warrants was classified as a liability of $465,248 as of March 31, 2019. For the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company recognized a gain of\n$401,158 for the investor warrant and placement agent warrant, from the change in fair value of the warrant liability, respectively. As a result, the warrant liability is carried on the\nconsolidated balance sheets at the fair value of $64,090 for the investor warrant and placement agent warrant, collectively, as of March 31, 2020.\nF-28\nNote 22 – Employee Deposits\nTo encourage operating team, which consists of doctors and nurses, to devote their efforts to run clinics, Linjia Medical allows them to put deposits in the clinic where doctors and\nnurses work, and take shares in any profit of the clinic. The principal amounts of these deposits are refundable in the event the doctors and nurses leave the clinic. In order to\nproperly reflect Linjia Medical’s liabilities, the Company reclassified the deposit of $70,507 (RMB500,000) as financial liability as of March 31, 2020.\nNote 23 – STOCKHOLDER’S EQUITY\nCommon stock\nOn January 23, 2017, the Company closed a private offering with one institutional investor (the “Investor”) pursuant to which the Company sold to the Investor, and the Investor\npurchased from the Company, an aggregate of 4,840,000 shares of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company, at a purchase price of $2.20 per share, for\naggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $10,648,000 (the “Private Placement”).\nStock warrants\nConcurrent with the registered direct offering of common stock that closed on April 15, 2019, the Company issued to several investors in a private placement warrants to purchase\nup to 3,000,006 shares ofcommon stock. In connection with the offering, the Company also issued a warrant to its placement agent of this offering, pursuant to which the agent\nmay purchase up to 6% of the aggregate number of shares of common stock sold in the offering, i.e. 240,000 shares at an exercise price of $3.125 per share. The warrant became\nexercisable on October 11, 2019 and willexpire on April 11, 2024.\nUpon evaluation, the warrants issued in April 2019 meet the definition of an equity under FASBASC 815. Accordingly, the fair value of the warrants recorded as a part of additional\npaid-in capital.\nStock-based compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based payment awards granted to employees and directors by recording compensation expense based on estimated fair values. The Company\nestimates the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense\nover the requisite service periods in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Share-based awards are attributed to expenses using the straight-line method over the\nvesting period. The Company determines the value of each option award that contains a market condition using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation model, while all other option\nawards are valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model as permitted under FASB ASC 718 “Compensation - Stock Compensation.” The assumptions used in calculating the\nfair value of share-based payment awards represent the Company’s best estimates. The Company’s estimates of the fair values of stock options granted and the resulting amounts\nof share-based compensation recognized may be impacted by certain variables including stock price volatility, employee stock option exercise behaviors, additional stock option\nmodifications, estimates of forfeitures, and the related income tax impact.\nOn March 30, 2018, the Company granted a total of 3,947,100 shares of restricted common stock to its key employees in its retail drugstores and online pharmacy under the\nCompany’s 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the “Plan”). The stock awards vested on the grant date. On June 28, 2018, the compensation committee of the Company\ncanceled 225,000 shares granted to the CEO in order to conform aggregate issuances to the 675,000 share limitation set forth in the Plan. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nremoved the 162(m) qualified performance based compensation exemption to the $1 million cap on deductions for compensation to covered executives. Section 1.3.2 was in the Plan\nto permit grants under the Plan to fit within that exemption. As that exemption no longer applies for grants made in 2018 or thereafter, the Plan has been amended to remove the\nprovisions intended to comply with that exemption, including the one in Section 1.3.2 of the Plan. All $5,328,585 of such expense has been recorded as a service compensation\nexpense in the year ended March 31, 2018.\nStock option\nOn November 18, 2014, the Company granted a total of 967,000 shares of stock options under the Plan to a group of a total of 46 grantees including directors, officers and\nemployees. The exercise price of the stock option is $2.50. The option vests on November 18, 2017, provided that the grantees are still employed by the Company on such a date.\nThe options will be exercisable for five years from the vesting date, or November 18, 2017 until November 17, 2022. For the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, $0 and $0 were\nrecorded as compensation expenses. As of March 31, 2020, all compensation costs related to stock option compensation arrangements granted have been recognized.\nF-29\nStatutory reserves\nStatutory reserves represent restricted retained earnings. Based on their legal formation, the Company is required to set aside 10% of its net income as reported in their statutory\naccounts on an annual basis to the Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund (the “Reserve Fund”). Once the total amount set aside in the Reserve Fund reaches 50% of the entity’s\nregistered capital, further appropriations become discretionary. The Reserve Fund can be used to increase the entity’s registered capital upon approval by relevant government\nauthorities or eliminate its future losses under PRC GAAP upon a resolution by its board of directors. The Reserve Fund is not distributable to shareholders, as cash dividends or\notherwise, except in the event of liquidation.\nAppropriations to the Reserve Fund are accounted for as a transfer from unrestricted earnings to statutory reserves. During the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the\nCompany did not make appropriations to statutory reserves.\nThere are no legal requirements in the PRC to fund the Reserve Fund by transfer of cash to any restricted accounts, and the Company does not do so.\nNote 24 – LOSS PER SHARE\nThe Company reports earnings per share in accordance with the provisions of the FASB’s related accounting standard. This standard requires presentation of basic and diluted\nearnings per share in conjunction with the disclosure of the methodology used in computing such earnings per share. Basic earnings per share excludes dilution, but includes\nvested restricted stocks and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted\nearnings per share takes into account the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and converted into common\nstock.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the basic and diluted earnings per share computation:\nThe year ended\nMarch 31,\n2020 2019\nNet income attributable to controlling interest $ (5,813,369) $ (926,278)\nWeighted average shares used in basic computation 32,816,567 28,936,778\nDiluted effect of stock options and warrants\nWeighted average shares used in diluted computation 32,816,567 28,936,778\nIncome per share – Basic:\nNet income before noncontrolling interest $ (0.18) $ (0.03)\nAdd: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest $ - $ -\nNet income attributable to controlling interest $ (0.18) $ (0.03)\nLoss per share – Diluted:\nNet income before noncontrolling interest $ (0.18) $ (0.03)\nAdd: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest $ - $ -\nNet income attributable to controlling interest $ (0.18) $ (0.03)\nFor the year ended March 31, 2020, 967,000 shares underlying employee stock options and 600,000 shares underlying outstanding purchase options to an investor, and 72,000\nshares underlying outstanding purchase option to an investment placement agent were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share as the options were anti-dilutive.\nNote 25 – SEGMENTS\nThe Company operates within four main reportable segments: retail drugstores, online pharmacy, drug wholesale and herb farming. The retail drugstores segment sells prescription\nand over-the-counter (“OTC”) medicines, TCM, dietary supplements, medical devices, and sundry items to retail customers. The online pharmacy sells OTC drugs, dietary\nsupplements, medical devices and sundry items to customers through several third-party platforms such as Alibaba’s Tmall, JD.com and Amazon.com, and the Company’s own\nplatform all over China. The drug wholesale segment includes supplying the Company’s own retail drugstores with prescription and OTC medicines, TCM, dietary supplement,\nmedical devices and sundry items (which sales have been eliminated as intercompany transactions), and also selling them to other drug vendors and hospitals. The Company’s\nherb farming segment cultivates selected herbs for sales to other drug vendors. The Company is also involved in online sales and clinic services that do not meet the quantitative\nthresholds for reportable segments and are included in the retail drugstores segment.

BUSINESS.\nOverview\nWe are a retailer and distributor of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products typically found in retail pharmacies in the People’s Republic of China\n(“PRC” or “China”). Prior to acquiring Zhejiang Jiuxin Medicine Co., Ltd. (“Jiuxin Medicine”) in August 2011 (seeO “ur Corporate History and Structure -\nHJ Group” below), we were primarily a retail pharmacy operator. We currently have one hundred and twenty-one (121) store locations under the store brand\n“Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy” in Hangzhou city and its adjacent town Lin’an. Additionally, we operate eight drugstores, controlled by Hangzhou Jiuzhou Grand\nPharmacy.\nWe currently operate in four business segments in China: (1) retail drugstores, (2) online pharmacy, (3) wholesale business selling products similar to\nthose we carry in our pharmacies, and (4) farming and selling herbs used for traditional Chinese medicine (“TCM”).\nOur stores provide customers with a wide variety of pharmaceutical products, including prescription and over-the-counter (“OTC”) drugs, nutritional\nsupplements, TCM, personal and family care products, and medical devices, as well as convenience products, including consumable, seasonal, and promotional\nitems. Additionally, we have doctors licensed in both western medicine and TCM on site for consultation, examination and treatment of common ailments at\nscheduled hours. Three (3) stores have adjacent medical clinics offering urgent care (to provide treatment for minor ailments such as sprains, minor lacerations,\nand dizziness that can be treated on an outpatient basis), TCM (including acupuncture, therapeutic massage, and cupping) and minor outpatient surgical\ntreatments (such as suturing). Our stores vary in size, but presently average close to 200 square meters per store. We attempt to tailor each store’s product\nofferings, physician access, and operating hours to suit the community where the store is located.\nWe operate our pharmacies (including the medical clinics) through the following companies in China that we control through contractual\narrangements(refer to “Contractual Arrangements with HJ Group and the Key Personnel” below in this report regarding the details of contractual\narrangements:\n● Hangzhou Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy Chain Co., Ltd. (“Jiuzhou Pharmacy”), which we control contractually, operates our “Jiuzhou Grand\nPharmacy” stores;\n● Hangzhou Jiuzhou Clinic of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine (General Partnership) (“Jiuzhou Clinic”), which we control\ncontractually, operates one (1) of our three (3) medical clinics; and\n● Hangzhou Jiuzhou Medical & Public Health Service Co., Ltd. (“Jiuzhou Service”), which we control contractually, operates our other medical\nclinics.\nIn addition, we operate pharmacies through Lin’An Jiuzhou Pharmacy Co., Ltd (“Lin’An Jiuzhou”), which are directly held by Jiuxin Investments\nManagement Co. Ltd. We also operates nine stores, which are held by Jiuzhou Pharmacy. We tend to expand our clinics network adjacent to our drugstores\nthrough Zhejiang Jiuzhou Linjia Medical Investment and Management Co. Ltd. (“Linjia Medical”), which are controlled by Jiuzhou Pharmacy.\nWe also offer OTC drugs and nutritional supplements for sale through a website (www.dada360.com) operated by Jiuzhou Pharmacy. For the fiscal\nyear ended March 31, 2019, retail revenue, including pharmacies, medical clinics accounted for approximately 67.3% of our total revenue, while online\npharmacy revenue accounted for 8.1% of our total revenue.\nSince August 2011, we have operated a wholesale business through Zhejiang Jiuxin Medicine Co., Ltd. (“Jiuxin Medicine”), distributing third-party\npharmaceutical products (similar to those carried by our pharmacies) primarily to trading companies throughout China. Jiuxin Medicine is wholly owned by\nJiuzhou Pharmacy. For the fiscal year March 31, 2019, wholesale revenue accounted for approximately 24.6% of our total revenue.\nWe also have an herb farming business cultivating and wholesaling herbs used for TCM. This business is conducted through Hangzhou Qianhong\nAgriculture Development Co., Ltd. (“Qianhong Agriculture”), a wholly-owned subsidiary. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we generated no\nrevenue from our herb farming business.\nThroughout this report, we will sometimes refer to Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service, Lin’An Jiuzhou, as well as the subsidiaries of\nJiuzhou Pharmacy, collectively as “HJ Group.”\nOur Corporate History and Structure\nWe were incorporated in Nevada on December 19, 2006, under the name “Kerrisdale Mining Corporation,” with a principal business objective to\nacquire and develop mineral properties. Although we had acquired certain mining claims, we were not operational.\n1\nOn July 14, 2008, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to increase our authorized capital stock from 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par\nvalue $0.001 per share, to 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and authorized the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of “blank check”\npreferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. With respect to the preferred shares, our Board of Directors has the right to set its designations, preferences,\nlimitations, privileges, qualifications, dividend, conversion, voting, and other special or relative rights.\nOn September 17, 2009, we acquired control of Renovation Investment (Hong Kong) Co., Ltd., a limited liability company incorporated in Hong Kong\non September 2, 2008 (“Renovation”), pursuant to a share exchange agreement.\nOn September 24, 2009, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name from “Kerrisdale Mining Corporation” to “China Jo-Jo\nDrugstores, Inc.”\nOn April 9, 2010, we implemented a 1-for-2 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock and a proportional reduction of\nour authorized shares of common stock, by filing a Certificate of Change pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 78.209 with the Nevada Secretary of State on\nApril 6, 2010. All share information in this report takes into account this reverse stock split.\nOn April 28, 2010, we completed a registered public offering of 3,500,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $5.00 per share, resulting in gross\nproceeds to us, prior to deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, of approximately $17,500,000.\nOn July 24, 2015, we closed a registered direct offering of 1.2 million shares of common stock at $2.50 per share with gross proceeds of\napproximately $3 million from our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3.\nOn January 23, 2017, we completed a private offering of 4,840,000 shares of the common stock at a price of $2.20 per share with gross proceeds of\n$10,648,000.\nOn April 15, 2019, we closed a registered direct offering of 4,000,008 shares of common stock at $2.50 per share with gross proceeds of $10,000,020\nfrom our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3. In a concurrent private placement we issued to the investors unregistered warrants to purchase up\nto an aggregate of 3,000,006 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.00 per share. The placement agent receives warrants to purchase up to\n240,000 shares of the common stock with an exercise price of $3.125 per share.\nRenovation\nRenovation was formed by the owners of HJ Group, as defined below, as a special purpose vehicle to raise capital overseas, in accordance with the\nrequirements of China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”). SAFE issued theN otice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange\nAdministration for Financing and Round-Trip Investment Undertaken by Domestic Residents Through Overseas Special-Purpose Vehicle s(“Circular\nNo. 75”) on October 21, 2005. To further clarify the implementation of Circular 75, on May 31, 2007, SAFE issued a supplementary official notice known as\nHui ZhongFa [2007] No. 106 (“Circular 106”). Circular 75 and Circular 106 require the owners of any Chinese company to obtain SAFE’s approval before\nestablishing any offshore holding company structure for foreign financing as well as subsequent acquisition matters in China. Accordingly, the owners of HJ\nGroup submitted their applications to SAFE on July 25, 2008. On August 16, 2008, SAFE approved the applications, permitting these Chinese nationals to\nestablish Renovation as an offshore, special purpose vehicle which was permitted to have foreign ownership and participate in foreign capital raising activities.\nAfter SAFE’s approval, the owners of HJ Group became holders of one hundred percent (100%) of Renovation’s issued and outstanding capital stock on\nSeptember 2, 2008. See “ Relevant PRC Regulations - SAFE Registration ” below.\nJiuxin Management\nZhejiang Jiuxin Investment Management Co., Ltd. (“Jiuxin Management”) was organized in the PRC on October 14, 2008. Since all of its issued and\noutstanding capital stock is held by Renovation, a Hong Kong company, Jiuxin Management is deemed a “wholly foreign owned enterprise” (“WFOE”) under\napplicable PRC laws.\nJiutong Medical\nHangzhou Jiutong Medical Technology Co., Ltd. (“Jiutong Medical”) was organized in the PRC on December 20, 2011. Like Jiuxin Management,\nJiutong Medical is also deemed a WFOE because it is wholly owned by Renovation. In November 2013, Jiutong Medical acquired the right to use of a piece of\nland, for which we intended to establish a herb processing plant. However, as our herb business has not grown, we have not started constructing the plant as of\nMarch 31, 2019. In the future, we may use the land for other purpose such as the construction of a warehouse.\nShouantang Technology\nShouantang Technology was organized in the PRC on July 16, 2010. Like Jiuxin Management and Jiutong Medical, it is also deemed a WFOE because\nit is wholly owned by Renovation.\nIn November 2010, Shouantang Technology acquired one hundred percent (100%) of Quannuo Technology and its wholly-owned subsidiary,\nHangzhou Quannuo Grand Pharmacy Co., Ltd. (“Hangzhou Quannuo”), pursuant to an equity ownership transfer agreement. Quannuo Technology was\norganized in the PRC on July 7, 2009, and Hangzhou Quannuo was established on July 8, 2010. Hangzhou Quannuo has terminated its State Administration of\nIndustry and Commerce (“SAIC”) license in April 2015 and currently has no operations.\n2\nIn November 2015, we sold all of the equity interests of Quannuo Technology to six individuals for approximately $17,121 (RMB107,074). Quannuo\nTechnology previously provided technical support to our online pharmacy and incurred accumulated losses over the last five years of its operations. After the\nsale, its technical support function has been transferred back to Jiuzhou Pharmacy, which hosts our online pharmacy.\nQianhong Agriculture\nQianhong Agriculture was organized in the PRC on August 10, 2010 for our herb farming business. We planted ginkgo, also known as maidenhair,\ntrees during the year ended March 31, 2013. A ginkgo tree may have a growth period of up to twenty years before it is mature enough for harvest. Usually, the\nlonger it grows the more valuable it becomes. As of March 31, 2019, we have not harvested or sold any herbs.\nShouantang Bio\nOn October 11, 2014, the Company, through Jiuzhou Pharmacy, formed Shouantang Bio-technology Co., Ltd. (“Shouantang Bio”) by contributing\n$0.16 million (RMB1 million) as its registered capital. Shouantang Bio was formed to sell nutritional supplements under its own brand name, Shouantang.\nJiuyi Technology\nOn September 10, 2015, Renovation set up an entity named Hangzhou Jiuyi Medical Technology Co. Ltd, (“Jiuyi Technology”) with registered capital\nof $5 million, which was originally intended to provide additional technical support such as webpage development to our online pharmacy business. Later on, we\ndecided to move online technical supports back to Jiuzhou Pharmacy, so Jiuyi Technology had no significant online technical operations. Jiuyi Technology is\nlocated in Hangzhou, China.\nLin’an Jiuzhou\nOn March 31, 2017, the Company, through Jiuxin Management, formed Lin’an Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy Co. Ltd, (“Lin’an Jiuzhou”) with registered\ncapital of $725,570 (RMB 5 million), to expand our retail pharmacies in Lin’an City.\nLinjia Medical\nOn September 27, 2017, the Company, through Jiuzhou Pharmacy, formed and held 51% of Zhejiang Jiuzhou Linjia Medical Investment and\nManagement Co. Ltd. with registered capital of $2,979,460 (RMB20 million), to expand our clinics network adjacent to our drugstores. After extensive market\nresearch, Linjia Medical started operation of its clinics in late calendar year 2018.\nAyi Health\nOn March 29, 2019, the Company, through Jiuzhou Pharmacy, formed and currently holds 51% of the equity of Zhejiang AyiGe Medical Health\nManagement Co., Ltd.(“Ayi Health”), which is intended to provide technical support such as IT and customer support to our health management business in\nthe future.\nHJ Group\nJiuzhou Pharmacy is a PRC limited liability company established on September 9, 2003 by Mr. Lei Liu (55%), Mr. Chong’an Jin (23%) and Ms. Li Qi\n(22%). Hangzhou Kuaileren Grand Pharmacy Co., Ltd. (“Kuaileren”), originally a subsidiary of Jiuzhou Pharmacy, was dissolved on April 9, 2011. Prior to its\ndissolution, Kuaileren operated a “Kuaileren Grand Pharmacy” store, which is now a “Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy” store. On July 1, 2014, Mr. Chong’an Jin\ntransferred all of the equity interests he held in Jiuzhou Pharmacy to Mr. Lei Liu and Ms. Li Qi. As a result of this transfer, Mr. Lei Liu held 61% and Ms. Li\nQi held 39% equity interests of Jiuzhou Pharmacy. On August 21, 2017, after Mr. Lei Liu transferred certain shares to Ms. Li Qi, Mr. Lei Liu held 56.7% and\nMs. Li Qi held 43.3%. On April 25, 2018, Mr. Wei Chen, who is associated with CareRetail Holdings Limited, agreed to invest RMB200,000 and hold 1% of\nJiuzhou Pharmacy. As a result, Mr. Lei Liu held 56.13% and Ms. Li Qi has held 42.87% equity interests of Jiuzhou Pharmacy. Mr. Lei Liu and Ms. Li Qi are\nfrom time to time referred to in this report as Key Personnel.\nJiuzhou Pharmacy currently has one subsidiary, Jiuxin Medicine, which was organized in the PRC on December 31, 2003. In April 2011, Jiuzhou\nPharmacy entered into an equity ownership transfer agreement with the owners of Jiuxin Medicine, and its business license was transferred to Jiuzhou\nPharmacy, although no consideration was paid. On August 25, 2011, the acquisition of Jiuxin Medicine was completed for $4.7 million (RMB 30 million.)\nJiuzhou Clinic is a PRC general partnership established on October 10, 2003 by Mr. Liu (39%), Mr. Jin (31%) and Ms. Qi (30%). Jiuzhou Clinic is a\nmedical practice currently operating adjacent to the “Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy” store in Daguan, providing primary, urgent, minor surgical, and traditional\nmedical care services. Additionally, Jiuzhou Clinic’s physicians consult with and examine patients at other “Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy” stores.\nJiuzhou Service is a PRC limited liability company established on November 2, 2005 by Mr. Liu (39%), Mr. Jin (31%) and Ms. Qi (30%). Jiuzhou\nService is licensed as a healthcare management company and currently manages the medical clinic operating adjacent to the “Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy” stores\nin Wenhua and Xiasha, providing services similar to those at the Daguan clinic. In November 30, 2017, Mr. Jin transferred his shares to Mr. Liu and Ms. Qi.\nAfter the transfer, Mr. Liu owns 56.7% and Ms. Qi owns 43.3% of the Jiuzhou Service.\nWe control HJ Group through contractual arrangements. See “Contractual Arrangements with HJ Group and the Key Personnel” below.\n3\nContractual Arrangements with HJ Group and the Key Personnel\nOur relationships with HJ Group and the Key Personnel are governed by a series of contractual arrangements that they have entered into with Jiuxin\nManagement.\nPRC regulations on foreign investment currently permit foreign companies to establish or invest in WFOEs or joint ventures that engage in wholesale\nor retail sales of pharmaceuticals in China. For retail sales, however, these regulations restrict the number and size of pharmacies that a foreign investor may\nown. If a chain operates more than thirty (30) stores and sells branded pharmaceutical products from different suppliers, a foreign investor may own only up to\nforty nine percent (49%) of such chain. The contractual arrangements with Jiuzhou Pharmacy render such restrictions inapplicable to us, since neither we nor\nour subsidiaries own equity interests in Jiuzhou Pharmacy, while at the same time we retain control of its drugstore chain by virtue of the contractual\narrangements.\nSimilarly, PRC regulations place certain restrictions on foreign ownership of medical practices. Foreign investors can only acquire ownership interests\nthrough a Sino-foreign joint venture and not through a WFOE. Since we do not have actual equity interests in Jiuzhou Clinic or Jiuzhou Service, and instead\ncontrol these entities through contractual arrangements, such regulations do not apply to us or our structure.\nUnder PRC laws, Jiuxin Management, Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Service and Jiuzhou Clinic are each independent business entities not exposed or\nsubject to the liabilities incurred by any of the other three (3) entities. The contractual arrangements constitute valid and binding obligations of the parties to\nsuch agreements. Each of the contractual arrangements, and the rights and obligations of the parties thereto, are enforceable and valid in accordance with the\nlaws of the PRC. These contractual arrangements, as amended and in effect, include the following:\nConsulting Services Agreements.

Additionally, Jiuxin\nManagement owns the intellectual property rights developed or discovered through research and development, in the course of providing the Services, or\nderived from the provision of the Services. Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Service and Jiuzhou Clinic must each pay a quarterly consulting services fee in RMB to\nJiuxin Management that is equal to its profits for such quarter. This agreement is in effect until and unless terminated by written notice of a party to the\nagreement in the event that: (a) a party becomes bankrupt, insolvent, is the subject of proceedings or arrangements for liquidation or dissolution, ceases to carry\non business, or becomes unable to pay its debts as they become due; (b) Jiuxin Management terminates its operations; or (c) circumstances arise which would\nmaterially and adversely affect the performance or the objectives of the agreement. Jiuxin Management may also terminate the agreement with any of Jiuzhou\nPharmacy, Jiuzhou Service or Jiuzhou Clinic if one of them breaches the terms of the agreement, or without cause.\nOperating Agreements.

They must also abide by corporate policies set by Jiuxin Management with respect to their\ndaily operations, financial management and employment issues. The term of this agreement is from August 1, 2009 until the maximum period of time permitted\nby law. Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Service and Jiuzhou Clinic cannot terminate this agreement.\nEquity Pledge Agreements. Pursuant to certain equity pledge agreements (the “Equity Pledge Agreement”), the Key Personnel have pledged all of\ntheir equity interests in Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Service and Jiuzhou Clinic to Jiuxin Management in order to guarantee these companies’ performance of\ntheir respective obligations under the Consulting Services Agreement. If these companies or the Key Personnel breach their respective contractual obligations,\nJiuxin Management, as pledgee, will be entitled to certain rights, including the right to sell the pledged equity interests. The Key Personnel have also agreed that\nupon occurrence of any event of default, Jiuxin Management shall be granted an exclusive, irrevocable power of attorney to take actions in the place and stead\nof the Key Personnel to carry out the security provisions of this agreement, and to take any action and execute any instrument that Jiuxin Management may\ndeem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this agreement. The Key Personnel agree not to dispose of the pledged equity interests or take any\nactions that would prejudice Jiuxin Management’s interests.

The proxy agreement may be terminated by mutual consent of the parties or upon thirty (30) days’ written notice from\nJiuxin Management.\nOther than as pursuant to the foregoing contractual arrangements, Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Service and Jiuzhou Clinic cannot transfer any funds\ngenerated from their respective operations. The contractual arrangements were originally entered into on August 1, 2009, and amended on October 27, 2009.\nOur Current Corporate Structure\nThe following diagram illustrates our current corporate structure as of June 10, 2019:\n5\nThe table below summarizes the status of the registered capital of our PRC subsidiaries and controlled companies as of the date of this report:\nDue Date for\nEntity Registered Registered Unpaid Registered\nEntity Name Type Capital Capital Paid Capital\nJiutong Medical Subsidiary USD 2,600,000 USD 2,600,000 N/A\nJiuzhou Clinic VIE N/A N/A N/A\nJiuzhou Pharmacy VIE USD 733,500 USD 733,500 N/A\nJiuzhou Service VIE USD 73,350 USD 73,350 N/A\nJiuxin Management Subsidiary USD 14,500,000 USD 14,500,000 N/A\nJiuxin Medicine VIE USD 1,564,000 USD 1,564,000 N/A\nQianhong Agriculture Subsidiary USD 1,497,000 USD 1,497,000 N/A\nShouantang Technology Subsidiary USD 11,000,000 USD 11,000,000 N/A\nShouantang Bio Subsidiary USD 162,900 USD 162,900 N/A\nJiuyi Technology Subsidiary USD 5,000,000 USD 2,500,000 September 25, 2026\nLin’an Jiuzhou Subsidiary USD 725,570 USD 72,557 March 31, 2027\nJiuben Pharmacy VIE USD 15,920 USD 15,920 N/A\nJiumu Pharmacy VIE USD 15,920 USD 15,920 N/A\nJiuheng Pharmacy VIE USD 15,920 USD 15,920 N/A\nJiujiu Pharmacy VIE USD 15,920 USD 15,920 N/A\nJiuli Pharmacy VIE USD 15,920 USD 15,920 N/A\nJiurui Pharmacy VIE USD 15,920 USD 15,920 N/A\nJiuxiang Pharmacy VIE USD 15,920 USD 15,920 N/A\nJiuyi Pharmacy VIE USD 15,920 USD 15,920 N/A\nLinjia Medical VIE USD 2,979,460 USD 1,489,730 N/A\nAyi Health VIE USD1,489,730 None N/A\nOur Business\nPharmacies\nWe currently have one hundred and twenty-one (121) pharmacies throughout Hangzhou, the provincial capital of Zhejiang and neighborhood cities.\nPharmacy sales accounted for approximately 89.2% of our retail revenue, and 67.3% of our total revenue, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. We offer\nprimarily third-party products at our pharmacies, including:\n● Approximately 1,376 prescription drugs (252 of which require a physician’s prescription and the remainder requiring customer personal\ninformation registration only), sales of which accounted for approximately 32.5% of our retail revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019;\n● Approximately 1,769 OTC drugs, sales of which accounted for approximately 43.4% of our retail revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31,\n2019;\n● Approximately 613 nutritional supplements, including a variety of healthcare supplements, vitamin, mineral and dietary products, sales of which\naccounted for approximately 8.8% of our retail revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019;\n● TCM, including drinkable herbal remedies and pre-packaged herbal mixtures for making soup, sales of which accounted for approximately 9.0%\nof our retail revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019;\n● Sundry products (i.e., personal care products such as skin care, hair care and beauty products, convenience products such as soft drinks,\npackaged snacks, and other consumable, cleaning agents, stationeries, and seasonal and promotional items tailored to local consumer demand for\nconvenience and quality), sales of which accounted for approximately 1.3% of our retail revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019; and\n● Medical devices (i.e., family planning and birth control products, early pregnancy test products, portable electronic diagnostic apparatus,\nrehabilitation equipment, and surgical tools such as hemostats, needle forceps and surgical scissors), sales of which accounted for approximately\n5.0% of our retail revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31,2019.\n6\nWe favor retail locations in well-established residential communities with relatively concentrated consumer purchasing power or are located in close\nproximity to local hospitals, and evaluate potential store sites to assess consumer traffic, visibility and convenience. Depending on its size, each drugstore has\nbetween two (2) to eight (8) pharmacists on staff, all of whom are properly licensed. We only accept prescriptions from licensed health care providers, and\nverify the validity, accuracy, and completeness of all prescriptions. We also ask all prescription customers to disclose their drug allergies, current medical\nconditions, and current medications. Most pharmacies also maintain a TCM counter staffed by licensed herbalists.\nAfter opening, a location without SHI coverage may take up to one year to achieve our projected revenue goals for that particular location. Various\nfactors influence individual store revenue including, but not limited to: location, nearby competition, local population demographics, square footage, and\ngovernment insurance coverage.\nAll of our one hundred and twenty-one (121) of our drugstores are located in Hangzhou city and its adjacent town Lin’an.\nTo enhance our customers’ experience, we have licensed physicians available at several of our “Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy” locations for consultation,\nexamination and treatment of common ailments at scheduled hours. In addition, our Daguan, Wenhua and Xiasha stores have adjoining medical clinics that\nprovide urgent care (for conditions such as sprains, minor lacerations, and dizziness), TCM treatments (including acupuncture, therapeutic massage,\nmoxibustion, and cupping), and minor outpatient surgical treatments (such as suturing).\nTo ensure quality and personal attention for patients, we employ only licensed doctors and certified nurses and technicians. Patient treatment at our\nthree (3) Jiuzhou Clinics and Jiuzhou Service, and all Linjia Clinics follow nationally established clinical practice guidelines from China’s Ministry of Health. We\ncurrently have fifty-six (56) physicians and sixty-seven (67) clinic staff. In-store consultations and examinations by our physicians are provided free-of-charge\nto ensure that customers are being prescribed and taking the appropriate medication for their ailments, and to afford customers convenience.\nWe view our medical services as more consumer-driven than other health care specialties, because consumers requiring the types of medical services\nthat we provide often seek treatment on their own accord. We have developed our medical services to respond to the public need for convenient access to\nmedical consultations and/or care and the significant savings that we can provide as compared to a more traditional medical setting such as a hospital. Many of\nour patients often need immediate access to medical services, do not have a regular physician, or may lack suitable alternatives. Patient flow is derived from\nthe physical presence of our drugstores, not from pre-existing doctor-patient relationships or referrals from other healthcare providers.\nWe generate limited revenue directly from our clinics. However, our clinic brings patients into our stores, where they then purchase medical products.\nOnline Sales\nSince May 2010, we have been retailing OTC drugs and nutritional supplements on the Internet atw ww.dada360.com. Before November 2015, our\nsubsidiary Quannuo Technology operated and maintained the website pursuant to the Internet Pharmaceutical Transaction Service Qualification Certificate\nissued by the State Food and Drug Administration (the “SFDA”) of Zhejiang Province, which allows us to engage in online retail pharmaceutical sales\nthroughout China. As we sold all our equity interests in Quannuo Technology in November 2015, we have transferred our online pharmacy operation function\nto Jiuzhou Pharmacy. We have established payment methods with banks and online intermediaries such as Alipay, and are cooperating with business-to-\nconsumer online vendors such as Taobao. By using Taobao’s platform in addition to our own website as mentioned above, we can be exposed to a wider range\nof customers.\nOnline sales accounted for approximately 10.8% of our retail revenue, and 8.1% of our total revenue, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Online\nsales accounted for approximately 16.4% of our retail revenue, and 12.6% of our total revenue, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.\nWholesale\nSince acquiring Jiuxin Medicine in August 2011, we have been distributing third-party products primarily to drug distributors throughout China,\nincluding:\n● Approximately 1,154 prescription drugs, the sales of which accounted for approximately 63.4% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year\nended March 31, 2019 as compared to approximately 343 prescription drugs, the sales of which accounted for approximately 56.0% of our\nwholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018;\n● Approximately 1,282 OTC drugs, the sales of which accounted for approximately 33.9% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended\nMarch 31, 2019 as compared to approximately 253 OTC drugs, the sales of which accounted for approximately 42.6% of our wholesale revenue\nfor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018;\n7\n● Approximately 307 nutritional supplements, the sales of which accounted for approximately 1.1% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year\nended March 31, 2018 as compared to approximately 31 nutritional supplements, the sales of which accounted for approximately 0.8% of our\nwholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018;\n● TCM products, the sales of which accounted for approximately 1.0% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, as\ncompared to TCM products, the sales of which accounted for approximately 0.3% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31,\n2018;\n● Sundry products, the sales of which accounted for approximately 0.1% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 as\ncompared to Sundry products, the sales of which accounted for approximately 0.2% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March\n31, 2018; and\n● Medical devices, the sales of which accounted for approximately 0.5% and 0.0%, of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31,\n2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWholesale revenue increased primarily as a result of our ability to resell certain products, which our retail stores made large orders on, to other\nvendors. As our retail drugstores achieved large quantity sales of certain brand name merchandise, we were able to negotiate for lower purchase prices than\nthe market level on such merchandise. As a result, certain vendors who were unable to obtain better prices than ours, will turn to us for such merchandise,\nleading the wholesale volume to grow. On the other side, we have been trying to act as a local agent for well-known health products in Zhejiang Province. For\nexample, we signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Dong’a Gelatin (DEEJ) and act as its local sale agent in Zhejiang Province. Until we can establish\na new customer base and secure the status to serve as provincial or national exclusive sale agent for certain popular drugs, we do not expect our wholesale\nbusiness to increase significantly in the immediate future.\nHerb Farming\nFrom 2010 to the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we had been cultivating and harvested ten (10) types of herbs, such as fructusrubi (used in TCM to\npromote blood circulation), white atractylodes rhizome (used in TCM to treat physical and mental fatigue), atractylodesmacrocephala (used in TCM to control\nsweating), ginkgo seeds (used in TCM to treat asthma), and ginkgo trees used for TCM on approximately forty eight (48) acres of leased land in Lin’an,\napproximately thirty (30) miles from Hangzhou.\nWe planted ginkgo trees during the year ended March 31, 2013. A ginkgo tree may have a growth period of up to twenty years before it is mature\nenough to harvest. Typically, the longer the plant grows, the more valuable it becomes. We plan to continue cultivating the trees in order to maximize their\nmarket value in the future. We may continue growing trees and cultivating other herbs in the future.\nHerb farming revenue accounted for no revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.\nOur Customers\nRetail Customers\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, our pharmacies collectively served an average of 13,645 customers per day. We periodically conduct\nqualitative customer surveys to help us build a stronger understanding of our market position and our customers’ purchasing habits.\nPharmacy customers pay by cash, debit or credit cards, mobile devices or medical insurance cards under Hangzhou and Zhejiang’s medical insurance\nprograms. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, approximately 10% of our pharmacy revenue came from cash sales, 57% from Hangzhou’s medical\ninsurance cards (where most of our pharmacies are located), and 33% from debit and credit cards, Zhejiang’s medical insurance cards, Alipay and other\ncharge cards.\n8\nWe maintain strict cash control procedures at our pharmacies. Our integrated information management system records the details of each sale, which\nwe control from our headquarters. Depending on each location’s sales activities, cash may be deposited daily or several times per week in designated bank\naccounts.\nFor sales made to eligible participants in the national medical insurance program, we generally obtain payments from the relevant government social\nsecurity bureaus on a monthly basis. See “Relevant PRC Regulations - Reimbursement under the National Medical Insurance Program”. According to\nrelevant regulations, a drugstore usually needs to operate for at least one (1) year before it can apply to be licensed to accept Hangzhou’s medical insurance\ncards. As of the date of this report, eighty-nine (89) of our one hundred and twenty-one (121) “Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy” stores are licensed to accept medical\ninsurance cards. Those of our stores that accept medical insurance cards are designated as such by clear signage on their storefront windows.\nOnline Sales Customers\nOur online customers consist primarily of consumers between the ages of 20 and 40. While our website is accessible throughout China, approximately\nthirty percent (30%) of our online sales during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, were from Zhejiang and neighboring Jiangsu and Shanghai.\nWholesale Customers\nOur wholesale customers are primarily third-party trading companies that purchase from us to resell to pharmacies throughout China. We also supply\nsome hospitals and pharmacies, although they collectively make up less than 10.0% of our wholesale customers currently.\nHerb Farming Customers\nOur farming customers primarily include local herb vendors. For the fiscal year ended March, 31, 2019, we have not harvested or sold any herbs.\nMarketing and Promotion\nOur marketing and promotion efforts are focused on our retail segment, specifically, our pharmacies, and our strategy is to build brand recognition,\nincrease customer flow, build strong customer loyalty, maximize repetitive customer visits, and develop incremental revenue opportunities.\nOur marketing department designs chain-wide marketing efforts while each store designs local promotions based on local demographics and market\nconditions. We also launch single store promotional campaigns and community activities in connection with the opening of new stores. Our store managers and\nstaff are also encouraged to propose their own advertising and promotional plans, including holiday promotions, posters and billboards. In addition, we offer\nspecial discounts and gift promotions for selected merchandise periodically in conjunction with our suppliers’ marketing programs. We also provide ancillary\nservices such as providing free blood pressure readings in our stores.\nMany of our promotional programs are designed to encourage manufacturers to invest resources to market their brands within our stores. We charge\nmanufacturers promotional fees in exchange for the right to promote and display their products in our stores during promotional periods. We also allow\nmanufacturers and distributors to station salespeople in our stores to promote their products, for which we receive a fee. Since manufacturers provide\npurchasing incentives and information to help customers make informed purchase decisions, we believe that manufacturer-led promotions improve our\ncustomers’ shopping experience. We work to maintain strong inventory positions for merchandise featured in our promotions, as we believe this increases the\neffectiveness of our spending on promotional activities.\nWe regularly run advertisements in selected newspapers to promote our brands and the products carried in our stores. Under our agreements with\ncertain newspapers, we run one-page weekly and monthly advertisements, as applicable, and the newspapers publish healthcare-related feature articles relating\nto our advertised products on or around the dates of our advertisements. We also promote our brands and products using billboards and radio and television\ncommercials. Depending on our agreement with a particular manufacturer, advertising expenses are borne either by us, the manufacturer of the products being\nadvertised, or are shared as a joint expense. Our advertisements are designed to promote our brands, our corporate image and the prices of products available\nfor sale in our stores.\nAs part of our marketing campaign, we offer rewards cards to customers, which provide certain exclusive discounts. After a customer signs up for\nthe rewards card, we communicate via the customer’s preferred method: e-mail, traditional mail or text messages. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019,\napproximately 63.9% of our customers used their rewards cards to make purchases. We intend to further extend this program to enhance the customer\nexperience and for customer retention. For every 10 Yuan spent at our stores, we award 1 membership point. Every 20 points can be exchanged for a 1 Yuan\ncoupon, redeemable towards merchandise purchased at our stores. The reward points never expire, but cannot be applied towards products reimbursed by the\nlocal SIC agent. As a result, we recorded unused membership points as accrued expense.\n9\nOur clinic staff also regularly offers free seminars and outreach programs covering various health issues that are topical to the communities where our\nstores are located. Such events are designed not only to raise public health awareness, but to reach potential customers for our drugstores.\nTo promote our online business, we are cooperating with Taobao, the largest online vendor in China, to help raise awareness among potential\ncustomers. Taobao lists our products on its platform, which then directs consumers back to our website to make their purchases.\nLogistics\nBefore March 31, 2018, we used Jiuxin Medicine’s resources to support our logistics needs in Hangzhou. Beginning March 31, 2018, we outsourced\nour logistics service to Astro Boy Cloud Pan (Hangzhou) Storage and Logistic Co. Ltd (“Astro Boy Logistic”). As a result, Jiuxin Medicine’s warehouse lease\nhas been terminated. Astro Boy Logistic provides us with approximately 14,000 square meters facility located approximately eighteen (18) miles from our\nheadquarters, which served as our central distribution center. Astro Boy Logistics’ staff and vehicles make regular deliveries to our pharmacies and wholesale\ncustomers. Jiuxin Medicine, however, continues to negotiate with various suppliers and make orders.\nWe employ third-party logistics companies for deliveries to wholesale customers outside Hangzhou. We believe that reliable logistics providers are\nreadily available and can be replaced without any material interruptions to our business.\nSuppliers\nWe currently source retail products from approximately 120 suppliers, including trading companies and direct manufacturers. We source wholesale\nproducts from approximately 380 suppliers, including many of those that provide our retail products. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, one supplier,\nHuaDong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. accounted for more than twenty-two percent (22.0%) and twenty-two percent (22.7%) of our total purchases and total\npurchase deposits. The suppliers are neither related to nor affiliated with us. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, one supplier, HuaDong Pharmaceutical\nCo., Ltd. accounted for more than nineteen percent (19.0%) and thirteen percent (13.1%) of our total purchases and total purchase deposits. The suppliers are\nneither related to nor affiliated with us.\nWe believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we require for our retail and wholesale businesses. As\nsuch, we believe that we can change suppliers without any material interruption to our business. To date, we have not experienced any significant difficulty in\nsourcing our suppliers.\nQuality Control\nWe strongly emphasize quality control, which starts with procurement. In addition to their market acceptance and costs, we select products based on\nGood Manufacturing Practice and Good Supply Practice (“GSP”) compliance status of their suppliers. We also assess product quality based on the\nmanufacturer’s facilities and capabilities, including technology, packaging and logistics. We conduct random quality inspections of each batch of products we\nprocure, and replace any supplier who fails to pass such inspections.\nWe also enforce strict quality control measures at our distribution center. All products are screened upon their arrival, and those with evidence of\ndefects or damages are immediately rejected. Products that pass the screening process are recorded and stored strictly according to each manufacturer’s\ntemperature and other requirements. Products (for both our pharmacies and wholesale customers) are verified against the appropriate delivery orders prior to\nleaving the facility. We use vehicles with cold-temperature storage to make deliveries as necessary.\nAll of our pharmacy employees participate in a mandatory thirty-six (36) hour training program regarding quality control annually, and we regularly\ndispatch quality inspectors to our stores to monitor the service quality of our staff.\nCompetition\nThe drugstore industry in China is intensely competitive, rapidly evolving and highly fragmented. We compete on the basis of store location,\nmerchandise selection, prices and brand recognition. Many of our competitors include large, national drugstore chains that may have more financial resources,\nstronger brand strength, and management expertise than us, including China Nepstar Chain Drugstore Ltd., LBX Pharmacy, and TianTianHao Grand\nPharmacy. Other competitors include local and independent drugstores and government-operated pharmacies, as well as discount stores, convenience stores,\nand supermarkets with respect to sundry and other non-medicinal products that we carry.\nThe wholesale pharmaceutical distribution industry in China is likewise competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with regional distributors, such\nas Zhengchen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Hangzhou Xiaoran Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., as well as national operators such as Fengwoda Pharmaceutical Co.,\nLtd. and Jiuzhoutong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. These competitors have substantially greater logistics capacities and more financial resources, as well as more\nindustry-relevant experience, than us.\n10\nThe online pharmacy is an emerging business in China. We are competing with other online vendors that may be supported by major drugstore chains\nor initiated by smaller local drugstore chains. In order to compete effectively, we are cooperating with Taobao, the largest online vendor in China. We also\ninvest significant resources in selecting products we believe are most suitable for online sales, such as those we have the exclusive right to sell. We have\ninvested significant resources identifying popular products that we believe can drive sales, while simultaneously controlling costs. In fiscal 2019, we have\ncontinued working with large insurance companies in China such as the People’s Insurance Company (Group) of China Limited, which sells online products to\ntheir enrolled insurance customers. Commercial health insurance has expanded rapidly in recent years in China, especially after the government began\nrestricting its Social Health Insurance (“SHI”) budget. We expect the close cooperation with commercial insurance companies and active strategy on e-\ncommerce platforms will drive up our online sales.\nChina’s herb market is highly specialized. We have not incurred any herb sales in fiscal 2019.\nIntellectual Property\nWe currently have the following trademarks registered with the Trademark Office of the SAIC:\n● “Jiuzhou Tongxin” is a Classes 5 and 35 trademark (for pharmaceuticals and advertisement) issued on February 14, 2011 and March 7, 2013\nrespectively, registered under Jiuzhou Pharmacy, which we plan to use to brand certain products that we may sell in our stores;\n● “Jiuzhou” is a Classes 5, 35 and 44 trademark (for medical services) issued in April and May 2012, registered under Jiuzhou Pharmacy, which we\nplan to use to brand our medical services;\n● “Shouantang” a Classes 5, 10, 30, 35 and 44 trademark (for pharmaceuticals, construction, food, advertisement and medical services) issued on\nOctober 2011, and a Classes 3、42、6、19、20、24、31、26、32 and 29 (for oil, diary and others) trademark issued in August and October 2015,\nregistered under Jiuzhou Pharmacy, which we are using to brand certain products that we sell in our stores; and\n● “Jinyuliangyan” is a Class 29 trademark (for food and oil) issued in June 2011, registered under Jiuzhou Pharmacy, which we are using to brand\ncertain products that we sell in our stores; and\n● “Jiuying” is a Classes 5, 35 and 44 trademark (for healthcare and nutritional supplement) issued in December 2012 and February 2013, registered\nunder Jiuzhou Service, which we are using to brand our service and products that we sell in our clinics.\nWe own and operate the following websites: www.dada360.com (for online sales), www.jiuzhou-drugstore.com (our corporate website used in\nChina), and www.jiuzhou360.com (our English-language corporate website). We also own two (2) inactive domain names. We do not own any patents, nor do\nwe have any pending patent applications, and we are not a beneficiary of any licenses, franchises, concessions or royalty agreements.\nAll of our employees are required to enter into written employment agreements with us, pursuant to which they are subject to confidentiality\nobligations.\nEmployees\nAs of March 31, 2019, we had 1,079 employees combined in our retail and wholesale operations, consisting of 1,019 full-time and 60 part-time\nemployees. The number of employees for each area of operations, and such employees as a percentage of our total workforce, are as follows:\nAs of\nMarch 31, 2019\nEmployees Percentage\nNon-pharmacist store staff 518 48.0%\nPharmacists 292 27.1%\nManagement - non-pharmacists 69 6.4%\nPhysicians 56 5.2%\nNon-physician clinic staff 67 6.2%\nWholesale - non-warehouse 36 3.3%\nWholesale - warehouse 0 0.0%\nOnline pharmacy - technicians 8 0.7%\nOnline pharmacy - non-technicians 33 3.1%\nTotal 1,079 100.00%\n11\nWe strongly emphasize the quality of our employees at all levels, including in-store pharmacists and store staff who directly interact with our\ncustomers. We provide extensive training for newly recruited employees in the first three (3) months of their employment. The training is designed to\nencompass a number of areas, such as knowledge of our products and effective customer service. In addition, we regularly carry out training programs on\nmedicinal information, nutritional information, and selling skills for our store staff and in-store pharmacists. We believe these programs have played an important\nrole in strengthening the capabilities of our employees.\nVarious drug manufacturers also pay us to have their representatives in our drugstores, and accordingly, we train them under our store policies and\nprocedures.\nRelevant PRC Regulations\nSAFE Registration\nIn October 2005, SAFE issued Circular 75. Circular 75 regulates foreign exchange matters in relation to the use of a special purpose vehicle by PRC\nresidents to seek offshore equity financing and conduct “round trip investment” in China. The Key Personnel, who are PRC residents, are in compliance with\nCircular 75 and its implementing circulars.\nDividend Distribution\nUnder current applicable laws and regulations, each of our consolidated PRC entities, including WFOEs and domestic companies, may pay dividends\nonly out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of our consolidated\nPRC entities is required to deposit at least ten percent (10%) of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year into its statutory surplus\nreserve fund until the accumulative amount of such reserve reaches fifty percent (50%) of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash\ndividends. As of March 31, 2019 the accumulated balance of our statutory reserve funds reserves amounted to $1.31 million, and the accumulated losses of our\nconsolidated PRC entities amounted to $15.04 million.\nTaxation\nThe current PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (the “EIT Law”), and the implementation regulations for the EIT Law issued by China’s State Council,\nbecame effective as of January 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law, enterprises are classified as either resident or non-resident enterprises. An enterprise established\noutside of China with its “de facto management bodies” located within China is considered a “resident enterprise,” meaning that it can be treated in a manner\nsimilar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the EIT Law defines a “de facto management body” as a\nmanaging body that in practice exercises “substantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and\nproperties” of the enterprise; however, it remains unclear whether the PRC tax authorities would deem our managing body as being located within China. Due\nto the relatively short history of the EIT Law and lack of applicable legal precedents, the PRC tax authorities determine the PRC tax resident treatment of\nentities organized under the laws of foreign jurisdictions on a case-by-case basis.\nIf the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of PRC tax consequences\ncould follow. First, we may be subject to enterprise income tax at a rate of twenty five percent (25%) on our respective worldwide taxable income, as well as\nPRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. Second, although the EIT Law provides that “dividends, bonuses and other equity investment proceeds\nbetween qualified resident enterprises” is exempted income, and the implementing rules of the EIT Law refer to “dividends, bonuses and other equity\ninvestment proceeds between qualified resident enterprises” as the investment proceeds obtained by a resident enterprise from its direct investment in another\nresident enterprise, it is still unclear whether the dividends we receive from Jiuxin Management would be classified as “dividends between qualified resident\nenterprises” and therefore qualify for tax exemption.\nIf we are treated as a non-resident enterprise under the EIT Law, any dividends that we receive from Jiuxin Management (assuming such dividends\nare deemed to be sourced from within the PRC) (i) may be subject to a five percent (5%) PRC withholding tax, provided that we own more than twenty five\npercent (25%) of the registered capital of Jiuxin Management incessantly within twelve (12) months immediately prior to obtaining such dividends from Jiuxin\nManagement, and if the Arrangement between the Mainland of China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double\nTaxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the “Arrangement”) is applicable, or (ii) if the Arrangement does not\napply (i.e. the PRC tax authorities may deem us to be a conduit not entitled to treaty benefits), may be subject to a ten percent (10%) PRC withholding tax.\nSimilarly, if we are treated as a non-resident enterprise, and Renovation is treated as a resident enterprise, then any dividends that we receive from Renovation\n(assuming such dividends were considered sourced within the PRC) may be subject to a ten percent (10%) PRC withholding tax. Any such taxes on dividends\ncould materially reduce the amount of dividends, if any, that we could pay to our shareholders.\n12\nFinally, the new “resident enterprise” classification could result in a situation in which a ten percent (10%) PRC tax is imposed on dividends we pay to\nour investors that are non-resident enterprises so long as such non-resident enterprise investors do not have an establishment or place of business in China or,\ndespite the existence of such establishment of place of business in China, the relevant income is not effectively connected with such establishment or place of\nbusiness in China, to the extent that such dividends have their sources within the PRC. Similarly, any gain realized on the transfer of our shares by such\ninvestors is also subject to a ten percent (10%) PRC income tax if such gain is regarded as income derived from sources within China. In such event, we may\nbe required to withhold a ten percent (10%) PRC tax on any dividends paid to our investors that are non-resident enterprises. Our investors that are non-\nresident enterprises also may be responsible for paying PRC tax at a rate of ten percent (10%) on any gain realized from the sale or transfer of our common\nshares in certain circumstances. We would not, however, have an obligation to withhold PRC tax with respect to such gain.\nMoreover, the State Administration of Taxation issued the Notice on Strengthening the Administration of Enterprise Income Tax on Share\nTransfer Income of Non-Resident Enterprises No. 698 (“Circular 698”) on December 10, 2009, which reinforces taxation on transfer of non-listed shares by\nnon-resident enterprises through overseas holding vehicles. Circular 698 applies retroactively and was deemed to be effective as of January 2008. Pursuant to\nCircular 698, where (i) a foreign investor who indirectly holds equity interest in a PRC resident enterprise through an offshore holding company indirectly\ntransfers equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise by selling the shares of the offshore holding company, and (ii) the offshore holding company is located in\na jurisdiction where the effective tax rate is lower than twelve and a half percent (12.5%) or where the offshore income of its residents is not taxable, the\nforeign investor is required to provide the tax authority in charge of that PRC resident enterprise with certain relevant information within thirty (30) days of the\ntransfer. The tax authorities in charge will evaluate the offshore transaction for tax purposes. In the event that the tax authorities determine that such transfer\nis abusing forms of business organization and there is no reasonable commercial purpose other than avoidance of PRC enterprise income tax, the tax authorities\nwill have the power to conduct a substance-over-form re-assessment of the nature of the equity transfer. A reasonable commercial purpose may be\nestablished when the overall offshore structure is set up to comply with the requirements of supervising authorities of international capital markets. If the State\nAdministration of Taxation’s challenge of a transfer is successful, they will deny the existence of the offshore holding company that is used for tax planning\npurposes. Since Circular 698 has a brief history, there is uncertainty as to its application.\nGeneral PRC Government Approval\nAs a wholesale distributor and retailer of pharmaceutical products, we are subject to regulation and oversight by different levels of the food and drug\nadministration in China, in particular, the SFDA. TheD rug Administration Law of the PRC, as amended, provides the basic legal framework for the\nadministration of the production and sale of pharmaceutical products in China and governs the manufacturing, distributing, packaging, pricing, and advertising of\npharmaceutical products in China. The corresponding implementation regulations set out detailed rules with respect to the administration of pharmaceuticals in\nChina. We are also subject to other PRC laws and regulations that are applicable to business operators, retailers, and foreign-invested companies.\nDistribution of Pharmaceutical Products\nA distributor of pharmaceutical products must obtain a distribution permit from the relevant provincial or designated municipal- or county-level SFDA.\nThe grant of such permit is subject to an inspection of the distributor’s facilities, warehouses, hygienic environment, quality control systems, personnel, and\nequipment. The distribution permit is valid for five (5) years, and the holder must apply for renewal of the permit within six (6) months prior to its expiration. In\naddition, a pharmaceutical product distributor needs to obtain a business license from the relevant administration for industry and commerce prior to\ncommencing its business. All of our consolidated entities that engage in the retail pharmaceutical business have obtained necessary pharmaceutical distribution\npermits, and we do not expect to face any difficulties in renewing these permits and/or certifications.\nIn addition, under the Supervision and Administration Rules on Pharmaceutical Product Distribution, promulgated by the SFDA on January 31,\n2007, and effective May 1, 2007, a pharmaceutical product distributor is responsible for its procurement and sales activities and is liable for the actions of its\nemployees or agents in connection with their conduct of distribution on behalf of the distributor. A retail distributor of pharmaceutical products is not allowed to\nsell prescription pharmaceutical products or Tier A OTC pharmaceutical products listed in the national or provincial medical insurance catalogs without the\npresence of a certified in-store pharmacist. See “Reimbursement under the National Medical Insurance Program .”\nRestrictions on Foreign Ownership of Wholesale or Retail Pharmaceutical Business in China\nPRC regulations on foreign investment currently permit foreign companies to establish or invest in WFOEs or joint ventures that engage in wholesale\nor retail sales of pharmaceuticals in China. For retail sales, these regulations restrict the number and size of pharmacies that a foreign investor may establish. If\na foreign investor owns more than thirty (30) stores that sell a variety of branded pharmaceutical products sourced from different suppliers, the foreign\ninvestor’s ownership interests in the stores are limited to forty nine percent (49%).\nIn lieu of equity ownership, our WFOE, Jiuxin Management, has entered into contractual arrangements with Jiuzhou Pharmacy and the Key\nPersonnel.\n13\nGood Supply Practice Standards\nGSP standards regulate wholesale and retail pharmaceutical product distributors to ensure the quality of distribution of pharmaceutical products in\nChina. All wholesale and retail pharmaceutical product distributors are required to apply for GSP certification within thirty (30) days after obtaining drug\ndistribution permits. The current applicable GSP standards require pharmaceutical product distributors to implement strict controls on the distribution of\nmedicine products, including standards regarding staff qualifications, distribution premises, warehouses, inspection equipment and facilities, management, and\nquality control. Specifically, the warehouse must be able to store the pharmaceutical products at various required temperatures and humidity, and handle\ntransport, warehouse entries, delivery, and billing by computerized logistics management systems. The GSP certificate is usually valid for five (5) years.\nCurrently, Jiuzhou Pharmacy, and Jiuxin Medicine are all GSP certified.\nPrescription Administration\nUnder the Rules on Administration of Prescriptions promulgated by the SFDA, effective May 1, 2007, doctors are required to include the chemical\ningredients of the medicine they prescribe in their prescription and are not allowed to include brand names in their prescription. This regulation is designed to\nprovide consumers with choices among different pharmaceutical products that contain the same chemical ingredients.\nAdvertisement of Pharmaceutical Products\nUnder the Advertising Law of PRC, the contents of an advertisement must be true, lawful, without falsehood, and must neither deceive nor mislead\nconsumers. Accordingly, advertisement must be examined by the competent authority prior to its publication or broadcast through any form of media. In\naddition, advertisement of pharmaceutical products may only be based on a drug’s approved indication of use statement, and may not contain any assurance of\na product’s efficiency, treatment efficiency, curative rate, or any other information prohibited by law. Advertisement for certain drugs should include an\nadmonishment to seek a doctor’s advice before purchasing and application. Advertising is prohibited for certain drugs such as anesthetics and psychotropic\ndrugs.\nTo further prevent misleading advertising of pharmaceutical products, the SAIC and the SFDA jointly promulgated theS tandards for Examination\nand Publication of Advertisements of Pharmaceutical Products and Measures for Examination of Advertisement of Pharmaceutical Products in March\n2007. Under these regulations, an approval must be obtained from the provincial level of food and drug administration before a pharmaceutical product may be\nadvertised. In addition, once approved, an advertisement’s content may not be altered without further approval. Such approval, once obtained, is valid for one\n(1) year.\nProduct Liability and Consumers Protection\nProduct liability claims may arise if the products sold have any harmful effect on consumers. The injured party may make a claim for damages or\ncompensation. The General Principles of the Civil Law of the PRC, which became effective in January 1987, state that manufacturers and sellers of\ndefective products causing property damage or injury shall incur civil liabilities for such damage or injuries.\nThe Product Quality Law of the PRC was enacted in 1993 and amended in 2000 to strengthen the quality control of products and protect consumers’\nrights and interests. Under this law, manufacturers and distributors who produce or sell defective products may be subject to confiscation of earnings from such\nsales, revocation of business licenses, imposition of fines, and, in severe circumstances, may be subject to criminal liability.\nThe Administrative Measures for Drug Recalls was issued by the SFDA in December 2007, and covers two (2) types of drug recalls, namely\nvoluntary recalls and compulsory recalls. Under such regulation, wholesalers are obliged to assist drug manufacturers with any drug recall. In addition, a\nwholesaler must immediately cease to sell any drug that the wholesaler learns has any safety issues, and must immediately notify the manufacturer or its\nsupplier as well as report the matter to the SFDA.\nThe Law of the PRC on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Consumers was promulgated on October 31, 1993 and became effective on\nJanuary 1, 1994 to protect consumers’ rights when they purchase or use goods or services. All business operators must comply with this law when they\nmanufacture or sell goods and/or provide services to customers. In extreme situations, pharmaceutical product manufacturers and distributors may be subject to\ncriminal liability if their goods or services lead to the death or injuries of customers or other third parties.\nThe Tort Law of the PRC was promulgated on December 26, 2009 and went into effect on July 1, 2010. The Tort Law provides that manufacturers\nand distributors who produce or sell defective products shall be responsible for the damage caused by the defective products.\nReimbursement under the National Medical Insurance Program\nEligible participants in the national medical insurance program, consisting primarily of urban residents, are entitled to purchase medicine when\npresenting their medical insurance cards in an authorized pharmacy, provided that the medicine they purchase has been included in the national or provincial\nmedical insurance catalogs. Depending on relevant local regulations, authorized pharmacies can either (i) sell medicine on credit and obtain reimbursement from\nrelevant government social security bureaus on a monthly basis, or (ii) receive payments from the participants at the time of their purchases, and the\nparticipants in turn obtain reimbursement from relevant government social security bureaus.\n14\nMedications included in the national and provincial medical insurance catalogs are divided into two (2) tiers. Purchases of Tier A pharmaceutical\nproducts are generally fully reimbursable, except that certain Tier A pharmaceutical products are only reimbursable to the extent the medications are used\nspecifically for the purposes stated in the medical insurance catalogs. Purchasers of Tier B pharmaceutical products, which are generally more expensive than\nthose in Tier A, are required to make a certain percentage of co-payments, with the remaining amount being reimbursable. The percentage of reimbursement\nfor Tier B OTC products varies in different regions in the PRC. Factors that affect the inclusion of medicine in the medical insurance catalogs include whether\nthe medicine is consumed in large volumes and commonly prescribed for clinical use in China and whether it is considered to be important in meeting the basic\nhealthcare needs of the general public.\nChina’s Ministry of Labor and Social Security, together with other government authorities, has the power to determine which medicines are included in\nthe national medical insurance catalog every two (2) years, under which of the two (2) tiers the included medicine falls, and whether an included medicine\nshould be removed from the catalog.\nSales of Nutritional Supplements and other Food Products\nA distributor of nutritional supplements and other food products must obtain a food circulation permit from its local Administration of Industry and\nCommerce. The grant of such permit is subject to an inspection of the distributor’s facilities, warehouses, hygienic environment, quality control systems,\npersonnel, and equipment. The food circulation permit is valid for three (3) years, and the holder must apply for renewal of the certificate within thirty (30) days\nprior to its expiration. Currently, Jiuxin Medicine, Jiuzhou Pharmacy, and our drugstores all hold a valid Food Circulation Permit, except for our Lin’an store and\nRen’airu store, which do not sell food products and therefore is not required to hold such a permit. We are in the process of renewing the permits for two (2)\nstores that has expired in April 2016, and believe that there will little to no difficulty in renewing such permits.\nMedical Practice\nHealthcare providers in China are required to comply with many laws and regulations at the national and local government levels. The laws and\nregulations applicable to our medical practice include the following:\n● We must register with and maintain an operating license from the local public health authority for each clinic that we operate, each of which is\nsubject to annual review by the public health authority;\n● The Licensed Physician Act requires that we only hire PRC licensed physicians;\n● All waste material from our clinics must be properly collected, sterilized, deposited, transported and disposed of, and we are required to keep\nrecords of the origin, type and amount of all waste materials that we generate for at least three (3) years;\n● We must have at least three (3) physicians, five (5) nurses and one (1) technician on staff at each clinic; and\n● We must establish and follow protocols to prevent medical malpractice, which require us to: (i) insure that patients are adequately informed\nbefore they consent to medical operations or procedures; (ii) maintain complete medical records which are available for review by the patient,\nphysicians and the courts; (iii) voluntarily report any event of malpractice to a local government agency; and (iv) support and justify the medical\nservices we provide in any administrative investigation or litigation. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer\npenalties, including the loss of our license to operate.\nInterim Regulations on Administration of Sino-Foreign Joint Venture and Cooperative Medical Institutions\nAs per China’s commitments to the World Trade Organization, “Foreign service suppliers are permitted to establish joint venture hospitals or clinics\nwith local Chinese partners with quantitative limitations in line with China’s needs. Foreign majority ownership is permitted.” In accordance with the Interim\nRegulations on Administration of Sino-Foreign Joint Venture and Cooperative Medical Institutions issued jointly by the Ministry of Health (“MOH”)\nand the Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”) in 2000, the Chinese party of Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperative medical institutions shall hold no less\nthan thirty percent (30%) of shares and legal rights or interest, which also mean foreign investors are allowed to hold a maximum stake of seventy percent\n(70%). Such regulations also specify that the establishment of Sino-foreign joint venture and cooperative medical institutions should be approved respectively by\nMOH and MOFCOM. In other words, foreigners are allowed to run hospitals or clinics in the form of equity or co-operative joint ventures with an equity\ninterest of up to seventy percent (70%) lasting up to twenty (20) years.\n15\nInternet Pharmaceutical Sales\nChina’s central government regulates Internet access, the distribution of online information and the conduct of online commerce through strict business\nlicensing requirements and other government regulations. Companies which sell pharmaceutical products to consumers through the Internet are required to\nobtain: (1) a drug distribution permit; (2) an Internet pharmaceutical information provider qualification certificate, renewable every five (5) years; (3) an\nInternet pharmaceutical transaction service qualification certificate, renewable every five (5) years; (4) a value-added telecommunication operation permit; and\n(5) registration with the Administration of Information Industry. Internet pharmacies are not allowed to distribute prescription drugs. The websites that sell\npharmaceutical products must ensure transaction security and enable the consumers to consult with licensed pharmacists. Also, an Internet-based business in\nChina is required to obtain and maintain certain assets relevant to its business, such as delivery and storage facilities. Jiuzhou Pharmacy obtained all above-\nmentioned certificates and registrations and launched www.dada360.com in May 2010 and renewed the certificates in 2015. Quannuo Technology has been\noperating the website and providing software and technical supports since November 2010. Since December 2015, such online pharmacy operation function\nhas been transferred to Jiuzhou Pharmacy after the sale of Quannuo Technology in November 2015. During the year ended March 31,2019, the Company also\nsold pharmaceutical and other products via certain third-party platforms such as Tmall and JD.com.\nTCM Manufacturing\nThe SFDA has adopted a non-mandatory licensing process for TCM manufacturers according to Good Agricultural Practice (“GAP”) for Chinese\nCrude Drugs. Manufacturers who meet the government-set requirements will be granted a GAP certificate. Since we do not process the herbs that we harvest\nand the GAP certification is not mandatory, we have not applied for such certification, and currently have no plan of doing so.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur drugstore and wholesale operations do not involve any activities subject to specific PRC environmental regulations. Our medical clinics are in\ncompliance with applicable regulations regarding the administration of medical wastes, including collections, temperate storage, and packaging and labeling of\nmedical wastes. Pursuant to such regulations, we contract with DadiWeikang Medical Wastes Disposal Center to dispose of all medical wastes generated by\nour clinics.\nPrincipal Executive Office\nOur principal executive office is located at 6th Floor, Hai Wai Hai Tongxin Mansion, Gong Shu District, Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China. Our\nmain telephone number is +86-571-8807-7078, and fax number is +86-571-8807-7108.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this report before making an\ninvestment decision with regard to our securities. The statements contained in or incorporated into this report that are not historic facts are forward-\nlooking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by\nforward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.\nIn that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\n16\nRisks Relating to Our Business in General\nFuture acquisitions are expected to be a part of our growth strategy, and could expose us to significant business risks.\nWe have grown our business, in part, through the acquisition of stores over the years. One of our strategies going forward is to continue our growth by\nacquiring additional drugstores. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to identify and secure suitable acquisition opportunities. Our ability\nto consummate and integrate effectively any future acquisitions on terms that are favorable to us may be limited by the number of attractive acquisition targets,\ninternal demands on our resources and, to the extent necessary, our ability to obtain any necessary financing for larger acquisitions on terms that are\nsatisfactory to us. Moreover, if an acquisition target is identified, the third parties with whom we seek to cooperate may not select us as a potential partner or\nwe may not be able to enter into arrangements on commercially reasonable terms. The negotiation and completion of potential acquisitions, whether or not\nultimately consummated, could also significantly divert management’s time and resources and may potentially disrupt our existing business. Furthermore, we\ncannot provide any assurance that the expected synergies from future acquisitions will actually materialize. Additionally, future acquisitions could result in the\nincurrence of additional indebtedness, costs, and contingent liabilities, causing us to significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service\nrequirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment, issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders’ percentage\nownership, or incur write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses. Future acquisitions may also expose us to potential risks, including risks associated\nwith:\n● the integration of new operations, services and personnel;\n● unforeseen or hidden liabilities;\n● the diversion of financial or other resources from our existing businesses;\n● difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience;\n● our inability to generate sufficient revenue to recover costs and expenses of the acquisitions; and\n● potential loss of, or harm to, relationships with employees or customers.\nAny of the above could significantly disrupt our ability to manage our business and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe face significant competition, and if we do not compete successfully against existing and new competitors, our revenue and profitability could be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\nBoth the drugstore, online pharmacy and wholesale pharmaceutical distribution industries in China are highly competitive, and we expect competition to\nintensify in the future. Our primary drugstore competitors include other drugstore chains and independent drugstores. Increasingly, we also face competition\nfrom discount stores, convenience stores and supermarkets as we expand our offering of non-drug convenience products and services. We compete for\ncustomers and revenue primarily on the basis of store location, merchandise selection, price, services offered, and our brand name. Our online pharmacy\ncompetitors include other online pharmaceutical vendors. As more large traditional drugstore chain companies entered into the online sales, we face competition\nranging from prices to service. Our primary wholesale competitors include regional and national players. In addition, we may be subject to additional\ncompetition from new entrants to both industries in China. We could also face increased competition from foreign companies if the Chinese government\nremoves the restrictions on the entry of foreign companies into these industries.\nSome of our larger competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as:\n● greater financial and other resources;\n● larger variety of products;\n● more extensive and advanced supply chain management systems;\n● greater pricing flexibility;\n● larger economies of scale and purchasing power;\n● more extensive advertising and marketing efforts;\n● greater knowledge of local market conditions;\n● stronger brand recognition; and\n● larger sales and distribution networks.\n17\nAs a result of the aforementioned advantages, we may be unable to offer products similar to, or more desirable than, those offered by our\ncompetitors, market our products as effectively as our competitors, or otherwise respond successfully to competitive pressures. As competition increases in the\nmarkets in which we operate, a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur, which could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to\nremain competitive. Our competitors may be able to offer larger discounts on competing products, and we may not be able to profitably match those discounts.\nFurthermore, our competitors may offer products that are more attractive to our customers or that render our products uncompetitive. In addition, the timing of\nthe introduction of competing products into the market could affect the market acceptance and market share of our products. Our failure to successfully\ncompete could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation, and prospects.\nChanges in economic conditions and consumer confidence in China may influence the drugstore industry, consumer preferences and spending\npatterns.\nOur business and revenue growth primarily depend on the size of the pharmaceutical market in China. As a result, our revenue and profitability may\nbe negatively affected by changes in national, regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence in China. In particular, as we focus on our\nexpansion of pharmacies in metropolitan markets, where living standards and consumer purchasing power are relatively high, we are especially susceptible to\nchanges in economic conditions, consumer confidence and customer preferences of the urban Chinese population. External factors beyond our control that\naffect consumer confidence include unemployment rates, levels of personal disposable income, national, regional or local economic conditions, and acts of war\nor terrorism. Changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences, purchasing power and spending patterns.\nA decrease in overall consumer spending as a result of changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our front-end and pharmacy sales and negatively\nimpact our profitability. In addition, acts of war or terrorism may cause damage to our facilities, disrupt the supply of the products and services we offer in our\nstores, or adversely impact consumer demand. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nWe may not be able to timely identify or otherwise effectively respond to changing customer preferences, and we may fail to optimize our product\noffering and inventory position.\nThe pharmaceutical industry in China is rapidly evolving and is subject to rapidly changing customer preferences that are difficult to predict. Our\nsuccess depends on our ability to anticipate and identify customer preferences, and adapt our product selection to meet these preferences. In particular, we\nmust optimize our product selection and inventory positions based on sales trends. We cannot provide assurance that our product selection, especially our\nselection of nutritional supplements and food products, will accurately reflect customer preferences at any given time. If we fail to accurately anticipate either\nthe market for our products or customers’ purchasing habits or fail to respond to customers’ changing preferences promptly and effectively, we may not be\nable to adapt our product selection to customer preferences or make appropriate adjustments to our inventory positions, which could significantly reduce our\nrevenue and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to establish effective advertising, marketing and promotional programs.\nOur success depends on our ability to establish effective advertising, marketing and promotional programs, including pricing strategies implemented in\nresponse to competitive pressures and/or to drive demand for our products. Our advertisements are designed to promote our brand, our corporate image and\nthe prices of products available for sale in our stores. Our pricing strategies and value propositions must be appropriate for our target customers. If we are not\nable to maintain and increase the awareness of our pharmacy’s brand and the products and services we provide, we may not be able to attract and retain\ncustomers and our reputation may also suffer. We expect to incur substantial expenses in our marketing and promotional efforts to both attract and retain\ncustomers. However, our marketing and promotional activities may be less successful than we anticipate, and may not be effective at building our brand\nawareness and customer base. In addition, the government may impose restrictions on how marketing and promotional activities can be conducted. We cannot\nprovide assurance that our current and proposed budget for marketing activities will be adequate to support our future growth. Failure to successfully execute\nour advertising, marketing and promotional programs may result in material decreases in our revenue and profitability.\nOur ability to grow our business may be constrained by our inability to find suitable new store locations at acceptable prices or by the expiration of\nour current leases.\nOur ability to grow our business may be constrained if suitable new store locations cannot be identified with lease terms or purchase prices that are\nacceptable to us. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. Local land use regulations and other regulations\napplicable to the kinds of stores we seek to construct may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing our stores. The\nexpiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close\nor relocate stores. Furthermore, changing local demographics at existing store locations could materially and adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at\nthose stores, and overall our business, financial condition, results of operation, and prospects.\n18\nWe have significant cash deposits with our suppliers and landlords in order to obtain and maintain our inventory and maintain and establish store\nlocations, which we may not be able to recover in the event of bankruptcy by our suppliers or landlords or other events beyond our control.\nOur ability to obtain products and maintain inventory at, and to establish and maintain leases for, our pharmacies, is dependent upon our ability to post\nand maintain significant cash deposits with our suppliers and landlords. Many vendors in China are unwilling to ship merchandise on credit and instead require\ncash deposits, and landlords may require security deposits consisting of the equivalent of twelve (12) months of rent . As of March 31, 2019, we had\napproximately $2.5 million deposited with suppliers and approximately $3.4 million deposited with landlords for our pharmacies. If we are unable or unwilling to\nestablish such advances and deposits, our ability to generate sales and expand our business could be adversely affected. In general, we expect the amounts\nrequired for advances and deposits to increase as we undertake our expansion plans, complete store openings and expand our business through acquisitions or\notherwise. We do not generally receive interest on the deposits made to suppliers or landlords, and such deposits are subject to the risk of loss as a result of the\ncreditworthiness or bankruptcy of the party who holds our funds, as well as the risk from any illegal acts associated with the third party, such as conversion,\nfraud, theft or dishonesty. If these circumstances were to arise, we could find it difficult or impossible, due to the unpredictability of legal proceedings in China,\nto recover all or a portion of the amount on deposit with our vendors or landlords.\nIf we are unable to optimize management of our procurement and distribution activities, we may be unable to meet customer demand while\nincreasing the burden on managing our supply chain.\nSince May 2011, we have been using Jiuxin Medicine’s facility as our distribution center for both our retail and wholesale businesses. Starting from\nMarch 31, 2018, we outsourced our logistic service to Astro Boy Cloud Pan (Hangzhou) Storage and Logistic Co. Ltd (“Astro Boy Logistic”). As a result,\nJiuxin Medicine’s warehouse lease has been terminated. Astro Boy Logistic provides us with a facility with approximately 14,000 square meters located\napproximately eighteen (18) miles from our headquarters, which served as our central distribution center. Astro Boy Logistic’s staff and vehicles make regular\ndeliveries to our pharmacies and wholesale customers. Our ability to meet customer demand may be significantly limited if we do not successfully and\nefficiently conduct our distribution activities, or if Astro Boy Logistic’s facility is destroyed or shut down for any reason, including as the result of natural\ndisasters. Any disruption in the operation of our distribution activities could result in higher costs or longer lead times associated with distributing our products.\nSince it is difficult to predict accurate sales volume in our industry, we may be unable to optimize our distribution activities, which may result in excess or\ninsufficient inventory, warehousing, fulfillment or distribution capacity. Furthermore, failure to effectively control product damage during the distribution process\ncould decrease our operating margins and reduce our profitability.\nAll product procurement is handled through our corporate headquarters. Such centralization is intended to reduce the cost of goods sold as a result of\nvolume purchase benefits. However, we may be less successful than anticipated in achieving these volume purchase benefits. In addition, such centralization is\nexpected to increase the complexity of tracking inventory and could place additional burdens on the management of our supply chain. If we cannot successfully\nreduce our costs through centralizing procurement, our profitability and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nFailure to maintain optimal inventory levels could increase our inventory holding costs or cause us to lose sales, either of which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe need to maintain sufficient inventory levels to operate both of our retail and wholesale businesses successfully as well as meet customer\nexpectations. However, we must also guard against the risk of accumulating excess inventory. We are exposed to inventory risks as a result of rapid changes\nin product life cycles, changing consumer preferences, uncertainty of the success of product launches, seasonality, and manufacturer backorders and other\nvendor-related problems. We cannot provide assurance that we can accurately predict these trends and events and avoid over-stocking or under-stocking\nproducts. In addition, demand for products could change significantly between the time product inventory is ordered and the time it is available for sale.\nWhen we begin selling a new product, it is particularly difficult to accurately forecast product demand. The purchase of certain types of inventory may\nrequire significant lead-time. As we carry a broad selection of products and maintain significant inventory levels for a substantial portion of our merchandise,\nwe may be unable to sell such inventory in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons. Carrying excess inventory could increase our inventory\nholding costs, and failure to have inventory in stock when a customer orders or purchases it could cause us to lose that order or that customer, either of which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on computer software and hardware systems in managing our operations, the capacity of which may restrict our growth and the failure of\nwhich could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon our integrated information management system to monitor daily operations of our retail and wholesale businesses, and to\nmaintain accurate and up-to-date operating and financial data for the compilation of management information. In addition, we rely on our computer hardware\nand network for the storage, delivery and transmission of the data of our retail and wholesale systems. If our computer software and hardware systems fail to\nmeet the increasing needs of our expanding operations, our ability to grow may be constrained. Furthermore, any system failure which causes interruptions to\nthe input, retrieval and transmission of data or causes lags in service time could disrupt our normal operations. Although we believe that our computer software\nand hardware systems are up to date and that our disaster recovery plan is adequate in handling potential failures, we cannot provide assurance that we can\neffectively carry out this disaster recovery plan and that we will be able to restore our operation within a sufficiently short time frame to avoid our business\nbeing disrupted. Furthermore, our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer\nviruses, security breaches, vandalism, natural disasters, catastrophic events and human error, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all\neventualities. If any of our computer software and/or hardware systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur\nsubstantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical\nfunctions. Due to the limited coverage of business interruption insurance policies offered in China, we do not carry business interruption insurance and, as a\nresult, any business disruption or natural disaster could severely disrupt our business and operations and, in turn, significantly decrease our revenue and\nprofitability.\n19\nWe depend substantially on the continuing efforts of the Key Personnel, and our business and prospects may be severely disrupted if we lose their\nservices.\nOur future success is dependent on the continued services of the Key Personnel but we do not maintain key-man insurance. If we lose the services of\nany one of the Key Personnel, we may not be able to locate suitable or qualified replacements, which could severely disrupt our business and prospects. Each\nof the Key Personnel has entered into confidentiality and non-competition agreements with us. However, if any disputes arise between us and the Key\nPersonnel, we cannot provide assurance, in light of uncertainties associated with the PRC legal system, that any of these agreements can be enforced in China,\nthe jurisdiction in which the Key Personnel reside and hold some of their assets. See ” Risks Related to Doing Business in China - You may experience\ndifficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in China based on United States or other\nforeign laws against us or our management. “\nWe depend on the continued service of, and on the ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified and skilled personnel for\nour business.\nThe implementation of our business strategy and our future success also depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly\nqualified and skilled personnel. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to attract, hire and retain sufficient numbers of skilled personnel necessary to\ncontinue to develop and grow our business. We face competition for personnel from both retail and wholesale pharmaceutical distribution operators. This\ncompetition could require us to offer higher compensation and other benefits in order to attract and retain qualified individuals, which could materially and\nadversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. On the other hand, we may be unable to attract or retain the personnel required to achieve our\nbusiness objectives, and that failure could severely disrupt our business and prospects. The process of hiring suitably qualified personnel is often lengthy. If our\nrecruitment and retention efforts are unsuccessful in the future, it may be more difficult for us to execute our business strategy.\nOur retail and wholesale operations require a number of permits and licenses in order to carry on their business.\nWe are required to obtain certain permits and licenses from various PRC governmental authorities, including a Drug Distribution Permit and a GSP\ncertification. We are also required to obtain food hygiene certificates for the distribution of nutritional supplements and food products. We cannot provide any\nassurance that we can maintain all required licenses, permits and certifications to carry on our business at all times, and from time to time we may have not\nbeen in the past, or may not be in the future, in compliance with all such required licenses, permits and certifications. Moreover, these licenses, permits and\ncertifications are subject to periodic renewal and/or reassessment by the relevant PRC governmental authorities and the standards of such renewal or\nreassessment may change from time to time. We intend to apply for renewal of these licenses, permits and certifications when required by applicable laws and\nregulations. Any failure by us to obtain and maintain all licenses, permits and certifications necessary to carry on our business at any time could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any inability to renew any of these licenses, permits and certifications\ncould severely disrupt our business, and prevent us from continuing to carry on our business. Any changes in the standards used by governmental authorities in\nconsidering whether to renew or reassess our business licenses, permits and certifications, as well as any enactment of new regulations that may restrict the\nconduct of our business, may also decrease our revenue and/or increase our costs, materially reducing our profitability and prospects. Furthermore, if the\ninterpretation or implementation of existing laws and regulations changes or if new regulations come into effect requiring us to obtain any additional licenses,\npermits or certifications that were previously not required to operate our existing businesses, we cannot provide assurance that we can successfully obtain such\nlicenses, permits or certifications.\nWe may need additional capital, and the sale of equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders, while debts may require us to make\ncovenants restricting how we operate.\nWe believe that the aggregate amount of our current cash, anticipated cash flow from operations, available borrowings under our existing bank\nfacilities, and personal loans from our principal shareholders should be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the near future. We may, however,\nrequire additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments. If our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash\nrequirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities. The sale of additional equity securities could result in the dilution\nof our existing stockholders. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Even if we\nare able to obtain any requisite financing, the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations, and could result in further\noperating and financing covenants that would restrict our freedom to operate our business, such as conditions that:\n● limit our ability to pay dividends or require us to seek consent for the payment of dividends;\n● increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n● require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to\nfund capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate purposes; and\n● limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.\n20\nRisks Relating to Our Pharmacy Operations\nOur brand names, trade secrets and other intellectual property are valuable assets. If we are unable to protect them from infringement, our business\nand prospects may be harmed.\nWe consider our pharmacy brand names to be valuable assets. We may be unable to prevent third parties from using such brand names without\nauthorization, which may adversely affect our business and reputation, including the perceived quality and reliability of our products and services. We have five\n(5) registered trademarks. We also own three (3) domain names that we actively use in our business.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our know-how and other proprietary information, including pricing, purchasing, promotional strategies, customer\nlists and/or suppliers lists. As a result, our employees are required to sign employment agreements that contain confidentiality provisions as a condition of their\nemployment with us. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we believe we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees,\nconsultants, contractors or advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. In addition, confidentiality agreements executed by\nthe aforementioned individuals may not be enforceable or provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of\nunauthorized use or disclosure.\nIf we were to enforce a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, such efforts could be expensive and time-\nconsuming, and the outcome unpredictable. Additionally, if our competitors independently develop information that is equivalent to our trade secrets or other\nproprietary information, we have little recourse to enforce our rights, and our business and prospects could be harmed.\nLitigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property\nrights of others. However, since the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in the PRC are uncertain and still evolving, we\nmay not be successful in prosecuting these cases. In addition, any litigation, proceeding or other efforts to protect our intellectual property rights could result in\nsubstantial costs and diversion of our resources, and could seriously harm our business and operating results. Furthermore, the degree of future protection of\nour proprietary rights is uncertain and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. If we are unable to protect\nour trade names, trade secrets and other propriety information from infringement, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially\nand adversely affected.\nWe may be exposed to intellectual property infringement and other claims by third parties which, if successful, could disrupt our business and have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to use our proprietary information and know-how without infringing third party intellectual property\nrights. As litigation becomes more common in China, we face a higher risk of being the subject of claims for intellectual property infringement, invalidity or\nindemnification relating to other parties’ proprietary rights. Our current or potential competitors, many of whom have substantial resources, may have or may\nobtain intellectual property protection that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to conduct our business in China. Moreover, the defense of intellectual\nproperty suits, including trademark infringement suits and related legal and administrative proceedings, can be both costly and time consuming and may\nsignificantly divert the efforts and resources of our management personnel. Furthermore, an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceeding to which\nwe may become a party could cause us to:\n● pay damage awards;\n● seek licenses from third parties;\n● pay ongoing royalties;\n● redesign our product offerings; or\n● be restricted by injunctions,\nEach of which could effectively prevent us from pursuing some or all of our business and result in our customers or potential customers deferring or\nlimiting their purchase from our stores, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe continued penetration of counterfeit products into the pharmaceutical market in China may damage our reputation and have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCounterfeit products have continued to make their way into the Chinese pharmaceutical market. Counterfeit products are generally sold at lower\nprices compared to their authentic counterparts due to their low production costs, and in some cases may be very similar in appearance to their authentic\ncounterparts. Counterfeit pharmaceuticals may or may not have the same chemical content as their authentic counterparts, and are typically manufactured\nwithout proper licenses or approvals as well as fraudulently mislabeled with respect to their content and/or manufacturer. Although China’s central government\nhas been increasingly active in combating counterfeit pharmaceutical and other products, China does not yet have effective regulatory control or an\nenforcement system over counterfeit pharmaceutical products. Although we have implemented a series of quality control procedures in our procurement\nprocess, we cannot provide assurance that we may not be inadvertently selling counterfeit pharmaceutical products. Any unintentional sale of counterfeit\nproducts may subject us to negative publicity, fines and/or other administrative penalties, or may even result in litigation against us. Moreover, the increased\ndistribution of counterfeit products and other products in recent years may reinforce the negative image of drug distributors among consumers in China. The\ncontinued proliferation of counterfeit products in China could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition, and results of operation.\n21\nAs a distributor of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products, we are exposed to inherent risks relating to product liability and personal injury\nclaims.\nDistributors of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of such products. Such\nrisks include unintentional distribution of counterfeit, mislabeled or contaminated drugs, and, with respect to our pharmacies, improper filling of prescriptions,\nlabeling of prescriptions and adequacy of warnings. Errors in the packaging or dispensing of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury or death. Furthermore,\nthe applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations require our in-store pharmacists to offer counseling to our customers, without additional charge, about\nmedication, dosage, delivery systems, common side effects, and other information the in-store pharmacists deem significant. Our in-store pharmacists\nsometimes also have a duty to warn customers regarding any potential negative effects of a prescription drug if the warning could reduce or negate these\neffects, and we may be liable for claims arising from any advice given by our in-store pharmacists. Product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted\nagainst us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide, and we may be required to pay for substantial monetary\ndamages for any successful product liability or personal injury claim against us. We may, however, in product liability claims, have the right under applicable\nPRC laws, rules and regulations to recover from the relevant manufacturer any compensation we paid to our customers in connection with such claim. Even if\nwe successfully defend ourselves against this type of claim, we could be required to spend significant management, financial and other resources in the\nprocess, which could disrupt our business. Our reputation and our brand names may also suffer as a result of any product liability or personal injury claims\nagainst us. Like many other similar companies in China, we do not carry product liability insurance. A product recall or damage to our reputation in the event of\na product liability or personal injury claim or judgment against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nWe may be subject to fines and penalties if we fail to comply with the applicable PRC laws and regulations governing sales of medicines under\nChina’s National Medical Insurance Program.\nEligible participants in China’s national medical insurance program, mainly consisting of urban residents in China, are entitled to buy medicines using\ntheir medical insurance cards from an authorized pharmacy, provided that the medicines they purchase have been included in the national or provincial medical\ninsurance catalogs. The pharmacy, in turn, obtains reimbursement from the relevant government social security bureaus. Moreover, the applicable PRC laws,\nrules and regulations prohibit pharmacies from selling goods other than pre-approved medicines when purchases are made with medical insurance cards. We\nhave established procedures to prohibit our drugstores from selling unauthorized goods to customers who make purchases with medical insurance cards.\nHowever, we cannot provide assurance that those procedures will be strictly followed by all of our employees in all of our stores.\nRisks Relating to Our Medical Services\nIf we do not attract and retain qualified physicians and other medical personnel, our ability to provide medical services would be adversely affected.\nThe success of our medical services will, in part, be dependent upon the number and quality of doctors, nurses and other medical support personnel\nthat we employ and our ability to maintain good relationships with them. Our medical staff may terminate their employment with us at any time. If we are\nunable to successfully maintain good relationships with them, our ability to provide medical services may be adversely affected.\nThe provision of medical services is heavily regulated in the PRC and failure to comply with those regulations could result in penalties, loss of\nlicensure, additional compliance costs or other adverse consequences.\nHealthcare providers in China, as in most other populous countries, are required to comply with many laws and regulations at the national and local\ngovernment levels. These laws and regulations relate to: licensing; the conduct of operations; the ownership of facilities; the addition of facilities and services;\nadvertising; confidentiality, maintenance and security issues associated with medical records; billing for services; and prices for services. If we fail to comply\nwith applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate. In addition, further healthcare legislative reform is\nlikely, and could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations in the event that we do not comply or if the cost of compliance is\nprohibitive. The above list of certain regulated areas is not exhaustive, and it is not possible to anticipate the exact nature of future healthcare legislative reform\nin China. Depending on the priorities set by the Chinese Ministry of Health, the political climate at any given time, the continued development of the Chinese\nhealthcare system and many other factors, future legislative reforms may be highly comprehensive, including stringent infection control policies, improved rural\nhealthcare facilities, increased regulation of the distribution of pharmaceuticals, and numerous other policy matters. Consequently, the implications of these\nfuture reforms could result in penalties, loss of licensure, additional compliance costs or other adverse consequences we cannot foresee at the present time.\n22\nAs a provider of medical services, we are exposed to inherent risks relating to malpractice claims.\nAs a provider of medical services, any misdiagnosis or improper treatment may result in negative publicity regarding us or our services, which would\nharm our reputation. If we are found liable for malpractice, we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages. Furthermore, even if we successfully\ndefend ourselves against a malpractice claim, we could be required to spend significant management, financial and other resources in the process, which could\ndisrupt our business, and our reputation and brand name may also suffer. Since malpractice claims are not common in China, we do not carry malpractice\ninsurance. As a result, any imposition of malpractice liability could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face competition that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur clinics compete with a large number and variety of healthcare facilities in their respective markets. There are numerous government-run and\nprivate hospitals and clinics available to the general populace. There can be no assurance that these or other clinics, hospitals or other facilities will not\ncommence or expand such operations, which would increase their competitive position. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a healthcare organization\nthat having greater resources in the provision or management of healthcare services will not decide to engage in operations similar to those being conducted by\nus in Hangzhou.\nRisks Related to Our Herb Farming\nOur herb farming business is subject to the volatility of prices for raw TCM herbs.\nWe currently planted gingko trees in our leased farm land. However, in the future, we may continue to cultivate and sell certain herbs in bulk to third-\nparty vendors, based on local market prices primarily determined by TCM manufacturers and trading companies. Such market prices have increased\nsignificantly in recent years in response to changes in the supply of and demand for raw herbs, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are\nbeyond our control, including inflation, changes in weather, disease outbreaks, domestic government regulation, market speculation and overall economic\nconditions. There can be no assurance that market prices, which historically have fluctuated widely, will continue to increase or remain stable, and any future\ndeclines in prices may negatively impact the viability of our herb farming business.\nUnforeseen and severe weather can reduce cultivation activities and lead to a decrease in anticipated harvest.\nSeasonal climate change and weather variations such as levels of rainfall and temperature may, among other things, affect the quality, overall supply\nand availability of raw herbs. Sustained adverse weather conditions in Zhejiang Province in general and in Lin’an in particular where our herbs are planted,\nsuch as rain, extreme cold or snow, could disrupt or curtail cultivation activities. This in turn could reduce our anticipated harvest yields, delay the timing of our\nanticipated harvest and distribution, and negatively affect the quality of our harvest. In addition, natural disasters such as fires, earthquakes, snowstorms, floods\nor droughts, or natural conditions such as crop disease, pests or soil erosion, may also negatively impact our cultivation and harvest.\nIn addition, the actual climatic conditions of Zhejiang Province and of Lin’an in particular may not conform to historical patterns and may be affected\nby variations in weather patterns, including any potential impact of climate change. The effects of climate change may produce more unpredictable weather\nevents that may adversely affect our ability to cultivate and harvest successfully.\nThe occurrence of any of these may materially harm our herb farming business.\nWe have limited control over the availability and the quality of the local farmers with whom we cooperate because we do not employ them directly.\nWe rely on local farmers to farm and harvest our herbs, but do not employ them directly. Instead, they are recruited and employed by the local\nvillagers’ committees with whom we negotiate. We have limited control over the availability and the quality of this labor force. A shortage of suitable laborers\nmay adversely affect our harvest yields.\nRisks Related to Our Online Sales\nWe rely on computer software and hardware systems in managing our online sales, the capacity of which may restrict our growth and the failure of\nwhich could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon our electronic commerce system to carry out our online sales. Any system failure which causes interruptions to the input,\nretrieval and transmission of data, or increases in service time could disrupt our normal operations. Although we believe we have a disaster recovery plan that\ncan handle the failure of our computer software and hardware systems, we cannot provide assurance that we can effectively carry out this disaster recovery\nplan and that we will be able to restore our operation within a sufficiently short time frame to avoid disruption to our business. Any failure in our computer\nsoftware and/or hardware systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if the\ncapacity of our computer software and hardware systems fails to meet the increasing needs of our operations, our ability to grow may be constrained.\n23\nOur online business decreased in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 and we cannot assure our efforts for alternative vendors will result in the\nincrease in revenues from online pharmacy in the coming years.\nOur online pharmacy sales decreased by approximately $3,348,471, or 27.6% for the year ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended\nMarch 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily caused by the decline in business via e-commerce platforms. In order to increase the popularity of our products,\nwe have made considerable efforts to identify popular products that can drive sales, while keeping a close watch on cost. However, due to the suspension of\nOTC drug sales on e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 by the China Food and Drug Administration (“CFDA”),\nour sales via these e-commerce platforms have been curtailed. As a result, our sales via these e-commerce platforms decreased by 33.4% period over period.\nWe are adding more non-medical health products such as nutritional supplements into our sales menu to counteract the decline in sale of OTC drug category.\nFor instance, we are opening a dendrobium candidum flagship store at Tmall with a popular local brand. The brand has a large customer base in Hangzhou.\nHowever, there is no assurance our efforts will lead in the increase in our online sales.\nIf our online business fails to obtain and maintain the requisite assets, licenses, qualified personnel and approvals required under the complex\nregulatory environment for Internet-based businesses in China, the business prospects for such business may be materially and adversely affected.\nInternet-based businesses in China are highly regulated by China’s central government, and numerous regulatory authorities are empowered to issue\nand implement regulations governing various aspects of these businesses. Our online business is operated by our PRC subsidiary, Jiuzhou Pharmacy, which is\nrequired to obtain and maintain certain assets relevant to its business, such as computers and other electrical equipment, as well as applicable licenses or\napprovals from different regulatory authorities. These assets and licenses are essential to the operation of an e-commerce business and are generally subject to\nannual review by the relevant governmental authorities. Furthermore, we may be required to obtain additional licenses. If we fail to obtain or maintain any of\nthe required assets, licenses or approvals, our Internet business may be deemed illegal and it may be subject to various penalties, such as confiscation of illegal\nincome, fines, and/or the discontinuation or restriction of its operations. Any such disruption may materially and adversely affect the prospects of our online\nbusiness.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure\nChinese regulations limit foreign ownership of any pharmacy operator with thirty (30) or more stores, and limit foreign ownership of medical clinics\nto Sino-foreign joint venture. The entities that operate our pharmacies and clinics are controlled by us through contractual arrangements. The\nvalidity of such contractual arrangements is uncertain. If the Chinese government determines that these contractual arrangements do not comply\nwith applicable regulations, we could be subject to severe penalties and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in the relevant\nChinese laws and regulations may materially and adversely affect our business.\nCurrent PRC regulations limit foreign ownership of a pharmacy operator to forty nine percent (49%) if such operator owns interests in thirty (30) or\nmore drugstores in China that sell a variety of branded pharmaceutical products sourced from different suppliers. Since we do not own any equity interests in\nJiuzhou Pharmacy (or its subsidiary Jiuxin Medicine), but instead control it through contractual arrangements, we do not believe that the regulations limiting\nforeign ownership apply to us even if Jiuzhou Pharmacy or Jiuxin Medicine expands beyond thirty (30) stores. In fact, Jiuzhou Pharmacy has expended to one\nhundred and twenty-one (121) stores as of March 31, 2019.\nSimilarly, PRC regulations restrict foreign ownership of medical practices in China to Sino-foreign joint ventures. Since we do not have any actual\nequity interest in Jiuzhou Clinic or Jiuzhou Service, but control these entities through contractual arrangements, we do not believe that such PRC regulations are\napplicable to us or our structure.\n24\nThere are, however, uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to the laws,\nrules and regulations governing the validity and enforcement of our contractual arrangements. Although the structures for operating our business in China\n(including our corporate structure and contractual arrangements with Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic, Jiuzhou Service and the Key Personnel) comply with all\napplicable PRC laws, rules and regulations, and do not violate, breach, contravene or otherwise conflict with any applicable PRC laws, rules or regulations, we\ncannot provide assurance that a regulatory authority will not determine that our corporate structure and contractual arrangements violate PRC laws, rules or\nregulations. If any such authority determines that our contractual arrangements are in violation of applicable PRC laws, rules or regulations, our contractual\narrangements may become invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to consolidate the operations of HJ Group with our results of operations. In\naddition, new PRC laws, rules and regulations may be introduced from time to time to impose additional requirements that may be applicable to our contractual\narrangements. For example, pursuant to the PRC Property Rights Law that became effective on October 1, 2007 (the “Property Law”), the pledge of any\nequity interests of a PRC private entity shall become effective once it is duly registered with the local branches of the SAIC. Following the promulgation of the\nProperty Law, the SAIC further issued theA dministrative Measures for Registrations of Share Pledge on September 1, 2008, which provided detailed\nprocedural guidance for the local SAIC offices to handle the registrations of pledged shares. The Equity Pledge Agreement that forms a part of the contractual\narrangements creates a legally binding obligation on the parties upon the execution date; however, the pledge established under such agreement does not\nbecome effective until due registration with the local SAIC office. On May 18, 2010, registration of the pledged equity interests in Jiuzhou Pharmacy was\ncompleted.\nThe Chinese government has broad discretion in dealing with violations of laws and regulations, including levying fines, revoking business and other\nlicenses, and requiring actions necessary for compliance. In particular, licenses and permits issued or granted to us by the relevant governmental bodies may be\nrevoked at a later time by higher regulatory bodies. We cannot predict the effect of the interpretation of existing or new Chinese laws or regulations on our\nbusinesses. We cannot provide assurance that our current ownership and operating structure will not be found in violation of any current or future Chinese laws\nor regulations. As a result, we may be subject to sanctions, including fines, and could be required to restructure our operations or cease the provision of certain\nservices. Any of these or similar actions could significantly disrupt our business operations or restrict us from conducting a substantial portion of our business\noperations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are determined to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws, rules or regulations, or fail to obtain or maintain any of the required\ngovernmental permits or approvals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations, including:\n● revoking the business and operating licenses of the HJ Group entities;\n● discontinuing or restricting the operations of the HJ Group entities;\n● imposing conditions or requirements with which we or the HJ Group entities may not be able to comply;\n● requiring us or the HJ Group entities to restructure the relevant ownership structure or operations; and/or\n● imposing fines.\nThe imposition of any of these penalties would severely disrupt our ability to conduct business and have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be adversely affected by complexity, uncertainties and changes in Chinese regulation of drugstores and the practice of medicine.\nThe Chinese government regulates drugstores and the practice of medicine, including foreign ownership and requirements for licenses and permits.\nThese laws and regulations are relatively new and evolving, and their interpretation and enforcement involve significant uncertainty. As a result, in certain\ncircumstances it may be difficult to determine what actions or omissions may be deemed to be a violation of applicable laws and regulations.\nThe interpretation and application of existing Chinese laws, regulations and policies and possible new laws, regulations or policies have created\nsubstantial uncertainties regarding the legality of existing and future foreign investments in, and the businesses and activities of, pharmaceutical businesses in\nChina, including our business. We currently only have contractual control over the HJ Group entities, and do not own them due to the restrictions on foreign\nownership of such companies. However, changes to laws in the PRC may force us to restructure our ownership structure or our operations, which would\nseverely disrupt our ability to conduct business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nUncertainties relating to the regulation of drugstores and medical practice in China also extend to evolving licensing practices, which means that\npermits, licenses or operations at our company may be subject to challenge. This may disrupt our business or subject us to sanctions, requirements to increase\ncapital, or other conditions or enforcement. In turn, this could compromise enforceability of related contractual arrangements, or have other harmful effects on\nus.\n25\nOur contractual arrangements with HJ Group and the Key Personnel may not be as effective in providing control over these entities as direct\nownership.\nWe have no equity ownership interest in HJ Group, and rely on contractual arrangements to control and operate the HJ Group companies and their\nbusinesses. These contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing control over these companies as direct ownership. For example, any one of\nthem could fail to take actions required for our business despite its contractual obligation to do so. Under such circumstances, we may have to rely on legal\nremedies under Chinese law, which may not be effective in providing us any relief. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that the Key Personnel will act in\nour best interests.\nSince we rely on contractual arrangements to control HJ Group and for substantially all of our revenue, the termination of such agreements will\nseverely and detrimentally affect our continuing business viability under our current corporate structure.\nSince we do not own equity interests of HJ Group, the termination of our contractual arrangements with them would sever our ability to continue\nreceiving payments from them under our current holding company structure. We cannot provide assurance that there will not be any event or reason that may\ncause the contractual arrangements to terminate. In the event that the contractual arrangements terminate, we will lose our control over them and their\nbusiness operations and, as a result, over our primary sources of revenue. This may have a severe and detrimental effect on our continuing business viability\nunder our current corporate structure, which in turn may affect the value of your investment. Should this occur, we may seek to acquire control of HJ Group\nthrough other means, although we cannot guarantee that we will do so, nor can we guarantee that we will be successful if we do.\nWe rely principally on dividends paid by our consolidated operating entities to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have, and any\nlimitation on the ability of our consolidated PRC entities to pay dividends to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our\nbusiness.\nWe are a holding company and rely principally on dividends paid by our consolidated PRC operating entities for cash requirements, including the funds\nrequired to service any debt we may incur, which are passed on to us through Jiuxin Management. If any of the consolidated operating entities incurs debt in its\nown name in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict dividends or other distributions on our equity interest to us. In addition, the PRC tax\nauthorities may require us to adjust our taxable income under the contractual arrangements in a manner that would materially and adversely affect our ability to\npay dividends and other distributions on our equity interest.\nFurthermore, applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations permit payment of dividends by our consolidated PRC entities only out of their retained\nearnings, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards. Under PRC laws, rules and regulations, our consolidated PRC entities are required\nto set aside at least ten percent (10%) of their after-tax profit each year, based on PRC accounting standards, into their statutory surplus reserve funds until the\naccumulative amount of such reserves reaches fifty percent (50%) of their respective registered capital. As a result, our consolidated PRC entities are\nrestricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net income to us whether in the form of dividends, loans or advances. As of March 31, 2019, our restricted\nreserves totaled $1,309,109(RMB 9,460,695). Our restricted reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. Any limitation on the ability of our consolidated\noperating entities to pay dividends to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our\nbusinesses, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nCertain management members of HJ Group have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may adversely affect our business and your ability for\nrecourse.\nMr. Lei Liu, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, is also the executive director of Jiuzhou Pharmacy, a general\npartner of Jiuzhou Clinic, and the supervising director of Jiuzhou Service. In addition, Mr. Liu has also lent us money out of his personal funds to help facilitate\nour payments of expenses in the U.S., as well as to purchase a land use right. Ms. Li Qi, our Corporate Secretary and a member of our Board of Directors, is\nthe general manager of each of Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service, and a general partner of Jiuzhou Clinic. Conflicts of interests between\ntheir respective duties to our company and HJ Group may arise. As our directors and executive officers, they have a duty of loyalty and care to us under U.S.\nand Hong Kong law when there are any potential conflicts of interests between our company and HJ Group. We cannot provide assurance, however, that\nwhen any conflicts of interest arise, both of them will act completely in our interests or that conflicts of interests will be resolved in our favor. For example, they\nmay determine that it is in HJ Group’s interests to sever the contractual arrangements with Jiuxin Management, irrespective of the effect such action may have\non us. In addition, either one of them could violate his or her legal duties by diverting business opportunities from us to others, thereby affecting the amount of\npayment that HJ Group is obligated to remit to us under the Consulting Services Agreement.\nIn the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under securities laws or otherwise as a result of any one of the circumstances\ndescribed above, it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against HJ Group, or our officers or directors who are members of the management,\nall of whom reside within China. Even if you are successful in bringing an action, the laws of China may render you unable to enforce a judgment against the\nassets of HJ Group and its management, all of which are located in China.\n26\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nWe rely on contractual arrangements with our VIE for our operations, which may not be as effective in providing control over these entities as direct\nownership.\nOur operations and financial results are dependent on our VIEs, Jiuzhou Pharmacy (including its subsidiaries and controlled entities), Jiuzhou Clinic and\nJiuzhou Service, in which we have no equity ownership interest and must rely on contractual arrangements to control and operate the businesses of our VIEs.\nThese contractual arrangements are not as effective in providing control over the VIEs as direct ownership. For example, the VIEs may be unwilling or unable\nto perform its contractual obligations under our commercial agreements. Consequently, we would not be able to conduct our operations in the manner currently\nplanned. In addition, the VIEs may seek to renew its agreements on terms that are disadvantageous to us. Although we have entered into a series of\nagreements that provide us with substantial ability to control the VIEs, we may not succeed in enforcing our rights under them insofar as our contractual rights\nand legal remedies under PRC law are inadequate. In addition, if we are unable to renew these agreements on favorable terms when these agreements expire\nor enter into similar agreements with other parties, our business may not be able to operate or expand, and our operating expenses may significantly increase.\nIn January 2015, China’s Ministry of Commerce released draft legislation that could change how the government regulates corporate structures,\nespecially for VIEs controlled by foreign investments. Instead of looking at “ownership”, the draft law focused on the entities or individuals hold control of a\nVIE. If a VIE is deemed to be controlled by foreign investors, it may be barred from operating in restricted sectors or the prohibited sectors listed on a\n“negative list”, where only companies controlled by Chinese nationals could operate, even if structured as VIEs. As of the report date, no formal legislation has\nbeen implemented.\nIn the event that the draft law is implemented in any form, and that the Company’s business was characterized as one of the “restricted” or\n“prohibited” sectors, the VIEs the Company currently maintains contractual arrangements with may be barred from operation which will materially adversely\naffect our business.\nChanges in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and the\nprofitability of such business.\nPolicies of the PRC government can have significant effects on economic conditions in China. Our interests may be adversely affected by changes in\npolicies by the PRC government, including:\n● changes in laws, regulations or their interpretation;\n● confiscatory taxation;\n● restrictions on currency conversion, imports or sources of supplies and export tariff; and\n● expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises.\nAlthough the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than two (2) decades, we cannot assure you that the government\nwill continue to pursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social or political\ndisruption, or other circumstances affecting the PRC’s political, economic and social life.\nUncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system could adversely affect us.\nWe conduct our business through our subsidiaries and controlled companies in the PRC. Our operations in China are governed by Chinese laws and\nregulations. We are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable to WFOE. The\nChinese legal system is based on written statutes. Prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value.\nSince 1979, Chinese legislation and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China.\nHowever, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic\nactivities in China. In particular, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published decisions and their\nnonbinding nature, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties. In addition, the Chinese legal system is based in part\non government policies and internal rules (some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all) that may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may\nnot be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in\nsubstantial costs and diversion of our resources and our management’s attention.\n27\nYou may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in China against us or\nour management based on United States or other foreign laws.\nWe are a holding company and conduct our business through our subsidiaries and controlled companies in the PRC. In addition, all of our operating\nassets are located in, and all of our other senior executive officers reside within, China. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process within\nthe United States or elsewhere outside China upon those of our senior executive officers and directors that do not reside in the United States, including with\nrespect to matters arising under U.S. federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws. Moreover, our Chinese counsel has advised us that China does\nnot have treaties with the United States or many other countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgment of courts. As a result,\nour public shareholders may face substantially more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management or directors than would\nshareholders of a corporation with assets and management located in the United States.\nWe may need to obtain additional governmental approvals to open new drugstores. Our inability to obtain such approvals will have a material\nadverse effect on our business and growth.\nAccording to the Measures on the Administration of Foreign Investment in the Commercial Sector (the “Measures”) promulgated by China’s\nMinistry of Commerce (the “MOC”), which became effective on June 1, 2004, a company that is directly owned by a foreign invested enterprise needs to\nobtain relevant governmental approvals before it opens new retail stores. However, there are no specific laws, rules or regulations with respect to whether\nsuch approvals are necessary for a company that is contractually controlled by a foreign invested enterprise. In addition, the Measures state that the MOC will\npromulgate a detailed implementation regulation to govern foreign invested enterprises engaging in drug sale. However, such implementation regulation has not\nyet been promulgated. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that the MOC will not require such approvals to be obtained, or as to when any regulation of\nsuch requirements may be implemented. If additional governmental approvals are deemed to be necessary and we are unable to obtain such approvals on a\ntimely basis or at all, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as the trading price of our common stock, will be materially\nand adversely affected.\nThe advent of recent healthcare reform directives from China’s central government may increase both competition and our cost of doing business.\nUnder the auspices of the Healthy China 2020 program (the “Program”), published by China’s National Development and Reform Commission in\nOctober 2008, the central government has set in motion a series of policies in fairly rapid succession aimed to improve China’s healthcare system. Such policies\ninclude (1) discouraging hospitals from both prescribing and dispensing medication, (2) the unveiling in April 2009 of formal healthcare reform guidelines aimed\nat improving the availability of and subsidies for “essential” drugs, and (3) the announcement in August 2009 of China’s National Essential Drugs List\n(“NEDL”), initially listing approximately three hundred (300) medicines to be sold at government-controlled prices. While an underlying goal of these policies is\nto make drugs more accessible to China’s poorer population, these policies also serve to create opportunities that in turn will intensify business competition in\nthe Chinese retail drugstore industry, as well as competition for skilled labor and retail spaces. Additionally, we expect the NEDL to result in a rise in the\nnumber of government-subsidized community healthcare service centers, which in turn may erode the convenience and price advantage that our drugstores\ntraditionally enjoy against hospitals.\nThe PRC’s labor law restricts our ability to reduce our workforce in the PRC in the event of an economic downturn and may increase our production\ncosts.\nIn June 2007, the National People’s Congress of the PRC enacted new labor law legislation called the Labor Contract Law, which became effective\non January 1, 2008 (the “LC Law”). The LC Law formalized workers’ rights concerning overtime hours, pensions, layoffs, employment contracts and the role\nof trade unions. Considered one of the strictest labor laws in the world, among other things, the LC Law provides for specific standards and procedures for the\ntermination of an employment contract and places the burden of proof on the employer. In addition, the law requires the payment of a statutory severance pay\nupon the termination of an employment contract in most cases, including the case of the expiration of a fixed-term employment contract. Further, the LC Law\nrequires an employer to conclude an “employment contract without a fixed-term” with any employee who either has worked for the same employer for ten\n(10) consecutive years or more or has had two (2) consecutive fixed-term contracts with the same employer. An “employment contract without a fixed term”\ncan no longer be terminated on the ground of the expiration of the contract, although it can still be terminated pursuant to the standards and procedures set forth\nunder the new law. Because of the lack of implementing rules for the LC Law and the precedents for the enforcement of such a law, the standards and\nprocedures set forth under the LC Law in relation to the termination of an employment contract have raised concerns among foreign investment enterprises in\nthe PRC that such “employment contract without a fixed term” might in fact become a “lifetime, permanent employment contract.” Finally, under the LC Law,\ndownsizing of either more than twenty (20) people or more than ten percent (10%) of the workforce may occur only under specified circumstances, such as a\nrestructuring undertaken pursuant to the PRC’s Enterprise Bankruptcy Law, or where a company suffers serious difficulties in production and/or business\noperations, or where there has been a material change in the objective economic circumstances relied upon by the parties at the time of the conclusion of the\nemployment contract, thereby making the performance of such employment contract impossible. To date, there has been very little guidance and precedent as\nto how such specified circumstances for downsizing will be interpreted and enforced by the relevant PRC authorities. All of our employees working for us\nexclusively within the PRC are covered by the LC Law and thus, our ability to adjust the size of our operations when necessary in periods of recession or less\nsevere economic downturns may be curtailed. Accordingly, if we face future periods of decline in business activity generally or adverse economic periods\nspecific to our business, the LC Law can be expected to exacerbate the adverse effect of the economic environment on our results of operations and financial\ncondition.\n28\nWe cannot be certain that the Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of the Renminbi,\nespecially with respect to foreign exchange transactions.\nFluctuations in the value of the Renminbi may have a material and adverse effect on your investment. The change in value of the Renminbi against the\nU.S. dollar is affected by, among other things, changes in PRC’s political and economic conditions. We receive substantially all of our revenues in RMB. Under\nour current structure, our income is primarily derived from payments from the three (3) HJ Group companies. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency\nmay restrict the ability of our subsidiaries and our PRC affiliated entities to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to us, or\notherwise satisfy their foreign currency denominated obligations. Under existing Chinese foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items,\nincluding profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from\nSAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be\nconverted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses, such as the repayment of bank loans denominated in foreign currencies. The\nChinese government may also, at its discretion, restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange\ncontrol system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign\ncurrencies to our stockholders.\nFrom 1995 until July 2005, the People’s Bank of China intervened in the foreign exchange market to maintain an exchange rate of approximately\nRenminbi 8.3 per U.S. dollar. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed this policy and began allowing modest appreciation of the Renminbi versus the\nU.S. dollar. Under the new policy, the Renminbi was permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies.\nThis change in policy caused the Renminbi to appreciate approximately 21.5% against the U.S. dollar over the following three years. As a consequence, the\nRenminbi has fluctuated sharply since July 2008 against other freely traded currencies, in tandem with the U.S. dollar. It is difficult to predict how long the\ncurrent situation may last and when and how it may change again. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a\nsubstantial liberalization of its currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation in the value of the Renminbi against the U.S.\ndollar. Significant revaluation of the Renminbi may have a material and adverse effect on your investment. For example, to the extent that we need to convert\nU.S. dollars we receive from securities offering into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse\neffect on the Renminbi amount we would receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of\nmaking payments for dividends on our common stock or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a\nnegative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us. In August 2015, the PRC Government devalued its currency by approximately 3%, represented the\nlargest yuan depreciation for 20 years. Concerns remain that China’s slowing economy, and in particular its exports, will need a stimulus that can only come\nfrom further cuts in the exchange rate.\nFluctuations in the value of RMB may have a material adverse effect on your investment.\nThe value of RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and\neconomic conditions. Our revenues, costs, and financial assets are mostly denominated in RMB, while our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly,\nthis may result in gains or losses from currency translation on our financial statements. We rely entirely on fees paid to us by our affiliated entities in China.\nTherefore, any significant fluctuation in the value of RMB may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenues, earnings, financial position, and the\nvalue of, and any dividends payable on, our stock in U.S. dollars. For example, an appreciation of RMB against the U.S. dollar would, to the extent that we\nneed to convert U.S. dollars into RMB for such purposes, make any new RMB denominated investments or expenditures more costly to us. An appreciation of\nRMB against the U.S. dollar would result in foreign currency translation gains for financial reporting purposes when we translate our RMB denominated\nfinancial assets into U.S. dollars, as the U.S. dollar is our reporting currency.\nIn addition, appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S.\ndollars without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. The income statements of our operations are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these\nforeign currencies denominated transactions results in reduced revenue, operating expenses and net income for our international operations. Similarly, to the\nextent the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased revenue,\noperating expenses and net income for our international operations. We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial\nstatements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the conversion of the foreign\nsubsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss, which is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.\nVery limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging\ntransactions. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited, and we may not\nbe able to successfully hedge our exposure at all.\n29\nJiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service are subject to restrictions on making payments to us.\nWe rely substantially on our contractual arrangements with Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service for our revenue. The Chinese\ngovernment also imposes controls on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of China. We may experience\ndifficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency. Furthermore, if these companies incur debt on their own\nin the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to make payments. If we are unable to receive all of the revenues from our operations\nthrough these contractual arrangements, we may be unable to pay dividends on our common shares.\nDividends we receive from our subsidiaries located in the PRC may be subject to PRC withholding tax.\nThe EIT Law provides that a maximum income tax rate of twenty percent (20%) is applicable to dividends payable to non-PRC investors that are\n“non-resident enterprises,” to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC. However, the State Council has reduced such rate to ten\npercent (10%) through the implementation regulations. We are a Nevada holding company and substantially all of our income is derived from our subsidiaries\nand controlled companies located in the PRC. Therefore, dividends paid to us from China may be subject to the ten percent (10%) income tax if we are\nconsidered a “non-resident enterprise” under the EIT Law. If we are required to pay income tax for any dividends we receive from our PRC subsidiaries\nunder the EIT Law and its implementation regulations, it may have a material and adverse effect on our net income and materially reduce the amount of\ndividends, if any, we may pay to our shareholders.\nWe face risks related to disease epidemics and other outbreaks.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of disease outbreaks. Any prolonged recurrence of any adverse public health developments in\nChina may have a material adverse effect on our business operations. For instance, health or other government regulations adopted in response may require\ntemporary closure of our stores or offices. Such closures would severely disrupt our business operations and adversely affect our results of operations. We\nhave not adopted any written preventive measures or contingency plans to combat any future epidemic outbreak.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in\nbribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some that may compete\nwith us, are not subject to these prohibitions, and therefore may have a competitive advantage over us. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other\nfraudulent practices may occur in the PRC. If our competitors engage in these practices, they may receive preferential treatment in the PRC, giving them an\nadvantage in securing business, which would put us at a disadvantage. We cannot provide assurance that our employees or other agents will not engage in such\nconduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe\npenalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf relations between the United States and China worsen, investors may be unwilling to hold or buy our stock and our stock price may decrease.\nAt various times in recent years, the United States and China have had significant disagreements over political and economic issues. Controversies\nmay arise in the future between the two countries. Any political or trade controversies between the United States and China, whether or not directly related to\nour business, could reduce the price of our common stock.\nOur auditor, like other independent registered public accounting firms operating in China, is not permitted to be subject to inspection by Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board, and consequently investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection.\nOur auditor, the independent registered public accounting firm that issued the audit reports included elsewhere in this annual report, as an auditor of\ncompanies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the\n“PCAOB”), is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess its compliance with the laws of the United\nStates and applicable professional standards. Our auditor is located in China and the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections on auditors in China\nwithout the approval of the PRC authorities. Therefore, our auditor, like other independent registered public accounting firms operating in China, is currently not\ninspected by the PCAOB.\nIn May 2013, the PCAOB announced that it has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) on Enforcement Cooperation with the\nChina Securities Regulatory Commission (the “CSRC”) and the Ministry of Finance (the “MOF”). The MOU establishes a cooperative framework between\nthe parties for the production and exchange of audit documents relevant to investigations in both countries’ respective jurisdictions. More specifically, it\nprovides a mechanism for the parties to request and receive from each other assistance in obtaining documents and information in furtherance of their\ninvestigative duties. In addition to developing enforcement MOU, the PCAOB has been engaged in continuing discussions with the CSRC and MOF to permit\njoint inspections in China of audit firms that are registered with the PCAOB and audit Chinese companies that trade on U.S. exchanges.\n30\nInspections of other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside of China have identified deficiencies in those firms’ audit procedures and quality\ncontrol procedures, and such deficiencies may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The inability of the PCAOB to\nconduct inspections of independent registered public accounting firms operating in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor’s\naudit procedures or quality control procedures, and to the extent that such inspections might have facilitated improvements in our auditor’s audit procedures and\nquality control procedures, investors may be deprived of such benefits.\nThe slowing economic growth in China may assert a negative impact on our operation and financial results.\nAccording to several articles published by the Wall Street Journal, CNN, and BBC News in January 2016, after experiencing rapid growth for more\nthan a decade, China’s economy has been hit by shrinking foreign and domestic demand, weak investment, factory overcapacity and oversupply in the property\nmarket, and has experienced a painful slowdown in the last two years. In 2016, China’s economy grew by 6.7%, compared with 6.9% a year earlier, marking\nits slowest growth in a quarter of a century. As the government tried to shift the growth engine away from manufacturing and debt-fueled investment toward\nthe services sector and consumer spending, the outlook of the Chinese economy is uncertain.\nIn the next two to three years, China’s growth performance could deteriorate because of the overhang of its real estate bubble, massive\nmanufacturing overcapacity, and the lack of new growth engines. The International Monetary Fund expected China’s economy to grow by 6.4% in 2018-2020.\nIf China’s economy slows down further, it may negatively affect our business operation and financial results.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Securities\nTo date, we have not paid any cash dividends and no cash dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and we may not have sufficient funds legally available to\npay dividends. Even if the funds are legally available for distribution, we may nevertheless decide not to pay any dividends. We intend to retain all earnings for\nour operations.\nNASDAQ may delist our common stock from trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market for failing to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00, which\ncould limit investors’ ability to effect transactions in our common stock and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOn May 9, 2013, we received a letter from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”), notifying us of our failure to maintain a minimum\nclosing bid price of $1.00 over the then preceding thirty (30) consecutive trading days for its common stock, as required by NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2)\n(the “Bid Price Rule”). The letter stated that the company had until November 5, 2013, to demonstrate compliance by maintaining a minimum closing bid price\nof at least $1.00 for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive trading days. In the meantime, we were included in a list of non-compliant companies posted on\nNASDAQ’s website commencing on May 16, 2013.\nOn November 6, 2013, NASDAQ granted us an additional 180-day period, or until May 5, 2014, to remain listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and\nto regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. Under NASDAQ Listing Rules, we were granted this extension because we met the continued listing\nrequirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other applicable NASDAQ listing requirements, except the bid price requirement.\nOn January 16, 2014, we received a letter from NASDAQ notifying us that we had regained compliance with the Bid Price Rule, as the closing bid\nprice of our common stock had been at or above $1.00 per share for at least 10 consecutive trading days. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will\nremain compliant with the Bid Price Rule in the future. If NASDAQ delists our common stock from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material\nadverse consequences including:\n● a limited availability of market quotations for our common stock;\n● a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n● a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nAlthough publicly traded, the trading market in our common stock may be substantially less liquid than the average stock quoted on the NASDAQ\nCapital Market, and such low trading volume may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nAlthough our common stock has been listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market since April 22, 2010, the historical trading volume of our common stock\nhas generally been low. Limited trading volume will subject our shares of common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for you to sell your\nshares of common stock at a price that is attractive to you.\n31\nThe market price for our stock may be volatile, and such volatility may subject us to securities litigation.\nThe market price for our stock may be volatile and, when compared to seasoned issuers, subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors,\nmany of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n● actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n● changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts;\n● conditions in the retail pharmacy markets;\n● changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other retail pharmacy operators;\n● announcements by us or our competitors of new products, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n● addition or departure of key personnel;\n● fluctuations of exchange rates between RMB and the U.S. dollar;\n● intellectual property litigation; and\n● general economic or political conditions in China.\nAs an illustration of such volatility, the closing price of our common stock during the fifty two (52) weeks preceding the date of this report ranged from\na low of $1.17 to a high of $2.73. In addition, the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not\nrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our\nstock.\nIn the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its\nsecurities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert\nmanagement’s attention and resources.\nTechniques employed by manipulative short sellers in Chinese small-cap stocks may drive down the market price of our common stock.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying\nidentical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from the difference in the sale price of the borrowed securities\nand the purchase price of the replacement shares. As it is therefore in the short seller’s best interests for the price of the stock to decline, there have been\nincidents of short sellers publishing, or arranging to publish negative opinions in order to create negative market momentum. While traditionally these disclosed\nshorts have been limited in their ability to access mainstream business media or to otherwise create negative market rumors, the rise of the Internet and\ntechnological advancements regarding document creation, videotaping and publication by weblog (“blogging”) have allowed many disclosed shorts to publicly\nattack a company’s credibility, strategy and veracity by means of so-called research reports that mimic the type of investment analysis performed by large Wall\nStreet firms and independent research analysts. These short attacks have, in the past, resulted in the selling of shares in the market, on occasion on a large\nscale and broad base. Issuers with business operations based in the PRC, that have limited trading volumes and that are susceptible to higher volatility levels\nthan U.S. domestic large-cap stocks can be particularly vulnerable to such short attacks.\nThese short seller publications are not regulated by any governmental, self-regulatory organization or other official authority in the U.S., are not subject\nto the certification requirements imposed by the SEC in Regulation Analyst Certification and, accordingly, the opinions they express may be based on distortion\nof the actual facts or, in some cases, fabrication of the facts. In light of the limited risks involved in publishing such information, and the enormous profit that\ncan be made from running just one successful short attack, unless the short sellers become subject to significant penalties, it is more likely than not that\ndisclosed shorts will continue to issue such reports.\nWhile we intend to strongly defend our public filings against any such short seller attacks, oftentimes we are constrained, either by principles of\nfreedom of speech, applicable state law (often called Anti-SLAPP statutes), or issues of commercial confidentiality, in the manner in which we can proceed\nagainst the relevant short seller. You should be aware that in light of the relative freedom to operate that such persons enjoy – oftentimes blogging from outside\nthe U.S. with little or no assets or identity requirements – should we be targeted for such an attack and the rumors not dismissed by market participants, our\nstock will likely suffer from a temporary, or possibly long term, decline in market price.\nOur officers and directors own a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock, which will enable them to influence many significant\ncorporate actions and in certain circumstances may prevent a change in control that would otherwise be beneficial to our shareholders.\nAs of June 28, 2019, our directors and executive officers collectively controlled approximately 9,244,482 or 28.6% of our outstanding shares of stock\nentitled to vote on all corporate actions. These stockholders, acting together, could have a substantial impact on matters requiring the vote of the shareholders,\nincluding the election of our directors and most of our corporate actions. This control could delay, defer or prevent others from initiating a potential merger,\ntakeover or other change in our control, even if these actions would benefit us and our shareholders. This control could adversely affect the voting and other\nrights of our other shareholders and could depress the market price of our common stock.\n32\nThe elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under Nevada law and the existence of indemnification rights for\nour directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and\nemployees.\nOur bylaws contain specific provisions that eliminate the liability of our directors for monetary damages to our company and shareholders, and we are\nprepared to give such indemnification to our directors and officers to the extent provided by Nevada law. We may also have contractual indemnification\nobligations under our employment agreements with our officers. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in our company incurring substantial\nexpenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and any\ncosts resulting therefrom may also discourage our company from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and\nmay similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might\notherwise benefit our company and shareholders.\nLegislative actions, potential new accounting pronouncements and higher insurance costs may impact our future financial position and results of\noperations.\nOver the last decade or so, there have been many regulatory changes, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) and the\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. There may potentially be new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings or\nchanges that will have an impact on our future financial position and results of operations. In addition, insurers are likely to increase premiums as a result of\nhigh claims rates over the past several years, which we expect will increase our premiums for insurance policies. These and other potential changes could\nmaterially increase the expenses we report under generally accepted accounting principles, and adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nWe are subject to reporting obligations under U.S. securities laws. The SEC, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as amended,\nadopted rules requiring every public company to include a management report on such company’s internal controls over financial reporting in its annual report,\nwhich contains management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. We reported certain material weaknesses\ninvolving control activities, specifically internal control weaknesses relating to finance personnel, in light of the continuing lack of sufficient experience by our\naccounting staff in U.S. GAAP-based reporting and SEC rules and regulations. Such material weaknesses were noted for the past five (5) fiscal years, based\non factors including: (i) the number of adjustments proposed by our independent auditors during our quarterly review and annual audit processes; (ii) the\nsignificance of the audit adjustments and their impact on the overall financial statements; (iii) how appropriately we complied with U.S. GAAP on transactions;\nand (iv) how accurately we prepared supporting information to provide to our independent auditors on a quarterly and annual basis. As such, we did not\nmaintain effective controls and did not implement adequate and proper supervisory review to ensure that significant internal control deficiencies could be\ndetected and/or prevented.\nAlthough we believe that we have made significant efforts to address the foregoing weaknesses, we believe that our efforts to date have not yet been\nsufficient to fully remediate such weaknesses. We will continue our efforts during the current fiscal year, although there can be no assurance that compliance\nwill be achieved in this time frame.\nOur reporting obligations as a public company will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for\nthe foreseeable future. Effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports\nand are important to help prevent fraud. As a result, our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could result in the\nloss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our\ncommon stock. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will incur considerable costs and use significant management time and other resources in an effort to\ncomply with Section 404 and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.\nNot applicable to a smaller reporting company like us.\n33\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nWe are headquartered in Hangzhou, China. We own three properties. Additionally, our current leased properties are as follows:\nSize Lease expiration\nDescription Location (square meters) date\nPrincipal executive office Hai Wai Hai Tongxin Mansion Floor 5&6 4,000 December 27, 2021\nGong Shu District, Hangzhou City\nZhejiang Province, China\nPharmacies (1) Various locations in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China Range from September 2018 to\n79 to 1,713 October 2033\nFarmland for herb cultivation (2) Qianhong Township, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China 196,677 February 1, 2040\nLand (2) Qianhong Township, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China 18,616 February 1, 2040\n(1) As of the date of this report, we maintain operating leases in connection with our 121 pharmacies. See Note 10, “Long Term Deposits,” and Note 22,\n“Commitments and Contingencies” to the Financial Statements. The leases do not contain any material escalating lease payments or contingent rental\npayment terms. We must negotiate with the landlords for an extension of the current leases or enter into new leases upon their termination, upon which\nour landlords may request a rent increase. Under applicable PRC law, we have priority over other potential lessees with respect to the leased store\nspace on the same terms. We also do not expect any significant difficulties in renewing the existing leases upon their expiration, where desired. Our\ncommunity stores are normally relatively small in size and the fixtures inside such stores are easily movable. As a result, we do not expect our drugstore\noperations to be materially and adversely affected by any failure to renew current leases or enter into new leases.\n(2) We lease the land from The People’s Government of Qianhong Village under a 30-year lease entered in February 2010. The rent for the land was\nprepaid in full in May 2010. See Note 11, “Other Noncurrent Assets,” and Note 12, “Intangible Assets,” to the Financial Statements.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nWe know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending\nlitigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder holding more than five\npercent of our common stock, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our company.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES.\nNot applicable.\n34\nPART II\nITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER\nPURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.\nMarket Information\nOur common stock trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “CJJD”.\nBased on the records of our transfer agent, we had 32,936,786 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of June 28, 2019.\nHolders\nBased on the records of our transfer agent, there were 43 stockholders of record of our common stock as of June 28, 2019 (not including beneficial\nowners who hold shares at broker/dealers in “street name”).\nTransfer Agent\nOur transfer agent is American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, whose address is 6201, 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11219, and\nwhose telephone number is (718) 921-8206.\n35\nDividends\nWhile there are no restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends, we have not paid, and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends on our\ncommon stock in the foreseeable future. Our policy is to retain all earnings, if any, to provide funds for the operation and expansion of our business. The\ndeclaration of dividends, if any, will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, who may consider such factors as our results of operations, financial\ncondition, capital needs and acquisition strategy, among others, in making its determination.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nPlease see the discussion in Item 12 titled “Equity Compensation Plan Information” below.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nOn January 23, 2017, we issued 4,840,000 shares of Common Stock to an institutional investor for a total proceeds of $10,648,000. The shares are\nrestrictive with a standard legend under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). No other sales of unregistered securities were made in\nfiscal 2018 and 2019.\nOn April 15, 2019, we issued unregistered warrants to the investors in a concurrent private placement to a registered direct offering pursuant to a\nSecurities Purchase Agreement dated April 11, 2019 (the “2019 Securities Purchase Agreement”), by and among the Company and the purchasers named\ntherein, to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,000,006 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.00 per share (the “2019 Warrants”). The 2019\nWarrants shall be initially exercisable six months following issuance and expire five and one-half years from the issuance date of the 2019 Warrants. H.C.\nWainwright & Co., LLC (the “Placement Agent”) (or its designees) shall also receive warrants to purchase such number of shares of common stock as is\nequal to 6% of the aggregate number of shares of common stock sold in the offering, or 240,000 warrants (the “2019 PA Warrants”), with substantially the\nsame terms as the 2019 Warrants being issued to the investors, except that the Placement Agent’s warrants will expire on April 11, 2024 and the warrants\nexercise price shall be $3.125.\nWithin 30 business days from the date of the 2019 Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company shall file a registration statement on Form S-1\nproviding for the resale by the investors of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the 2019 Warrants and the 2019 PA Warrants and use commercially\nreasonable best efforts to cause such registration to become effective no later than 90 business days from the date of the 2019 Securities Purchase\nAgreement.\nITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.\nNot applicable.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and\n2018 should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included elsewhere in this\nreport. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans,\nobjectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-\nlooking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under the “Risk Factors,” “Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements” and “Description of Business” sections and elsewhere in this report. We use words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,”\n“project,” “continuing,” “ongoing,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “predict” and similar expressions to identify\nforward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable\nassumptions within the bound of our knowledge of our business, our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these\nstatements. Factors that could contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of this\nreport. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason even if new information becomes available or\nother events occur in the future other than in compliance with the SEC rules and regulations.\nOur financial statements are prepared in U.S. Dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates. See “Exchange Rates” at the end of this section for information concerning the exchanges rates at which Renminbi (“RMB”) were translated\ninto U.S. Dollars (“USD” or “$”) at various pertinent dates and for pertinent periods.\nOverview\nWe currently operate in four business segments in China: (1) retail drugstores, (2) online pharmacy, (3) wholesale of products similar to those that we\ncarry in our pharmacies, and (4) farming and selling herbs used for traditional Chinese medicine (“TCM”).\n36\nOur drugstores offer customers a wide variety of pharmaceutical products, including prescription and over-the-counter (“OTC”) drugs, nutritional\nsupplements, TCM, personal and family care products, medical devices, and convenience products, including consumable, seasonal, and promotional items.\nAdditionally, we have licensed doctors of both western medicine and TCM on site for consultation, examination and treatment of common ailments at\nscheduled hours. As of March 31, 2019, we had 121 pharmacies in Hangzhou city and its adjacent town Lin’an under the store brand of “Jiuzhou Grand\nPharmacy.”\nSince May 2010, we have also been selling certain OTC drugs, medical devices, nutritional supplements and other sundry products online. Our online\npharmacy sells through several third-party platforms such as Alibaba’s Tmall, JD.com and Amazon.com, and the Company’s own platform all over China. In\nfiscal year 2019, in order to keep competitive in certain third-party platforms such as Tmall, we have spent reasonable resources on marketing our products\nthrough these third-party platforms. Our sales through our own platform are primarily generated by customers who use their private commercial medical\ninsurances package.\nWe operate a wholesale business through Jiuxin Medicine distributing third-party pharmaceutical products (similar to those carried by our pharmacies)\nprimarily to trading companies and other local drugstores in China. We also farm certain herbs used in TCM but have not made sales in the year ended March\n31, 2019.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn preparing our audited consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica, we are required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect: (i) the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities; (ii) the disclosure of\nour contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period; and (iii) the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during each reporting period.\nWe continually evaluate these estimates based on our own historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions, our\nexpectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions, which together form our basis for making judgments about\nmatters that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, our actual\nresults could differ materially from those estimates.\nWe believe that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of\noperations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the statement of operations and corresponding balance\nsheet accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future financial statements.\nWhen reading our financial statements, you should consider: (i) our critical accounting policies; (ii) the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the\napplication of such policies; and (iii) the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. The critical accounting policies and related\njudgments and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are identified in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements accompanying in this\nreport.\nRevenue recognition\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, which creates Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The new guidance outlines a\nsingle comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The core principle of the guidance is that an\nentity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the\nentity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosure to help users of financial\nstatements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. The new guidance supersedes most current revenue\nrecognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including\ninterim periods within that reporting period, and permits early adoption on a limited basis. The update permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative\neffect transition method. On April 1, 2018, we adopted the guidance in ASC 606 and all the related amendments and applied the new revenue standard to all\ncontracts using the modified retrospective method. Based on the new standard our revenue recognition policies related to membership rewards programs will\nchange. But the impact of the new revenue standard was not material and there was no adjustment required to the opening balance of retained earnings. We\nexpect the impact of the adoption of the new revenue standard to be immaterial to our net income on an ongoing basis.\nImpairment of definite-lived intangible assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\nvalue of an asset may not be recoverable. These long-lived assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows\ncan be identified. When evaluating these long-lived assets for potential impairment, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the\nasset group’s estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than that carrying amount of\nthe asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset\ngroup’s estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). If required, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group’s\ncarrying value that exceeds the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges).\nThe long-lived asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate each asset group’s future\nsales, profitability and cash flows. When preparing these estimates, the Company considers historical results and current operating trends and consolidated\nsales, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic\nand regulatory conditions, efforts of third party organizations to reduce their prescription drug costs and/or increased member co-payments, the continued\nefforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns.\n37\nThere were no material impairment losses for definite-lived intangible assets recognized in any of the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.\nWe currently recorded awarded membership points as accrued expense. The adoption of the policy will require us to deduct the membership rewards\ndirectly from our retail revenue. In other words, we will present such amounts in net sales as opposed to our current reduction of operation expense\nclassification.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018:\nYears ended December 31,\n2019 2018\nPercentage Percentage\nof total of total\nAmount revenue Amount revenue\nRevenue $ 107,551,012 100.0% $ 96,112,706 100.0%\nGross profit $ 25,108,043 23.3% $ 20,125,169 20.9%\nSelling expenses $ 24,265,184 22.6% $ 18,739,492 19.5%\nGeneral and administrative expenses $ 1,718,989 1.6% $ 17,823,661 18.5%\nImpairment of long-lived assets $ - -% $ 1,583,186 1.6%\nLoss from operations $ (876,130) (0.8)% $ (18,021,170) (18.8)%\nInterest income $ 112,887 0.1% $ 478,976 0.5%\nOther income (expense), net $ (93,311) (0.1)% $ 201,096 0.2%\nChange in fair value of derivative liability $ (326,452) (0.3)% $ 357,421 0.4%\nIncome tax expense $ 134,763 0.1% $ 76,256 0.1%\nNet loss $ (1,317,769) (1.2)% $ (17,059,933) (17.7)%\nRevenue\nPrimarily due to the rise in our retail stores pharmacy business, revenue increased by $11,438,306 or 11.9% for the year ended March 31, 2019, as\ncompared to the year ended March 31, 2018, partially offset by the decrease in our online sales.\nRevenue by Segment\nThe following table breaks down the revenue for our four business segments for the year ended March 31, 2019 and 2018:\nFor the year ended March 31,\n2019 2018\n% of total % of total Variance by % of\nAmount revenue Amount revenue amount change\nRevenue from retail drugstores $ 72,334,409 67.3% $ 61,977,582 64.5% $ 10,356,827 16.7%\nRevenue from online sales 8,784,459 8.1% 12,132,930 12.6% (3,348,471) (27.6)%\nRevenue from wholesale business 26,432,144 24.6% 22,002,194 22.9% 4,429,950 20.1%\nRevenue from farming business - -% - -% - -%\nTotal revenue $ 107,551,012 100.0% $ 96,112,706 100.0% $ 11,438,306 11.9%\n38\nRetail drugstores sales, which accounted for approximately 67.3% of total revenue for the year ended March 31, 2019, increased by $10,356,827, or\n16.7% compared to the year ended March 31, 2018, to $72,334,409. Same-store sales increased by approximately $9,465,094, or 15.9%, while new stores\ncontributed approximately $755,419 in revenue in the year ended March 31, 2019.Excluding the RMB depreciation effect, the same store sales increased by\napproximately 17.4% period over period.\nThe increase in our retail drugstore sales is primarily due to consumer-facing benefits such as emphasis on on-site medical care, chronic disease\nmanagement services, incremental DTP (Direct-to-Patient) business caused by continuous hospital medical reform, promotional campaigns such as our fifteen\nyear anniversary sales, and maturing of stores opened a year ago. Convenient on-site medical support at our pharmacies has been our hallmark from the\nbeginning of our business. Suitable medical support from our doctors has proven to be critical to our superior store sales. Linking doctor care with drug sales\nhas become our business guidance for the future. By adding more doctor-provided services at stores, we have been able to promote our store sales. In January\n2019, we had a grand opening of another flagship store in South Hangzhou. The store hosts both our drugstore and clinic and is expected to expand our\nbusiness model.\nDTP drugs are usually low profit margin new medicines not sold at hospitals. As part of the PRC’s recent medical reform package, local governments\nrequire the revenue percentage from drug sales at public hospitals to decline. In order to achieve lower drug sales percentage out of their total revenue, the\npublic hospitals chose to abandon sales of low profit margin DTP products first. As the biggest drugstore network in Hangzhou City, Jiuzhou Pharmacy had\nquite a few of our stores located adjacent to local hospitals. Additionally, we have actively contacted local vendors of certain DTP products that we were\npreviously not selling and were able to sell these DTP products in our stores. By setting special counters selling DTP products at our stores, sales in our\ndrugstores have increased.\nImplementing marketing campaigns suited to local communities has been an important tool in driving sales. We usually cooperated with brand-name\npharmaceutical manufacturers in our marketing campaigns. Brand-name medical products sales improve our store reputation, which is beneficial to our long-\nterm sales.\nFurthermore, since fiscal year 2018, we have accelerated our expansion of new stores, which is expected to generate more retail drugstore revenues.\nEighteen stores have become qualified for municipal government insurance reimbursement after about a year’s operation. Sales reimbursed from municipal\ngovernment insurance program usually account for more than 50% of our total sales at maturing stores. As these stores gained such qualifications, their sales\nincreased quickly as compared to the previous year. Our store count is 122 at March, 2018 and 121 at March 31, 2019.\nOur online pharmacy sales decreased by approximately $3,348,471, or 27.6% for the year ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended\nMarch 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily caused by a decline in our sales via various e-commerce platforms, offset by the increase in business referred\nfrom Pharmacy Benefit Management (“PBM”) providers, as further explained below. We operate our online business via e-commerce platforms such as Tmall\nand JD.com as well as our own official online pharmacy website. Such arrangements with third-party platforms have exposed our online presence to a wider\nconsumer base due to the official suspension of OTC drug sales on e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba and strong competition, our sales via these e-\ncommerce platforms have been curtailed. As a result, our sales via these e-commerce platforms decreased by 33.4% period over period. We are adding more\nnon-medical health products such as nutritional supplements into our sales menu to counteract the decline in sale of OTC drug category. Our official website\nsales increased by 7,502 or 0.4% year over year, primarily as we explored more Pharmacy Benefit Management (“PBM”) providers, who draw insured\ncustomers from private health insurance companies to spend on health products at drugstores.\nWholesale revenue increased by $4,429,950 or 20.1%, primarily as a result of our ability to resell certain products, which our retail stores made large\norder on, to other vendors. As our retail drugstores achieved large quantity sales of certain brand name products, we were able to bargain for lower purchase\nprices than the market level on these merchandises. As a result, vendors who were unable to obtain a better price than ours, turned to us for these products,\ncausing the increase in the wholesale volume. Additionally, we strategically act as provincial agent for Dong’e Ejiao and sold significant amounts of Ejiao with\nin Zhejiang Province. However, hospitals are still the dominant drug retailers in China. Local hospitals usually have strong ties with their existing suppliers and\nwe have not been able to make significant progress in becoming a major supplier to local hospitals.\nIn the year ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, we have not harvested and generated revenue from our farming business. We planted ginkgo trees during\nthe year ended March 31, 2013. A ginkgo tree may have a growth period of up to twenty years before it is mature enough for harvest. Usually, the longer it\ngrows the more valuable it becomes. We plan to continue cultivating the trees in order to maximize their market value in the future. We anticipate that we will\ncontinue to grow ginkgo trees and cultivate other herbs in the future.\n39\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased by $4,982,874 or 24.8% period over period primarily as a result of an increase in gross profit provided by retail stores sale,\nwhich increased significantly in the year ended March 31, 2019. At the same time, gross margin increased from 20.9% to 23.3% due to higher retail profit\nmargins. The average gross margins for each of our four business segments are as follows:\nYear ended\nMarch 31,\n2019 2018\nAverage gross margin for retail drugstores 29.2% 25.9%\nAverage gross margin for online sales 11.8% 10.5%\nAverage gross margin for wholesale business 11.3% 12.7%\nAverage gross margin for farming business N/A N/A\nRetail gross margins increased primarily because of introducing new suppliers, and renegotiating prices with our suppliers continuously. By hiring\ntalented procurement employees, who have decades of experience in the drug sales and purchase industry, we were able to introduce new suppliers and sign\nbrand name products contract to obtain more rebates. As a result, we were able to keep up with our sales profit margin. In addition, we are able to\ncontinuously renegotiate with our vendors and press price down to acceptable levels. We expect to keep our profit margin at a reasonable level in the future.\nGross margin of online pharmacy sales increased primarily due to the increase in our sales via our own official website, as well as a decrease in sales\nvia third-party platforms, which are usually subject to low profit margin. We conduct our business either through certain e-commerce platforms such as Tmall\nand JD.com or via our own official online pharmacy website, www.dada360.com. The sales on our own official website usually have higher profit margins\nbecause customers referred by commercial insurance companies are premium customers who can afford premium products with higher profit margins. As\ndescribed in the above, in the year ended March 31, 2019, we achieved more sales from our own official websites. As a result, we incurred higher profit\nmargin.\nWholesale gross margin decreased primarily due to various products with different profit margin we carried and sold to certain pharmaceutical\nvendors. In the year ended March 31, 2019, we acted as the provincial agent for Dong’e Ejiao and distributed significant amount of Ejiao in September within\nZhejiang Province. As a result, our gross profit margin was lowered significantly. Although we have attempted to market our products to major local hospitals\nand other pharmacies, we have not been able to make significant progress. Until we are able to obtain status as a provincial or national exclusive sale agent for\ncertain popular drugs or have sales access to large local hospitals, we may have to maintain low profit margins in order to drive sales on our wholesale\nbusiness.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $5,525,692 or 29.5% year over year, primarily due to increase in labor and rent related to our store\nexpansions and rising local living cost. We opened over 50 stores at the end of calendar year 2017 and early in calendar year 2018. As a result, we experienced\nincrease of $2.9 million labor cost and $1.5 million rental cost. Excluding the above factors, selling and marketing expenses increased by approximately $1.2\nmillion or 6.2%, which reflects increase in other operating cost.\n40\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $16,104,672 or 90.4% period over period. Such expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to\n1.6% from 18.5% for the same period a year ago. In fiscal 2019, in order to use our cash more efficiently, we accelerated collection of advance to suppliers\nand accounts receivables. Specifically, we focused on the collection of aged accounts of advance to suppliers and accounts receivable. As we have collected\nthe amount, our allowance on doubtful accounts decreased by approximately $7.7 million. Additionally, our stock compensation expense decreased by\napproximately $6.8 million primarily as a result of issuing shares to our key employees in fiscal 2018. Excluding such an effect, general and administrative\nexpenses decreased by approximately $1.6 million or 9%, which reflects our improved control of expense such as overall management cash compensation in\nfiscal year 2019.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe recorded an impairment of long-lived assets of $0 and $1,583,186 for the year ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. On March 31, 2018, Jiuxin\nMedicine started outsourcing its logistics service to Astro Boy Cloud Pan (Hangzhou) Storage and Logistic Co. Ltd, Jiuxin Medicine’s warehouse lease has\nbeen terminated. As a result, approximately $1,583,186 in unamortized warehouse improvements was recognized as expense in the year ended March 31, 2018.\nSuch impairment was made after we estimated that the implied fair value of long-lived assets was lower than the carrying value.\nLoss from Operations\nAs a result of the above, we had loss from operations of $876,130, as compared to loss from operations of $18,021,170 a year ago. Our operating\nmargin for the year ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was (0.8)% and (18.8)%, respectively.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nIn the year ended March 31, 2019, other income is $(93,311) as compared to other income of $201,096 in the year ended March 31, 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense increased by $58,507 period over period due to increase in overall profit.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the foregoing, net loss is $1,317,769 in the year ended March 31, 2019 as compared to a net loss of $17,059,933 in the year ended\nMarch 31, 2018.\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable, which are unsecured, are stated at the amount we expect to collect. We continuously monitor collections and payments from\nour customers (our distributors) and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses. To prepare for potential loss in such accounts, we made corresponding\nreserves.\nOur accounts receivable aging was as follows for the periods described below:\nRetail Online Drug Herb Total\nFrom date of invoice to customer drugstores Pharmacy wholesale farming amount\n1- 3 months $ 5,022,472 $ 713,450 $ 312,763 $ - $ 6,048,685\n4- 6 months 70,694 101,532 1,655,203 - 1,827,429\n7- 12 months 383,867 169,028 1,139,223 - 1,692,118\nOver one year 1,726,406 187,179 457,547 - 2,371,132\nAllowance for doubtful accounts (1,980,725) (267,001) (999,124) - (3,246,850)\nTotal accounts receivable $ 5,222,714 $ 904,188 $ 2,565,612 $ - $ 8,692,514\nAccounts receivable from our retail business mainly consist of reimbursements from local government health insurance bureaus and commercial health\ninsurance programs. In the year ended March 31, 2019, we wrote off an approximately $146,593 collectible from provincial and Hangzhou City government\ninsurance, as such amounts have been determined by the health insurance bureaus to be unqualified for reimbursement.\n41\nAccounts receivables from our online pharmacy business mainly consist of receivables from insurance company and a service company handling with\ninsurance companies. As we continue to expand our business with commercial insurance company, our receivables from them increased. Additionally, certain\nreceivables are from third-party platforms such as JD.com where we sell products. Usually the third-party platforms will collect from customers ordering on\ntheir platforms and then reimburse us at a later date, such reimbursement periods times ranging from several days to a month after orders are placed.\nAccounts receivable from our drug wholesale business consist of receivables from our customers such as pharmaceutical distributors and local\ndrugstores primarily in Zhejiang Province. In fiscal 2019, we accelerated collection of certain aged accounts from customers which we no longer or rarely sold\nproducts to. By doing so, we are able to take better use of our cash. As a result, the overall reserve on wholesale accounts receivables decreased.\nSubsequent to March 31, 2019 and through May 31, 2019, we collected approximately $5.0 million in receivables relating to our drugstore business,\napproximately $1.0 million in receivables relating to our online pharmacy business, approximately $1.8 million relating to our wholesale business, and $0 relating\nto our herb farming business.\nAdvances to suppliers\nAdvances to suppliers are mainly prepayments to secure certain products or services at favorable pricing. The aging of our advances to suppliers is as\nfollows for the periods described below:\nRetail Online Drug Herb Total\nFrom date of cash prepayment to suppliers drugstores Pharmacy wholesale farming amount\n1- 3 months $ 192,700 $ - $ 1,453,328 $ - $ 1,646,028\n4- 6 months 12,771 - 176,165 - 188,936\n7- 12 months 26,960 - 243,327 - 270,287\nOver one year 109,436 - 262,539 - 371,975\nAllowance for doubtful accounts (143,762) - (383,212) - (526,974)\nTotal advances to suppliers $ 198,105 $ - $ 1,752,147 $ - $ 1,950,252\nSince the acquisition of Jiuxin Medicine, we have gradually transferred almost all logistics services of our retail drugstores to Jiuxin Medicine. Jiuzhou\nPharmacy only purchases certain non-medical products such as sundry. As a result, our retail chain made few advances to suppliers as of March 31, 2019.\nAdvances to suppliers for our drug wholesale business consist of prepayments to our vendors such as pharmaceutical manufacturers and other\ndistributors. We typically receive products from vendors within three to nine months after making prepayments. We continuously monitor delivery from and\npayments to our vendors while maintaining a provision for estimated credit losses based upon past experience and any supplier-specific issues such as the\ndiscontinuation of inventory supply that have been identified. If we are having difficulty receiving products from a vendor, we take the following steps: cease\npurchasing products from the vendor, ask for return of our prepayment promptly, and if necessary, take legal action. If all of these steps are unsuccessful,\nmanagement then determines whether or not the prepayments should be reserved or written off. In fiscal 2019, in order to use our cash more efficiently, we\naccelerated the collection of deposits from quite a few suppliers, especially aged accounts. We chose to only leave deposits with critical suppliers who supply\nlarge quantities of merchandise. As a result, the outstanding advances to suppliers decreased dramatically.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur cash flows for the periods indicated are as follows:\nFor the year ended\nMarch 31,\n2019 2018\nNet cash provided by/used in operating activities $ (5,603,216) $ (2,070,066)\nNet cash provided by/used in investing activities $ (7,326,181) $ (2,977,502)\nNet cash provided by/used in financing activities $ 8,078,581 $ (4,893,288)\n42\nFor the year ended March 31, 2019 cash provided by operating activities amounted to $(5,603,216), as compared to $(2,070,066) a year ago. The\nchange is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash provided by bad debt direct write-offs and provisions of $7,367,487, a decrease in cash provided by stock\ncompensation of $6,824,463,a decrease in cash provided by accounts payable of $4,254,978 offset by an increase of $2,491,447 in advances to suppliers, an\nincrease in cash provided by accounts receivable of $1,955,676 and an increase in cash provided by inventories and biological assets of $1,020,386.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities amounted to $(7,326,181), as compared to $(2,977,502) provided by investing\nactivities a year ago. The change is primarily attributable to the purchase of Yueming Shop for approximately $4,842,670 in the year ended March 31, 2019.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities amounted to $8,078,581, as compared to $(4,893,288) net cash used in\nfinancing activities a year ago. The financing proceeds were derived from the private placement described below.\nAs of March 31, 2019, we had cash of approximately $9,322,463. Our total current assets as of March 31, 2019, were $56,202,981 and total current\nliabilities were $55,212.286, which resulted in a working capital of $990,695.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations:\nContractual obligations Payments due by period\nLess than More than\nTotal 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years\nLong-Term Debt Obligations $ - - - - -\nCapital Lease Obligations - - - - -\nOperating Lease Obligations 18,322,510 4,952,693 7,277,929 4,052,270 2,039,618\nPurchase Obligations - - - - -\nOther Long-Term Liabilities Reflected on the Registrant’s\nBalance Sheet under GAAP* 465,248 - 465,248 - -\nTotal $ 18,787,758 4,952,693 7,743,177 4,052,270 2,039,618\n* This refers to warrants to purchase shares of common stock issued to an institutional investor and a placement agent (See Note 17).\n43\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any outstanding financial guarantees or commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. We have not entered\ninto any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as stockholder’s equity or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial\nstatements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or\nmarket risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit\nsupport to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.\nExchange Rates\nOur subsidiaries and affiliated companies in the PRC maintain their books and records in RMB, the lawful currency of the PRC. In general, for\nconsolidation purposes, we translate their assets and liabilities into USD using the applicable exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date, and the\nstatement of income is translated at average exchange rates during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation of their financial statements\nare recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income.\nThe exchange rates used to translate amounts in RMB into USD for the purposes of preparing the audited consolidated financial statements or\notherwise disclosed in this report were as follows:\nMarch 31, March 31,\n2019 2018\nBalance sheet items, except for the registered and paid-up capital, as of end of period/year USD1: RMB 0.1490 USD1: RMB 0.1592\nAmounts included in the statement of Operations and statement of cash flows for the period/ year ended USD1: RMB 0.1491 USD1: RMB 0.1510\nInflation\nWe believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our operations to date.\nITEM 7A.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the “Exchange Act”)), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized\nand reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,\nincluding our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and\nevaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the\ncost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nAs of March 31, 2019, the end of the fiscal year covered by this report, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures.\nBased on the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2019, our disclosure controls and\nprocedures were ineffective. They reached this conclusion due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting as described\nbelow. Management anticipates that our disclosure controls and procedures will remain ineffective until such material weaknesses are remediated.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2019. In making this assessment, we used\nthe criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (COSO) in the Internal Control-Integrated\nFramework. We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Based on our evaluation, management\nconcluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of March 31, 2019 due to the following material weaknesses:\nAccounting and Finance Personnel Weaknesses - As noted in Item 9A of our annual reports on Form 10-K for the preceding fiscal years,\nmanagement concluded that in light of the inexperience of our accounting staff with respect to the requirements of U.S. GAAP-based reporting and SEC rules\nand regulations, we did not maintain effective controls and did not implement adequate and proper supervisory review to ensure that significant internal control\ndeficiencies can be detected or prevented.\nManagement’s assessment of the control deficiency over accounting and finance personnel as of March 31, 2019 considered the same factors,\nincluding:\n● the number of adjustments proposed by our independent auditors during our quarterly review and annual audit processes;\n● how adequately we complied with U.S. GAAP on transactions; and\n● how accurately we prepared supporting information to provide to our independent auditors on a quarterly and annual basis.\nBased on the above factors, management concluded that the lack of timely reconciliation of booking and recording from China GAAP to US GAAP\nand lack of accounting staff with sufficient US GAAP experience are material weaknesses as of March 31, 2019.\nRemediation of Material Weakness for the year ended March 31, 2019\nSubsequent to the identification of the material weakness, we have enhanced existing controls and design and implemented new controls. We have\ndevoted significant time and attention to remediate the above material weakness. For example, we redesigned our system to retrieve data faster, so we are able\nto identify and reconcile the GAAP difference more efficiently. In addition, we trained our accounting staff with US GAAP knowledge, so they can meet the\nrequirement from our auditors more efficiently. These improvements to our internal control infrastructure were implemented over the course of fiscal 2019, and\nwere in place in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2019. As such, we believe that the remediation\ninitiative outlined above will be sufficient to remediate as the changes become operational for a full year the material weakness in internal control over financial\nreporting as discussed\n45\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn 2017, we installed a leading ERP system, SAP from Germany. SAP is a well-known management system used by many fortune 500 companies. In\nfiscal 2019, we linked our SAP system with a series of local banks, so it can provide a view of overall and instant cash information. In addition, we hired\nspecialized managers who are able to program and develop improved procedure in the system. We expect to continually improve our internal control system.\nThere have been no other changes in our internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of\nExchange Act Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that occurred during the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2019, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely\nto materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Controls\nManagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors\nand fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that its objectives will be met.

(the “Company”) as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, the related\nconsolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes. In our opinion, the\nconsolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at March 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of\ntheir operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required\nto have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,\nand performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in\nthe consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well\nas evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ BDO China Shu Lun Pan Certified Accountants LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since year 2015.\nShanghai, People’s Republic of China\nJuly 1, 2019\nF-1\nPART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nITEM 1.

(“Jo-Jo Drugstores” or the “Company”), was incorporated in Nevada on December 19, 2006, originally under the name\n“Kerrisdale Mining Corporation”. On September 24, 2009, the Company changed its name to “China Jo-Jo Drugstores, Inc.” in connection with a share\nexchange transaction as described below.\nOn September 17, 2009, the Company completed a share exchange transaction with Renovation Investment (Hong Kong) Co., Ltd. (“Renovation”), whereby\n7,900,000 shares of common stock were issued to the stockholders of Renovation in exchange for 100% of the capital stock of Renovation. The completion of\nthe share exchange transaction resulted in a change of control. The share exchange transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization\nand, as a result, the consolidated financial statements of the Company (the legal acquirer) are, in substance, those of Renovation (the accounting acquirer), with\nthe assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses, of the Company being included effective from the date of the share exchange transaction. Renovation has\nno substantive operations of its own except for its holdings of Zhejiang Jiuxin Investment Management Co., Ltd. (“Jiuxin Management”), Zhejiang Shouantang\nMedical Technology Co., Ltd. (“Shouantang Technology”) and Hangzhou Jiutong Medical Technology Co., Ltd (“Jiutong Medical”), Hangzhou Jiuyi Medical\nTechnology Co. Ltd. (“Jiuyi Technology”), its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nThe Company is an online and offline retailer and wholesale distributor of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products in the People’s Republic of China\n(“China” or the “PRC”). The Company’s offline retail business is comprised primarily of pharmacies, which are operated by Hangzhou Jiuzhou Grand\nPharmacy Chain Co., Ltd. (“Jiuzhou Pharmacy”), a company that the Company controls through contractual arrangements. On March 31, 2017, Jiuxin\nManagement established a subsidiary, Lin’An Jiuzhou Pharmacy Co., Ltd (“Lin’An Jiuzhou”) to operates drugstores in Lin’an City. As of March 31, 2019,\nJiuzhou Pharmacy has established the following companies, each of which operates a drugstore in Hangzhou City:\nEntity Name Date Established\nHangzhou Jiuben Pharmacy Co., Ltd (“Jiuben Pharmacy”) April 27, 2017\nHangzhou Jiuli Pharmacy Co., Ltd (“Jiuli Pharmacy”) May 22, 2017\nHangzhou Jiuxiang Pharmacy Co., Ltd (“Jiuxiang Pharmacy”) May 26, 2017\nHangzhou Jiuheng Pharmacy Co., Ltd (“Jiuheng Pharmacy”) June 6, 2017\nHangzhou Jiujiu Pharmacy Co., Ltd (“Jiujiu Pharmacy”) June 8, 2017\nHangzhou Jiuyi Pharmacy Co., Ltd (“Jiuyi Pharmacy”) June 8, 2017\nHangzhou Jiumu Pharmacy Co., Ltd (“Jiumu Pharmacy”) July 21, 2017\nHangzhou Jiurui Pharmacy Co., Ltd (“Jiurui Pharmacy”) August 4, 2017\nThe Company’s offline retail business also includes three medical clinics through Hangzhou Jiuzhou Clinic of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine\n(“Jiuzhou Clinic”) and Hangzhou Jiuzhou Medical and Public Health Service Co., Ltd. (“Jiuzhou Service”), both of which are also controlled by the Company\nthrough contractual arrangements. On December 18, 2013, Jiuzhou Service established, and held 51% of, Hangzhou Shouantang Health Management Co., Ltd.\n(“Shouantang Health”), a PRC company licensed to sell health care products. Shouantang Health was closed in April 2015. In May 2016, Hangzhou\nShouantang Bio-technology Co., Ltd. (“Shouantang Bio”) set up and held 49% of Hangzhou Kahamadi Bio-technology Co., Ltd.(“Kahamadi Bio”), a joint\nventure specialized in brand name development for nutritional supplements. In 2018, Jiuzhou Pharmacy invested a total of $741,540 (5,100,000RMB) in and held\n51% of Zhejiang Jiuzhou Linjia Medical Investment and Management Co. Ltd (“Linjia Medical”), which is operating two new clinics in Hangzhou as of March\n31, 2019. On March 29, 2019, Jiuzhou Pharmacy set up and currently holds 51% of the equity of Zhejiang AyiGe Medical Health Management Co., Ltd.(“Ayi\nHealth”), which is intended to provide technical support such as IT and customer support to our health management business in the future.\nThe Company currently conducts its online retail pharmacy business through Jiuzhou Pharmacy, which holds the Company’s online pharmacy license. Prior to\nNovember 2015, the Company primarily conducted its online retail pharmacy business through Zhejiang Quannuo Internet Technology Co., Ltd. In May 2015,\nthe Company established Zhejiang Jianshun Network Technology Co. Ltd, a joint venture with Shanghai Jianbao Technology Co., Ltd. (“Jianshun Network”), in\norder to develop its online pharmaceutical sales from large commercial medical insurance companies. However, as the strategic cooperation with Yikatong\nceased, Jianshun Network was dissolved. On September 10, 2015, Renovation set up a new entity Jiuyi Technology to provide additional technical support such\nas webpage development to our online pharmacy business. In November 2015, the Company sold all of the equity interests of Quannou Technology to six\nindividuals for approximately $17,121 (RMB107,074). After the sale, its technical support function has been transferred back to Jiuzhou Pharmacy, which hosts\nour online pharmacy.\nThe Company’s wholesale business is primarily conducted through Zhejiang Jiuxin Medicine Co., Ltd. (“Jiuxin Medicine”), which is licensed to distribute\nprescription and non-prescription pharmaceutical products throughout China. Jiuzhou Pharmacy acquired Jiuxin Medicine on August 25, 2011. On April 20,\n2018, 10% of Jiuxin Medicine shares were sold to Hangzhou Kangzhou Biotech Co. Ltd. for a total proceeds of $79,625 (RMB 507,760).\nF-6\nThe Company’s herb farming business is conducted by Hangzhou Qianhong Agriculture Development Co., Ltd. (“Qianhong Agriculture”), a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of Jiuxin Management. Due to the complexity of the cultivation business, Qianhong Agriculture has not grown herbs in fiscal 2019.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the activities of the Company

and Ms. Li Qi, the three\nshareholders (the “Owners”) since their respective establishment dates, pursuant to agreements among the Owners to vote their interests in concert\nas memorialized in a voting rights agreement. Based on such voting agreement, the Company has determined that common control exists among these\nthree companies. The Owners have operated these three companies in conjunction with one another since each company’s respective establishment\ndate. Jiuxin Medicine is also deemed under the common control of the Owners as a subsidiary of Jiuzhou Pharmacy.\n(2) To comply with certain foreign ownership restrictions of pharmacy and medical clinic operators, Jiuxin Management entered into a series of\ncontractual arrangements with Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service on August 1, 2009. These contractual arrangements are\ncomprised of five agreements: a consulting services agreement, operating agreement, equity pledge agreement, voting rights agreement and option\nagreement. Because such agreements obligate Jiuxin Management to absorb all of the risks of loss from the activities of Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou\nClinic and Jiuzhou Service, and enable the Company (through Jiuxin Management) to receive all of their expected residual returns, the Company\naccounts for each of the three companies (as well as subsidiaries of Jiuzhou Pharmacy) as a variable interest entity (“VIE”) under the accounting\nstandards of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). Accordingly, the financial statements of Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic and\nJiuzhou Service, as well as the subsidiary under the control of Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuxin Medicine and Shouantang Bio are consolidated into the\nfinancial statements of the Company.\nF-9\nNote 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of presentation and consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\n(“US GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and VIEs. All significant\ninter-company transactions and balances between the Company, its subsidiaries and VIEs are eliminated upon consolidation.\nConsolidation of variable interest entities\nIn accordance with accounting standards regarding consolidation of variable interest entities, VIEs are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance\ntheir activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making ability. All VIEs with which the\nCompany is involved must be evaluated to determine the primary beneficiary of the risks and rewards of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is required to\nconsolidate the VIE for financial reporting purposes.\nThe Company has concluded, based on the contractual arrangements, that Jiuzhou Pharmacy (including its subsidiaries and controlled entities), Jiuzhou Clinic\nand Jiuzhou Service are each a VIE and that the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Jiuxin Management, absorbs a majority of the risk of loss from the\nactivities of these companies, thereby enabling the Company, through Jiuxin Management, to receive a majority of their respective expected residual returns.\nControl and common control are defined under the accounting standards as “an individual, enterprise, or immediate family members who hold more than 50\npercent of the voting ownership interest of each entity.” Because the Owners collectively own 100% of Jiuzhou Pharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service,\nand have agreed to vote their interests in concert since the establishment of each of these three companies as memorialized in the voting rights agreement, the\nCompany believes that the Owners collectively have control and common control of the three companies. Accordingly, the Company believes that Jiuzhou\nPharmacy, Jiuzhou Clinic and Jiuzhou Service were constructively held under common control by Jiuxin Management as of the time the Contractual\nAgreements were entered into, establishing Jiuxin Management as their primary beneficiary. Jiuxin Management, in turn, is owned by Renovation, which is\nowned by the Company.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe operations of the Company are located in the PRC. Accordingly, the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations may be influenced\nby political, economic, and legal environments in the PRC, as well as by the general state of the PRC economy. The Company’s operations in the PRC are\nsubject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in North America and Western Europe. These include risks\nassociated with, among others, the political, economic and legal environment and foreign currency exchange. The Company’s results may be adversely\naffected by changes in the political, regulatory and social conditions in the PRC. Although the Company has not experienced losses from these situations and\nbelieves that it is in compliance with existing laws and regulations including its organization and structure disclosed in Note 1, this may not be indicative of future\nresults.\nThe Company has significant cash deposits with suppliers in order to obtain and maintain inventory. The Company’s ability to obtain products and maintain\ninventory at existing and new locations is dependent upon its ability to post and maintain significant cash deposits with its suppliers. In the PRC, many vendors\nare unwilling to extend credit terms for product sales that require cash deposits to be made. The Company does not generally receive interest on any of its\nsupplier deposits, and such deposits are subject to loss as a result of the creditworthiness or bankruptcy of the party who holds such funds, as well as the risk\nfrom illegal acts such as conversion, fraud, theft or dishonesty associated with the third party. If these circumstances were to arise, the Company would find it\ndifficult or impossible, due to the unpredictability of legal proceedings in China, to recover all or a portion of the amount on deposit with its suppliers.\nF-10\nMembers of the current management team own controlling interests in the Company and are also the Owners of the VIEs in the PRC. The Company only\ncontrols the VIEs through contractual arrangements which obligate it to absorb the risk of loss and to receive the residual expected returns. As such, the\ncontrolling shareholders of the Company and the VIEs could cancel these agreements or permit them to expire at the end of the agreement terms, as a result of\nwhich the Company would not retain control of the VIEs.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and\nthe reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The significant estimates made in the preparation of the accompanying unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements relate to the assessment of the carrying values of accounts receivable, advances to suppliers and related\nallowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives of property and equipment, inventory reserve and fair value of its purchase option derivative liability. Because of\nthe use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nFair value measurements\nThe Company establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy of valuation techniques based on observable and unobservable inputs, which may be used to\nmeasure fair value and include the following:\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 – Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in\nmarkets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or\nliabilities.\nLevel 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nClassification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities, which include financial instruments as defined by FASB ASC 820, include cash and cash equivalents, restricted\ncash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, long-term debt and derivatives. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, financial assets available for\nsales, accounts receivable, notes receivables, and accounts payable are a reasonable approximation of fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments\n(Level 1). The carrying amount of notes payable approximates fair value based on borrowing rates of similar bank loan currently available to the Company\n(Level 2) (See Note 13). The carrying amount of the Company’s derivative instruments is recorded at fair value and is determined based on observable inputs\nthat are corroborated by market data (Level 2). The carrying amount of the Financial assets available for sale is recorded at fair value and is determined based\non unobservable inputs (Level 3)(SeeNote 3). As of March 31 2019, the fair values of our derivative instruments were carried at fair value (See Note 17). As\nof March 31 2019, the fair values of our Financial liability were carried at fair value (See Note 18)\nActive Market\nfor Identical Observable Unobservable Total\nAssets Inputs Inputs Carrying\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Value\nCash and restricted cash $ 24,745,202 - - 24,745,202\nFinancial assets available for sale - - 180,928 180,928\nNotes payable - 25,951,673 - 25,951,673\nFinancial liability 81,935 81,935\nWarrants liability - 465,248 - 465,248\nTotal $ 24,745,202 26,416,921 262,863 51,424,986\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue from sales of prescription medicine at drugstores is recognized when the prescription is filled and the customer picks up and pays for the prescription.\nRevenue from sales of other merchandise at drugstores is recognized at the point of sale, which is when a customer pays for and receives the merchandise.\nUsually the majority of our merchandise, such as prescription and OTC drugs, are not allowed to be returned after the customers leave the counter. Return of\nother products, such as sundry products, are minimal. Sales of drugs reimbursed by the local government medical insurance agency and receivables from the\nagency are recognized when a customer pays for the drugs at a store. Based on historical experience, a reserve for potential loss from denial of reimbursement\non certain unqualified drugs is made to the receivables from the government agency. Retail sales price adjustments after sales are rare.\nRevenue from medical services is recognized after the service has been rendered to a customer.\nF-11\nRevenue from online pharmacy sales is recognized when merchandise is shipped to customers. While most deliveries take one day, certain deliveries may take\nlonger depending on a customer’s location. Any loss caused in a shipment will be reimbursed by the Company’s courier company. Our sales policy allows for\nthe return of certain merchandises without reason within seven days after customer’s receipt of the applicable merchandise. A proper sales reserve is made to\naccount for the potential loss from returns from customers. Historically, sales returns seven days after merchandise receipts have been minimal.\nRevenue from sales of merchandise to non-retail customers is recognized when the following conditions are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement\nexists (sales agreements and customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement); (2) control of the merchandise is transferred\nto customers, (3) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is probable. Historically, sales returns have been minimal. As we usually offer\nlow prices as an incentive for wholesale customers to buy from us, we do no give price concession to our customers later on ,\nThe Company’s revenue is net of value added tax (“VAT”) collected on behalf of PRC tax authorities in respect to the sales of merchandise. VAT collected\nfrom customers, net of VAT paid for purchases, is recorded as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until it is paid to the relevant PRC\ntax authorities.\nCertain contract liabilities primarily represent the Company’s obligation to transfer additional goods or services to a customer for which the Company has\nreceived consideration, for example, membership points. The consideration received remains a contract liability until goods or services have been provided to\nthe retail customer. The estimated amount based on accrued membership points was deducted from sales revenue.\nRestricted cash\nThe Company’s restricted cash consists of cash and long-term deposits in a bank as security for its notes payable. The Company has notes payable outstanding\nwith the bank and is required to keep certain amounts on deposit that are subject to withdrawal restrictions. The notes payable are generally short term in\nnature due to their short maturity period of six to nine months; thus, restricted cash is classified as a current asset.\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable represents the following: (1) amounts due from banks relating to retail sales that are paid or settled by the customers’ debit or credit cards,\n(2) amounts due from government social security bureaus and commercial health insurance programs relating to retail sales of drugs, prescription medicine, and\nmedical services that are paid or settled by the customers’ medical insurance cards, (3) amounts due from non-bank third party payment instruments such as\nAlipay and certain e-commerce platforms and (4) amounts due from non-retail customers for sales of merchandise.\nAccounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value consisting of the carrying amount less an allowance for uncollectible accounts, as necessary. In the\nCompany’s retail business, accounts receivable mainly consist of reimbursements due from the government insurance bureaus and commercial health insurance\nprograms and are usually collected within two or three months. The Company directly writes off delinquent account balances, which it determines to be\nuncollectible after confirming with the appropriate bureau or program each month. Additionally, the Company also makes estimated reserves on related\noutstanding accounts receivable based on historical trends.\nIn the Company’s online pharmacy business, accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from non-bank third party payment instruments such as\nAlipay and certain e-commerce platforms. To purchase pharmaceutical products from an e-commerce platforms such as Tmall, customers are required to\nsubmit payment to certain non-bank third party payment instruments, such as Alipay, which, in turn, reimburse the Company within seven days to a month.\nExcept for customer returns of sold products, the receivables from these payments instruments are rarely uncollectible.\nIn its wholesale business, the Company uses the aging method to estimate the allowance for anticipated uncollectible receivable balances. Under the aging\nmethod, bad debt percentages are determined by management, based on historical experience and the current economic climate, are applied to customers’\nbalances categorized by the number of months the underlying invoices have remained outstanding. At each reporting period, the allowance balance is adjusted\nto reflect the amount computed as a result of the aging method. When facts subsequently become available to indicate that the allowance provided requires an\nadjustment, a corresponding adjustment is made to the allowance account as a change in estimate.\nAdvances to suppliers\nAdvances to suppliers consist of prepayments to our vendors, such as pharmaceutical manufacturers and other distributors. Since the acquisition of Jiuxin\nMedicine, we have transferred almost all logistics services of our retail drugstores to Jiuxin Medicine. Jiuzhou Pharmacy only directly purchases certain non-\nmedical products, such as certain nutritional supplements. As a result, almost all advances to suppliers are made by Jiuxin Medicine.\nAdvances to suppliers for our drug wholesale business consist of prepayments to our vendors, such as pharmaceutical manufacturers and other\ndistributors. We typically receive products from vendors within three to nine months after making prepayments. We continuously monitor delivery from, and\npayments to, our vendors while maintaining a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific supplier issues, such as\ndiscontinuing of inventory supply, that have been identified. If we have difficulty receiving products from a vendor, we take the following steps: cease\npurchasing products from such vendor, ask for return of our prepayment promptly, and if necessary, take legal action. If all of these steps are unsuccessful,\nmanagement then determines whether the prepayments should be reserved or written off.\nF-12\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined using the first in first out (FIFO) method. Market value is the lower of\nreplacement cost or net realizable value. The Company carries out physical inventory counts on a monthly basis at each store and warehouse location. Herbs\nthat the Company farms are recorded at their cost, which includes direct costs such as seed selection, fertilizer, labor costs that are spent in growing herbs on\nthe leased farmland, and indirect costs such as amortization of farmland development cost. All costs are accumulated until the time of harvest and then\nallocated to harvested herbs costs when the herbs are sold. The Company periodically reviews its inventory and records write-downs to inventories for\nshrinkage losses and damaged merchandise that are identified. The Company provides a reserve for estimated inventory obsolescence or excess quantities on\nhand equal to the difference, if any, between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value.\nFarmland assets\nHerbs that the Company farms are recorded at their cost, which includes direct costs such as seed selection, fertilizer, and labor costs that are spent in growing\nherbs on the leased farmland, and indirect costs such as amortization of farmland development costs. Since April 2014, amortization of farmland development\ncosts has been expensed instead of allocated into inventory due to unpredictable future market value of planted gingko trees.\nAll related costs described in the above are accumulated until the time of harvest and then allocated to harvested herbs when they are sold.\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation or amortization. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful lives of the assets, taking into consideration the assets’ estimated residual value. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of\nlease term or remaining lease period of the underlying assets. Following are the estimated useful lives of the Company’s property and equipment:\nEstimated\nUseful Life\nLeasehold improvements 3-10 years\nMotor vehicles 3-5 years\nOffice equipment & furniture 3-5 years\nBuildings 35 years\nMaintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to expenses as incurred. Major additions and betterment to property and equipment are capitalized.\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets are acquired individually or as part of a group of assets, and are initially recorded at their fair value. The cost of a group of assets acquired in\na transaction is allocated to the individual assets based on their relative fair values.\nThe estimated useful lives of the Company’s intangible assets are as follows:\nEstimated\nUseful Life\nLand use rights 50 years\nSoftware 3 years\nThe Company evaluates intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired.\nImpairment of long lived assets\nThe Company evaluates long lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value\nmay not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flows. Recoverability is measured by comparing the assets’ net book value to the related projected\nundiscounted cash flows from these assets, considering a number of factors including past operating results, budgets, economic projections, market trends and\nproduct development cycles. If the net book value of the asset exceeds the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset is considered impaired, and a second test\nis performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. There was $1,337,529 leasehold improvements impaired in the year ended March 31, 2019. There\nwere $825,259 farmland assets and $1,196,197 prepayment of lease use rights, impaired in the year ended March 31, 2019(See Notes 9 and 11).\nNotes payable\nDuring the normal course of business, the Company regularly issues bank acceptance bills as a payment method to settle outstanding accounts payables with\nvarious material suppliers. The Company records such bank acceptance bills as notes payable. Such notes payable are generally short term in nature due to\ntheir short maturity period of six to nine months.\nF-13\nIncome taxes\nThe Company follows FASB ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax\nconsequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax\nconsequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on\nenacted tax laws and statutory tax rates, applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are\nestablished, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nThe accounting standards clarify the accounting and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions and prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement\nattribute for recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The accounting standards also provide guidance on\nde-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures, and transition. No significant penalties, uncertain tax provisions or\ninterest relating to income taxes were incurred during the periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.\nValue added tax\nSales revenue represents the invoiced value of goods, net of VAT. All of the Company’s products are sold in the PRC and are subject to a VAT on the gross\nsales price. The VAT rates range up to 17%, depending on the type of products sold. The VAT may be offset by VAT paid by the Company on raw materials\nand other materials included in the cost of producing or acquiring its finished products. The Company recorded a VAT payable net of payments in the\naccompanying financial statements.\nStock based compensation\nThe Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 718, “Compensation — Stock Compensation,” which establishes accounting standards for non-employee\nand employee stock-based awards. Under the provisions of FASB ASC 718, the fair value of stock issued is used to measure the fair value of services\nreceived as the Company believes such approach is a more reliable method of measuring the fair value of the services. For non-employee stock-based awards,\nfair value is measured based on the value of the Company’s common stock on the date that the commitment for performance by the counterparty has been\nreached or the counterparty’s performance is complete. The fair value of the equity instrument is calculated and then recognized as compensation expense\nover the requisite performance period. For employee stock-based awards, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value\nof the award and is recognized as expense with graded vesting on a straight–line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.\nAdvertising and promotion costs\nAdvertising and promotion costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to $1,023,461 and $641,328 for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018,\nrespectively. Such costs consist primarily of print and promotional materials such as flyers to local communities.\nOperating leases\nThe Company leases premises for retail drugstores, offices and wholesale warehouse under non-cancellable operating leases. Operating lease payments are\nexpensed over the term of lease. A majority of the Company’s retail drugstore leases have a 3 to 10 year term with a renewal option upon the expiration of the\nlease; the wholesale warehouse lease has a 10-year term with a renewal option upon the expiration of the lease. The Company has historically been able to\nrenew a majority of its drugstores leases. Under the terms of the lease agreements, the Company has no legal or contractual asset retirement obligations at the\nend of the lease. In addition, land leased from the government is amortized on a straight-line basis over a 30-year term.\nForeign currency translation\nThe Company uses the United States dollar (“U.S. dollars” or “USD”) for financial reporting purposes. The Company’s subsidiaries and VIEs maintain their\nbooks and records in their functional currency the Renminbi (“RMB”), the currency of the PRC.\nF-14\nIn general, for consolidation purposes, the Company translates the assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries and VIEs into U.S. dollars using the applicable\nexchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date, and the statements of income and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates during the reporting\nperiod. As a result, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding\nbalances on the balance sheet. Equity accounts are translated at historical rates. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the financial statements of the\nsubsidiaries and VIEs are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income.\nThe balance sheet amounts, with the exception of equity, at March 31, 2019 and 2018 were translated at 1 RMB to 0.1490 USD and at 1 RMB to 0.1592 USD,\nrespectively. The average translation rates applied to income and cash flow statement amounts for years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were at 1 RMB to\n0.1491 USD and at 1 RMB to 0.1510 USD, respectively.\nConcentrations and credit risk\nCertain financial instruments, which subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist of cash and restricted cash. The Company has cash balances\nat financial institutions located in Hong Kong and PRC. Balances at financial institutions in Hong Kong may, from time to time, exceed Hong Kong Deposit\nProtection Board’s insured limits. Since March 31, 2015, balances at financial institutions and state-owned banks within the PRC are covered by insurance up\nto RMB 500,000 (USD 79,600) per bank. As of March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, the Company had deposits totaling $24,730,736 and $31,433,969 that\nwere covered by such limited insurance, respectively. Any balance over RMB 500,000 (USD 79,600) per bank in PRC will not be covered. To date, the\nCompany has not experienced any losses in such accounts.\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, two vendors collectively accounted for 40.3% of the Company’s total purchases and two suppliers accounted for\nmore than 10% of total advances to suppliers. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, one vendor accounted for 19% of the Company’s total purchases and\nanother vendor accounted for more than 10% of total advances to suppliers.\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, no customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total sales and more than 10% of total accounts\nreceivable. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, no customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total sales or more than 10% of total\naccounts receivable.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for\nvirtually all of their leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease). The liability will be equal to the present value of future lease\npayments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment, such as for initial direct costs. For income statement purposes, a dual model was\nretained, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance leases. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense (similar to current operating\nleases) while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar to current capital leases). Lessor accounting is similar to the current model, but\nupdated to align with certain changes to the lessee model (e.g., certain definitions, such as initial direct costs, have been updated) and the new revenue\nrecognition standard. The Company adopted this new accounting guidance on January 1, 2019 on a modified retrospective basis. The adoption of this new\nguidance resulted in an increase in both assets and liabilities of approximately $15 million as of April 1, 2019. The adoption of this new guidance is not expected\nto have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows.\nF-15\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,”\nproviding financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to\nextend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. For public business entities that are U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filers, the\namendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. All entities may\nadopt the amendments in this update earlier as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We\nare currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,”\naddressing eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments in this update are effective for\npublic business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including\nadoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal\nyear that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The amendments in this update\nshould be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of\nthe issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The impact of adoption on its Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements for any period presented is not material.\nIn July 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards update (“ASU”) No. 2017-11, “Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity\n(Topic 480), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): I. Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features; II. Replacement of the\nIndefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling\nInterests with a Scope Exception”. Part I of this update addresses the complexity of accounting for certain financial instruments with down round features.\nPart II of this update addresses the difficulty of navigating Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, because of the existence of extensive pending\ncontent in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification®. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-11 on our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards update (“ASU”) No. 2017-04, “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for\nGoodwill Impairment” (“ASU 2017-04”), which removes Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. An entity will apply a one-step quantitative test and record\nthe amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to\nthe reporting unit. The new guidance does not amend the optional qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment. Public business entity that is a U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission filer should adopt the amendments in this ASU for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment test in fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. ASU 2017-4\nhas no impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAdoption of New Revenue Recognition Standard\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with\ncustomers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-\n08,“Principal Versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus Net),” which amends the principal versus-agent implementation guidance and in\nApril 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, “Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,” which amends the guidance in those areas in the new\nrevenue recognition standard. On April 1, 2018, we adopted the guidance in ASC 606 and all the related amendments and applied the new revenue standard to\nall contracts using the modified retrospective method. Based on the new standard our revenue recognition policies related to membership rewards programs\nwill change. But the impact of the new revenue standard was not material and there was no adjustment required to the opening balance of retained earnings.\nWe expect the impact of the adoption of the new revenue standard to be immaterial to our net income on an ongoing basis.\nF-16\nThe following is a discussion of the Company’s revenue recognition policies by segment under the new revenue recognition accounting standard:\nPharmacy retail sales\nThe physical pharmacies sell prescription drugs, OTC drugs, traditional Chinese medicine, nutritional supplements, medical devices and sundry products.\nRevenue from sales of prescription medicine at drugstores is recognized when the prescription is filled and the customer picks up and pays for the prescription.\nRevenue from sales of other merchandise at drugstores is recognized at the point of sale, which is when a customer pays for and receives the merchandise.\nUsually the majority of our merchandise, such as prescription and OTC drugs, are not allowed to be returned after the customers leave the counter. Return of\nother products, such as sundry products, are minimal. Sales of drugs reimbursed by the local government medical insurance agency and receivables from the\nagency are recognized when a customer pays for the drugs at a store. Based on historical experience, a reserve for potential loss from denial of reimbursement\non certain unqualified drugs is made to the receivables from the government agency. Revenue from medical services is recognized after the service has been\nrendered to a customer. As revenue from medical services are minimal compared to pharmacy retail sales, it is included as part of the pharmacy retail sales.\nOnline pharmacy sales\nThe online pharmacy sells various health products except for prescription drugs. Revenue from online pharmacy sales is recognized when merchandise is\nshipped to customers. While most deliveries take one day, certain deliveries may take longer depending on a customer’s location. Any loss caused in a\nshipment will be reimbursed by the Company’s courier company. Our sales policy allows for the return of certain merchandises without reason within seven\ndays after customer’s receipt of the applicable merchandise. Historically, sales returns seven days after merchandise receipts have been minimal.\nWholesale\nJiuxin Medicine purchases medicine in quantity and distributes products primarily to local pharmacies and medical products dealers. Revenue from sales of\nmerchandise to non-retail customers is recognized when the following conditions are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists (sales agreements\nand customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement); (2) control of the merchandise is transferred to customers; (3) the sales\nprice is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is probable. Historically, sales returns have been minimal.\nThe Company’s revenue is net of value added tax (“VAT”) collected on behalf of PRC tax authorities in respect to the sales of merchandise. VAT collected\nfrom customers, net of VAT paid for purchases, is recorded as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until it is paid to the relevant PRC\ntax authorities.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table disaggregates the Company’s revenue by major source in each segment for the year ended March 31, 2019:\nFor the year ended March 31 2019 2018\nRetail drugstores\nPrescription drugs $ 23,516,046 $ 20,553,179\nOTC drugs 31,401,328 28,368,059\nNutritional supplements 6,354,108 4,179,139\nTCM 6,529,790 1,660,301\nSundry products 941,491 6,254,286\nMedical devices 3,591,646 962,619\nTotal retail revenue $ 72,334,409 $ 61,977,583\nOnline pharmacy\nPrescription drugs $ - $ -\nOTC drugs 3,127,976 5,193,051\nNutritional supplements 737,315 29,717\nTCM 74,262 3,932,607\nSundry products 2,736,070 1,880,707\nMedical devices 2,108,836 1,096,849\nTotal online revenue $ 8,784,459 $ 12,132,931\nDrug wholesale\nPrescription drugs $ 16,745,862 $ 12,314,829\nOTC drugs 8,964,587 9,381,932\nNutritional supplements 290,534 182,903\nTCM 271,280 73,645\nSundry products 24,846 48,852\nMedical devices 135,035 32\nTotal wholesale revenue $ 26,432,144 $ 22,002,193\nTotal revenue $ 107,551,012 $ 96,112,706\nF-17\nContract Balances\nContract liabilities primarily represent the Company’s obligation to transfer additional goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received\nconsideration, for example membership points. The consideration received remains a contract liability until goods or services have been provided to the retail\ncustomer.\nThe following table provides information about receivables and contract liabilities from contracts with customers:\nMarch 31, March 31,\n2018 2018\nTrade receivable(included in accounts receivable, net) $ 8,692,514 $ 8,322,393\nContract liabilities (included in accrued expenses) 1,689,099 4,461,136\nImpact of New Revenue Recognition Standard on Financial Statement Line Items\nThe Company adopted ASU 2014-09 using the modified retrospective method. The cumulative effect of applying the new guidance to all contracts was\nrecorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the adoption date. As a result of applying the modified retrospective method to adopt the new revenue\nguidance, the following adjustments were made to accounts on the condensed statement of operation for the year ended March 31, 2019:\nImpact of Change in Accounting Policy\nAs Reported\nBalances\nFor the\nThe year Balance\nEnded without\nMarch 31, Adoption of\nIn thousands 2019 Adjustments Topic 606\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of Operations:\nNet revenues 107,551 (302) 107,249\nCost of revenues 82,443 - 82,443\nGross profit 25,108 (302) 24,806\nSELLING EXPENSES 24,265 302 24,567\nGENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 1,719 - 1,719\nOperating profit (876) - (1,480)\nIncome (loss) before income tax provision (1,183) - (1,787)\nIncome tax provision 135 - 135\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations (1,318) - (1,922)\nNet income (loss) (1,318) - (1,922)\nThe adoption of ASU 2014-09 has no effect on consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flow.\nAdoption of Statement of Cash Flows\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows, which amends Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 230. This ASU\nrequires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. When\ncash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are presented in more than one line item on the balance sheet, the new guidance requires\na reconciliation of the totals in the statement of cash flows to the related captions in the balance sheet. Entities will also have to disclose the nature of their\nrestricted cash and restricted cash equivalent balances. The guidance is required to be applied retrospectively. The Company adopted this new accounting\nguidance. The following represents a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents in the condensed consolidated balance sheet to total cash, cash equivalents\nand restricted cash in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows:\nMarch 31, March 31,\n2019 2018\nCash and cash equivalents 9,322,463 15,132,640\nRestricted cash 15,422,739 16,319,551\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the statement of cash flows 24,745,202 31,452,191\nRestricted cash in the condensed consolidated balance sheets primarily represents deposits required by a bank as security for its notes payable. The Company\nhas notes payable outstanding with the bank and is required to keep certain amounts on deposit that are subject to withdrawal restrictions. All restricted cash is\ninvested in time deposits and money markets, which are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\nF-18\nRestricted cash activity was previously reported in “Change in restricted cash” within financing activities cash flows on the Company’s condensed consolidated\nstatement of cash flows. The following is a reconciliation of the effect on the relevant line items on the statement of cash flows for the year ended March 31,\n2018 as a result of adopting this new accounting guidance:\nAs\nPreviously As\nReported Adjustments Revised\nYear Ended March 31, 2018\nChange in restricted cash (5,664,224) 5,664,224 -\nNet cash provided by financing activities (770,936) 5,664,224 4,893,288\nEffects of exchange rate on cash 2,586,720 1,223,941 3,810,661\nNet decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (3,231,784) 6,888,165 3,656,381\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at the beginning of the period 18,364,424 9,431,386 27,795,810\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at the end of the period 15,132,640 16,319,551 31,452,191\nNOTE 3 – FINANCIAL ASSETS AVAILABLE FOR SALE\nAs of March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, financial assets available for sale amounted to $180,928 (RMB 1,214,500) and $175,140 (RMB 1,100,000),\nrespectively.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences\nattributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, operating losses and\ntax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which\nthose temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in\nthe period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred income tax assets for amounts which are not considered “more\nlikely than not” to be realized.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes on an entity basis on income arising in or derived from the tax jurisdiction in which each entity is domiciled.\nEntity Income Tax Jurisdiction\nJo-Jo Drugstores United States\nRenovation Hong Kong, PRC\nAll other entities Mainland, PRC\nFor the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the components of income tax expense consist of the following:\nFor the year ended\nMarch 31,\n2019 2018\nCurrent:\nFederal - -\nState - -\nForeign 134,763 76,256\n134,763 76,256\nDeferred:\nFederal - -\nState - -\nForeign - -\n- -\nProvision for income taxes 134,763 76,256\nA reconciliation of the income tax provision at the federal statutory rate and the effective rate is as follows:\nFor the year\nEnded March 31,\n2019 2018\nU.S. Statutory rates 21.0% 21.0%\nForeign income not recognized in the U.S. (21.0) (21.0)\nChina income taxes 25.0 25.0\nChange in valuation allowance (1) (25.0) (25.0)\nNon-deductible expenses-permanent difference (2) (11.4) (0.4)\nEffective tax rate (11.4)% (0.4)%\n(1) Represents a non-taxable expense reversal due to overall decrease in allowance for accounts receivable and advances to suppliers.\n(2) The (11.4)% and (0.4)% rate adjustments for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 represent expenses that primarily include stock option expenses\nand other expenses incurred by the Company that are not deductible for PRC income tax.\nF-23\nThe components of the Company’s net deferred tax assets are as follows:\nAs of As of\n3/31/2019 3/31/2018\nAllowance 986,665 1,214,946\nLong-lived assets impairment 586,298 395,797\nDepreciation and Amortization - 345,952\nAccrued expense 1,569,683 245,056\nNet operating loss carry forward 1,164,735 654,282\nForeign Tax Credit Carryover 195,000 195,000\nTotal deferred tax assets (liabilities): 4,502,381 3,051,033\nValuation allowance (4,502,381) (3,051,033)\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities) - -\nThe Company regularly assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion\nof the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We weigh all available positive and negative evidence, including earnings history and results of recent operations,\nscheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. Assumptions used to forecast future taxable income\noften require significant judgment. More weight is given to objectively verifiable evidence. In the event we determine that we would not be able to realize all or\npart of our net deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance will be established against deferred tax assets in the period in which we make such\ndetermination. The need to establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate.\nAs of March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, the estimated net operating loss carry forwards for U.S. income tax purposes amounted to $816,908, which may be\navailable to reduce future years’ taxable income. These carry forwards will expire if not utilized by 2032. In addition, the Company carries a Foreign tax credit\nof $195,000. As of March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, the estimated net operating loss carry forwards for Hong Kong income tax purposes amounted to\n$1,960,933 and $1,882,276, which may be available to reduce future years’ taxable income. As of March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, the estimated net\noperating loss carry forwards for China income tax purposes amounted to $2,678,523 and $688,622, which may be available to reduce future years’ taxable\nincome. These carry forwards will expire if not utilized in the next five years.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the 2017 Tax Act. The 2017 Tax Act includes a number of changes in existing tax law impacting\nbusinesses, including the transition tax, a one-time deemed repatriation of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings and a permanent reduction in the U.S.\nfederal statutory rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. ASC 740 requires companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of\nenactment, accordingly, the effects must be recognized on companies’ calendar year-end financial statements, even though the effective date for most\nprovisions is January 1, 2018. As a result, we re-measured our net U.S. deferred tax assets at the 21% future tax rate. As of December 31, 2017, for\nestimating our foreign undistributed earnings according to the 2017 Tax Act, we estimated an aggregate deficit in “accumulated earnings and profits,” which is\nhow foreign undistributed earnings are determined for the one-time transition tax and for U.S. income tax purposes. As a result, the one-time transition tax did\nnot have a significant impact on the Company’s FY18 tax provision and there was no undistributed accumulated earnings and profits as of March 31, 2019.\nIn December 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), which provided a measurement period of up to one year from the\nenactment date of the 2017 Tax Act for us to complete the accounting for the 2017 Tax Act and its related impacts. The income tax effects of the 2017 Tax\nAct for which the accounting is incomplete include: the impact of the transition tax, the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the 21%\ncorporate tax rate, and the impact to the aforementioned items on state income taxes. We have made reasonable provisional estimates for each of these items,\nhowever, these estimates may be affected by other analyses related to the 2017 Tax Act, including but not limited to, any deferred adjustments related to the\nfiling of our fiscal 2019 federal and state income tax returns and further guidance yet to be issued.\nThe Company recorded net unrecognized tax benefits of $0.0 million as of January 31, 2019. It is our policy to classify accrued interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.\nAudit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed, which in the PRC is usually 5 years as the Company’s most significant tax\njurisdiction. The completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the Company’s\nliability for income taxes. Any such adjustment could be material to the Company’s results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based, in part,\nupon the results of operations for the given period.\nF-24\nNote 15 – POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nRegulations in the PRC require the Company to contribute to a defined contribution retirement plan for all permanent employees. The contribution for each\nemployee is based on a percentage of the employee’s current compensation as required by the local government. The Company contributed $1,423,449 and\n$1,257,362 in employment benefits and pension for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNote 16 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND ARRANGEMENTS\nAmounts payable to related parties are summarized as follows:\nMarch 31, March 31,\n2019 2018\nDue to a director and CEO (1) : 795,179 850,342\n(1) Due to foreign exchange restrictions, the Company’s director and CEO, Mr. Lei Liu personally lent U.S. dollars to the Company to facilitate its payments\nof expenses in the United States.\nAs of March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, notes payable totaling $0 and $3,253,630 were secured by the personal properties of certain of the Company’s\nshareholders, respectively.\nThe Company leases a retail space from Mr. Lei Liu. The lease expires in September 2020. Rent expenses totaled $27,605 and $18,120 for the twelve months\nended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The amounts owed under the lease for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were not paid to\nMr. Liu as of March 31, 2019.\nOn April 28, 2018, 10% of Jiuxin Medicine was sold to Hangzhou Kangzhou Biotech Co. Ltd. for a total proceeds of approximately $75,643 (RMB507,760).\nMr. Lei Liu owns 51% of Hangzhou Kangzhou Biotech Co. Ltd.\nNote 17 – WARRANTS\nIn connection with the registered direct offering closed on July 19, 2015, the Company issued to an investor a warrant to purchase up to 600,000 shares of\ncommon stock at an exercise price of $3.10 per share. The warrant became exercisable on January 19, 2016 and will expire on January 18, 2021. In\nconnection with the offering, the Company also issued a warrant to its placement agent of this offering, pursuant to which the agent may purchase up to 6% of\nthe aggregate number of shares of common stock sold in the offering, i.e. 72,000 shares. Such warrant has the same terms as the warrant issued to investor in\nthe offering.\nThe fair value of the warrants issued to purchase 672,000 shares as described above was estimated by using the binominal pricing model with the following\nassumptions:\nCommon Stock Common Stock\nWarrants Warrants\nMarch 31, March 31,\n2019(1) 2018\nStock price $ 2.62 $ 1.35\nExercise price $ 3.10 $ 3.10\nAnnual dividend yield -% -%\nExpected term (years) 1.80 2.80\nRisk-free interest rate 2.27% 1.98%\nExpected volatility 67.69% 68.73%\n(1) As of March 31, 2019, the warrants had not been exercised.\nUpon evaluation, the warrants meet the definition of a derivative under FASB ASC 815, as the Company cannot avoid a net cash settlement under certain\ncircumstances. Accordingly, the fair value of the warrants was classified as a liability of $138,796 as of March 31, 2018. For the year ended March 31, 2019,\nthe Company recognized a loss of $326,452 for the investor warrant and placement agent warrant, from the change in fair value of the warrant liability,\nrespectively. As a result, the warrant liability is carried on the consolidated balance sheets at the fair value of $465,248 for the investor warrant and placement\nagent warrant, collectively, as of March 31, 2019.\nF-25\nNote 18 – Financial Liability\nTo encourage operating team, which consists of doctors and nurses, to devote their efforts to run clinics, Linjia Medical allows them to put deposits in the clinic\nwhere doctors and nurses work, and take shares in any profit of the clinic. The principal amounts of these deposits are refundable in the event the doctors and\nnurses leave the clinic. In order to properly reflect Linjia Medical’s liabilities, the Company reclassified the deposit of $81,935 (RMB550,000) as financial\nliability as of March 31, 2019.\nNote 19 – STOCKHOLDER’S EQUITY\nCommon stock\nOn January 23, 2017, the Company closed a private offering with one institutional investor (the “Investor”) pursuant to which the Company sold to the Investor,\nand the Investor purchased from the Company, an aggregate of 4,840,000 shares of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company, at a\npurchase price of $2.20 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $10,648,000 (the “Private Placement”).\nOn April 11,2019, the Company closed a registered direct offering of 4,000,008 shares of common stock at $2.50 per share with gross proceeds of\n$10,000,020 from an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3.\nStock-based compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based payment awards granted to employees and directors by recording compensation expense based on estimated fair\nvalues. The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately\nexpected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Share-based awards\nare attributed to expenses using the straight-line method over the vesting period. The Company determines the value of each option award that contains a\nmarket condition using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation model, while all other option awards are valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model as\npermitted under FASB ASC 718 “Compensation - Stock Compensation.” The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards\nrepresent the Company’s best estimates. The Company’s estimates of the fair values of stock options granted and the resulting amounts of share-based\ncompensation recognized may be impacted by certain variables including stock price volatility, employee stock option exercise behaviors, additional stock option\nmodifications, estimates of forfeitures, and the related income tax impact.\nOn March 30, 2018, the Company granted a total of 3,947,100 shares of restricted common stock to its key employees in its retail drugstores and online\npharmacy under the Company’s 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the “Plan”). The stock awards vested on the grant date. On June 28, 2018, the\ncompensation committee of the Company canceled 225,000 shares granted to the CEO in order to conform aggregate issuances to the 675,000 share limitation\nset forth in the Plan. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 removed the 162(m) qualified performance based compensation exemption to the $1 million cap on\ndeductions for compensation to covered executives. Section 1.3.2 was in the Plan to permit grants under the Plan to fit within that exemption. As that\nexemption no longer applies for grants made in 2018 or thereafter, the Plan has been amended to remove the provisions intended to comply with that\nexemption, including the one in Section 1.3.2 of the Plan. All $5,328,585 of such expense has been recorded as a service compensation expense in the year\nended March 31, 2018.\nStock option\nOn November 18, 2014, the Company granted a total of 967,000 shares of stock options under the Plan to a group of a total of 46 grantees including directors,\nofficers and employees. The exercise price of the stock option is $2.50. The option vests on November 18, 2017, provided that the grantees are still employed\nby the Company on such a date. The options will be exercisable for five years from the vesting date, or November 18, 2017 until November 17, 2022. For the\nyears ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, $0 and $313,651 were recorded as compensation expenses. As of March 31, 2019, all compensation costs related to\nstock option compensation arrangements granted have been recognized.\nF-26\nStatutory reserves\nStatutory reserves represent restricted retained earnings. Based on their legal formation, the Company is required to set aside 10% of its net income as\nreported in their statutory accounts on an annual basis to the Statutory Surplus Reserve Fund (the “Reserve Fund”). Once the total amount set aside in the\nReserve Fund reaches 50% of the entity’s registered capital, further appropriations become discretionary. The Reserve Fund can be used to increase the\nentity’s registered capital upon approval by relevant government authorities or eliminate its future losses under PRC GAAP upon a resolution by its board of\ndirectors. The Reserve Fund is not distributable to shareholders, as cash dividends or otherwise, except in the event of liquidation.\nAppropriations to the Reserve Fund are accounted for as a transfer from unrestricted earnings to statutory reserves. During the years ended March 31, 2019\nand 2018, the Company did not make appropriations to statutory reserves.\nThere are no legal requirements in the PRC to fund the Reserve Fund by transfer of cash to any restricted accounts, and the Company does not do so.\nNote 20 – LOSS PER SHARE\nThe Company reports earnings per share in accordance with the provisions of the FASB’s related accounting standard. This standard requires presentation of\nbasic and diluted earnings per share in conjunction with the disclosure of the methodology used in computing such earnings per share. Basic earnings per share\nexcludes dilution, but includes vested restricted stocks and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average common\nshares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share takes into account the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue\ncommon stock were exercised and converted into common stock.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the basic and diluted earnings per share computation:\nThe year ended\nMarch 31,\n2019 2018\nNet income attributable to controlling interest $ (926,278) $ (17,059,933)\nWeighted average shares used in basic computation 28,936,778 25,241,748\nDiluted effect of stock options and warrants -\nWeighted average shares used in diluted computation 28,936,778 25,241,748\nIncome per share – Basic:\nNet income before noncontrolling interest $ (0.03) $ (0.68)\nAdd: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest $ - $ -\nNet income attributable to controlling interest $ (0.03) $ (0.68)\nLoss per share – Diluted:\nNet income before noncontrolling interest $ (0.03) $ (0.68)\nAdd: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest $ - $ -\nNet income attributable to controlling interest $ (0.03) $ (0.68)\nFor the year ended March 31, 2019, 967,000 shares underlying employee stock options and 600,000 shares underlying outstanding purchase options to an\ninvestor, and 72,000 shares underlying outstanding purchase option to an investment placement agent were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per\nshare as the options were anti-dilutive.\nNote 21 – SEGMENTS\nThe Company operates within four main reportable segments: retail drugstores, online pharmacy, drug wholesale and herb farming. The retail drugstores\nsegment sells prescription and over-the-counter (“OTC”) medicines, TCM, dietary supplements, medical devices, and sundry items to retail customers. The\nonline pharmacy sells OTC drugs, dietary supplements, medical devices and sundry items to customers through several third-party platforms such as Alibaba’s\nTmall, JD.com and Amazon.com, and the Company’s own platform all over China. The drug wholesale segment includes supplying the Company’s own\nretail drugstores with prescription and OTC medicines, TCM, dietary supplement, medical devices and sundry items (which sales have been eliminated as\nintercompany transactions), and also selling them to other drug vendors and hospitals. The Company’s herb farming segment cultivates selected herbs for sales\nto other drug vendors. The Company is also involved in online sales and clinic services that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for reportable segments and\nare included in the retail drugstores segment. The segments’ accounting policies are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting\npolicies. The Company evaluates performance based on profit or loss from operations before interest and income taxes not including nonrecurring gains and\nlosses.\nThe Company’s reportable business segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. Each segment is managed separately\nbecause they require different operations and markets to distinct classes of customers.\nF-27\nThe following table presents summarized information by segment of the continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2019:\nRetail Online Herb\ndrugstores Pharmacy Drug wholesale farming Total\nRevenue $ 72,334,409 $ 8,784,459 $ 26,432,144 $ - $ 107,551,012\nCost of goods 51,246,983 7,748,519 23,447,467 - 82,442,969\nGross profit $ 21,087,426 $ 1,035,940 $ 2,984,677 $ - $ 25,108,043\nSelling expenses 18,930,118 1,735,966 3,599,100 - 24,265,184\nGeneral and administrative expenses 4,072,500 347,516 (2,701,027) 1,718,989*\nImpairment of long-lived assets - - -\nLoss from operations $ (1,915,192) $ (1,047,542) $ 2,086,604 $ $ (876,130)\nDepreciation and amortization $ 1,476,903 $ - $ 7,644 $ - $ 1,484,547\nTotal capital expenditures $ 7,267,847 $ - $ 1,434 $ - $ 7,269,281\n* includes additional accounts receivable and advance to suppliers allowance of $(3,845,582)\nThe following table presents summarized information by segment of the continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2018:\nRetail Online Herb\ndrugstores Pharmacy Drug wholesale farming Total\nRevenue $ 61,977,582 $ 12,132,930 $ 22,002,194 $ - $ 96,112,706\nCost of goods 45,918,540 10,858,160 19,210,837 - 75,987,537\nGross profit $ 16,059,042 $ 1,274,770 $ 2,791,357 $ - $ 20,125,169\nSelling expenses 13,037,239 2,014,414 3,687,839 - 18,739,492\nGeneral and administrative expenses 14,730,152 427,772 2,630,278 35,459 17,823,661*\nImpairment of long-lived assets - - 1,583,186 - 1,583,186\nLoss from operations $ (11,708,349) $ (1,167,416) $ (5,109,946) $ (35,459) $ (18,021,170)\nDepreciation and amortization $ 837,195 $ - $ 377,912 $ - $ 1,215,107\nTotal capital expenditures $ 878,121 $ - $ 10,915 $ - $ 889,036\n* includes additional accounts receivable and advance to suppliers allowance of $4,701,647\nF-28\nThe Company does not have long-lived assets located outside the PRC.
