[(Nasdaq:DRMA; DRMAW)](https://pr.report/478m) (\"Dermata,\" or the \"Company\"), a late-stage biotechnology company focused on the treatment of medical and aesthetic skin diseases and conditions, today highlighted recent corporate progress and reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n\"The third quarter was a busy time for our team as we approach completing enrollment in our DMT310 Phase 3 STAR-1 study and were able to raise funds, which we believe will allow us to reach the topline data readout in the STAR-1 study in the first quarter of 2025,\" commented Gerry Proehl, Dermata's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. \"We believe patients deserve an acne treatment that is safe, well-tolerated, applied only once-a-week, with a significant 45% reduction in inflammatory lesions after just four applications, as seen in our DMT310 Phase 2b acne study. With many unique features and benefits, we believe DMT310 can cause a paradigm shift in the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne, if approved,\" concluded Mr. Proehl.\n\n**Corporate Highlights**\n\n  * **Achieved 50% enrollment in its DMT310 Phase 3 STAR-1 clinical trial in moderate-to-severe acne.** After achieving the 50% enrollment milestone in July 2024, Dermata expects to receive topline results from the STAR-1 study in the first quarter of 2025. STAR-1 is the first of two Phase 3 clinical trials, including a long-term extension study, which the Company will need to complete prior to filing a new drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\n\n\n  * **Raised $7.8 million in gross proceeds during 2024.** The funds raised during 2024, along with the Company's existing cash, is expected to fund its operations into the second quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n\n**Anticipated Upcoming Milestones**\n\n  * **Complete enrollment in its DMT310 Phase 3 STAR-1 clinical trial in moderate-to-severe acne.** Dermata expects to complete enrollment in the STAR-1 study by the end of 2024 and plans to announce topline results from the DMT310 Phase 3 STAR-1 study in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n\n  * **DMT410 Partnership Discussions.** The Company continues to make progress on partnership discussions for its DMT410 program for the topical delivery of botulinum toxin. DMT410 is the Company's combination treatment regimen that uses the unique mechanical features of the Company's DMT310 product to facilitate the intradermal delivery of botulinum toxin by topical application rather than through multiple injections with a needle. The Company believes DMT410 has the potential be to a first-in-class treatment for hyperhidrosis, acne, and facial aesthetics.\n\n\n\n\n**Dermata Conference Participation**\n\n  * **Life Sciences Investor Forum**\n\n    * Date: Thursday, November 14, 2024\n\n    * Time: 12:00pm ET\n\n    * Link: [https://bit.ly/3NuUDa4](https://pr.report/478n)\n\n  * **H.C. Wainwright 26th Annual Global Investment Conference**\n\n  * **2024 Maxim Healthcare Virtual Summit**\n\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $6.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $7.4 million as of December 31, 2023. The $1.3 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulted from $8.2 million of cash used in operations offset by $7.0 million in net financing proceeds. The Company expects its current cash resources to be sufficient to fund operations into the second quarter of 2025.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $2.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $0.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in research and development expense was the result of increased clinical trial expenses from the Company's STAR-1 clinical study, offset by decreased non-clinical and chemistry, manufacturing, and control expenses during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $0.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $0.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was the result of decreased insurance costs.\n\n**About Dermata Therapeutics**\n\nDermata Therapeutics, Inc. is a late-stage biotechnology company focusing on the treatment of medical and aesthetic skin diseases and conditions.

[(Nasdaq:DRMA; DRMAW)](https://pr.report/478m) (\"Dermata,\" or the \"Company\"), a late-stage biotechnology company focused on the treatment of medical and aesthetic skin diseases and conditions, today highlighted recent corporate progress and reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n\"The third quarter was a busy time for our team as we approach completing enrollment in our DMT310 Phase 3 STAR-1 study and were able to raise funds, which we believe will allow us to reach the topline data readout in the STAR-1 study in the first quarter of 2025,\" commented Gerry Proehl, Dermata's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. \"We believe patients deserve an acne treatment that is safe, well-tolerated, applied only once-a-week, with a significant 45% reduction in inflammatory lesions after just four applications, as seen in our DMT310 Phase 2b acne study. With many unique features and benefits, we believe DMT310 can cause a paradigm shift in the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne, if approved,\" concluded Mr. Proehl.\n\n**Corporate Highlights**\n\n  * **Achieved 50% enrollment in its DMT310 Phase 3 STAR-1 clinical trial in moderate-to-severe acne.** After achieving the 50% enrollment milestone in July 2024, Dermata expects to receive topline results from the STAR-1 study in the first quarter of 2025. STAR-1 is the first of two Phase 3 clinical trials, including a long-term extension study, which the Company will need to complete prior to filing a new drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\n\n\n  * **Raised $7.8 million in gross proceeds during 2024.** The funds raised during 2024, along with the Company's existing cash, is expected to fund its operations into the second quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n\n**Anticipated Upcoming Milestones**\n\n  * **Complete enrollment in its DMT310 Phase 3 STAR-1 clinical trial in moderate-to-severe acne.** Dermata expects to complete enrollment in the STAR-1 study by the end of 2024 and plans to announce topline results from the DMT310 Phase 3 STAR-1 study in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n\n  * **DMT410 Partnership Discussions.** The Company continues to make progress on partnership discussions for its DMT410 program for the topical delivery of botulinum toxin. DMT410 is the Company's combination treatment regimen that uses the unique mechanical features of the Company's DMT310 product to facilitate the intradermal delivery of botulinum toxin by topical application rather than through multiple injections with a needle. The Company believes DMT410 has the potential be to a first-in-class treatment for hyperhidrosis, acne, and facial aesthetics.\n\n\n\n\n**Dermata Conference Participation**\n\n  * **Life Sciences Investor Forum**\n\n    * Date: Thursday, November 14, 2024\n\n    * Time: 12:00pm ET\n\n    * Link: [https://bit.ly/3NuUDa4](https://pr.report/478n)\n\n  * **H.C.

The $1.3 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulted from $8.2 million of cash used in operations offset by $7.0 million in net financing proceeds. The Company expects its current cash resources to be sufficient to fund operations into the second quarter of 2025.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $2.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $0.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in research and development expense was the result of increased clinical trial expenses from the Company's STAR-1 clinical study, offset by decreased non-clinical and chemistry, manufacturing, and control expenses during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $0.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $0.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was the result of decreased insurance costs.\n\n**About Dermata Therapeutics**\n\nDermata Therapeutics, Inc. is a late-stage biotechnology company focusing on the treatment of medical and aesthetic skin diseases and conditions.

Botulinum Toxin\nDMT410 Overview\nDMT410’s Combination Regimen for Botulinum Toxin Simple Application Process of DMT410\nDMT410 is a combination treatment using sponge Sponge mixture is massaged into the treatment area:\ntechnology to create millions of microchannels for\n• Enhances spicule penetration\ntopical delivery of botulinum toxin to the dermis\n• Creates microchannels through the stratum corneum\nSponge mixture is then removed after 10-15 minutes\nBotulinum toxin Botulinum toxin liquid formulation is applied to the skin\nSpicule *\n(>100 kD)\nand massaged into the treatment area, utilizing sponge’s\nnewly created microchannels\n* Spicules average about\nSponge mixture creates\n200 µm in length, 10-15 µm millions of microchannels in\nthe human skin\nin diameter\nBenefits of DMT410 versus Injections for Delivery of\nBotulinum Toxin\nMolecule Size Increased Coverage\nInjection Limitation Injection Limitation\n• Botulinum toxin molecules are between 150-900 kDa • Botulinum toxin injections limit the spread over a large\nand are currently injected for clinical efficacy surface area\nDMT410 Potential Benefit DMT410 Potential Benefit\n• DMT410 creates microchannels in the skin that allow • The creation of millions of microchannels allow a\ntopical penetration of botulinum toxin into the dermis uniform topical application of toxin to more easily\ndeliver treatment to a larger surface area\nNo Injections Necessary Additional Uses\nInjection Limitation Injection Limitation\n• Current treatments, like hyperhidrosis, require 10-20 • There are multiple aesthetic
