(“SunOpta” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:STKL) (TSX:SOY), an innovative and sustainable manufacturer fueling the future of food, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 28, 2024. \n\nAll amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars and results are reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, except where specifically noted. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 highlights:**\n\n  * Revenues increased 15.5% to $176.2 million compared to $152.5 million in the year earlier period, driven by 20.6% volume growth partially offset by a 2.8% price reduction for pass-through commodity pricing \n  * Gross profit increased 16.4% to $23.6 million compared to $20.3 million in the prior year period \n  * Loss from continuing operations was $5.5 million compared to a loss of $5.7 million in the prior year period \n  * Adjusted earnings¹ from continuing operations was $2.5 million compared to $0.5 million in the prior year period \n  * Adjusted EBITDA¹ from continuing operations increased 12.6% to $21.5 million, compared to $19.1 million in the prior year period. \n\n\n\n“The third quarter unfolded as expected,” said Brian Kocher, Chief Executive Officer of SunOpta. “Volume again drove our revenue growth reflecting the strength of our competitive position. Our growth remains broad based across our customers, channels and product portfolio and we continue to have a substantial pipeline of new business opportunities. We continue to make short-term investments in our supply chain to support our growth and implement processes and controls. Those productivity initiatives are gaining traction and creating a long runway for significant future incremental capacity within our existing asset base which will drive sustainable gross margin expansion. We remain confident in the direction of our business and steadfast in our focus on driving increasing returns on our invested capital and generating long-term value for shareholders.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nRevenues increased 15.5% to $176.2 million for the third quarter of 2024. The increase was driven by favorable volume/mix of 20.6%, partially offset by a price reduction of 2.8% due to the pass through of commodity costs for certain raw materials. Our exit from the smoothie bowls category in March 2024 resulted in a 2.3% reduction in revenue. Volume/mix reflected volume growth for fruit snacks, broths, plant-based beverages, and protein shakes. \n\nGross profit increased by $3.3 million, or 16.4%, to $23.6 million for the third quarter, compared to $20.3 million in the prior year period. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit margin was 13.4% compared to 13.3% in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted gross margin¹ was 17.0% compared to 16.4% in the third quarter of 2023. The 60-basis point increase in adjusted gross margin reflected higher sales and production volumes partially offset by incremental depreciation of new production equipment for capital expansion projects, together with manufacturing inefficiencies. \n\nOperating income was $1.5 million, up slightly compared to the third quarter of 2023, reflecting higher gross profit together with lower business development and employee severance costs following the divestiture of Frozen Fruit and related consolidation of our continuing operations in 2023, largely offset by higher variable compensation accruals and increased professional fees related to operational productivity initiatives. \n\nLoss from continuing operations was $5.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared with a loss of $5.7 million in the prior year period. Diluted loss per share from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders (after dividends and accretion on preferred stock) was $0.05 for the third quarter compared with a diluted loss per share of $0.05 in the prior year period. \n\nAdjusted earnings¹ from continuing operations was $2.5 million or $0.02 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2024 compared to adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $0.5 million or $0.00 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA¹ from continuing operations was $21.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $19.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n\nPlease refer to the discussion and table below under “Non-GAAP Measures”. \n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow**\n\nAs of September 28, 2024, SunOpta had total assets of $699.3 million and total debt of $289.9 million compared to total assets of $669.4 million and total debt of $263.2 million at year end fiscal 2023. During the three quarters ended September 28, 2024, cash provided in operating activities of continuing operations was $19.2 million compared to $8.4 million of cash used in operating activities of continuing operations during the same period in 2023. The increase in cash provided from operating activities mainly reflected improved working capital efficiency, together with improved profitability, driven by revenue volume growth and lower start-up costs related to our Midlothian, Texas, facility. Investing activities of continuing operations consumed $16.5 million of cash during the first three quarters of 2024 down from $37.3 million for the same period in the prior year, reflecting the completion of certain major capital projects including the construction of our new plant-based beverage facility in Midlothian, Texas. \n\n**2024 Outlook 2 **\n\nFor fiscal 2024, the Company is reaffirming its outlook and continues to expect strong growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA: \n\n($ millions)  |  Outlook  |  Growth   \n---|---|---  \nRevenue  |  $  |  710 - 730  |  13% – 16%   \nAdj. EBITDA  |  $  |  88 – 92  |  12% - 17%   \n  \n**Conference Call**\n\nSunOpta plans to host a conference call at 5:30 P.M. Eastern time on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, to discuss the third quarter financial results. After prepared remarks, there will be a question and answer period.

These non–GAAP financial measures are derived by excluding certain amounts, expenses or income, from the corresponding financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures is a matter of management judgment and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts recognized in a given period. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of the aforementioned forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because management cannot reliably predict all the necessary components of such GAAP measures. Historically, management has excluded the following items from certain of these non-GAAP measures, and such items may also be excluded in future periods and could be significant amounts. \n\n  * Expenses related to the acquisition or divestiture of a business, including business development costs, impairment of assets, integration costs, severance, retention costs and transaction costs; \n  * Start-up costs of new facilities and equipment; \n  * Charges associated with restructuring and cost saving initiatives, including but not limited to asset impairments, accelerated depreciation, severance costs and lease abandonment charges; \n  * Asset impairment charges and facility closure costs; \n  * Legal settlements or awards; and \n  * The tax effect of the above items. \n\n  \n  \n**About SunOpta Inc.**\n\nSunOpta (Nasdaq:STKL) (TSX:SOY) is an innovative and sustainable manufacturer fueling the future of food.

This non-GAAP measure excludes non-capitalizable start-up costs included in cost of goods sold that are incurred in connection with capital expansion projects. Start-up costs have had a significant impact on the comparability of reported gross margins, which may obscure trends in the Company’s margin performance. Additionally, the Company’s measure of adjusted gross margin may exclude other unusual items that are identified and evaluated on an individual basis, which due to their nature or size, the Company would not expect to occur as part of its normal business on a regular basis. The Company believes that disclosing this non-GAAP measure provides investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of its profitability measure for the periods presented. However, the non-GAAP measure of adjusted gross margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for gross margin calculated based on gross profit determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin from reported gross margin calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.   \n---  \nQuarter ended  |  Three quarters ended   \nSeptember 28, 2024  |  September 30, 2023  |  September 28, 2024  |  September 30, 2023   \nReported gross margin  |  13.4%  |  13.3%  |  14.6%  |  14.0%   \nStart-up costs (a) |  2.4%  |  3.1%  |  1.3%  |  3.6%   \nWastewater haul-off charges (b) |  1.2%  |  -  |  0.7%  |  -   \nProduct withdrawal costs (c) |  -  |  -  |  0.4%  |  -   \nAdjusted gross margin  |  17.0%  |  16.4%  |  16.9%  |  17.7%   \n_Note: percentages may not add due to rounding._  \n(a) |  For the third quarter and first three quarters of 2024, start-up costs of $4.1 million and $6.8 million, respectively, were recorded in costs of goods sold, which were mainly related to the scale-up of production at our plant-based beverage facility in Midlothian, Texas, including the start-up of a new high-speed Edge line. In addition, start-up costs for the third quarter and first three quarters of 2024, include the ramp-up of oat-base extraction operations at our Modesto, California, facility. For the third quarter and first three quarters of 2023, start-up costs of $4.7 million and $16.3 million, respectively, included in cost of goods sold mainly related to the initial ramp-up of production at our Midlothian, Texas, facility, and the addition of new extrusion and high-speed packaging lines at our fruit snacks facility in Omak, Washington.   \n---|---  \n(b) |  For the third quarter and first three quarters of 2024, we incurred temporary third-party haul-off charges of $2.2 million and $3.6 million, respectively, for excess wastewater produced at our Midlothian, Texas, facility, due to volume constraints within our current treatment system.   \n(c) |  In the second quarter of 2024, we conducted a voluntary withdrawal from customers of certain batches of aseptically-packaged products that may have had the potential for non-pathogenic microbial contamination. None of the withdrawn product made it into the consumer marketplace. For the first three quarters of 2024, we recognized direct costs related to the withdrawal of $2.1 million, net of expected insurance recoveries, which included finished goods inventory write-offs, product return and logistic costs, and costs related to investigative and remedial actions taken in response to the withdrawal, which corrective actions have been completed. These charges are incremental to our normal course reserves and have had a significant unfavorable impact on our reported gross profit and gross margin for the first three quarters of 2024.   \nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company provides additional information about its operating results regarding adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) from continuing operations, which are not measures in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company believes that adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations assist investors in comparing performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that management believes are not indicative of its operating performance. These non-GAAP measures are presented solely to allow investors to more fully assess the Company’s results of operations and should not be considered in isolation of, or as substitutes for, an analysis of the Company’s results as reported under U.S. GAAP.  The following are tabular presentations of adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, including a reconciliation from loss from continuing operations, which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.   \n---  \n**September 28, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023**  \nPer Share  |  Per Share   \n**For the quarter ended** |  $  |  $  |  $  |  $   \nLoss from continuing operations  |  (5,498  |  )  |  (5,680  |  )   \nDividends and accretion on preferred stock  |  (137  |  )  |  (426  |  )   \nLoss from continuing operations attributable to common   \nshareholders  |  (5,635  |  )  |  (0.05  |  )  |  (6,106  |  )  |  (0.05  |  )   \nAdjusted for:   \nStart-up costs (a) |  4,980  |  4,733   \nWastewater haul-off charges (b) |  2,180  |  -   \nUnrealized foreign exchange loss on restricted cash (c) |  525  |  -   \nBusiness development costs (d) |  -  |  928   \nSeverance costs (e) |  -  |  897   \nOther (f) |  450  |  -   \nAdjusted earnings from continuing operations  |  2,500  |  0.02  |  452  |  0.00   \n**September 28, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n---|---  \n**For the quarter ended** |  $  |  $   \nLoss from continuing operations  |  (5,498  |  )  |  (5,680  |  )   \nInterest expense, net  |  6,762  |  7,162   \nLoss on sale of receivables*  |  236  |  -   \nIncome tax expense  |  23  |  -   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  9,319  |  7,983   \nStock-based compensation  |  2,527  |  3,068   \nAdjusted for:   \nStart-up costs (a) |  4,980  |  4,733   \nWastewater haul-off charges (b) |  2,180  |  -   \nUnrealized foreign exchange loss on restricted cash (c) |  525  |  -   \nBusiness development costs (d) |  -  |  928   \nSeverance costs (e) |  -  |  897   \nOther (f) |  450  |  -   \nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations  |  21,504  |  19,091   \n* Included in other non-operating expense.   \n(a) |  Refer to footnote (a) to the Adjusted Gross Margin table above for a description of start-up costs included in cost of goods sold.

The favorable volume/mix reflected the incremental output from our\ncapital expansion projects, together with new product innovation launches, which produced sales volume growth with existing and new customers across our fruit snack, broth, tea, protein shake, and plant-based\nbeverage product lines.\n(2) For the first three quarters of 2024, we incurred start-up costs included in cost of goods sold of $6.8 million (1.3% gross margin impact), compared with start-up costs of $16.3 million (3.6% gross margin impact) for the\nfirst three quarters of 2023. Start-up costs for the first three quarters of 2024, were mainly related to the scale-up of production at our plant-based beverage facility in Midlothian, Texas, including the start-up of a new\nhigh-speed Edge line, together with the ramp-up of oat-base extraction operations at our Modesto, California, facility. In addition, for the first three quarters of 2024, we incurred haul-off charges of $3.6 million (0.7%\ngross margin impact) for excess wastewater produced at our plant-based beverage facility in Midlothian, Texas, due to volume constraints within our current treatment system, and, in the second and third quarters of\n2024, we recognized direct costs of $2.1 million (0.4% gross margin impact), net of expected insurance recoveries, related to our voluntary withdrawal in the second quarter of 2024, of certain batches of aseptically-\npackaged products that may have had the potential for non-pathogenic microbial contamination.\n(3) Operating income increased $11.1 million to $14.3 million for the three quarters ended September 28, 2024, compared with $3.2 million for the three quarters ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating income\nreflected higher gross profit, as described above, together with a gain on sale of the smoothie bowls product line of $1.8 million, and lower business development and employee severance costs following the divestiture\nof Frozen Fruit and related consolidation of our continuing operations in 2023. These factors were partially offset by higher variable employee compensation accruals based on performance, together with higher stock-\nbased compensation expense due to the timing of our annual incentive plan grants and the accelerated vesting of certain previously granted awards in connection with the retirement of our former Chief Executive\nOfficer (“CEO”). In addition, in the first three quarters of 2024, we recognized an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $1.4 million on peso-denominated restricted cash held in Mexico.\n(4) Adjusted earnings from continuing operations, Adjusted earnings from continuing operations per share and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures.

For the first three quarters of 2023, start-up costs of $16.3 million included\nin cost of goods sold mainly related to the initial ramp-up of production at our Midlothian, Texas, facility, and the addition of new extrusion and high-speed packaging lines at our fruit snacks facility in Omak, Washington.\nAdditionally, for the first three quarters of 2024 and 2023, start-up costs included $0.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively, of professional fees related to operational productivity initiatives, which are recorded in SG&A\nexpenses.\nb) For the first three quarters of 2024, we incurred third-party haul-off charges of $3.6 million for excess wastewater produced at our Midlothian, Texas, facility, due to volume constraints within our current treatment system.\nc) In the second quarter of 2024, we conducted a voluntary withdrawal from customers of certain batches of aseptically-packaged products that may have had the potential for non-pathogenic microbial contamination. None of\nthe withdrawn product made it into the consumer marketplace. In the second and third quarters of 2024, we recognized direct costs related to the withdrawal of $2.1 million, net of expected insurance recoveries, which\nincluded finished goods inventory write-offs, product return and logistic costs, and costs related to investigative and remedial actions taken in response to the withdrawal, which corrective actions have been completed.\nThese charges are incremental to our normal course reserves and have had an unfavorable impact on our reported gross profit and gross margin for the first three quarters of 2024.\nd) For the first three quarters of 2024, reflects an unrealized foreign exchange loss associated with peso-denominated bank accounts in Mexico that were retained following the divestiture of Frozen Fruit.

Generally, forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or\ncurrent facts and are typically accompanied by words such as anticipate, estimate, target, intend, project, potential,\npredict, continue, believe, expect, can, could, would, should, may, might, plan, will, budget,\nforecast, the negatives of such terms, and words and phrases of similar impact and include, but are not limited to, references\nto future financial and operating results, plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions; our expectations regarding the future\nprofitability of our business, including anticipated results of operations, revenue trends, and gross margin profile; the expected\nimpact of the inflationary cost environment on our business, including raw material, packaging, labor, energy, fuel and\ntransportation costs; the expected impact of pricing actions on sales volumes and gross margins; the expected impact of cost\ncontainment measures and productivity initiatives; our expectations regarding customer demand, consumer preferences,\ncompetition, sales pricing, availability and pricing of raw material inputs, and timing and cost to complete capital expansion\nprojects; our ability to successfully execute on our capital investment plans, and the viability of those plans; disruptions or\ninefficiencies in the supply chain; the adequacy of internally generated funds and existing sources of liquidity, such as the\navailability of bank financing; the anticipated sufficiency of future cash flows to enable the payments of interest and repayment\nof debt, working capital needs, planned capital expenditures; and our ability to obtain additional financing or issue additional\ndebt or equity securities; our intentions related to the potential sale of selected businesses, operations, or assets; our estimates\nfor losses and related insurance recoveries associated with the recall of specific frozen fruit products initiated in the second\nquarter of 2023; the outcome of litigation to which we may, from time to time, be a party; and other statements that are not\nhistorical facts. These forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions,\nexpectations and analyses we make in light of our experience and our interpretation of current conditions, historical trends and\nexpected future developments, as well as other factors that we believe are appropriate in the circumstances.\nWhether actual results and developments will be consistent with and meet our expectations and predictions is subject to many\nrisks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from\nour expectations and predictions. We believe these factors include, but are not limited to, the impact of global economic\nconditions, including inflation, interest rates, and energy availability; the potential for economic disruption due to geopolitical\nevents and health crises; our ability to increase pricing to offset, or partially offset, inflationary pressures on the cost of our\nproducts; issues affecting our supply chain and procurement of raw materials, including fluctuations in the cost and availability\nof raw and packaging materials; labor shortages, employee turnover, and labor cost increases; business interruptions due to\nweather events, natural disasters, other unexpected events or public health crises; the potential loss of one or more of our key\ncustomers; our ability to identify, interpret and react to changes in consumer preferences and demand; our ability to effectively\nrespond to competitive factors, including product innovations of our competitors; a failure to realize some or all of the\nanticipated benefits from our capital investment plans; a failure to successfully integrate or divest businesses, operations, or\nassets; impairments of long-lived assets or goodwill; a failure of our internal control over financial reporting; occurrence of\nproduct recall and withdrawal events; results of litigation and other legal proceedings; changes in government regulations and\npolicies; infringements of our intellectual property; risks associated with our information technology systems, including the\nthreat of data breaches and cyber-attacks; the impacts of severe weather events, natural disasters, and climate change on the\nsupply and cost of raw and packaging materials, as well as energy, fuel and water; the availability and pricing of non-GMO\nand organic ingredients; global economic and financial conditions on availability of financing and interest rates; the effects of\nincreased debt levels and service obligations on our ability to borrow or the cost of any such additional borrowing on our\nability to react to certain economic and industry conditions; and other risks described herein under Part I, Item 1A Risk\nFactors.\nAll forward-looking statements made herein are qualified by these cautionary statements, and our actual results or the\ndevelopments we anticipate may not be realized.

The foregoing\nfactors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are\nincluded in this report.\nSUNOPTA INC. 3 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nPART I\nItem 1. Business\nThe Company\nSunOpta Inc. was organized under the laws of Canada in 1973. We operate as a manufacturer for leading natural and private\nlabel brands and also produce our own propriety brands, including SOWN®, Dream® and West Life. The core of our product\nportfolio is a range of plant-based beverages, including oat, almond, soy, coconut and rice milks and creamers, which have a\nfavorable climate profile relative to traditional dairy milks in terms of lower carbon emissions and water usage. Our plant-\nbased offerings include non-genetically modified (non-GMO), organic, and gluten-free products. Our consumer products\nportfolio also includes protein shakes, teas, broths, and fruit snacks. In October 2023, we completed the divestiture of our\ncommodity-based frozen fruit business (Frozen Fruit), in order to focus on value-add products in plant-based and healthy\nsnack categories (see below  Divestiture of Frozen Fruit).\nWe sell our products through various distribution channels including private label products to retail customers; branded\nproducts under co-manufacturing agreements to other branded food companies for their distribution; and our own branded\nproducts to retail and foodservice customers. In addition, we also produce liquid and dry ingredients for internal use and for\nsale to other food and beverage manufacturers.\nOur employees and production facilities are principally located in the U.S., as well as Canada. Our corporate headquarters is\nlocated in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, together with our innovation center and pilot plant.\nDivestiture of Frozen Fruit\nOn October 12, 2023, we completed the sale of certain assets and liabilities of Frozen Fruit, which included owned facilities of\nFrozen Fruit located in Edwardsville, Kansas, and Jacona, Mexico. In December 2023, we completed the liquidation of a leased\nfrozen fruit facility located in Oxnard, California. These transactions represent our exit from the processing, packaging and\nselling of individually quick frozen fruit for retail, foodservice and industrial applications and completes our strategic\noptimization plan for our non-core, commodity-based businesses, which included the divestiture of our sunflower business\n(Sunflower) in October 2022. Frozen Fruit and Sunflower have been classified as discontinued operations.\nCustomers and Competition\nWe sell our products through various distribution channels, including foodservice operators, grocery retailers and club stores,\nbranded food companies, and food manufacturers, located principally in the U.S. We generally conduct our business with\ncustomers based on purchase orders or pursuant to contracts that are terminable by either party following a designated notice\nperiod. However, some of our contracts may extend for several years and/or include volume purchase commitments. A\nrelatively limited number of customers account for a large percentage of our revenues. In 2023, our ten largest customers\naccounted for approximately 80% of our revenues from continuing operations.\nWe compete with major branded and private-label food manufacturers that have significantly greater resources and brand\nrecognition than we do. However, we believe that the strategic locations of our manufacturing and distribution facilities, our\nin-house processing and packaging capabilities, and our innovation center and pilot plant, allows us to compete effectively. For\nsales of private label and co-manufactured products, the principal competitive factors are product quality, reliability of service,\ninnovation, and price. For sales of our own branded products, the principal competitive factors are consumer brand recognition\nand loyalty, product quality, promotion, and price.\nRaw Materials\nOur raw materials primarily consist of ingredients and packaging materials. Principal ingredients used in our products include\noats, almonds, soybeans, coconut, apple and sugar. For critical raw materials, we identify and qualify alternate sources of\nsupply, where possible. Ingredients are subject to fluctuations in market price caused by weather, growing and harvesting\nconditions, market conditions, including inflationary cost increases, and other factors beyond our control. Where possible, we\nmitigate market price volatility by entering into annual purchase arrangements with our suppliers and by incorporating pass-\nthrough pricing adjustment clauses into our contracts with customers. The costs of raw materials used in our products also\nfluctuate due to energy costs, fuel prices, labor availability, and freight and storage demand. Volatility in the cost of our raw\nmaterials can adversely affect our performance, as price changes may lag behind changes in costs, and we are not always able\nto adjust our pricing to reflect changes in raw material costs due to competitive pressures.\nSUNOPTA INC. 4 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nWe rely on our packaging suppliers to ensure delivery of often unique, portable, and convenient consumer packaging formats.\nIn our plant-based beverage processing facilities, we specialize in the use of Tetra Pak processing and packaging equipment in\na variety of package sizes, and an array of opening types and extended shelf-life options. Over 95% of our packaging by weight\nis recyclable, and we are committed to working with our suppliers to innovate and develop new packaging technologies to\nfurther reduce the impact on the environment, while maintaining the quality and safety of our products.\nNatural gas and electricity are the primary sources of energy used to power our plants and processing equipment, and water is\nthe principal ingredient in many of our products and is essential to our production processes.\nDiesel fuel is used in connection with the distribution of our products, and we rely on third-party transportation providers to\ndeliver raw materials, as well as our products to our customers.\nSeasonality\nOverall, the demand for most of our products does not typically fluctuate significantly in any particular season; however, broth\nsales are generally higher in the first and fourth quarters of each year.\nProduct Development\nOur 24,000 square foot innovation center and pilot plant located in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, supports our product development\nteam of 21 highly trained and experienced food scientists and technologists that are dedicated to the development of innovative\nfood and beverage offerings and addressing product development opportunities for our customers. These opportunities include\nnew and custom formulations, innovations in packaging formats, and new production processes and applications. Applications\nand technical support provided to our customers include all aspects of product development from concept to commercial launch,\nas well as ongoing manufacturing and processing support.\nTrademarks\nWe market our own consumer brands under trademarks that we own, including SOWN, Dream and West Life. While we\nconsider these trademarks to be valuable to the marketing and sale of our proprietary brands, we do not consider any trademark\nto be of such material importance that its absence would cause a material disruption of our business.\nHuman Capital\nOur Human Capital Management strategy is based on our goal of Putting the YOU in SunOpta. We develop employee\nprograms, benefits, and compensation to align with four pillars of well-being: physical, financial, social, and emotional.\nExamples of these initiatives are:\nOffering a competitive compensation and benefit package that includes choices for each employee to select which\nworks best for them. Our comprehensive benefits package includes health insurance, company-paid life, accident, and\ndisability insurance, 401(k), employee stock purchase plan, paid time off, paid parental and maternity leave programs,\nflexible schedules, and a tuition reimbursement program. In 2023, we implemented two additional paid personal\nholidays for our regular, full-time employees called You Days, which can be taken in recognition of an employees\nbirthday and work anniversary date. In addition, we added a mental health benefit that provides faster access to care\nat the individual level of need for employees and their families. As part of our focus on financial wellness, we\nannounced expedited access to our 401(k) plan, beginning in 2024 so employees can realize the benefits of planning\nfor retirement with employer match earlier in their tenure.\nWe believe it is key to give back to the communities in which we live and work as evidenced by our community\nservice and volunteerism program, which we refer to as SunOpta Cares. This program provides 24 hours of paid\ntime off for our employees to volunteer with community programs that align with their values. Throughout the year,\nemployees have several opportunities to donate talent and gifts to local charitable organizations.\nTalent management and growth is instrumental in developing a sustainable workforce. We provide various\nopportunities for our employees to learn and grow within SunOpta through individual development plans, on-the-job\ntraining, special project assignments, monthly safety training and regular leader led learning sessions. In 2023, we\nexpanded the Foundational Manager Program to all of our plant locations. This offering was created for managers and\nsupervisors with a focus on cross-functional leadership, effective communication, leading through change, influencing\nwith integrity, negotiating, and creative problem solving. We are committed to identifying and developing the talents\nof our next generation leaders. On an annual basis, we conduct talent assessments across the organization and\nSUNOPTA INC. 5 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nsuccession planning for our most critical roles within the organization to identify high potential employees, gaps in\ncapabilities or skills, and bench strength. In 2023, we had the first cohort of the Leadership Impact Program.\nParticipants at the SVP and VP level gathered quarterly throughout the year to focus on leadership skills, strategy,\nprofessional growth and completed capstone projects to further the business.\nWe believe in the power of diversity. We provide training regarding diversity, equity and inclusion for employees to\nbetter understand how we can all work together, and be better, by embracing our differences. We foster inclusion by\nrecognizing and supporting activities and initiatives representative of our workforce such as celebrations of Black\nHistory month, Hispanic Heritage month, PRIDE, National Native American Heritage month, and our Womens\nLeadership Program. We continue to foster our Hispanic and Womens Employee Resource Groups by offering\nprogramming for awareness, education and collaboration.\nWe encourage our employees to be guided by our MVBs (Most Valued Behaviors) of speed, dedication, problem solving,\npassion, entrepreneurship, and customer centricity. We have a peer recognition program which allows employees to recognize\nothers who are demonstrating our MVBs. Our leaders also recognize employees through our quarterly awards program.\nSunOpta conducts an organizational health survey two times each year to check the pulse of our workforce and look for areas\nof improvement through the lens of all our employees. We engage in communication efforts such as quarterly town halls and\nmonthly all-company huddles that we believe help employees feel they are a part of SunOpta as a whole, not just their individual\ndepartment or location.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed 1,174 full-time employees in North America. Our average employee has over four\nyears of service. In 2023, our voluntary turnover was 20% (down from 22% in 2022) across the Company. We continue to\nfocus on increasing employee retention by implementing retention programs and initiatives to increase employee engagement.\nEmployee health and safety is paramount to our success. In addition to our safety training and initiatives at our manufacturing\nfacilities, we track our Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) which ended the year at 1.02, compared to a goal of 1.3.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance\nWe are committed to incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles into our business strategies and\norganizational culture. The Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors provides oversight on ESG matters.\nDetails on our ESG commitments and progress are set out in our most recent ESG report (available at\nsunopta.com/sustainability), which shall not be deemed to be a part of this Form 10-K or incorporated into any of our other\nfilings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) or Canadian Securities Administrators (the\nCSA).\nRegulations\nWe are subject to a wide range of governmental regulations and policies in the U.S. and Canada. These laws, regulations and policies\nare implemented, as applicable in each jurisdiction, on the national, federal, state, provincial, and local levels. For example, we are\naffected by laws and regulations related to seed, fertilizer, and pesticides; the purchasing, harvesting, transportation, and\nwarehousing of agricultural products; the processing, packaging, and sale of food and beverages, including wholesale operations;\nand product labeling and marketing, food safety and food defense. We are also affected by government-sponsored price supports,\nacreage set aside programs, and a number of environmental regulations.\nU.S. Regulations\nOur activities in the U.S. are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture (USDA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and the Departments of Commerce and Labor,\nas well as voluntary regulation by other bodies. Various state and local agencies also regulate our activities.\nUSDA National Organic Program and Similar Regulations\nWe manufacture and distribute a number of organic products that are subject to the standards set forth in the Organic Foods\nProduction Act and the regulations adopted thereunder by the National Organic Standards Board. In addition, our organic products\nmay be subject to various state regulations. We believe that we are in material compliance with the organic regulations applicable\nto our business, and we maintain an organic testing and verification process. Generally, organic food products are produced using:\nagricultural management practices intended to promote and enhance ecosystem health;\nSUNOPTA INC. 6 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\ningredients produced without genetically engineered seeds or crops, sewage sludge, long-lasting pesticides, herbicides,\nor fungicides; and\nfood processing practices intended to protect the integrity of the organic product and disallow irradiation, genetically\nmodified organisms, or synthetic preservatives.\nAfter becoming certified, organic operations must retain records concerning the production, harvesting, and handling of\nagricultural products that are to be sold as organic for a period of five years. Any organic operation found to be in violation of\nthe USDA organic regulations is subject to potential enforcement actions, which can include financial penalties or suspension\nor revocation of their organic certificate.\nFood Safety, Labeling and Packaging Regulations\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Fair\nPackaging and Labeling Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA and the FTC. This regulatory framework\ngoverns the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging, and safety of food in the U.S. state and\nlocal statutes and regulations may impose additional food safety, labeling, and packaging requirements. For instance, the\nCalifornia Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (commonly referred to as Proposition 65) requires, with\na few exceptions, that a specific warning appear on any consumer product sold in California that contains a substance, above\ncertain levels, listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. We believe we are in material\ncompliance with state and local statutes and regulations as they apply to our business.\nEnvironmental Regulations\nWe are also subject to various U.S. federal, state, and local environmental regulations. Some of the key environmental regulations\nin the U.S. include, but are not limited to, the following:\nAir quality regulations  air quality is regulated by the EPA and certain city/state air pollution control groups. Emission\nreports are filed annually.\nWaste treatment/disposal regulations  solid waste is either disposed of by a third-party or, in some cases, we have a\npermit to haul and apply the sludge to land. Agreements exist with local city sewer districts to treat waste at specified\nlevels of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and other constituents. This can\nrequire weekly/monthly reporting as well as annual inspection.\nSewer regulations  we have agreements with the local city sewer districts to treat waste at specified limits of BOD\nand TSS. This requires weekly/monthly reporting as well as annual inspection.\nHazardous chemicals regulations  various reports are filed with local, city, and state emergency response agencies to\nidentify potential hazardous chemicals being used in our U.S. facilities.\nStorm-water  all of our U.S. facilities are inspected annually and must comply with an approved storm-water plan to\nprotect water supplies.\nEmployee Safety Regulations\nWe are subject to certain safety regulations, including OSHA regulations. These regulations require us to comply with certain\nmanufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. We believe that we are in material compliance with\nall employee safety regulations applicable to our business.\nSUNOPTA INC. 7 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nCanadian Regulations\nIn Canada, the sale of food is regulated under various federal and provincial laws, principally (but not limited to) the Safe Food for\nCanadians Act (SFCA), the Food and Drugs Act (FADA), the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA), the Canadian\nFood Inspection Agency Act (CFIAA) and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA), along with their\nsupporting regulations. The following is a summary of each of these statutes to the extent that they apply or potentially apply to the\nCompany and its operations:\nSafe Food for Canadians Regulations (SFCR) (under the SFCA)  the SFCR came into effect on January 15, 2019, and\nconsolidated 14 sets of existing food regulations into a single set of regulations which governs all imported, exported, or\ninter-provincially traded food products. Some provisions of the SFCA and SFCR also apply intra-provincially. Notably,\nSFCR replaced the Organic Products Regulations, 2009, the Processed Products Regulations and, to the extent that they\nrelated to food products, the Consumer Packaging and Labeling Act and its supporting regulations. Principal elements of\nthe SCFR that may impact the Company include licensing requirements, preventative controls, traceability\nrequirements, commodity-specific requirements, reporting requirements and timelines, an export certificate request\nprocess, packaging and labeling requirements to ensure food safety and prevent false or misleading labeling, regulation\nof the use of grades and grade names, standards of identity and expansion of the certification process for organic\nproducts, and other requirements. Timelines for complying with the SFCR requirements vary by food, activity, and size\nof the food business.\nFood and Drug Regulations (under the FADA)  food and drugs are subject to specific regulatory requirements, including\ncomposition (such as food additives, fortification, and food standards), packaging, labeling, advertising, and marketing,\nand licensing requirements. New requirements regarding nutrition and ingredient labeling and food color were introduced\nin 2016. In 2022, the Government of Canada, with support from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (the CFIA),\namended the Food and Drug Regulations to update the requirements for labelling pre-packaged food products. The\namendments to the Food and Drug Regulations are part of the CFIAs initiative to modernize Canadas food labelling\nsystem.\nCanadian Food Inspection Agency Act (CFIAA)  the CFIAA grants power to the CFIA, which is tasked with the\nadministration and enforcement of certain Canadian food legislation. By virtue of the CFIAA and the SFCA, the CFIA\nhas the power to inspect and, if deemed necessary, recall certain products, including fresh fruit and vegetables,\nprocessed foods, and organic foods, if the Minister of Health believes that such products pose a risk to the public,\nanimal or plant health.\nSubstance Regulations  various regulations under CEPA regulate the importation and use of certain substances in\nCanada. For example, prior to the importation and use in products, the importer must ensure that all ingredients are\nfound on the Domestic Substances List (DSL) maintained by Environment and Climate Change Canada. In the event\nthat an ingredient is not found on the DSL, then subject to the amount of the substance imported into Canada and used\nin products sold in Canada, a filing may become necessary under the New Substances Notification Regulations.\nCanada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)  the CCPSA provides oversight and regulation of consumer\nproducts with respect to manufacturers, importers, and retailers. It includes, without limitation, the ability to require\nproduct recalls, mandatory incident reporting, document retention requirements, increased fines and penalties, and\npackaging and labeling requirements. While the CCPSA does not apply to food, it does apply to its packaging with\nrespect to safety. It is possible that there will be amendments introduced to the FADA, to capture the essence of the\nregulatory oversight found in the CCPSA. We have no way of anticipating if and when that may occur.\nEnvironmental Compliance\nAs described above, we are subject to environmental regulations in the U.S. and Canada. Our business also requires that we have\ncertain permits from various state, provincial and local authorities related to air quality, water consumption and treatment,\nstormwater discharge, solid waste, land spreading and hazardous waste. We are committed to meeting all applicable environmental\ncompliance requirements.\nIntellectual Property\nThe nature of a number of our products and processes requires that we create and maintain patents, trade secrets and trademarks.\nOur policy is to protect our technology, brands, and trademarks by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology\nrelating to the development of our business in the U.S. and in selected foreign jurisdictions, registering trademarks in the U.S.,\nSUNOPTA INC. 8 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nCanada and selected foreign jurisdictions where we sell products, and maintaining confidentiality agreements with outside\nparties and employees.\nOur continued success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our products, trade names and technology under U.S. and\ninternational patent laws and other intellectual property laws. We believe that we own or have sufficient rights to use all of the\nproprietary technology, information and trademarks necessary to manufacture and market our products; however, there is\nalways a risk that patent applications relating to our products or technologies will not result in patents being issued, or, if issued,\nwill be later challenged by a third party, or that current or additional patents will not afford protection against competitors with\nsimilar technology.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how and confidentiality agreements to protect certain technologies and\nprocesses. However, even with these steps taken, our outside partners and contract manufacturers could gain access to our\nproprietary technology and confidential information. All employees are required to adhere to internal policies, which are\nintended to further protect our technologies, processes, and trade secrets.\nAvailable Information\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those\nreports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), are\navailable free of charge on our website at www.sunopta.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such information\nelectronically with, or furnish it to, the SEC and the CSA.\nAdditionally, the SEC and CSA maintain internet sites that contain reports, proxy and information statements, and other\ninformation regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC and CSA, which can be found at http://www.sec.gov and\nhttp://www.sedarplus.ca, respectively.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those\ndescribed below and elsewhere in this report. We believe the most significant of these risks and uncertainties are described\nbelow, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our cash flows,\nliquidity, stock price and/or reputation, and could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the\nforward-looking statements contained in this report. There may be additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us\nor that we currently consider immaterial. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of\nall possible risks or uncertainties applicable to our business. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other\ninformation in this report and in the other documents that we file from time to time with the SEC and the CSA.\nRisks Related to Our Company, Business and Operations\nDeterioration of global economic conditions, an economic recession, periods of inflation, or economic uncertainty in our\nkey markets may adversely affect customer and consumer spending, as well as demand for our products\nGlobal economic conditions can be uncertain and volatile. Our business and results of operations have in the past been, and\nmay continue to be, adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions including inflation, interest rates, consumer\nspending rates, energy availability and costs, the negative impacts caused by public health crises, such as the COVID-19\npandemic, as well as the potential impacts of geopolitical events, and the effect of governmental initiatives to manage economic\nconditions. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty remains, trends in consumer\nspending also remain unpredictable and subject to reductions due to credit constraints and uncertainties about the future. Most\nof our products are purchased by our customers based on end-user demand from consumers. Some of the factors that may\ninfluence consumer spending include general economic conditions, high levels of unemployment, health crises, higher\nconsumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in\nhome values, fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity\nprices, inflationary pressure, tax rates, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Unfavorable\neconomic conditions may lead customers and consumers to delay or reduce purchases of our products and could present\nchallenges in collecting our account receivables on a timely basis. Customer demand for our products may not reach our targets\nor may decline as distributors and retailers seek to reduce inventory positions if there is an economic downturn or economic\nuncertainty in our key markets. Economic cycles and related fluctuations in customer demand may have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSUNOPTA INC. 9 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nWe may not be able to increase prices to fully offset inflationary pressures on costs, such as raw and packaging materials,\nlabor, energy, fuel and distribution costs, which may impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations\nIn recent years, we have experienced elevated commodity and supply chain costs, including the costs of raw materials,\npackaging, labor, energy, fuel, freight and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products, and we\nexpect elevated levels of inflation to continue in 2024. Many of these materials and costs are subject to price fluctuations from\na number of factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, geopolitical events, demand for raw materials, weather,\ngrowing and harvesting conditions, energy and fuel costs, currency fluctuations, and other factors beyond our control.\nOur attempts to offset these cost pressures, such as through increases in the selling prices of some of our products, may not be\nsuccessful. Higher product prices may result in lower sales volumes. Consumers may shift to lower priced product offerings,\nor may forego some purchases altogether, during an economic downturn or times of increased inflationary pressure. To the\nextent that our efforts to offset cost inflation through price increases, and/or through cost containment measures and\nproductivity initiatives, are not sufficient to offset these increased costs adequately or in a timely manner, and/or if they result\nin significant decreases in sales volume, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and\nadversely affected.\nIf we do not manage our supply chain effectively, our operating results may be adversely affected\nOur supply chain is complex and critical to our ability to manufacture, move, and sell products. We rely on third-party suppliers\nfor our raw materials and packaging, as well as the distribution of our products. The inability of any of these suppliers to deliver\nor perform for us in a timely or cost-effective manner could cause our operating costs to rise and our margins to fall. Many of\nour products are perishable and require timely processing and transportation to our customers. Additionally, many of our\nproducts can only be stored for a limited amount of time before they spoil and cannot be sold. We must continually monitor\nour inventory and product sales mix against forecasted demand to reduce the risk of not having adequate supplies to meet\nconsumer demand or the risk of having too much inventory that may reach its expiration date. General macroeconomic and\nconditions, geopolitical events and health crises have increased the challenges of managing our supply chain, and these factors\ncould continue to cause unpredictable supply chain interruptions or other adverse effects on our supply chain. If we are unable\nto manage our supply chain effectively and ensure that our products are available to meet consumer demand, our operating\ncosts could increase and our margins could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nIf we face labor shortages or increased labor costs, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected\nLabor is a primary component of operating our business. Our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to\nidentify, hire, train, and retain qualified employees. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry\nfor talented employees. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high-level, our ability to\nefficiently operate our manufacturing facilities and overall business could be adversely affected. Our ability to meet our labor\nneeds while controlling labor costs is subject to external factors, such as employment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum\nwage legislation, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs, and governmental labor and employment\nrequirements. In addition, a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base could lead to\nincreased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand, costs to hire and train new employees, and increased wage rates\nand employee benefits to attract and retain employees. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover, labor\ninflation, and changes in applicable employment laws and regulations, could lead to increased labor costs and/or reduced\noperating efficiencies, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nAn interruption at one or more of our manufacturing facilities could negatively affect our business, and our business\ncontinuity plan may prove inadequate\nWe own or lease, manage and operate a number of manufacturing, processing, packaging, storage and office facilities. We may\nbe unable to accept and fulfill customer orders as a result of disasters, health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), business\ninterruptions, or other similar events. Some of our inventory and manufacturing facilities are located in areas that are susceptible\nto harsh weather, and the production of certain of our products is concentrated in a few geographic areas. Although we have a\nbusiness continuity plan, our plan might not address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other\nunanticipated issues. Our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from\nany of the foregoing. In the event that a disaster, or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of any of our facilities or\ninterrupt our operations for any extended period of time, or if harsh weather or health crises prevent us from producing and/or\nSUNOPTA INC. 10 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\ndelivering products in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and\nadversely affected.\nOur customers generally are not obligated to continue purchasing products from us\nMany of our customers buy from us under short-term, binding purchase orders. As a result, these customers are not committed\nto maintain or increase their sales volumes or orders for the products supplied by us. Decreases in our customers sales volumes\nor orders for products supplied by us may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. In addition, some customer buying decisions are based on a periodic bidding process. Our sales volume may\ndecrease if our offer is too high and rejected. Alternatively, we risk reducing our margins if our offer is successful but less than\nour desired price point. Either of these outcomes may adversely affect our results of operations.\nLoss of a key customer could materially reduce revenues and earnings\nOur relationships with our key customers are critical to the success of our business and our results of operations. For the year\nended December 30, 2023, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 80% of revenues from continuing operations.\nThe loss, decrease or cancellation of business with any of our large customers could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry\nWe operate businesses in the highly competitive food industry in North America. We compete with large U.S. and international\nfood ingredient and consumer-packaged food companies. These competitors may have financial resources larger than ours and\nmay be able to benefit from economies of scale, pricing advantages, long-standing customer relationships, and greater resources\nfor product innovation, and marketing and promotional activities. In addition, we may have to compete for limited supplies of\ncertain raw materials with competitors having greater resources and stronger supplier relationships than we have. If we are\nunable to effectively respond to these competitive factors or if the competition in any of our product markets results in price\nreductions or decreased demand for our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially\nand adversely affected.\nProduct innovations by our competitors could make our food products less competitive\nOur competitors include major food manufacturers and consumer-packaged food companies. Many of these companies are\nengaged in the development of food ingredients and packaged food products and frequently introduce new products into the\nmarket. If our competitors introduce products that are more appealing to the tastes and dietary habits of consumers or considered\nto be of higher quality or value than our products, our sales and market share could decline, which may have a material adverse\neffect on our profitability.\nConsumer food preferences are difficult to predict and may change\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to predict, identify, and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to\noffer products to our customers that appeal to those preferences on a timely and affordable basis. Consumer preferences and\ntrends change based on a number of factors, including product taste and nutrition, food allergies, sustainability values, and\nanimal welfare concerns. Our failure to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences on a timely basis could result\nin reduced demand and price decreases for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of our capital investment plans in the anticipated time frame or\nat all\nWe have recently completed the largest capital expansion in our companys history, which included the construction of our\nnew plant-based beverage facility in Midlothian, Texas. Our capital investment plans often require a substantial amount of\nmanagement, operational, and financial resources, which may divert our attention and resources from existing businesses,\npotentially disrupting our operations and adversely affecting our relationships with customers and suppliers. In addition, delays\nand unexpected costs in connection with the completion of capital expansion projects, or changes in demand and pricing for\nour products may occur that could result in us not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits of our capital investment plans\non our expected timetable or at all, and there can be no assurance that any benefits we realize from our capital investments will\nbe sufficient to offset the costs that we may incur.\nSUNOPTA INC. 11 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nOur operations are subject to the general risks associated with acquisitions and divestitures\nWe regularly review strategic opportunities to grow our business through acquisitions of complementary businesses or assets.\nAdditionally, we have made several significant divestitures in recent years that aligned with our strategic priority of optimizing\nour non-core, commodity-based businesses and focusing on value-add opportunities. Potential risks associated with these\ntransactions include the inability to consummate a transaction on favorable terms, the diversion of managements attention\nfrom other business concerns, the potential loss of key employees and customers of current or acquired companies, the inability\nto integrate or divest operations successfully, the possible assumptions of unknown liabilities, potential disputes with buyers\nor sellers, potential impairment charges, and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which the Company\nhas limited or no prior experience. Any or all of these risks could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations. In addition, acquisitions outside the U.S. or Canada may present unique challenges and\nincrease our exposure to the risks associated with foreign operations.\nIn October 2023, we completed the sale of certain assets and liabilities of Frozen Fruit to Natures Touch Mexico, S. de R.L. de\nC.V. and Natures Touch Frozen Fruits, LLC (the Purchasers) for an estimated aggregate purchase price of approximately\n$141 million. The estimated aggregate purchase price is subject to post-closing adjustments based on a determination of the\nfinal net working capital as of the closing date of the transaction on October 12, 2023. Our estimate of the final net working\ncapital allocation, which is recognized as part of the loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of\noperations for the year ended December 30, 2023, may be subject to change, which could be material, as the parties are currently\nin the process of reconciling the final aggregate purchase price, including the resolution of certain disputed items, in accordance\nwith the procedures set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement. A change in the aggregate purchase price could have a material\nimpact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, a portion of the aggregate purchase price was in the form of secured seller promissory notes due in three years and\nwith a stated principal amount of $20.0 million in the aggregate (the Seller Promissory Notes) that the Company entered into\nwith the Purchasers and Natures Touch Frozen Foods, LLC (collectively the Loan Parties). The Seller Promissory Notes are\nsecured by a second-priority lien on certain assets of Frozen Fruit acquired by the Purchasers. While we assessed the Seller\nPromissory Notes to be collectible as at December 30, 2023, a deterioration in the liquidity of the Loan Parties could impact\nthe collectability of the Seller Promissory Notes.\nImpairment charges related to long-lived assets or goodwill could adversely impact our financial condition and results of\noperations\nAs at December 30, 2023, we had $319.9 million of property, plant and equipment, $105.9 million of operating lease right-of-\nuse assets, and $21.9 million of intangible assets, as well as $4.0 million of goodwill. In addition, prior to fiscal 2019, we\nrecognized accumulated impairment losses of $213.8 million related to goodwill that arose from business acquisitions.\nWe perform impairment assessments for our long-lived assets annually, or at any time when events occur that could affect the\nvalue of these assets. If the results of such assessments were to show that the carrying value of our long-lived assets was not\nrecoverable and the fair value of these assets was less than the carrying value, we would be required to recognize a charge for\nimpairment, and the amount of the impairment charge could be material. Factors which could result in an impairment of a long-\nlived assets include, but are not limited to, reduced demand or pricing for our products due to increased competition, the loss\nof a significant customer or market share, or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset may be disposed\nof before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\nLikewise, we perform an annual impairment test for goodwill, or at any time when events occur that could indicate that more\nlikely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Indicators of goodwill impairment include, but are\nnot limited to, a decline in general economic conditions, an increased competitive environment in which a reporting unit\noperates, a negative trend in the financial performance and cash flows of the reporting unit, and a more-likely-than-not\nexpectation of selling or disposing of all, or a portion, of a reporting unit.\nFor the year ended December 30, 2023, on a continuing operations basis, we did not recognize any impairment charges related\nto our long-lived assets or goodwill. Within discontinued operations, we incurred a pre-tax loss on the sale of Frozen Fruit of\n$119.8 million, of which a significant portion was comprised of the carrying value of the long-lived assets of the business.\nFuture impairments of long-lived assets and/or goodwill could materially and adversely impact our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nSUNOPTA INC. 12 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nIf we lose the services of our key executives, our business could suffer\nOur prospects depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our key executives, and our continued growth depends\non our ability to identify, recruit, and retain key management personnel. We do not typically carry key person life insurance on\nour executive officers. If we lose the services of our key executives or fail to identify, recruit, and retain key management\npersonnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted.\nFailure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal\ncontrol over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for\nexternal purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent\nlimitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or\ndetect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over\nfinancial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and in a timely manner, or to detect and\nprevent fraud. A significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could\ncause a loss of investor confidence and/or a decline in the market price of our stock. In connection with the preparation of our\nconsolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we identified a material weakness in\nour internal control over financial reporting. This material weakness was remediated during the fiscal year ended December\n30, 2023. The identified material weakness and associated remediation efforts are further described in Part II, Item 9A of this\nForm 10-K. Even after any identified material weaknesses have been remediated, investors may lose confidence in our reported\nfinancial information and the market price of our common shares may decline.\nRisks Related to Litigation and Government Regulations\nProduct recalls and withdrawals and product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business\nWe sell products for human consumption, which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage, misbranding,\nproduct tampering, and other adulteration of food products. Consumption of a contaminated, spoiled, tampered, or adulterated\nproduct may result in personal illness or injury. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to recall or withdraw products,\nwhich may be costly and time consuming, and may require the diversion of managements time and resources from business\noperations. The costs of a recall or withdrawal may include product destruction costs, temporary plant closings, and compliance\nor remediation costs. In addition, a product recall or withdrawal may cause us to lose future revenues from, or relationships\nwith, one or more material customers, and the impact of the recall or withdrawal could affect our customers willingness to\ncontinue to purchase related or unrelated products from us or could otherwise hinder our ability to grow our business with those\ncustomers. Further, we could be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness or injury, and we could\nincur liabilities that are not insured or that exceed our insurance coverage. Even if product liability claims against us are not\nsuccessful or fully pursued, these claims could be costly and time consuming to defend against, and the negative publicity\nsurrounding any such claims could adversely affect our reputation. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect\non our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn the second quarter of 2023, we announced our subsidiary, Sunrise Growers Inc., had issued a voluntary recall of specific\nfrozen fruit products linked to pineapple provided by a third-party supplier due to possible contamination by Listeria\nmonocytogenes. To date, we have recognized losses of $7.3 million related to this recall, net of estimated insurance recoveries\nof $4.8 million. We may incur additional losses related to this recall that are unforeseen at this time and we may need to revise\nour insurance estimate as we work with our insurance providers to substantiate the losses incurred to date. In addition, in the\nthird quarter of 2023, we withdrew specific batches of aseptically-packaged product from a customer due to the discovery of a\nfaulty seal that was traced to an equipment misconfiguration by a third-party service provider. The equipment issue was\nidentified and resolved in the third quarter of 2023, and none of the withdrawn product made it into the consumer marketplace.\nWe have recognized losses of $3.4 million related to the withdrawal, net of expected recoveries from the service provider. Our\nrecovery estimate may need to be revised as we work with the service provider to substantiate our losses.\nPotential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business\nWe are, or may become, party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business, which may include\nlawsuits or claims relating to commercial contracts, product recalls, product liability, the marketing and labeling of products,\nemployment matters, environmental matters, data protection, intellectual property, and other aspects of our business. There is\nno guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in these actions and we could incur substantial costs and fees in\ndefending ourselves or in asserting our rights in these actions. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently\nSUNOPTA INC. 13 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nunpredictable and resolutions or dispositions of lawsuits and claims by settlement or otherwise could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nNew laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could adversely affect our business\nThe food industry is subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to,\nthose related to food safety, food labeling, and environmental matters. Governmental regulations also affect taxes and levies,\nhealthcare costs, energy usage, and labor issues, all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our business or those of\nour customers or suppliers. Changes in these laws or regulations, or the introduction of new laws or regulations, could increase\nthe costs of doing business for the Company, our customers, or suppliers, or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations\nto be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Information Technology\nWe rely on protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. We rely primarily on patent, copyright,\ntrademark, and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technologies. Our policy is to protect our technology by, among\nother things, filing patent applications for technology relating to the development of our business in the U.S. and in selected\nforeign jurisdictions. Our trademarks and brand names are registered in the U.S., Canada, and other jurisdictions. We intend to\nkeep these filings current and seek protection for new trademarks to the extent consistent with business needs. We also rely on\ntrade secrets and proprietary know-how and confidentiality agreements to protect certain of the technologies and processes that\nwe use. The failure of any patents, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights to provide protection to our\ntechnologies would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products, which could result in lower revenues and/or\nmargins and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic\ninformation. We rely on our information technology systems, including the internet, to effectively manage our business data,\nsupply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. Information technology systems are also integral to our\ninternal and external financial reporting. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communications between, and storage of\npersonal data of, our personnel, customers and suppliers depends on information technology. Our information technology\nsystems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, may be susceptible to physical or electronic break-\nin, damage, disruption, or shutdown due to computer viruses, hacker attacks, and other cybersecurity risks, hardware failures,\ntelecommunications failures, user errors or malfeasance, catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, or other factors which may\nbe beyond our control. Furthermore, the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may\nintensify our cybersecurity risks. If we are unable to anticipate, prevent, or adequately respond to and resolve these failures,\ndisruptions or breaches, our business may be materially disrupted, and we may suffer other adverse consequences such as\nsignificant data loss, financial or reputational damage or penalties, legal claims or proceedings, remediation costs, or loss of\nrevenues or customers. Consequently, any failure or breach of our information technology systems could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Weather, Climate Change, and Other External Factors\nAdverse weather conditions and natural disasters could impose costs on our business\nIngredients for our products are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, including windstorms,\nhurricanes, earthquakes, floods, droughts, fires, and temperature and precipitation extremes, some of which are recurring but\ndifficult to predict, as well as crop disease and infestation. Severe weather conditions may occur with higher frequency or may\nbe less predictable in the future due to the effects of climate change. Unfavorable growing and harvesting conditions could\nreduce both crop size and crop quality. In extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost in some geographic areas. Adverse weather\nconditions or natural disasters may adversely affect our supply of raw materials or prevent or impair our ability to ship products\nas planned. These factors may increase raw material acquisition and production costs, decrease our sales volumes and revenues,\nand lead to additional charges to earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nSUNOPTA INC. 14 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations\nLong-term climate change impacts on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather\nand natural disasters may negatively impact the price or availability of ingredients and packaging materials (such as corrugated\ncardboard) that are necessary for our products. We may also be subjected to decreased availability of and/or less favorable\npricing for water, which could adversely impact our manufacturing operations.\nThere is an increased focus by U.S. federal, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies, as well as foreign bodies, regarding\nenvironmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies, and sustainability.\nIncreased compliance costs and expenses due to the impacts of climate change and additional legal or regulatory requirements\nregarding climate change may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, the running of our manufacturing\nfacilities and our business, as well as increase distribution and supply chain costs. In addition, compliance with any such legal\nor regulatory requirements may require us to make significant changes in our business operations and strategy, which will\nlikely require us to devote substantial time and attention to these matters and cause us to incur additional costs. Even if we\nmake changes to align ourselves with such legal or regulatory requirements, we may still be subject to significant penalties or\npotential litigation if such laws and regulations are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices. The\neffects of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a long-term adverse impact\non our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we might fail to effectively address increased attention from customers, consumers, investors, activists and other\nstakeholders on climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. Such failure, or the perception that we have\nfailed to act responsibly regarding climate change, whether or not valid, could result in adverse publicity and negatively affect\nour business and reputation. In addition, customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase\nproducts from another company or a competitor, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\nFurthermore, we may from time to time establish and publicly announce goals and commitments to reduce our impact on the\nenvironment. Our ability to achieve any stated goal or commitment is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of\nwhich are outside of our control. Examples of such factors include evolving regulatory requirements affecting sustainability\nstandards or disclosures, the development of new environmental technologies to address climate change, and the availability\nof financing to support climate-related projects. In addition, we may determine that it is in the best interest of our company and\nour shareholders to prioritize other business investments over the achievement of our current environmental goals and\ncommitments based on economic conditions, changes in our business strategy, or pressure from investors or other stakeholders.\nIf we fail to achieve or are perceived to have failed or been delayed in achieving, or improperly report our progress toward\nachieving our goals and commitments, it could negatively affect customer and consumer preference for our products or investor\nconfidence in our business, as well as expose us to enforcement actions and litigation.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the availability of non-GMO and organic commodities and ingredients\nOur ability to ensure a continuing supply of non-GMO and organic ingredients at competitive prices depends on many factors\nbeyond our control, including the number and size of farms that grow non-GMO and organic crops. The non-GMO and organic\nraw materials that we use in the production of our products, including, among others grains, nuts, fruits, sweeteners, and\nflavorings, are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, water scarcity,\ntemperature extremes, frosts, earthquakes, and pestilences. Natural disasters and adverse weather conditions can reduce crop\nsize and crop quality, which in turn could reduce our supplies of and/or increase the price of non-GMO and organic raw\nmaterials. If our supplies of non-GMO and organic raw materials are reduced, we may not be able to find enough supplemental\nsupply sources on favorable terms, if at all, which could impact our ability to supply product to our customers and adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Liquidity\nIncreases in interest rates may negatively impact our cost of borrowing and access to capital financing\nTo address inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve implemented tighter monetary policies beginning in 2022, causing interest rates\nto rise significantly, which negatively impacted the cost of borrowing on our variable rate debt beginning in 2022. As at\nDecember 30, 2023, we had approximately $212 million of variable rate debt outstanding under our credit agreement. We\nexpect interest rates to remain at elevated levels in 2024, and we continue to be exposed to further changes in interest rates,\nwhich could have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSUNOPTA INC. 15 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations\nAs at December 30, 2023, we have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding as a result of the capital investments we\nhave made in recent years. The level of our indebtedness and the degree to which we are leveraged could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations, including, without limitation, increasing our exposure to interest rate\nfluctuations and impairing our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service\nrequirements, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes. In addition, we may have to use a substantial portion of our\ncash flow to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, which may reduce the funds available to us for other purposes. If\nwe do not generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt service obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing\nplans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, or seeking to raise\nadditional capital. A high level of indebtedness and leverage could also make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and\nadverse industry conditions and may compromise our ability to capitalize on business opportunities, and to react to competitive\npressures as compared to our competitors.\nOur debt and equity agreements restrict how we may operate our business, and our business may be materially and adversely\naffected if these restrictions prevent us from implementing our business plan\nThe agreements governing our debt and preferred equity instruments contain restrictive covenants that limit the discretion of\nour management with respect to certain business matters. These covenants place restrictions on, among other things, our ability\nto obtain additional debt financing or preferred equity, to create other liens, to complete a merger, amalgamation, or\nconsolidation, to make certain distributions or make certain payments, investments and guarantees and to sell or otherwise\ndispose of certain assets. These restrictions may hinder our ability to execute on our growth strategy or prevent us from\nimplementing parts of our business plan.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to meet the financial covenants of our credit\nagreement\nOur credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated total net\nleverage ratio. Our ability to comply with the financial covenants under the credit agreement will depend on the success of our\nbusinesses, our operating results, and our ability to achieve our financial forecasts. Various risks, uncertainties and events\nbeyond our control could affect our ability to comply with the financial covenants and terms of the credit agreement. Failure\nto comply with the financial covenants and other terms could result in an event of default and the acceleration of amounts\nowing under the credit agreement unless we are able to negotiate a waiver. The lenders could condition any such waiver on an\namendment to the credit agreement on terms, including, but not limited to, the payment of consent fees, which may be\nunfavorable to us. If we fail to comply with the financial covenants and we are unable to negotiate a covenant waiver or replace\nor refinance the credit agreement on favorable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\nmaterially and adversely impacted.\nWe may require additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all\nOur working capital requirements, capital investment plans, and our ability to acquire complementary businesses or assets often\nrequire significant financial resources. Our ability to raise capital, through debt or equity financing, is directly related to our\nability to both continue to grow our revenues and improve the profitability of our operations. Debt or equity financing may not\nbe available to us on favorable terms or at all. In addition, any potential debt financing could adversely affect our financial\ncondition and increase our exposure to interest rate changes, while any potential equity financing would dilute our current\nshareholders and may result in a decrease in our share price if we are unable to realize adequate returns.\nOur ability to maintain current levels of working capital may be adversely affected if we are unable to utilize supply chain\nfinancing (SCF) programs to accelerate payment terms for certain customers\nTo improve working capital efficiency, we utilize SCF programs offered by some of our major customers that allow us to\nmonetize our receivables from those customers earlier than our payment terms would provide. To the extent that these various\nSCF programs were terminated, our financial condition, cash flows, and liquidity could be adversely affected by higher working\ncapital levels due to delays in collecting accounts receivables. If working capital is negatively impacted by the termination of\nthese programs, and we are unable to secure alternative financing sources, we may have to increase our debt borrowings, along\nwith the associated interest expense.\nSUNOPTA INC. 16 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nRisks Related to Significant Investors and Shareholder Activism\nOur significant investor may have interests that conflict with those of our debtholders and other stakeholders\nAs at December 30, 2023, Oaktree Capital Management L.P., a private equity investor (together with its affiliates, Oaktree)\nheld an approximately 20% voting interest in the Company and has nominated two members of our Board of Directors. The\ninterests of Oaktree may differ from the interests of our other stakeholders in material respects. For example, Oaktree may have\nan interest in directly or indirectly pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings, or other transactions that, in their judgment,\ncould enhance their other equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to us, including risks to our\nliquidity and financial condition. Oaktree is in the business of making or advising on investments in companies, including\nbusinesses that may directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business. Oaktree may also pursue acquisition\nopportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available\nto us.\nOur other large investors do not have specific rights beyond those of smaller holders of our common shares. However, a\nconcentration of ownership within our large investors could potentially be disadvantageous to, or conflict with, interests of our\ndebtholders or smaller shareholders. In addition, if any significant shareholder were to sell or otherwise transfer all or a large\npercentage of its holdings, we could find it difficult to raise capital, if needed, through the sale of additional equity securities.\nOur business could be negatively impacted as a result of shareholder activism or an unsolicited takeover proposal or a proxy\ncontest\nIn recent years, proxy contests and other forms of shareholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies.\nIf a proxy contest or an unsolicited takeover proposal is made with respect to us, we could incur significant costs in defending\nthe Company, which would have an adverse effect on our financial results. Shareholder activists may also seek to involve\nthemselves in the governance, strategic direction, and operations of the Company. Such proposals may disrupt our business\nand divert the attention of our management and employees, and any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting\nfrom such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, be exploited by our competitors, cause concern\nto our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners,\nall of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, actions of activist shareholders may cause significant fluctuations\nin our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the\nunderlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Shares\nOur share price is subject to significant volatility\nOur share price may be highly volatile compared to larger public companies, which increases the chance of larger than normal\nprice swings that could reduce predictability in the price of our common shares and impair investment decisions. In addition,\nprice and volume trading volatility in the stock markets can have a substantial effect on our share price, frequently for reasons\nother than our operating performance. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common\nshares.\nPeriods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a companys securities is often followed by securities class\naction litigation alleging material misstatements or omissions in disclosures provided to shareholders. Such litigation, if\ninstituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources.\nOur debt instruments restrict, and our future debt instruments may restrict, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders,\nand we do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future; therefore, our\nshareholders may not be able to receive a return on their common shares until their shares are sold\nWe have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common shares, and we do not currently anticipate paying any cash\ndividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future. Any future payment of dividends will be dependent on factors such\nas covenant restrictions, cash on hand, or achieving and maintaining profitability, the financial requirements to fund growth,\nour general financial condition, and other factors we may consider appropriate in the circumstances. Until we pay dividends,\nwhich we may never do, our shareholders will not receive a return on their common shares until their shares are sold, and any\nreturn will depend on the ability to sell their shares at a price higher than they paid to acquire them.\nSUNOPTA INC. 17 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nThe future issuance of additional common shares in connection with the exchange of convertible preferred stock, vesting\nof equity-based awards, participation in our employee stock purchase plan and issuance of additional securities could dilute\nthe value of our common shares\nWe have unlimited common shares authorized but unissued. Our articles of amalgamation authorize us to issue these common\nshares, and we may also issue options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to common shares for consideration and\non terms and conditions established by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion.\nThe exchange of outstanding convertible preferred stock, vesting of equity-based awards, participation in our employee stock\npurchase plan, and issuance of additional securities in connection with acquisitions or otherwise could result in dilution in the\nvalue of our common shares and the voting power represented thereby. Furthermore, to the extent common shares are issued\npursuant to the exchange of outstanding convertible preferred stock, vesting of equity-based awards, participation in our\nemployee stock purchase plan, and issuance of additional securities, our share price may decrease due to the additional amount\nof common shares available in the market. The subsequent sales of these shares could encourage short sales by our shareholders\nand others, which could place further downward pressure on our share price.\nIf securities or industry research analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about our business or if\nthey issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common shares, our share price and trading volume could decline\nThe trading market for our common shares relies in part on the research and reports that securities and industry research analysts\npublish about us, our industry, our competitors and our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. Our share\nprice and trading volumes could decline if one or more securities or industry analysts downgrade our common shares, issue\nunfavorable commentary about us, our industry or our business, cease to cover our Company or fail to regularly publish reports\nabout us, our industry, or our business.\nA portion of our assets and certain of our directors are located outside of the U.S.; it may be difficult to effect service of\nprocess and enforce legal judgments upon us and certain of our directors\nA portion of our assets and certain of our directors are located outside of the U.S. As a result, it may be difficult to effect service\nof process within the U.S. and enforce judgment of a U.S. court obtained against us and certain of our directors. Particularly,\nour stakeholders may not be able to:\neffect service of process within the U.S. on us or certain of our directors;\nenforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against us or certain of directors based upon the civil liability provisions of\nthe U.S. federal securities laws;\nenforce, in a court outside of the U.S., judgments of U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S.\nfederal securities laws; or\nbring an original action in a court outside of the U.S. to enforce liabilities against us or any of our executive officers\nand directors based upon the U.S. federal securities laws.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nOur cybersecurity program is strategically crafted to achieve the paramount goals of identifying, protecting, detecting, and\nresponding to all potential risks and threats. Employing a defense-in-depth strategy, we proactively identify, investigate, and\nresolve vulnerabilities and security incidents in a timely manner.\nContinuous improvement is integral to our cybersecurity approach. Regular assessments, conducted with the expertise of\nexternal security firms against international standards, allow us to quantify our programs effectiveness. The insights gained\nfrom these assessments serve as a foundation for continuous improvement efforts. Outcomes are reported to our Audit\nCommittee for transparency and accountability. We rely on services from a variety of third-party providers to supply things\nsuch as cloud storage and networks. On an annual basis, we review these providers to assess their risk profiles. We rely on\nSUNOPTA INC. 18 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nthese third parties to have their own cybersecurity programs commensurate with their risk, and we cannot ensure in all\ncircumstances that their efforts will be successful.\nDespite facing directed attacks, our systems have withstood such challenges without material interruptions to our business\noperations. Recognizing the potential impact of significant disruptions, we remain steadfast in our commitment to fortify our\nsystems against evolving threats. Any significant disruption to our ability to transact business could adversely affect our\nbusiness performance as well as our reputation. Refer to Item 1A Risk Factors  Our business operations could be disrupted\nif our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached.\nHeading our cybersecurity program is our Chief Information Officer (CIO). Our CIO has over 30 years of experience in\nSoftware Engineering and Information Technology/Cybersecurity and is supported by skilled professionals from our\nInformation Technology team. This seasoned team provides regular updates to our Enterprise Risk Management Steering\nCommittee (the ERM), composed of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, and\nother members of our senior leadership. Our Audit Committee and Board of Directors receive regular reports from the ERM,\nas well as directly from our CIO on a quarterly basis. These reports cover various cybersecurity matters, including risk\nassessments, mitigation strategies, areas of emerging risks, incidents and industry trends, and other areas of importance.\nFurthermore, our Board of Directors takes a proactive stance in overseeing our annual enterprise risk assessment.

Our consumer product portfolio includes plant-based beverages and creamers, protein shakes, teas,\nand broths packaged in shelf-stable formats, together with fruit snacks and smoothie bowls, which are sold through retail and\nfoodservice channels. We also produce liquid and dry ingredients for internal use and for sale to other food and beverage\nmanufacturers.\nOn February 23, 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell the assets related to our smoothie bowl product line, which is\nexpected to close on March 4, 2024.\nFiscal Year\nWe operate on a fiscal calendar that results in a given fiscal year consisting of a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday\nclosest to December 31. Fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 were each 52-week periods ending on December 30, 2023, December\n31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively.\nSUNOPTA INC. 21 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nRecent Developments\nDivestiture of Frozen Fruit\nOn October 12, 2023, we completed the sale of certain assets and liabilities of our frozen fruit business (Frozen Fruit) for an\naggregate purchase price of approximately $141 million, subject to closing working capital adjustments. This transaction\nrepresents our exit from the processing, packaging and selling of individually quick frozen fruit for retail, foodservice and\nindustrial applications. The divestiture of Frozen Fruit completes our strategic optimization plan for our non-core, commodity-\nbased businesses, which included the divestiture of our sunflower business (Sunflower) in October 2022, in order to focus\non value-add products in plant-based and healthy snack categories. Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, Frozen Fruit and\nSunflower met the criteria for reporting as discontinued operations. As a result, the information in this MD&A is presented on\na continuing operations basis, with all periods presented recast to reflect the reporting of Frozen Fruit and Sunflower as\ndiscontinued operations. For further information regarding the divestiture of Frozen Fruit and discontinued operations, see note\n2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nSegment Change\nIn connection with the divestiture of Frozen Fruit and the management changes described below, we changed our internal\norganization and reporting structures beginning in the third quarter of 2023 and began operating as one segment. As a result,\nthe information in this MD&A is presented on a consolidated basis for all periods presented. For further information regarding\nthe change in our segment structure, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nManagement Changes\nEffective October 9, 2023 and October 13, 2023, respectively, Michael Buick, Senior Vice President and General Manager of\nPlant-Based Foods and Beverages and Scott Huckins, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and General Manager of Fruit-Based\nFoods and Beverages left the Company. With their departures, we eliminated the position of General Manager and adopted a\ncentralized functional structure reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Effective October 13, 2023, Greg\nGaba, our former Vice President Corporate Finance and Deputy CFO, was appointed CFO of the Company.\nEffective January 2, 2024, Brian Kocher was appointed CEO of the Company in connection with the retirement of our former\nCEO, Joseph Ennen.\nNew Credit Agreement\nAs described below under the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources, on December 8, 2023, we entered into a new credit\nagreement providing for a new $180 million term loan credit facility and a new $85 million revolving credit facility (the New\nCredit Agreement). The New Credit Agreement has a term of five years and replaces our former asset-based credit facilities.\nGlobal Economic Conditions and Inflationary Cost Environment\nOur businesses continue to be exposed to the effects of the current global macroeconomic environment, including elevated\ninflation, higher interest rates, and shifts in consumer demand.\nInflation  Inflation in 2023 declined from the highs in 2022 but remained elevated. We expect this inflationary\nenvironment to continue throughout 2024. We believe that we will be able to continue to mitigate the impact of\ninflationary cost increases for raw materials, packaging, labor, energy, fuel, and transportation through pricing actions\nwe took with our customers in 2022 that mostly remained in effect in 2023, and further pricing actions that we may\nimplement as needed. However, the effect of our customers passing on higher prices to end consumers has impacted\nand may continue to impact the level of consumption of our products. As a result, we continue to identify opportunities\nto improve our own operational efficiencies and achieve cost savings in order to offset inflationary impacts and\nmaintain our profit margins.\nInterest Rates  Loans under our credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate, and the interest rate on our\noutstanding indebtedness has increased as market interest rates have risen, starting in the second half of 2022. These\nhigher interest rates have led to an increase in our interest expense in 2023, which we expect will continue in 2024.\nConsumer Demand  Current economic conditions have reduced household savings and resulted in changes in\nconsumer spending patterns, with a shift to lower-cost retailers and product alternatives, together with a streamlining\nSUNOPTA INC. 22 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nof purchases. As a result, some of the categories we serve have experienced a softening of demand, which negatively\nimpacted our sales volumes and mix in 2023. These consumption trends may continue to have an impact on our\nbusiness.\nFiscal 2024 Outlook\nFor fiscal 2024, we are projecting higher revenues driven by organic volume growth from our beverages and snacks categories,\npartially offset by the impact of our planned exit from smoothie bowls. We anticipate an improved gross margin profile on a\nreported basis, reflecting higher production volumes and plant utilization to support sales, together with lower start-up costs\nand improved operating efficiencies at our Midlothian, Texas, facility. The resulting increase in gross profit, together with\nstable SG&A spending as a percentage of revenue, is expected to drive operating income growth and improved cash flows.\nConsolidated Results of Operations for Fiscal Years 2023 and 2022\nDecember 30, December 31,\n2023 2022 Change Change\nFor the year ended $ $ $ %\nRevenues 630,297 591,395 38,902 6.6%\nCost of goods sold 541,680 491,665 50,015 10.2%\nGross profit 88,617 99,730 (11,113) -11.1%\nGross margin(1) 14.1% 16.9% -2.8%\nOperating expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 78,000 78,469 (469) -0.6%\nIntangible asset amortization 1,784 1,784 - 0.0%\nOther expense, net 455 1,651 (1,196) -72.4%\nForeign exchange loss (gain) 110 (107) 217 *\nTotal operating expenses 80,349 81,797 (1,448) -1.8%\nOperating income 8,268 17,933 (9,665) -53.9%\nInterest expense, net 26,909 13,156 13,753 104.5%\nEarnings (loss) from continuing operations before income (18,641) 4,777 (23,418) *\nIncome tax expense 3,269 896 2,373 264.8%\nEarnings (loss) from continuing operations (21,910) 3,881 (25,791) *\nLoss from discontinued operations (153,108) (8,722) (144,386) -1655.4%\nNet loss(2),(3) (175,018) (4,841) (170,177) -3515.3%\nDividends and accretion on preferred stock (1,981) (3,109) 1,128 36.3%\nLoss attributable to common shareholders(4) (176,999) (7,950) (169,049) -2126.4%\n* Percentage not meaningful due to figures being positive and negative.\n(1) Gross margin is a measure of gross profit (equal to revenues less cost of goods sold) as a percentage of revenues. We use\na measure of adjusted gross margin that excludes non-capitalizable start-up costs included in cost of goods sold that are\nincurred in connection with capital expansion projects. In recent years, we have undergone the largest capital expansion in\nour companys history, including the construction of our new plant-based beverage facility in Midlothian, Texas. As a\nresult, start-up costs have had a significant impact on the comparability of reported gross margins in 2023 and 2022, which\nmay obscure trends in our margin performance. Additionally, our measure of adjusted gross margin may exclude other\nunusual items that are identified and evaluated on an individual basis, which due to their nature or size, we would not\nexpect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.\nWe use the measure of adjusted gross margin to evaluate the underlying profitability of our revenue-generating activities\nwithin each reporting period. We believe that disclosing this non-GAAP measure provides investors with a meaningful,\nconsistent comparison of our profitability measure for the periods presented. However, the non-GAAP measure of adjusted\ngross margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for gross margin calculated based on gross profit\nSUNOPTA INC. 23 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\ndetermined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin from\nreported gross margin calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nDecember 30, December 31,\nFor the year ended 2023 2022\nReported gross margin 14.1% 16.9%\nStart-up costs(a) 3.0% 1.0%\nProduct withdrawal costs(b) 0.5% -\nAdjusted gross margin 17.6% 17.8%\nNote: percentages may not add due to rounding.\n(a) Represents incremental direct costs incurred in connection with plant expansion projects and new product\nintroductions before the project or product reaches normal production levels, including costs for the hiring and training\nof additional personnel, fees for outside services, travel costs, and plant- and production-related expenses. For 2023,\nstart-up costs included in cost of goods sold related to the ramp-up of production at our new plant-based beverage\nfacility in Midlothian, Texas, and the start-up of new extrusion and high-speed packaging lines at our fruit snacks\nfacility in Omak, Washington. For 2022, start-up costs included in cost of goods sold related to the hiring and training\nof new employees for the Midlothian facility, together with the integration of the acquired Dream and West Life\nbrands.\n(b) Reflects costs, net of expected recoveries, related to the withdrawal of specific batches of aseptically-packaged product\ndue to a faulty seal caused by an equipment misconfiguration by a third-party service provider. The equipment issue\nwas identified and resolved in the third quarter of 2023, and none of the withdrawn product made it into the consumer\nmarketplace.\n(2) When assessing our financial performance, we use an internal measure of adjusted earnings/loss that excludes specific\nitems recognized in other income or expense, and other unusual items that are identified and evaluated on an individual\nbasis, which due to their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. We\nbelieve that the identification of these excluded items enhances the analysis of the financial performance of our business\nwhen comparing those operating results between periods, as we do not consider these items to be reflective of normal\nbusiness operations. The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted earnings (loss) from net earnings (loss),\nwhich we consider to be the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.

For 2022, start-up costs mainly related to the\nhiring and training of new employees for the Midlothian facility, and the integration of the Dream and West Life\nbrands, which are recorded in cost of goods sold ($5.7 million) and SG&A expenses ($0.3 million).\nSUNOPTA INC. 25 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\n(c) For 2023, reflects inventory reserves recognized in connection with the divestiture of Frozen Fruit, which are recorded\nin loss from discontinued operations.\n(d) For 2023, reflects asset impairment charges and contract cancellation costs related to the exit from our Oxnard,\nCalifornia, frozen fruit processing facility in connection with the divestiture of Frozen Fruit, which are recorded in\nloss from discontinued operations.\n(e) For 2023, reflects costs, net of expected recoveries, of $3.4 million related to the withdrawal of specific batches of\naseptically-packaged product due to a faulty seal caused by an equipment misconfiguration by a third-party service\nprovider, which are recorded in cost of goods sold, as well as the self-insured retention amount of $2.5 million under\nour insurance policies related to the recall of specific frozen fruit products initiated in the second quarter of 2023,\nwhich is recorded in loss from discontinued operations.\n(f) Represents third-party costs associated with business development activities, which are inclusive of costs related to\nthe evaluation, execution, and integration of external acquisitions and divestitures, internal expansion projects, and\nother strategic initiatives. For 2023, business development costs related to the divestiture of Frozen Fruit, and, for\n2022, these costs related to the divestitures of Frozen Fruit and Sunflower, together with our inaugural Investor Day\nheld in June 2022.

However, adjusted earnings (loss) is not, and should not be viewed as, a\nsubstitute for net earnings (loss) prepared under U.S. GAAP. Adjusted earnings (loss) is presented solely to allow investors\nto more fully understand how we assess our financial performance.\n(3) We use a measure of adjusted EBITDA when assessing the performance of our operations, which we believe is useful to\ninvestors understanding of our operating profitability because it excludes non-operating expenses, such as interest and\nincome taxes, and non-cash expenses, such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, as well as other\nunusual items that affect the comparability of operating performance. We also use this measure to assess operating\nperformance in connection with our employee incentive programs. We define adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss)\nbefore interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, and excluding other unusual\nitems as identified in the determination of adjusted earnings (loss) (refer above to footnote (2)). The following table\npresents a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA from net earnings (loss), which we consider to be the most directly\ncomparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. In addition, as described above in footnote (2), we have prepared this table in\nSUNOPTA INC. 26 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\ncolumnar format to present the effects of discontinued operations on our consolidated results for the periods presented.

Some of these limitations are:\nadjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest\npayments on our indebtedness;\nadjusted EBITDA does not include the payment or recovery of income taxes, which is a necessary element of our\noperations;\nSUNOPTA INC. 27 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nalthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will\noften have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such\nreplacements; and\nadjusted EBITDA does not include non-cash stock-based compensation, which is an important component of our\ntotal compensation program for employees and directors.\nBecause of these limitations, adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to\nus to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by not viewing adjusted EBITDA\nin isolation, and specifically by using other U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP measures, such as revenues, gross profit, operating\nincome, net earnings/loss, and adjusted earnings/loss to measure our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not a\nmeasurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to our results of\noperations or cash flows from operations determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our calculation of adjusted\nEBITDA may not be comparable to the calculation of a similarly titled measure reported by other companies.\n(4) In order to evaluate our results of operations, we use certain non-GAAP measures that we believe enhance an investors\nability to derive meaningful period-over-period comparisons and trends from our results of operations. For example, as\ndescribed above under footnote (1), we evaluate our adjusted gross margins on a basis that excludes the impact of start-up\ncosts and other unusual items. In addition, we exclude specific items from our reported results that due to their nature or\nsize, we do not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. These items are identified above under\nfootnote (2), and in the discussion of our results of operations below. These non-GAAP measures are presented solely to\nallow investors to more fully assess our results of operations and should not be considered in isolation of, or as substitutes\nfor an analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.\nRevenues for the year ended December 30, 2023 increased by 6.6% to $630.3 million from $591.4 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The change in revenues from 2022 to 2023 was due to the following:\n$ %\n2022 revenues 591,395\nPrice 17,841 3.0%\nVolume/Mix 21,061 3.6%\n2023 revenues 630,297 6.6%\nFor the year ended December 30, 2023, the 6.6% increase in revenues reflected a 3.6% increase in pricing mainly reflecting\nthe wrap-around benefit of pricing actions taken with customers in 2022 to offset inflationary cost increases, together with a\nfavorable volume/mix impact of 3.0%. The favorable volume/mix impact reflected sales volume growth for plant-based milks\nand creamers (oat, coconut and soy flavors), 330-milliliter protein shakes, and teas, together with higher sales volumes for fruit\nsnacks and smoothie bowls. These factors were partially offset by lower external ingredient sales due to a customer transferring\npart of its business to a second-source supplier and increased internal demand for oat base, together with softer demand for\nalmond and rice milks, and lower broth volumes.\nGross profit decreased $11.1 million, or 11.1%, to $88.6 million for the year ended December 30, 2023, compared with $99.7\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022. Gross margin for the year ended December 30, 2023 was 14.1% compared to\n16.9% for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of 280 basis points.\nFor the year ended December 30, 2023, we incurred start-up costs included in cost of goods sold of $18.7 million (3.0% gross\nmargin impact) related to our new plant in Midlothian, Texas, and new extrusion and high-speed packaging lines at our fruit\nsnacks facility in Omak, Washington, compared with $5.8 million (1.0% gross margin impact) of start-up costs incurred in\n2022. Additionally, in 2023, we incurred incremental costs, net of expected recoveries, of $3.4 million (0.5% gross margin\nimpact) related to the withdrawal of specific batches of aseptically-packaged product due to a faulty seal caused by an\nequipment misconfiguration by a third-party service provider. Excluding the impact of these costs, adjusted gross margin for\nthe year ended December 30, 2023 was 17.6% compared to 17.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of 20\nbasis points. See footnote (1) to the Consolidated Results of Operations for Fiscal Years 2023 and 2022 table for a\nreconciliation of adjusted gross margin from gross margin calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe 20-basis point decrease in adjusted gross margin reflected the impact of incremental depreciation of new production\nequipment for capital expansion projects ($8.5 million or 1.3% gross margin impact) and higher manufacturing costs, largely\noffset by the wrap-around benefit of pricing actions taken in 2022 to recover input cost inflation, together with a favorable mix\nSUNOPTA INC. 28 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nshift in our ingredient operations, with increased internal use of oat base to support our beverage business and lower external\nsales.\nOperating income decreased $9.6 million to $8.3 million for the year ended December 30, 2023, compared with $17.9 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in operating income reflected lower gross profit, as described above,\ntogether with higher business development and employee severance costs in connection with the divestiture of Frozen Fruit\nand related consolidation of our continuing operations, partially offset by lower employee incentive compensation accruals and\nvariable stock-based compensation expense based on performance.\n(Further details on the changes in revenue, gross profit and operating income are provided in the rollforward tables below.)\nNet interest expense increased by $13.7 million to $26.9 million for the year ended December 30, 2023, compared with $13.2\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022, resulting from an increase in average outstanding debt to finance capital\nexpansion projects, together with the impact of higher interest rates. Additionally, interest expense, net, includes a loss on the\nextinguishment of debt of $1.6 million recognized in connection with the refinancing of our credit agreement in December\n2023. Interest expense capitalized as part of the construction cost of property, plant and equipment was $0.3 million and $1.2\nmillion in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 30, 2023, we recognized income tax expense of $3.3 million on a pre-tax loss of $18.6 million,\nreflecting the recognition of a full valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2023, based on\nour assessment that the related tax benefits were no longer more likely than not to be realized in the future. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, we recognized income tax expense of $0.9 million on pre-tax earnings of $4.8 million.\nLoss from continuing operations for the year ended December 30, 2023 was $21.9 million, compared with earnings of $3.9\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022. Diluted loss per share from continuing operations attributable to common\nshareholders (after dividends and accretion on preferred stock) was $0.21 for the year ended December 30, 2023, compared\nwith a diluted earnings per share of $0.01 for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nWe recognized a loss from discontinued operations of $153.1 million (diluted loss per share of $1.34) for the year ended\nDecember 30, 2023, compared with a loss of $8.7 million (diluted loss per share of $0.08) for the year ended December 31,\n2022. The loss from discontinued operations reflected a pre-tax loss on the divestiture of Frozen Fruit of $119.8 million in\n2023, compared with a pre-tax loss on the divestiture of Sunflower of $23.2 million in 2022, together with an $8.2 million loss\nrecognized in 2022 on the settlement of the purchase price allocation related to the 2020 divestiture of our global ingredients\nbusiness, Tradin Organic. Before the losses on divestitures, the loss from discontinued operations was $33.5 million in 2023,\ncompared with earnings of $6.6 million in 2022, which mainly reflected a year-over-year decrease in the gross profit of Frozen\nFruit prior to the divestiture due to lower sales and production volumes as a result of softer retail consumption trends and lost\nfoodservice distribution. Additionally, in connection with the divestiture we recognized frozen fruit inventory reserves of $12.8\nmillion and exit costs of $10.0 million related to the former Oxnard, California, facility of Frozen Fruit.\nWe realized a loss attributable to common shareholders of $177.0 million (diluted loss per share of $1.55) for the year ended\nDecember 30, 2023, compared with a loss attributable to common shareholders of $8.0 million (diluted loss per share of $0.07)\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022. Loss attributable to common shareholders included dividends and accretion on our\nSeries B-1 preferred stock of $2.0 million and $3.1 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOn a consolidated basis, adjusted earnings for the year ended December 30, 2023 was $3.4 million, or $0.03 earnings per\ndiluted share, compared with adjusted earnings of $9.0 million, or $0.08 earnings per diluted share, for the year ended December\n31, 2022. For the year ended December 30, 2023, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $9.1 million, or $0.08\nearnings per diluted share, compared with adjusted earnings of $7.3 million, or $0.07 earnings per diluted share, for the year\nended December 31, 2022.\nOn a consolidated basis, adjusted EBITDA was $82.1 million for the year ended December 30, 2023, compared with $83.7\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased $14.8 million, or\n23.4%, to $78.5 million for the year ended December 30, 2023, compared with $63.7 million for the year ended December 31,\n2022.\nAdjusted earnings (loss) and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. See footnotes (2) and (3) to the\nConsolidated Results of Operations for Fiscal Years 2023 and 2022 table for a reconciliation of adjusted earnings (loss) and\nadjusted EBITDA from net earnings

The change in revenues from 2021 to 2022 was due to the following:\n$ %\n2021 revenues 496,455\nPrice 52,403 10.6%\nVolume/Mix 64,855 13.1%\nAcquisition of Dream and West Life brands 3,735 0.8%\nRationalization of fruit-based ingredients (26,053) -5.2%\n2022 revenues 591,395 19.1%\nNote: percentages may not add due to rounding.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the 19.1% increase in revenues reflected a 10.6% increase in pricing, a favorable\nvolume/mix impact of 13.1%, and 0.8% of incremental revenue in the first quarter of 2022 related to the acquisition of the\nDream and West Life brands in April 2021, partially offset by the impact of the rationalization of lower-margin fruit-based\ningredients in July 2021. The increase in pricing was driven by pricing actions taken with customers to offset inflationary cost\nincreases, while volume/mix was favorable mainly due to growth from our oat-based product offerings, almond beverages, and\nteas, together with strong demand for fruit snacks and the introduction of smoothie bowls, partially offset by lower broth\ndemand.\nGross profit increased $18.6 million, or 22.9%, to $99.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with $81.1\nmillion for the year ended January 1, 2022. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 16.9% compared to 16.3%\nfor the year ended January 1, 2022, an increase of 60 basis points.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred start-up costs included in cost of goods sold of $5.8 million (1.0% gross\nmargin impact) mainly related to our new plant in Midlothian, Texas, and integration of the acquired Dream and West Life\nbrands, compared with $0.7 million (0.1% gross margin impact) of start-up costs incurred for the year ended January 1, 2022.\nExcluding the impact of these costs, adjusted gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 17.8% compared to\n16.5% for the year ended January 1, 2022, an increase of 130 basis points. See footnote (1) to the Consolidated Results of\nOperations for Fiscal Years 2022 and 2021 table for a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin from gross margin calculated in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe 130-basis point increase in adjusted gross margin reflected the benefit of the rationalization of fruit-based ingredients\nbeginning in the second half of 2021, including the closure of our fruit ingredient processing facility, together with higher\nproduction volumes and plant utilization within our plant-based beverage and fruit snack operations. These factors were\npartially offset by the dilutive effect of pass-through pricing to recover cost inflation on raw materials and packaging, together\nwith the impacts of higher labor and utility costs, increased inventory reserves, and higher depreciation expense.\nOperating income increased $9.7 million to $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with $8.2 million\nfor the year ended January 1, 2022. The increase in operating income reflected higher gross profit, as described above, together\nwith lower facility closure and employee severance costs related to the exit from our former fruit ingredient processing facility\nin 2021. These factors were partially offset by higher employee compensation costs, including incremental 2022 incentive plan\naccruals based on performance, and a one-time bonus of $1.6 million recognized in the first quarter of 2022 to reward employees\nfor improved performance, partially offset by lower business development costs.\n(Further details on the changes in revenue, gross profit and operating income are provided in the rollforward tables below.)\nNet interest expense increased by $5.6 million to $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with $7.6\nmillion for the year ended January 1, 2022, reflecting an increase in outstanding debt to finance capital expansion projects and\nfund working capital requirements, together with the impact of higher interest rates. Interest expense capitalized as part of the\nconstruction cost of property, plant and equipment was $1.2 million in 2022 and immaterial 2021.\nWe recognized income tax expense of $0.9 million on pre-tax earnings from continuing operations of $4.8 million for the year\nended December 31, 2022, compared with an income tax benefit of $4.9 million on pre-tax earnings from continuing operations\nof $0.7 million for the year ended January 1, 2022, which reflected the recognition of excess tax benefits on the vesting of\nstock-based awards.\nSUNOPTA INC. 35 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nEarnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $3.9 million, compared with $5.5 million for\nthe year ended January 1, 2022. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders\n(after dividends and accretion on preferred stock) were $0.01 for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and January 1,\n2022.\nWe recognized a loss from discontinued operations of $8.7 million (diluted loss per share of $0.08) for the year ended December\n31, 2022, compared with a loss of $6.7 million (diluted loss per share of $0.06) for the year ended January 1, 2022. The loss\nfrom discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 included a pre-tax loss on the divestiture of Sunflower of\n$23.2 million, together with an $8.2 million loss on the settlement of the purchase price allocation related to the 2020 divestiture\nof our global ingredients business, Tradin Organic. Before the losses on divestitures, earnings from discontinued operations\nwere $6.6 million in 2022, compared with a loss of $8.3 million in 2021, which reflected an improved margin profile for Frozen\nFruit in 2022 from portfolio rationalizations, a reduced manufacturing cost base, and higher pricing for retail customers.\nWe realized a loss attributable to common shareholders of $8.0 million (diluted loss per share of $0.07) for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, compared with a loss attributable to common shareholders of $5.4 million (diluted loss per share of $0.05)\nfor the year ended January 1, 2022. The loss attributable to common shareholders included dividends and accretion on preferred\nstock of $3.1 million and $4.2 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decline in preferred stock dividends and accretion\nreflected the exchange of all of the shares of Series A preferred stock for shares of our common stock in February 2021.\nOutstanding preferred stock since February 2021 consists entirely of our Series B-1 preferred stock.\nOn a consolidated basis, adjusted earnings for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $9.0 million, or $0.08 earnings per\ndiluted share, compared with adjusted earnings of $4.5 million, or $0.04 earnings per diluted share, for the year ended January\n1, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $7.3 million, or $0.07\nearnings per diluted share, compared with adjusted earnings of $9.9 million, or $0.09 earnings per diluted share, for the year\nended January 1, 2022.\nOn a consolidated basis, adjusted EBITDA increased $23.1 million, or 38.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $83.7\nmillion, compared with $60.6 million for the year ended January 1, 2022.

The divestiture of the commodity-based frozen fruit business also serves to significantly\nreduce our working capital needs, particularly in the first half of each fiscal year due to crop inventory builds. As a result, on\nDecember 8, 2023, we refinanced and extended our credit facilities with our existing syndicate of lenders to provide a structure\nthat aligns with our more capital efficient value-add business model and the significant capital investments we have made in\nrecent years.\nThe New Credit Agreement provides for a $180.0 million term loan credit facility (the New Term Loan Credit Facility) and\nan $85.0 million revolving credit facility (the New Revolving Credit Facility) (collectively, the New Credit Facilities). We\nused initial proceeds from the New Credit Facilities of $141.9 million to repay in full the amounts owing under our former\nasset-based revolving and term loan credit facilities, and $56.0 million to repay and terminate certain finance lease obligations.\nThe New Credit Facilities have a term of five years and replace the former asset-based credit facilities. As at December 30,\n2023, the $180 million New Term Loan Credit Facility was fully drawn and we had utilized $37.7 million of the $85 million\nNew Revolving Credit Facility, including $5.9 million in letters of credit. For more information on our New Credit Facilities,\nincluding maturity dates, see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nIn connection with our efforts to extend payment terms with our major suppliers to enhance cash flows, we are financing certain\npurchases of goods and services through extended payables facilities, by which third-party intermediaries settle the supplier\ninvoice on the contractual due date and issue us a short-term note payable for the face amount of the invoice, which we repay,\ntogether with interest, at a later date. For the year ended December 30, 2023, we had principal borrowings of $102.0 million\nunder these facilities, of which $17.6 million principal amount remained outstanding as at December 30, 2023. With the\nflexibility provided by our New Credit Facilities, our intention is to reduce our reliance on these facilities in 2024 and to settle\nall remaining outstanding notes payable.\nFrom time to time, as part of our ongoing efforts to improve working capital efficiency, we utilize, at our sole discretion, supply\nchain finance (SCF) programs offered by some of our major customers that allows us to sell our receivables from the\ncustomers to such customers financial institutions, on a non-recourse basis, in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms\nwith the customer provide at a discount rate that leverages those customers favorable credit ratings. Utilizing our customers\nSCF programs reduces our accounts receivable balances, improves our cash flows, and reduces the cost of servicing these\nreceivables with our revolving credit facility. All operating cash flows from accounts receivable are reported consistently in\nour consolidated statements of cash flows regardless of whether they are associated with a SCF program.\nAs at December 30, 2023, we had approximately $86.3 million of purchase commitments related to inventories to be used in\nour production processes over the next 12 months, which we intend to fund through operating cash flows, supplemented from\ntime to time with short-term borrowings under our New Revolving Credit Facility.\nSUNOPTA INC. 38 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nWe estimate additional capital expenditures in 2024 of approximately $15 million for other discretionary investments in growth\nand productivity projects, and approximately $10 million to $15 million of non-discretionary maintenance projects. We also\nanticipate the addition of approximately $25 million of finance lease right-of-use assets related to an expansion of our ingredient\nextraction operations at our Modesto, California, facility. For 2024, our estimated capital expenditures directly related to\nenvironmental projects are not expected to be material. We intend to fund our cash capital expenditures using operating cash\nflows and the New Revolving Credit Facility.\nWe believe that our operating cash flows, including the selective use of customer SCF programs to improve collection terms,\ntogether with our New Credit Facilities and access to committed lease financing, will be adequate to meet our operating,\ninvesting, and financing needs for the foreseeable future, including the 12-month period following the issuance of our financial\nstatements. However, in order to finance significant investments in our existing businesses, or significant business acquisitions,\nif any, that may arise in the future, we may need additional sources of cash that we could attempt to obtain through a\ncombination of additional bank or subordinated financing, a private or public offering of debt or equity securities, or the\nissuance of common stock. There can be no assurance that these types of financing would be available at all or, if so, on terms\nthat are acceptable to us. In addition, we may explore the sale of selected operations or assets from time to time to improve our\nprofitability, reduce our indebtedness, and/or improve our position to obtain additional financing.\nCash Flows\nSummarized cash flow information for the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 is as\nfollows:\nChange\nDecember 30, December 31, January 1, 2022 to 2021 to\n2023 2022 2022 2023 2022\n$ $ $ $ $\nNet cash flows provided by (used in):\nContinuing operations:\nOperating activities 3,575 30,746 38,207 (27,171) (7,461)\nInvesting activities (46,519) (120,957) (77,390) 74,438 (43,567)\nFinancing activities (48,337) 96,534 52,762 (144,871) 43,772\nDiscontinued operations 99,356 (5,871) (13,603) 105,227 7,732\nOperating Activities of Continuing Operations\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations decreased $27.2 million from 2022 to 2023, which reflected the\nimpact of start-up costs related to our Midlothian, Texas, facility, higher cash interest expense on borrowings to finance capital\nexpenditures, and unrecovered product withdrawal and recall costs.\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations decreased $7.5 million from 2021 to 2022, which reflected an\nincrease in net working capital in 2022, due to the timing of payables and higher inventory levels to support the growth in our\nfruit snacks operations, partially offset by improved operating performance in 2022.\nInvesting Activities of Continuing Operations\nCash used in investing activities of continuing operations decreased $74.4 million from 2022 to 2023, which reflected the\ncompletion of certain major capital projects, including the construction of our new plant-based beverage facility in Midlothian,\nTexas.\nCash used in investing activities of continuing operations increased $43.6 million from 2021 to 2022, reflecting the ramp-up\nof construction activities at the Midlothian facility, together with the completion of our executive office and innovation center\nin Eden Prairie, Minnesota in 2022.

The estimates and assumptions made require us to exercise our\njudgment and are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances. We continually evaluate the information that forms the basis of our estimates and assumptions as our business\nand the business environment generally changes. The use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements. The\nfollowing are the accounting estimates which we believe to be most significant to our business.\nLoss on Divestiture of Frozen Fruit\nThe estimated aggregate purchase price recognized in connection with the divestiture of Frozen Fruit is subject to post-closing\nadjustments based on a determination of the final net working capital as of the closing date of the transaction on October 12,\n2023. As at December 30, 2023, we recognized a $0.5 million post-closing adjustment based on our estimate of the final net\nworking capital allocation, which is recognized as part of the loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement\nof operations for the year ended December 30, 2023. This estimate may be subject to change, which could be material, as the\nparties are currently in the process of reconciling the final aggregate purchase price, including the resolution of certain disputed\nitems, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement. A change in the aggregate purchase price\ncould have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nLeases\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized and measured based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease\nterm. In measuring lease assets and liabilities, critical estimates and assumptions include the amount and timing of the future\nlease payments based on the expected lease term, and the discount rate to apply to those future lease payments. We generally\nuse initial noncancelable lease term when determining the lease asset and liability. The discount rate used to determine the\npresent value of the future lease payments is the implicit rate in the lease if readily determinable. When that rate is not readily\ndeterminable, we use our incremental borrowing rate, which we estimate using relevant interest rate yield curves and credit\nspreads derived from available market data. See note 6 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this\nForm 10-K for disclosures related to leases, including weighted-average remaining lease terms and discount rates.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets, comprising property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and operating lease right-of-use\nassets, for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be\nrecoverable. Our evaluation is based on an assessment of potential indicators of impairment, such as an adverse change in the\nbusiness climate that could affect the value of an asset, the loss of a significant customer, current or forecasted operating or\ncash flow losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the use of an asset, the introduction of a competing product\nSUNOPTA INC. 40 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nthat results in a significant loss of market share, and a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be\ndisposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life, such as a plan to exit a product line or business in the near\nterm.\nImpairment exists when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows\nand its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. A discounted cash flow analysis is typically used to determine fair value\nusing estimates and assumptions that market participants would apply. Some of the estimates and assumptions inherent in a\ndiscounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of the projected future cash flow to be generated from the use of\nthe long-lived asset and its eventual disposal, and the discount rate used to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows. A\nchange in any of these estimates and assumptions could produce a different fair value, which could have a material impact on\nour results of operations. In addition, a long-lived assets expected useful life can increase estimation risk, as longer-lived assets\nnecessarily require longer-term cash flow forecasts. In connection with an impairment evaluation, we also reassess the\nremaining useful life of an amortizable long-lived asset and modify it, as appropriate.\nBased on our impairment assessment as of December 30, 2023, we did not identify any facts or circumstances that would\nindicate that the carrying amounts of any of the long-lived assets related to our continuing operations were not recoverable.\nContingencies\nWe make estimates for payments that are contingent on the outcome of uncertain future events. These contingencies include\naccrued but unpaid bonuses, tax-related matters, product recall-related claims and recoveries, and other claims or litigation. In\nestablishing our estimates, we consider historical experience with similar contingencies and the progress of each contingency,\nas well as the recommendations of internal and external advisors and legal counsel. We re-evaluate all contingencies as\nadditional information becomes available; however, given the inherent uncertainties, the ultimate amount paid could differ\nfrom our estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate may differ from the statutory tax rates in the jurisdiction in which we operate and may vary from year to\nyear as a result of permanent differences, investment and other tax credits, the provision for income taxes at different rates in\nforeign jurisdictions, enacted statutory tax rate increases or reductions in the year, changes due to foreign exchange, changes\nin valuation allowance based on our recoverability assessments of deferred tax assets, and favorable or unfavorable resolution\nof various tax examinations.\nIn making an estimate of our income tax liability, we first assess which items of income and expense are taxable in a particular\njurisdiction. This process involves a determination of the amount of taxes currently payable as well as the assessment of the\neffect of temporary timing differences resulting from different treatment of items for accounting and tax purposes. These\ndifferences in the timing of the recognition of income or the deductibility of expenses result in deferred income tax balances\nthat are recorded as assets or liabilities as the case may be on our balance sheet. We also estimate the amount of valuation\nallowance to maintain relating to loss carry forwards and other balances that can be used to reduce future taxes payable. This\njudgment is based on forecasted results in the jurisdiction and certain tax planning strategies and as a result actual results may\ndiffer from forecasts. We assess the likelihood of the ultimate realization of these tax assets by looking at the relative size of\nthe tax assets in relation to the profitability of the businesses and the jurisdiction to which they can be applied, the number of\nyears based on managements estimate it will take to use the tax assets and any other special circumstances. If different\njudgments had been used, our income tax liability could have been different from the amount recorded. In addition, the taxing\nauthorities of those jurisdictions upon audit may not agree with our assessment. Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Item 15 of this Form 10-K provides an analysis of the changes in the valuation allowance and the components of\nour deferred tax assets.\nWhile we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could differ from\nour accrued position. Accordingly, additional provisions on federal, provincial, state and foreign tax-related matters could be\nrecorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding recent accounting pronouncements is provided in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements included\nin Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\nSUNOPTA INC. 41 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest rate risk\nVariable and fixed rate borrowings carry different types of interest rate risk. Variable rate debt gives less predictability to\nearnings and cash flows as interest rates change, while the fair value of fixed rate debt is affected by changes in interest rates.\nAs at December 30, 2023, we had approximately $212 million of variable rate debt, mainly comprised of our New Credit\nFacilities, and approximately $53 million principal amount of fixed rate debt, comprised of finance lease obligations. A one\npercent, or 100 basis-point, change in interest rates would have a pre-tax effect of approximately $2.1 million on our results of\noperations and cash flows, based on current outstanding borrowings of variable rate debt, and the fair value of the fixed-rate\nfinance lease liabilities would increase or decrease by approximately $0.9 million.\nForeign currency risk\nFollowing the divestiture of Frozen Fruit with its Mexican operations, our remaining operations, assets and customers are\nprincipally located in the U.S. All of our U.S. subsidiaries use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, and the U.S. dollar\nis also our reporting currency. In addition, the functional and reporting currencies of our smaller Canadian operations are the\nU.S. dollar. As at December 30, 2023, a 10% change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, U.S. and Canadian operations have limited\nexposure to foreign currency transactions since sales and purchases are predominately made in U.S. dollars.\nPrice risk\nCertain agricultural commodities and ingredients we use in the production of our products are exposed to market price risk,\nincluding grains, nuts, sweeteners, and flavorings. In addition, other inputs, such as packaging materials, energy, fuel, storage,\nand freight, are exposed to price fluctuations due to weather conditions, regulations, industry conditions, energy costs, fuel\nprices, transportation and storage demands, or other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, as described above under\nRecent Events, the impacts of global macroeconomic conditions have contributed to higher commodity inflation and input\ncosts over the past few years. We currently do not utilize derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in input\nprices.\nChanges in the prices of our products may lag changes in the costs to produce and ship our products due to contractual\nrestrictions in our revenue contracts with customers, or competitive pressures. If we are unable to increase our prices to offset\nincreasing costs, our gross margins, operating results, and cash flows could be materially affected.\nOur ability to pass through higher input costs to our customers on a timely basis depends on how we go-to-market, that is\nprivate label, co-manufacturing, or branded products. In our private label contracts, the timing of pass-through pricing\nadjustments tends to lag impacts from cost inflation. As a result, with private label we have greater exposure to price risk,\nincluding the impact of changing freight rates as these products are typically delivered to the customers. On the other hand, the\ncost-plus pricing mechanisms built into most of our co-manufacturing arrangements generally result in our customers bearing\nthe majority of the raw material and packaging price risk. In addition, co-manufactured products are typically picked up by our\ncustomers, so they bear the impact of changing freight rates. With our branded portfolio, we are exposed to price risks for input\ncosts, including raw materials, packaging, plant operating costs and freight, that we may not be able to fully recover through\nprice increases due to competitive factors, or be able to fully offset with compensating productivity gains.\nItem 8.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nSUNOPTA INC. 42 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nItem 9A - Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management has established disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\nExchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange\nCommissions rules and forms. Such disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures\ndesigned to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the\nExchange Act is accumulated and communicated to its management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e)\npromulgated under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based on this evaluation, our\nChief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective\nas of December 30, 2023.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company.\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the\nCompanys financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Accordingly,\neven effective internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control\nobjectives\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that\nthere is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial statements will not\nbe prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting as of December 30,\n2023, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the evaluation performed, management concluded that our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective as of December 30, 2023 based on those criteria.\nOur internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, Independent\nRegistered Public Accounting Firm, as stated in its report which contains an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting. This report appears herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, management determined that we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial\nreporting and disclosure controls and procedures related to the preparation and review of our consolidated income tax provision\nand recognition of deferred tax assets in our financial statements for the year ended January 1, 2022. During fiscal 2023, we\nimproved our policies and procedures relating to enhancing our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls related\nto the accumulation and communication of information necessary to the accurate preparation of our consolidated income tax\nprovision and recognition of deferred tax assets, as well as strengthening our review controls over the reporting of income taxes\nand our financial statements. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we successfully completed the testing necessary to conclude\nthat the remedial controls are operating effectively, and the material weakness has been remediated.\nExcept as noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December\n30, 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nSUNOPTA INC. 43 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of SunOpta Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited SunOpta Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on criteria established\nin Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway (2013\nframework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, SunOpta Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the related\nconsolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in\nthe period ended December 30, 2023 and the related notes and our report dated February 28, 2024 expressed an unqualified\nopinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Annual\nReport on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required\nto be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,\nand performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nFebruary 28, 2024\nSUNOPTA INC. 44 December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nItem 9B.

(the Company) as of December 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders equity and cash flows\nfor each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the\nconsolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company at December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its\ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2023 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(2013 framework), and our report dated February 28, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due\nto error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that\nare material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken\nas a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit\nmatter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nSUNOPTA INC. -F2- December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nRevenue recognition under bill-and-hold arrangements\nDescription of the As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company enters into bill-and-hold\nMatter arrangements, whereby the Company produces and sells food and beverage products and control\ntransfers when the product is ready for physical transfer to the customer and the Company has a present\nright to payment. Total revenues was $630.2 million for the year ended December 30, 2023, a portion\nof which was for bill-and-hold arrangements.\nWe identified the evaluation of revenue recognized under bill-and-hold arrangements as a critical audit\nmatter because of the extent of additional audit effort required to test the incremental bill-and-hold\nrevenue recognition criteria. The incremental bill-and-hold revenue recognition criteria include the\nevaluation of: 1) the reason for the bill and hold arrangement; 2) the identification of the product as\nseparately belonging to the customer; 3) the product being currently ready for physical transfer to the\ncustomer; and 4) the Companys inability to use the product or direct it to another customer.\nHow We Addressed We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the\nthe Matter in Our Companys revenue recognition process, including controls related to the identification of bill-and-\nAudit hold revenue transactions and whether the criteria for revenue recognition have been met based on the\nunderlying agreements and transactions.\nWe examined the contracts with customers and evaluated the terms and conditions to determine\nwhether the reason for the bill-and-hold arrangement is substantive and whether certain revenue should\nbe recognized as bill-and-hold revenue. We further examined a sample of bill-and-hold revenue\ntransactions to assess the incremental bill-and-hold revenue recognition criteria. Specifically, we\ninspected the certificate of analysis that evidences that product is ready for physical transfer and the\ncontract terms which evidence the Company has the right to present payment. To evaluate that the\nCompany does not have the ability to use the product or direct to another customer, we inspected\nunderlying documentation for the same sample of bill and hold transactions to determine legal title to\nthe product had transferred to the customer.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2021.\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nFebruary 28, 2024\nSUNOPTA INC. -F3- December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nSunOpta Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nFor the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022\n(All dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 30, December 31, January 1,\n2023 2022 2022\n$ $ $\n(note 1) (note 1)\nRevenues (note 18) 630,297 591,395 496,455\nCost of goods sold 541,680 491,665 415,311\nGross profit 88,617 99,730 81,144\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 78,000 78,469 64,778\nIntangible asset amortization (note 7) 1,784 1,784 1,286\nOther expense, net 455 1,651 6,745\nForeign exchange loss (gain) 110 (107) 94\nOperating income 8,268 17,933 8,241\nInterest expense, net (note 10) 26,909 13,156 7,552\nEarnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes (18,641) 4,777 689\nIncome tax expense (benefit) (note 14) 3,269 896 (4,854)\nEarnings (loss) from continuing operations (21,910) 3,881 5,543\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax (note 2) (153,108) (8,722) (6,715)\nNet loss (175,018) (4,841) (1,172)\nDividends and accretion on preferred stock (note 11) (1,981) (3,109) (4,197)\nLoss attributable to common shareholders (176,999) (7,950) (5,369)\nBasic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (note 15)\nEarnings (loss) from continuing operations (0.21) 0.01 0.01\nLoss from discontinued operations (1.34) (0.08) (0.06)\nLoss attributable to common shareholders (1.55) (0.07) (0.05)\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding (000s) (note 15)\nBasic 114,226 107,659 104,098\nDiluted 114,226 110,247 106,987\n(See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements)\nSUNOPTA INC. -F4- December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nSunOpta Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss\nFor the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022\n(All dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nDecember 30, December 31, January 1,\n2023 2022 2022\n$ $ $\n(note 1) (note 1)\nEarnings (loss) from continuing operations (21,910) 3,881 5,543\nLoss from discontinued operations (153,108) (8,722) (6,715)\nNet loss (175,018) (4,841) (1,172)\nOther comprehensive loss\nReclassification of accumulated currency translation adjustment\nof discontinued operations (646) -

Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SunOpta Inc. and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries\n(collectively, the Company or SunOpta) and have been prepared by the Company in United States (U.S.) dollars and in\naccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). All intercompany accounts and transactions\nhave been eliminated on consolidation.\nFiscal Year\nThe fiscal year of the Company consists of a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal years\n2023, 2022 and 2021 were each 52-week periods ending on December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022,\nrespectively. Fiscal year 2024 will be a 52-week period ending on December 28, 2024, with quarterly periods ending on March\n30, 2024, June 29, 2024, and September 28, 2024.\nDiscontinued Operations\nAs described in note 2, on October 12, 2023, the Company completed the divestiture of its frozen fruit business (Frozen\nFruit). The divestiture of Frozen Fruit completes the Companys strategic optimization plan for its non-core, commodity-\nbased businesses, which included the divestiture of its sunflower business (Sunflower) in October 2022, in order to focus on\nvalue-add products in plant-based and healthy snack categories. Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, Frozen Fruit and\nSunflower met the criteria for reporting as discontinued operations, and, as such, the operating results and cash flows of Frozen\nFruit and Sunflower for the years ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 have been reclassified to discontinued\noperations on the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows, and the assets and liabilities of the Frozen Fruit disposal\ngroup have been reclassified and reported as held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2022. In\naddition, the information disclosed in these notes to the consolidated financial statements is presented on a continuing\noperations basis, with comparative period information recast to reflect Frozen Fruit and Sunflower as discontinued operations.\nSegment Information\nIn connection with the divestiture of Frozen Fruit, the Company changed its internal organization and reporting structures\nbeginning in the third quarter of 2023 and began operating as one segment. These changes included the elimination of the roles\nand responsibilities of the former General Managers of the Company, who were previously identified as the segment managers\nof the Companys former Plant-Based and Fruit-Based Foods and Beverages operating and reportable segments. With these\nchanges, the Companys Chief Executive Officer, who has been identified as the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM),\nmanages operations on a company-wide basis, rather than at a product category or business unit level. The CODM is supported\nby a centralized management team based on functional area, including sales, marketing, supply chain, and research and\ndevelopment, as well as finance, IT and administration. Only the CODM has overall responsibility and accountability for the\nprofitability and cash flows of the Company. Using financial information at the consolidated level, the CODM makes key\noperating decisions, including approving annual operating plans, expanding into new markets or product categories, pursuing\nbusiness acquisitions or divestitures, and initiating major capital expenditure programs. In addition, the CODM determines the\nallocation of resources and capital investments to optimize operations and maximize opportunities for the Company as a whole,\nwithout regard to specific product categories or business units. The CODM also uses consolidated information to assess\nperformance against the annual operating plan and to set company-wide incentive compensation targets. Following the\ndivestiture of its commodity-based businesses, the majority of the Companys products are shelf-stable packaged food and\nbeverage products and share similar customers and distribution. Refer to note 18 for a disaggregation of the Companys\nrevenues by product category.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Areas involving\nSUNOPTA INC. -F9- December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nSunOpta Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022\n(All tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts)\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\nsignificant estimates and assumptions include: allowances for credit losses; inventory reserves; income tax liabilities and assets,\nand related valuation allowances; provisions for loss contingencies related to claims and litigation; useful lives of property,\nplant and equipment and intangible assets; expected lease terms and discount rates in measuring lease assets and liabilities;\nexpected future cash flows used in evaluating long-lived assets for impairment; and reporting unit fair values in testing goodwill\nfor impairment. The estimates and assumptions made require judgment on the part of management and are based on the\nCompanys historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances. Management\ncontinually evaluates the information that forms the basis of its estimates and assumptions as the business of the Company and\nthe general business environment changes.\nFair Value\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement date (that is, an exit price). Fair value measurements are estimated based on\ninputs categorized as follows:\nLevel 1 inputs include quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are observable.\nLevel 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or\nsimilar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the\nasset or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation\nor other means.\nLevel 3 includes unobservable inputs that reflect the Companys own assumptions about what factors market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nWhen measuring fair value, the Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable\ninputs.\nForeign Currency Transactions\nGains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are included in foreign exchange gain/loss on the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits with an original maturity of 90 days or less. The Company\nplaces its cash and cash equivalents with institutions of high creditworthiness.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash consists of cash that is legally restricted as to withdrawal or usage.\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for credit losses is an\nestimate of the amount of probable losses in existing accounts receivable. The Company routinely assesses the financial strength\nof its customers and believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited. The Company closely monitors\nreceivable balances and estimates an allowance for credit losses based on historical collection experience, and account aging\nanalysis and trends, and evaluates the adequacy of the allowance each reporting period, considering individual customer\naccount reviews, write-offs recorded in the period, sales forecasts and trends, and current and expected economic and customer-\nspecific conditions. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the Company determines the receivable will\nnot be recovered. As at December 30, 2023, two long-term customers represented approximately 33% and 14%, respectively,\nSUNOPTA INC. -F10- December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nSunOpta Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022\n(All tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts)\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\nof the Companys consolidated accounts receivable balance. The Company does not believe it is exposed to any significant\ncredit risks with respect to these customers.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. Shipping and handling costs are\nincluded in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of operations.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes capitalized interest on\nborrowings during the construction of major capital projects. Depreciation begins when an asset is ready for its intended use.\nProperty, plant and equipment assets, other than land, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of\nthe assets, as follows:\nBuildings 20 - 40 years\nMachinery and equipment 5 - 20 years\nEnterprise software 3 - 5 years\nOffice furniture and equipment 3 - 7 years\nVehicles 3 - 7 years\nLeases\nAt the lease commencement date, the Company recognizes a right-of-use lease asset for an amount equal to the lease liability,\nless any lease incentives. The lease liability is determined based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease\nterm. The lease term includes the noncancellable term of the lease, together with periods covered by options to extend the lease\nthat the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. The discount rate used to determine the present value of the future lease\npayments is the implicit rate in the lease if readily determinable. When that rate is not readily determinable, the Company\napplies its incremental borrowing rate, which its estimated using relevant interest rate yield curves and credit spreads derived\nfrom available market data. The Company excludes material non-lease components in determining the future lease payments.\nMaterial leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are recorded on the balance sheet.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Companys finite-lived intangible assets consist of brand names and customer relationships. Intangible assets are amortized\non a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are 15 years for brand names and 20 years for customer\nrelationships.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds\nthe sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying\namount of an asset is not recoverable, the fair value of the asset is determined typically using an income approach (discounted\ncash flow analysis). An impairment loss is recognized in earnings for any excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its\nfair value.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess in a business combination of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the identifiable\nnet assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually,\nor whenever events or circumstances change between the annual impairment tests that would indicate the carrying amount of\nSUNOPTA INC. -F11- December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nSunOpta Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022\n(All tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts)\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\ngoodwill may be impaired. The Company performs its annual test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal\nyear. The Company can elect to qualitatively assess goodwill for impairment if it is more likely than not that the fair value of\na reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. If the Company elects to quantitatively assess goodwill, or it is not more likely than\nnot that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the Company estimates the fair value of each of its reporting\nunits using an income approach (discounted cash flow method). Goodwill impairment charges are recognized based on the\nexcess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value. Based on Companys qualitative assessment, it was determined\nthat goodwill was not impaired as at December 30, 2023.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nCosts incurred in connection with obtaining debt financing are deferred and amortized over the term of the financing\narrangement. Costs incurred to secure revolving credit facilities are recorded in other long-term assets. All other debt issuance\ncosts are recorded as a direct deduction from the related debt liability.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred income tax assets are\nrecognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards, and deferred income tax liabilities are\nrecognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the amounts of assets and\nliabilities recorded for income tax and financial reporting purposes.\nDeferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that management determines that it is more likely than not that the\ndeferred income tax assets will be realized. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in\ntax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The income tax expense or benefit is the income tax payable or recoverable for the\nyear plus or minus the change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year.\nThe Company is subject to ongoing tax exposures, examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. Accordingly, the\nCompany may incur additional income tax expense based upon the outcomes of such matters. In addition, when applicable, the\nCompany adjusts income tax expense to reflect the Companys ongoing assessments of such matters, which requires judgment\nand can materially increase or decrease its effective rate as well as impact operating results. The evaluation of tax positions\ntaken or expected to be taken in a tax return is a two-step process, whereby (i) the Company determines whether it is more\nlikely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position, and (ii) for those tax positions\nthat meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that has a\ngreater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.\nStock Incentive Plan\nThe Company maintains a stock incentive plan under which stock options and other stock-based awards may be granted to\nselected employees and directors. The Company measures stock-based awards at fair value as of the date of grant.\nCompensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over vesting period of the entire stock-based award, based on the\nnumber of awards that ultimately vest. Upon exercise, stock-based awards are settled through the issuance of common shares\nand are therefore treated as equity awards.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company manufactures and sells food and beverage products to retailers, foodservice operators, branded food companies,\nand other food manufacturers. The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract\nwith a customer are satisfied, which is upon the transfer of control of the contracted goods. Except for goods sold under bill-and-\nhold arrangements, control is transferred when title and physical possession of the product transfers to the customer, which is at\nthe point in time that product is shipped from the Companys facilities or delivered to a specified destination, depending on the\nterms of the contract, and the Company has a present right to payment. Under bill-and-hold arrangements, whereby the Company\nbills a customer for product to be delivered at a later date, control typically transfers when the product is ready for physical\ntransfer to the customer, and the Company has a present right to payment.\nSUNOPTA INC. -F12- December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nSunOpta Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022\n(All tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts)\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\nA performance obligation is a promise within a contract to transfer distinct goods to the customer. A contract with a customer\nmay involve multiple products and/or multiple delivery dates, with the transfer of each product at each delivery date being\nconsidered a distinct performance obligation, as each of the Companys products has standalone utility to the customer. In these\ncases, the contracts transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and\nrecognized as revenue when each individual product is transferred to the customer.\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring the goods.\nConsideration is typically determined based on a fixed unit price for the quantity of product transferred. Certain contracts include\nrebates and other forms of variable consideration. For contracts involving variable consideration, the Company estimates the\ntransaction price based on the amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled. These estimates are determined based\non historical experience and the expected outcome of the variable consideration, and are updated as new information becomes\navailable, including actual claims paid, which indicate an estimate is not indicative of the expected results. Changes to these\nestimates are recorded in the period the adjustment is identified. The Company does not typically grant customers a general right\nof return for goods transferred but will generally accept returns of product for quality-related issues. The cost of satisfying this\npromise of quality is accounted for as an assurance-type warranty obligation rather than variable consideration. The Companys\ncontracts do not typically include any significant payment terms, as payment is normally due shortly after the time of transfer.\nRevenue contracts are typically represented by short-term, binding purchase orders from customers, identifying the quantity and\npricing for products to be transferred. Customer purchase orders may be issued under long-term master supply arrangements. On\ntheir own, these master supply arrangements are typically not considered contracts for purposes of revenue recognition, as they\ndo not create enforceable rights and obligations regarding the quantity, pricing, or timing of goods to be transferred; however,\ncertain master supply agreements impose minimum purchase obligations on the part of the customers, which is considered a form\nof variable consideration. Other master supply arrangements provide for the transfer of product on a bill-and-hold basis at the\nspecific request of the customer. As goods are produced under these bill-and-hold arrangements to meet individual customer\nspecifications, they are identifiable as belonging to the customer and cannot be directed to another customer.\nThe timing of the Companys revenue recognition, customer billings and cash collections, does not result in significant unbilled\nreceivables (contract assets) or customer advances (contract liabilities) on the consolidated balance sheet. Contract costs, such\nas sales commissions, are generally expensed as incurred given the short-term nature of the associated contracts.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The\nCompanys research and development activities are directed towards custom product formulations, packaging innovations, and\nproduction process improvements. The Companys research and development expenditures primarily consist of employee-\nrelated compensation and supplies, as well as rental costs and depreciation expense related to the Companys innovation center\nand pilot plant.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number\nof common shares outstanding during the year. Earnings attributable to common shareholders is computed by deducting\ndividends and accretion on convertible preferred stock from net earnings. The potential diluted effect of stock options and other\nstock-based awards is computed using the treasury stock method whereby the weighted-average number of common shares\nused in the basic earnings per share calculation is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would\nhave been outstanding if the potential dilutive common shares had been issued at the beginning of the year. The potential\ndilutive effect of convertible preferred stock is computed using the if-converted method whereby dividends and accretion on\nthe convertible preferred stock are added back to the numerator, and the common shares resulting from the assumed conversion\nof the convertible preferred stock are included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation.\nSUNOPTA INC. -F13- December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nSunOpta Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022\n(All tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts)\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\nContingencies\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is subject to loss contingencies, such as accrued but unpaid bonuses, tax-related\nmatters, product recall-related claims and recoveries, and other claims or litigation. Accruals for loss contingencies are recorded\nwhen the Company determines that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably\nestimated. If the estimate of the amount of the loss is a range and some amount within the range appears to be a better estimate\nthan any other amount within the range, that amount is accrued as a liability. If no amount within the range is a better estimate\nthan any other amount, the minimum amount of the range is accrued as a liability.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-\n09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires public entities, on an annual basis, to\nprovide disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation, as well as disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by\njurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The\nCompany is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures, which requires public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments significant expenses and\nother segment items on an interim and annual basis. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the\ndisclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in ASC\n280 on an interim and annual basis. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for\ninterim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently\nevaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-07.\n2. Discontinued Operations\nDivestiture of Frozen Fruit\nOn October 12, 2023, the Company, together with its subsidiaries Sunrise Growers, Inc. (Sunrise Growers), Sunrise Growers\nMexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. (Sunrise Mexico) and SunOpta Mx, S.A. de C.V. (SunOpta Mexico), entered into an Asset\nPurchase Agreement (APA) with Natures Touch Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. and Natures Touch Frozen Fruits, LLC (the\nPurchasers) to sell to the Purchasers certain assets and liabilities of Frozen Fruit (the Transaction). On October 12, 2023\n(the Closing Date), the Company completed the Transaction in accordance with the terms of the APA. The Transaction\nrepresents the Companys exit from the processing, packaging and selling of individually quick frozen fruit for retail,\nfoodservice and industrial applications. Frozen Fruit was previously identified as a reporting unit within the Companys former\nFruit-Based Foods and Beverages operating and reportable segment. Included with the Transaction are owned facilities of\nFrozen Fruit located in Edwardsville, Kansas, and Jacona, Mexico. A leased frozen fruit facility located in Oxnard, California\nand certain inventories of frozen fruit were not acquired by the Purchasers as part of the Transaction; however, the Companys\nplan for the divestiture of Frozen Fruit included the immediate liquidation of these assets, as they have no use to the Companys\ncontinuing operations.\nAt the Closing Date, the estimated aggregate purchase price comprised cash consideration of $95.3 million; a short-term note\nreceivable of $10.5 million, payable in five consecutive monthly installments of $2.1 million beginning 30 days following the\nClosing Date; secured seller promissory notes due in three years and with stated principal amounts of $15.0 million entered\ninto by Sunrise Growers and $5.0 million entered into by SunOpta Mexico (the Seller Promissory Notes); and the assumption\nby the Purchasers of $15.7 million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of Frozen Fruit. At the Closing Date, $20.5\nmillion of the cash consideration was used to make required repayments of certain bank loans and other liabilities of Frozen\nFruit not assumed by the Purchasers. The Company realized a $0.4 million loss on a foreign currency forward contract entered\ninto to hedge the repayment of Mexican peso-denominated bank loans, which is included in other expense of continuing\noperations. The Company utilized the remaining cash consideration of $74.8 million to repay a portion of the outstanding\nborrowings under its credit agreement. As at December 30, 2023, $6.3 million of the short-term note receivable remained\noutstanding, which is included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet.\nSUNOPTA INC. -F14- December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nSunOpta Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022\n(All tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts)\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\nThe estimated aggregate purchase price is subject to post-closing adjustments based on a determination of the final net working\ncapital and resulting aggregate purchase price as of the Closing Date (the Closing Statement), with adjustments to the\naggregate purchase price determined on a separate and individual basis for each of Sunrise Growers, Sunrise Mexico and\nSunOpta Mexico. Any downward adjustment will be deducted from the principal amount of the Seller Promissory Notes entered\ninto by Sunrise Growers and/or SunOpta Mexico, as the case may be, in an amount up to $5.0 million in the aggregate, with\nany additional downward adjustment payable by the Company to the Purchasers in cash. The portion of any upward adjustment\nin the aggregate purchase price not paid to the Company by the Purchasers in cash will be added to the principal amount of the\nSeller Promissory Notes entered into by Sunrise Growers and/or SunOpta Mexico, as applicable. As at December 30, 2023, the\nCompany recorded a $0.5 million net receivable from the Purchasers based on the Companys estimate of the final net working\ncapital and post-closing adjustments, which is included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. However, this\nestimate may be subject to change, which could be material, as the parties are currently in the process of reconciling the final\naggregate purchase price, including the resolution of certain disputed items in accordance with the procedures set forth in the\nAPA.\nThe Seller Promissory Notes bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR),\ndetermined quarterly in advance, plus a margin of 4.00% for the first year and 7.00% for the second and third years. Interest is\npayable quarterly in-kind. The Seller Promissory Notes mature on October 12, 2026, and outstanding principal and accrued\nand unpaid interest is payable on the maturity date. The Seller Promissory Notes are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring\nbasis (Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy) and will be assessed for credit losses periodically. The Company determined that\nthe fair values of the Seller Promissory Notes approximate their principal values upon initial recognition and no premium or\ndiscount was recognized. As described above, the final principal amount of the Sellers Promissory Notes may change as a result\nof any upward or downward adjustment to the aggregate purchase price in connection with the resolution of the Closing\nStatement. As at December 30, 2023, the Company has not recorded any allowance for credit losses related to the Seller\nPromissory Notes. The Seller Promissory Notes are secured by a second-priority lien on certain assets of Frozen Fruit acquired\nby the Purchasers. The principal amount of the Seller Promissory Notes, together with accrued and unpaid in-kind interest, is\nrecorded in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance as at December 30, 2023.\nOn the Closing Date, the Company entered into post-closing transitional services agreements with the Purchasers to facilitate\nan orderly transfer of the business operations. The services provided under the agreements include, but are not limited to,\ninformation technology and financial shared services, payroll and benefits administration, supply chain transition services, and\ncontract manufacturing. These services terminate at various times up to nine months from the Closing Date and certain services\nmay be extended up to an additional three months.

Real estate leases typically provide the Company\noptions to extend the leases for up to 15 years. Finance leases for machinery and equipment typically include nominal purchase\noptions at the end of the lease term that are reasonably certain of being exercised at the lease commencement date. Machinery\nand equipment operating leases typically include purchase options for the fair market value of the underlying asset at the end\nof the lease term, which are uncertain of being exercised at the lease commencement date.\nThe following tables present supplemental information related to leases:\nDecember 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022\n$ $ $\nLease Costs\nOperating lease cost 15,076 13,099 11,789\nFinance lease cost:\nDepreciation of right-of-use assets 13,441 9,816 5,592\nInterest on lease liabilities 9,310 5,136 2,727\nTotal finance lease cost 22,751 14,952 8,319\nSUNOPTA INC. -F18- December 30, 2023 Form 10-K\nSunOpta Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022\n(All tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts)\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\nDecember 30, 2023 December 31, 2022\n$ $\nBalance Sheet Classification\nOperating leases:\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 105,919 78,761\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities 15,808 12,499\nOperating lease liabilities 100,102 74,329\nTotal operating lease liabilities 115,910 86,828\nFinance leases:\nProperty, plant and equipment, gross 81,423 153,976\nAccumulated depreciation (18,319) (18,168)\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 63,104 135,808\nCurrent portion of long-term debt 15,346 33,283\nLong-term debt 37,284 90,796\nTotal finance lease liabilities 52,630 124,079\nDecember 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022\n$ $ $\nCash Flow Information\nCash paid (received) for amounts included in measurement\nof lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases 13,852 12,320 11,098\nOperating cash flows from finance leases 9,310 5,136 2,727\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases\nCash paid under finance leases(1) 89,087 19,903 8,439\nCash received under finance leases(2) (6,568) (58,764) (13,626)\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease\nliabilities:\nOperating leases 35,601 49,662 27,909\nFinance leases 9,651 31,466 29,906\nRight-of-use assets and liabilities reduced through lease\nterminations or modifications:\nOperating leases (914) (4,060) (2,261)\n(1) Represents repayments under finance leases recorded as a reduction of the lease liability and reported in repayment of\nlong-term debt on the consolidated statements of cash flows.

The Common Shares\nexchanged represented approximately 5.3% of the Companys issued and outstanding Common Shares on a post-exchange\nbasis. After the exchange, the exchanged shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock previously held by Engaged were cancelled and\nSunOpta Foods is no longer required to pay dividends on those shares. Upon the exchange, the Company derecognized the\n$14.1 million carrying amount of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock previously held by Engaged, net of $1.1 million of unamortized\nissuance costs, and recognized a corresponding amount for the Common Shares issued on exchange, less common share\nissuance costs of $0.2 million.\nIn connection with the exchange of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, the Company redeemed all Special Shares, Series 2, par\nvalue $0.00001 per share, of the Company that were held by Engaged.

In addition, at any time on or after April 24, 2025, SunOpta Foods may redeem all\nof the Series B-1 Preferred Stock for an amount per share equal to the value of the liquidation preference at such time, plus\naccrued and unpaid dividends.\nOn May 19, 2023, the Company issued 2,932,453 Special Shares, Series 2 to Oaktree. As a result of a permanent voting cap,\nthe number of Special Shares, Series 2 issued to Oaktree at any time, when taken together with any other voting securities\nOaktree then controls, cannot exceed 19.99% of the votes eligible to be cast by all security holders of the Company.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the Company paid cash dividends on the Series B-1 Preferred Stock of $0.6 million in the aggregate\nto Oaktree and Engaged related to the fourth quarter of 2022, together with a cash dividend $0.2 million paid to Engaged for\nthe period from January 1, 2023 to March 3, 2023. In each of the second through fourth quarters of 2023, the Company paid a\nquarterly cash dividend of $0.3 million to Oaktree on the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, and, as at December 30, 2023, the\nCompany accrued unpaid dividends to Oaktree of $0.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, which are recorded in accounts\npayable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.

In the Companys opinion, the eventual resolution of such\nmatters, either individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position,\nresults of operations, or cash flows.

For the year ended December 30, 2023, the Company\nrecognized charges of $0.9 million for customer returns of the recalled products, $3.0 million for inventory on-hand at the time\nof the recall, and $3.4 million for the reimbursement of customer lost profits and consumer refunds and claims for damages\nrelated to the recall. The Company is seeking to recover a portion of the recall-related costs through its insurance coverage, and\nsuch recoveries are recorded in the period in which the recoveries are determined to be probable of realization. For the year\nended December 30, 2023, the Company recognized estimated insurance recoveries, net of deductibles, of $4.8 million. In\nconnection with the divestiture of Frozen Fruit, the recall-related costs and estimated insurance recoveries are included in the\nloss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 30, 2023. As at\nDecember 30, 2023, estimated insurance recoveries of $4.8 million are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets,\nand $1.3 million of recall-related costs are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance\nsheet.\nThe Company expects to incur additional costs related to the recall during the first quarter of 2024, including product\nwarehousing, transportation and destruction costs, as well as administrative costs. The Company expects that these additional\ncosts will be generally covered under its insurance policies; however, as of the date of this filing, the Company cannot be\ncertain of its ability to recover recall-related costs through its insurance coverage or the extent of any such recovery.\nEnvironmental Laws\nThe Company believes that, with respect to both its operations and real property, it is in material compliance with current\nenvironmental laws. Based on known existing conditions and the Companys experience in complying with emerging\nenvironmental issues, the Company is of the view that future costs relating to environmental compliance will not have a material\nadverse effect on its consolidated financial position, but there can be no assurance that unforeseen changes in the laws or\nenforcement policies of relevant governmental bodies, the discovery of changed conditions on the Companys real property or\nin its operations, or changes in the use of such properties and any related site restoration requirements, will not result in the\nincurrence of significant costs.\n18.

Most shareholders who reside in the United\nStates have received a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the “Notice”), which provides instructions\nfor accessing proxy materials on a website or for requesting electronic or printed copies of the proxy materials.\nIf you would like to receive a paper copy of the proxy materials for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the\n“Meeting”) of SunOpta Inc. (sometimes referred to as “we”, “us”, “our”, “the Company” or “SunOpta”) and for all\nfuture meetings, please follow the Notice instructions for requesting such materials. The chosen electronic delivery\noption lowers costs and reduces environmental impacts of printing and distributing the materials.\nWhat is the date, time and place of the Meeting?\nThe Meeting will be held on Thursday, May 23, 2024 at 3:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time. The Meeting will be held\nas a completely virtual online meeting, which will be conducted via live webcast. Shareholders will not be able\nto attend the Meeting in person. A summary of the information shareholders will need to attend the Meeting\nonline is provided below.\nTo be admitted to the Meeting, please access the virtual meeting platform on the Internet at\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/STKL2024. Shareholders or their legal proxies must log on to the platform by\nentering the 16-digit control number included on the proxy card, Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or\nvoting instruction form. Online access to the Meeting will open approximately 15 minutes prior to the start of the\nvirtual meeting. In order to attend the virtual Meeting, it is very important that you retain your proxy card, Notice of\nAvailability, or voting instruction form, and all related materials, including your assigned 16-digit control number,\nthrough the date of the Meeting. A shareholder also has the option of attending the virtual Meeting as a guest by using\nthe same platform. If you do not have access to a computer you may listen to the meeting by using the following\nnumbers: (USA) 1-800-590-8290 or (International) 1-240-690-8800. If you are dialing in, please ask the operator to\njoin the SunOpta call.\nWhy am I receiving proxy materials?\nWe sent you the Notice or this proxy statement relating to the Meeting (this “Proxy Statement”) and the accompanying\nproxy card because our Board of Directors (sometimes referred to as the “Board”) is soliciting your proxy to vote at\nthe Meeting and at any adjournment or postponement thereof. You are invited to attend the Meeting and we request\nthat you vote on the proposals described in this Proxy Statement. However, you do not need to attend the Meeting to\nvote your shares. Instead, you may simply complete, sign and return the enclosed proxy card, or vote by telephone or\nInternet as described below under “How can I vote?”\nWhat are the items of business scheduled for the Meeting?\nThere are three matters scheduled for a vote:\n• the election of the director nominees specified in this Proxy Statement;\n• the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm and\nauditor and authorization for the Audit Committee to fix their remuneration; and\n• a non-binding, advisory resolution to approve the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers\n(“NEOs”).\nShareholders will also consider and take action upon such other matters as may properly come before the Meeting or\nany adjournment thereof. The Board is not currently aware of any other matters to be presented at the Meeting.\n5\nWhat is included in the proxy materials?\nThe proxy materials include:\n• this Proxy Statement for the Meeting;\n• the accompanying proxy card; and\n• our Annual Report to Shareholders on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, which\nincludes the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 30, 2023 and the\nrelated Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The\nAnnual Report is not incorporated by reference into this Proxy Statement and is not deemed to be a part\nhereof.\nWhat is a proxy?\nIt is your legal designation of another person to vote the shares you own. The other person is called a proxy. If you\ndesignate someone as your proxy in a written document, that document is also called a proxy or a proxy card.\nThe enclosed proxy card contemplates that Greg Gaba, Chief Financial Officer, and Jill Barnett, Chief Administrative\nOfficer, General Counsel and Secretary, each be appointed to act as your proxy. However, you may choose another\nperson to act as your proxy. If you wish to appoint as your proxy a person other than the individuals named on the\nproxy card to attend the Meeting and vote for you, you may do so by striking out the names on the proxy card and\ninserting the name of your proxy in the blank space provided in the proxy card, or you may complete another proper\nproxy card. Your appointed proxy need not be a shareholder of the Company. If you appoint a non-management\nproxyholder, please make them aware and ensure they will attend the meeting for the vote to count.\nWho is soliciting my proxy?\nThe proxy accompanying this Proxy Statement is solicited by management and the Board of Directors of the Company.\nProxies may be solicited by officers, directors and regular employees of the Company. None of the officers, directors\nor employees will be directly compensated for such services.\nHow many classes of shares are outstanding?\nThe Company currently has two classes of shares issued and outstanding, namely the Common Shares and the Special\nVoting Shares. The Common Shares are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the stock\nsymbol “STKL” and are listed for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) under the stock symbol “SOY”.\nThe Company created and issued the Special Voting Shares in connection with the Series B-1 Preferred Stock\nfinancing, completed by our subsidiary, SunOpta Foods Inc. in April 2020. The Special Voting Shares are not quoted\nor listed for trading on any exchange.\nUnless the context otherwise requires, any reference in this Proxy Statement to “shares” of the Company refers to both\nthe Common Shares and Special Voting Shares, and any reference to “shareholders” of the Company is intended to\nrefer to holders of either Common Shares or Special Voting Shares.\nWho can vote at the Meeting?\nSubject to the restriction noted below under “How many votes are needed to approve each proposal,” each holder of\nCommon Shares and each holder of Special Voting Shares is entitled to one vote for every share owned. The holders\nof Common Shares and Special Voting Shares vote together as a single class.\nOnly shareholders of record at the close of business on March 28, 2024, or the record date, will be entitled to vote at\nthe Meeting. On the record date, there were 116,080,736 Common Shares and 2,932,453 Special Voting Shares issued\nand outstanding (119,013,189 shares in aggregate), representing 97.54% and 2.46%, respectively, of the aggregate\nvoting rights attaching to all of the Company’s outstanding shares. Except as otherwise stated, all information relating\nto the number of outstanding shares or other securities of the Company in this Proxy Statement is as of March 28,\n2024.\nIn the event a shareholder of record transfers their Common Shares or Special Voting Shares after the close of business\n6\non the record date, the transferee of those shares will be entitled to vote the transferred shares at the Meeting provided\nthat they produce properly endorsed share certificates representing the transferred shares to the Company’s Secretary\nor transfer agent or otherwise establishes ownership of the transferred shares at least ten days prior to the Meeting.\nWhat is the difference between a shareholder of record and a shareholder who holds shares in street name?\nMost shareholders hold their shares through a broker, bank or other nominee rather than directly in their own name.\nAs summarized below, there are important distinctions between shares held of record and those owned in street name.\nShareholder of Record – Shares Registered in Your Name\nIf, as of the close of business on March 28, 2024, your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer\nagent, you are considered, with respect to those shares, the shareholder of record. As the shareholder of record, you\nhave the right to grant your voting proxy directly to the individuals named on the proxy card, or to vote in person at\nthe Meeting. Whether or not you plan to attend the Meeting, we urge you to fill out and return the enclosed proxy\ncard to ensure your vote is counted.\nBeneficial Owner – Shares Registered in the Name of Broker, Bank or Nominee\nIf your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial\nowner of shares held in “street name,” and the proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your broker or nominee,\nwhich is considered, with respect to those shares, the shareholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the\nright to direct your broker how to vote and are also invited to attend the Meeting. However, since you are not the\nshareholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the Meeting unless you obtain a signed proxy from\nthe shareholder of record giving you the right to vote the shares. Your broker or nominee has provided voting\ninstructions for you to use in directing the broker or nominee how to vote your shares. If you fail to provide sufficient\ninstructions to your broker or nominee, that shareholder of record may be prohibited from voting your shares. See\n“What if I do not specify how my shares are to be voted?” and “What are ‘broker non-votes’?” below.\nHow can I vote?\nYou may vote your shares by one of the following methods:\nVote by Internet. To vote via the Internet before the meeting, go to www.proxyvote.com and follow the\nsimple instructions. You will be required to provide your 16-digit control number located on the Notice\nor your form of proxy. You may attend the Meeting via the Internet and vote during the Meeting by\ngoing to www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/STKL2024. Be sure you have your control number\ninformation located on the Notice or your form of proxy available and follow the instructions.\nVote by Telephone. To vote by telephone, call toll free 1-800-690-6903. You will be prompted to provide\nyour 16-digit control located on the Notice or your proxy card.\nVote by Mail. If you received a printed set of proxy materials, you may complete, sign, date and mail the\nseparate proxy card or other proper form of proxy in the envelope provided with this Proxy Statement.\nIf you vote by telephone or Internet, please do not mail your proxy card.\nIf you vote by telephone or Internet before the Meeting, your vote must be cast no later than the proxy cut-off of 4:00\nP.M. Eastern Daylight Time on Tuesday, May 21, 2024 (or 4:00 P.M. on the day before, excluding Saturdays, Sundays\nand holidays, any adjournment or postponement of the Meeting). If you vote by proxy, your completed proxy card\nmust be received by Broadridge at 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York USA 11717, prior to 4:00 P.M. Eastern\nDaylight Time on Tuesday, May 21, 2024 (or 4:00 P.M. on the day before, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays,\nany adjournment or postponement of the Meeting at which the proxy is to be used). The Chair of the Meeting may\nwaive or extend the proxy cut-off without notice at his own discretion.\nIf your shares are held in street name by a broker, bank or other nominee, please refer to the instructions provided by\nthat broker, bank or nominee regarding how to vote or how to revoke your voting instructions.\nIf you return a signed proxy card or use the telephone or Internet to vote before the Meeting, the persons named as\nproxies in the proxy card will vote your Common Shares as you direct.\n7\nEven if you currently plan to attend the Meeting virtually, we recommend that you also submit your proxy as described\nabove so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Meeting. Submitting your proxy via\nInternet, telephone or mail does not affect your right to vote during the Meeting.\nHow many votes are needed to approve each proposal?\nThe number of votes required to approve each of the proposals scheduled to be presented at the Meeting is as follows:\nProposal One: Election of Directors. Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast, meaning the nominees who\nreceive the largest number of votes will be elected as directors, up to the maximum number of directors to be elected.\nHowever, in accordance with the Canada Business Corporations Act (the “CBCA”) our Majority Voting Policy,\nnominees will only be elected if the number of votes cast in their favor represents a majority of the votes cast for and\nagainst them by the shareholders who are present in person or represented by proxy. See “Proposal One – Election of\nDirectors – Majority Voting Policy” below.\nProposal Two: Appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm\nand auditors and authorization of the Audit Committee to fix their remuneration. This proposal will be approved if\nthe votes cast in favor of the proposal constitute a majority of the total votes cast on the proposal.\nProposal Three: Advisory vote regarding the compensation of the Company’s NEOs. This proposal will be approved\nif the votes cast in favor of the proposal constitute a majority of the total votes cast on the proposal. Although the\noutcome of this vote is not binding on us, we will consider the outcome of this vote when developing our compensation\npolicies and practices, and when making compensation decisions in the future.\nWhat if I do not specify how my shares are to be voted?\nShareholders of Record. If you are a shareholder of record and you submit a proxy card, but you do not provide voting\ninstructions, your shares will be voted as follows:\nFOR each of the eight nominees named in this Proxy Statement for election to the Company’s Board of\nDirectors;\nFOR the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accounting\nfirm and auditor and authorization of the Audit Committee to fix their remuneration; and\nFOR the approval of the non-binding advisory resolution regarding the compensation of the Company’s\nNEOs.\nThe Board does not expect that any additional matters will be brought before the Meeting. The persons appointed as\nproxies will vote in their discretion on any other matters that may properly come before the Meeting or any\npostponement or adjournment thereof, including any vote to postpone or adjourn the Meeting. Moreover, if for any\nreason any of our nominees are not available as a candidate for director, the persons named as proxies will vote for\nsuch other candidate or candidates as may be nominated by the Board.\nBeneficial Owners. If you are a beneficial owner and you do not provide the broker, bank or other nominee that holds\nyour shares with voting instructions, the broker or other nominee will determine if it has the discretionary authority to\nvote on the particular matter. Therefore, if you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, your broker may\nonly vote your shares on Proposal Two. See “What are ‘broker non-votes’?” below.\nWhat are “broker non-votes”?\nA broker non-vote occurs when a broker, bank or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote\non a particular proposal because the nominee does not have authority to vote on that particular proposal without\nreceiving voting instructions from the beneficial owner. Under NASDAQ rules, brokers that do not receive voting\ninstructions from the beneficial owner have the discretion to vote on certain routine matters, but do not have the\ndiscretion to vote on the election of directors to the Board, executive compensation matters or any other significant\nmatter as determined by the SEC. We believe that Proposal Two relating to the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP\nas our independent registered public accounting firm is considered a matter on which brokers may vote in their\ndiscretion on behalf of clients who have not furnished voting instructions. However, under current NASDAQ rules,\nwe believe that brokers who have not received voting instructions from their clients will not be authorized to vote in\ntheir discretion on Proposals One and Three. Accordingly, for beneficial owners of shares, if you do not give your\n8\nbroker specific instructions, your shares may not be voted on such proposals.\nHow are abstentions and broker non-votes counted?\nAbstentions and broker non-votes are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists at the Meeting.\nThe shares represented by proxies marked “abstain” will not be treated as affirmative or opposing votes. Broker non-\nvotes will not affect the outcome of the vote on any of the proposals to be voted upon at the Meeting because the\noutcome of each vote depends on the number of votes cast rather than the number of shares entitled to vote.\nHow many votes do I have?\nOn each matter to be voted upon, you have one vote for each Common Share you owned as of March 28, 2024.\nWho counts the votes?\nThe Company has nominated Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. to count and tabulate the votes. This is done\nindependently of the Company to preserve the confidentiality of individual shareholder votes. Proxies are referred to\nthe Company only in cases where a shareholder clearly intends to communicate with management, the validity of the\nproxy is in question or where it is necessary to do so to meet the requirements of applicable law.\nIs my vote confidential?\nThe Company’s transfer agents (identified below) preserve the confidentiality of individual shareholder votes, except\nwhere a shareholder clearly intends to communicate their individual position to the management of the Company or\nas necessary in order to comply with legal requirements.\nIf I need to contact the Company’s transfer agents, how do I reach them?\nYou can contact the transfer agent in Canada by mail at: TSX Trust Company, 100 Adelaide Street West, Suite 301,\nToronto, Ontario, Canada M5H 4H1, or via telephone at 1-866-600-5869. You can contact the transfer agent in the\nUnited States by mail at: Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York, USA 11219, or via\ntelephone at 1-800-937-5449.\nWhat does it mean if I receive more than one copy of the Notice or proxy card?\nIf you receive more than one copy of the Notice or more than one proxy card, your shares are registered in more than\none name or are registered in different accounts. Please complete, sign and return each proxy card or follow the\ninstructions on each copy of the Notice to ensure that all of your shares are voted.\nHow do I revoke or change my vote?\nIf you are a shareholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted by one of the following\nmethods:\n• Voting again by telephone or by Internet prior to 4:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time on May 21, 2024, as set\nforth above under “How can I vote?”;\n• Requesting, completing and mailing or delivering by facsimile a proper proxy card, as set forth above under\n“How can I vote?”; or\n• Sending written notice of revocation, signed by you (or your duly authorized attorney), to the Secretary of\nthe Company, at the Company’s corporate offices at 7078 Shady Oak Road, Eden Prairie, Minnesota 55344,\nat any time prior to the last business day preceding the date of the Meeting.\nAttendance at the virtual meeting is not, by itself, sufficient to revoke a Proxy unless written notice of the revocation\nor a subsequent Proxy is delivered to the Secretary of the Company before the revoked or superseded Proxy is used at\nthe virtual Meeting. Proxies not revoked will be voted in accordance with the choices specified by shareholders by\nmeans of the ballot provided on the Proxy for that purpose.\nIf you hold your shares in street name, you may revoke your proxy by following the instructions provided by your\nbroker, bank or other nominee.\n9\nWhat is the quorum requirement?\nUnder NASDAQ listing rules, the presence at the Meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of at least two\nshareholders holding not less than one-third (33 1/3%) of all the Company’s outstanding shares shall constitute a\nquorum for the purpose of transacting business at the Meeting. As of the record date, there were 116,080,736 Common\nShares and 2,932,453 Special Voting Shares outstanding (119,013,189 shares in the aggregate). Therefore, holders of\nat least 39,671,063 of the Company’s outstanding shares must be present, in person or represented by proxy, at the\nMeeting in order to establish a quorum. The Company encourages all of its shareholders to participate in the Meeting.\nHow can I find out the results of the voting at the Meeting?\nPreliminary voting results will be announced at the Meeting. We will publish final results in a Current Report on\nForm 8-K that we expect to file with the SEC and with applicable Canadian securities regulatory authorities within\nfour business days of the Meeting. After the Form 8-K is filed, you may obtain a copy by visiting our website, by\nviewing our public filings in the U.S. at www.sec.gov or in Canada at www.sedar.com, by calling (952) 820-2518, by\nwriting to Investor Relations, SunOpta Inc., 7078 Shady Oak Road, Eden Prairie, Minnesota 55344 or by sending an\nemail to legal@sunopta.com.\n[Remainder of page left intentionally blank]\n10\nSECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT\nThe following presents information regarding beneficial ownership of our shares as of March 28, 2024 by:\n• each person who we know that beneficially owns more than 5% of our Common Shares;\n• each of our directors and nominees;\n• each of our NEOs; and\n• all of our directors and executive officers as a group.\nUnder the regulations of the SEC, shares are generally deemed to be “beneficially owned” by a person if the person\ndirectly or indirectly has or shares voting power or investment power (including the power to dispose) over the shares,\nwhether or not the person has any pecuniary interest in the shares, or if the person has the right to acquire voting power\nor investment power of the shares within 60 days, including through the exercise of any option, warrant or right. In\naccordance with the regulations of the SEC, in computing the number of Common Shares beneficially owned by a\nperson and the percentage ownership of such person, we deemed to be outstanding all Common Shares subject to\noptions or other rights held by the person that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of March 28,\n2024. We did not deem such shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of\nany other person.\nBased solely on our review of statements filed with the SEC pursuant to Section 13(d) and 13(g) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) the Company is not aware of any other person or group that\nbeneficially owns more than 5% of any class of voting shares of the Company, except as noted below.\nAmount and\nNature of Percentage\nBeneficial Percentage of all\nName and Address of Beneficial Owner Title of Class Ownership of Class(1) Shares(1)\nOaktree Capital Group, LLC Common 23,658,579(2)(3) 19.88% 19.88%\n333 South Grand Avenue, 28th Floor,\nLos Angeles, CA 90071 Special Voting 2,932,453(4) 100% 2.46%\nBlackRock, Inc.\n50 Hudson Yards Common 9,984,820(5) 8.60% 8.39%\nNew York, NY 10001\n(1) Percentage of Class and Percentage of all Shares are calculated based on a total of 116,080,736 Common Shares and\n2,932,453 Special Voting Shares outstanding as at March 28, 2024.\n(2) Includes 20,726,126 Common Shares and 2,932,453 Common Shares currently issuable on the exchange of Series B-1\nPreferred Stock beneficially owned by the Oaktree Funds (as defined below).\n(3) According to a Schedule 13D/A filed on May 18, 2023 by Oaktree Fund GP, LLC (“Fund GP”), Oaktree Organics, L.P.\n(“Organics”) and Oaktree Huntington Investment Fund II, L.P.

Persons subject to Section 16 are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16\nforms that they file related to SunOpta stock transactions. Under SEC rules, certain forms of indirect ownership and\nownership of our Common Shares by certain family members are covered by these reporting requirements. As a\nmatter of practice, our administrative staff assists our directors and executive officers in preparing initial ownership\nreports and reporting ownership changes and typically files these reports on their behalf.\nBased solely on a review of the copies of Forms 4 and 5 furnished to us, or written representations from reporting\npersons that all reportable transactions were reported, we believe that during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023,\nall of our executive officers, directors and greater than 10% holders filed the reports required to be filed under\nSection 16(a) on a timely basis, except that the Form 4 filing made on February 6, 2023 for Scott Huckins and the\nForm 4 filing made on October 27, 2023 for Greg Gaba were late due to an administrative oversight. The two late\nForm 4 filings reported a total of four transactions.\n[Remainder of page left intentionally blank]\n13\nPROPOSAL ONE - ELECTION OF DIRECTORS\nNominees\nThe term of office of each director expires at the close of the next annual meeting of shareholders unless they resign\nor their office becomes vacant as a result of death, removal or other cause.\nIt is proposed that the following eight individuals be elected as directors of the Company at the Meeting. Each of the\nnominees named below has consented to be named herein and to serve as a director if elected. Management has no\nreason to believe that any of the nominees will not be a candidate or, if elected, will be unable to serve as a director.\nThere are no family relationships among the Company’s directors, executive officers or persons nominated or chosen\nto become directors.\nBoard of Director Nominees in Alphabetical Order:\nDr. Albert Bolles\nRebecca Fisher\nDean Hollis\nKatrina Houde\nBrian Kocher\nDiego Reynoso\nLeslie Starr\nMahes S. Wickramasinghe\nRecommendation of the Board of Directors; Vote Required\nThe Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote FOR the election of each of the eight director\nnominees named above. Subject to the majority voting requirement described below, the eight nominees who receive\nthe greatest number of votes cast at the Meeting will be elected as directors.\nAmendments to the CBCA, which came into force on August 31, 2022, establish a majority voting requirement for\ndirectors. Specifically, the CBCA now requires that, for elections at which there is only one candidate nominated for\neach position available on the Board of Directors, shareholders vote “for” or “against” individual directors (rather than\n“for” or “withhold”) and each candidate is elected only if they receive a majority of votes cast in their favor. The\nCBCA provides that if an incumbent director is not elected in those circumstances, the director may continue in office\nuntil the earlier of (i) the 90th day after the day of the election, and (ii) the day on which their successor is appointed\nor elected.\nAbstentions and broker non-votes are counted only for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists at the\nMeeting, but will have no effect on the results of the vote. Brokers and other nominees will not have discretionary\nauthority to vote your shares if you hold your shares in street name and do not provide instructions as to how your\nshares should be voted on this proposal. If any of the nominees for director at the Meeting becomes unavailable for\nelection for any reason, the proxies on this proposal will have discretionary authority to vote pursuant to the proxy for\na substitute or substitutes.\nInformation about the Board Nominees\nThe biographies that follow provide certain information as of March 28, 2024, with respect to each director nominee.\nThe information presented below for each director includes the specific experience, qualifications, attributes and skills\nthat led us to the conclusion that such director should be nominated to serve on the Board in light of our business.\nIn addition to the factual information provided for each of the nominees, the Board and the Corporate Governance\nCommittee (as Nominating Committee) also believe that each of the nominees has attributes that are important to an\neffective board, including: sound judgment and analytical skills; integrity and demonstrated high ethical standards;\nthe ability to engage management and one another in a constructive and collaborative manner; diversity of background\nand experience; and the continued commitment to devote their time, energy and skills to ensure the growth and\nprosperity of the Company.\n14\nAdvance Notice By-Law\nEffective November 10, 2015, the Board approved and adopted by-law number 15 (the “Advance Notice By-Law”)\nproviding for advance notice requirements for the nomination of directors. The Company’s shareholders\nsubsequently approved the Advance Notice By-law at the annual and special meeting of shareholders held on May\n10, 2016. A copy of the Advance Notice By-law can be found under the Company’s profile on the SEDAR website\nat www.sedar.com or attached as Exhibit 3.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November 13,\n2015.\nThe Advance Notice By-Law establishes the conditions and framework under which holders of record of Common\nShares may exercise their right to submit director nominations and is designed to ensure that shareholders receive\nadequate notice of all director nominations to be considered at a shareholders' meeting and sufficient information so\nthat shareholders can cast an informed vote.\nThe Advance Notice By-Law provides that for an annual meeting of shareholders (including an annual and special\nmeeting), advance notice of director nominations to the Company must be given not less than 30 days prior to the\ndate of the annual meeting. If the annual meeting is to be held on a date that is less than 50 days following the date\nof public announcement of the date of the annual meeting, notice must be given by the nominating shareholder not\nlater than the close of business on the tenth day following the notice date. In the case of a special meeting of\nshareholders (which is not also an annual meeting), called for the purpose of electing directors (whether or not called\nfor other purposes as well), notice to the Company must be given no later than the close of business on the 15th day\nfollowing the day on which the first public announcement of the date of the special meeting was made. The Advance\nNotice By-Law requires the nominating shareholder to include in its notice to the Company certain information\nregarding the nominating shareholder and the director nominees.\n[Remainder of page left intentionally blank]\n15\nPROFESSIONAL HIGHLIGHTS AND QUALIFICATIONS\n As Chief Executive Officer of Landec Corporation, Dr. Bolles successfully led profitability,\noperating, innovation and quality improvements, enabling divestiture of the Curation Foods\nbusinesses and transitioning the Lifecore Biomedical business from Landec to a stand-alone\ncorporation.\n As Executive Vice President, Research, Quality and Innovation for ConAgra, Dr. Bolles\nchampioned the development and execution of multiple new and improved products, realizing\nincremental growth for ConAgra Foods and a multi-year pipeline to sustain and advance growth\nfurther.\n As Vice President, Worldwide R&D for PepsiCo Beverages and Foods, Dr. Bolles led global R&D\nfor beverages (Pepsi, Gatorade, and Tropicana) and Quaker Foods, including product, process,\npackage and sensory R&D, Nutrition, Quality, and Scientific & Regulatory Affairs.\nDr. Albert  Dr. Bolles’ experience includes partnering with the FDA and USDA to influence and craft public\npolicy benefiting consumers and passing the Food Safety Modernization Act in 2010.\nBolles\nRECENT PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE\nLandec Corporation (2014 – 2022)\nIndependent\n• Chief Executive Officer\nAge 66\n• Member of Compensation Committee, Food Innovation Committee, and Nominating and\nDirector Since 2016 Governance Committee\nConAgra Foods, Inc.

Consequently, the Board is committed to ensuring that the Company follows best practices and\ncontinually seeks to enhance and improve its corporate governance practices.\nBoard Mandate\nThe Board is responsible for the stewardship of the Company and supervising the management of the business and\naffairs of the Company in accordance with the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Board\nestablishes overall policies and standards for the Company. Where appropriate, the directors rely upon management\nand the advice of the Company’s outside advisors and auditors. The Board also delegates certain responsibilities to\nits standing committees, based upon the approved charters of each such committee.\nIn accordance with its mandate, the Board oversees and reviews the development and implementation of the\nfollowing significant corporate plans and initiatives, among others:\n• the Company’s strategic planning process;\n• the identification of the principal risks to the Company’s business and the implementation of systems to\nmanage these risks, whether financial, operational, environmental, cyber- or safety-related or otherwise;\n• succession planning and evaluation of relative strengths of existing management including the needs to\nensure sufficient depth of management;\n• oversight of communications and public disclosure including the Company’s disclosure policy and receiving\nfeedback from stakeholders;\n• analysis and approval of significant transactions including material acquisitions and dispositions of\nbusinesses or other Company assets; and\n• the Company’s internal controls and management information systems.\nBoard Composition, Size and Leadership\nThe articles of incorporation of the Company provide that its Board shall consist of a minimum of five and a maximum\nof fifteen directors. The Board of Directors has fixed the number of directors at eight.\nBrian Kocher, our CEO, currently serves on the Board, and Dean Hollis is the Chair of the Board. The Board does not\nhave a formal policy concerning the separation of the roles of CEO and Chair, as the Board believes that it is in the\nbest interests of the Company to make that determination based on the position and direction of the Company and the\ncomposition of the Board from time to time. As indicated above, these roles are currently separate.\nThe Chair of the Board sets the agenda for meetings of the Board with input and feedback from the directors.\nAdditionally, the Chair’s duties entail: conducting and presiding at executive sessions of the Board, serving as a liaison\nto and acting as a regular communication channel between the members of the Board and the CEO of the Company,\nand consulting with the CEO about the concerns of the Board.\nAll committees of the Board are chaired by independent directors. The Board and the Corporate Governance\nCommittee believe that the current Board leadership structure is an appropriate structure for the Company and will\ncontinue to periodically evaluate whether the structure is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.\nBoard Skills and Experience\nIn accordance with its mandate, the Corporate Governance Committee regularly considers the appropriate skills and\ncharacteristics required of Board members, taking into consideration the Board’s short-term needs and long-term\nsuccession plans. The Corporate Governance Committee believes that the Board should be comprised of directors\nwith a broad range of experience and expertise. Additionally, the Corporate Governance Committee develops and\nperiodically updates a long-term plan for the Board's composition taking into consideration the independence, age,\nskills, experience and availability of service to the Company of its members, as well as the opportunities, risks, and\nstrategic direction of the Company. Having regard for the results of the foregoing, the Corporate Governance\n20\nCommittee makes recommendations to the full Board regarding the size and composition of the Board and seeks to\nidentify qualified individuals to become Board members as deemed appropriate.\nWhile the specific mix may vary from time to time and alternative categories may be considered in addition to or\ninstead of those below, the following skills and types of experience are generally sought by the Corporate Governance\nCommittee, and have been utilized in seeking additions to the Board:\n• Accounting, Finance or Financial Reporting: Accounting and audit expertise are valued in order to\nenable the Board to oversee management’s handling of financial and financial reporting matters,\nincluding by: critically assessing the Company’s financial performance and projections;\nunderstanding the Company’s critical accounting policies, as well as technical issues relevant to\ninternal and external audit; and evaluating the robustness of the Company’s internal controls. The\nCorporate Governance Committee values candidates who have experience in senior financial roles\nand/or in financial advisory roles. Such experience enhances the Board’s oversight of financial\nperformance, assists it in its assessment of strategic opportunities and risks and allows it to more\neffectively address issues relevant to capital and capital structure.\n• Corporate Governance/Other Public Boards: In light of the competing demands of stakeholders and\nthe increasingly complex governance environment in which public companies operate, the\nCorporate Governance Committee values candidates who possess a sophisticated understanding of\ncorporate governance practices and norms, and/or board expertise.\n• Cybersecurity: The Corporate Governance Committee seeks candidates with practical expertise in\nstrategy, implementation, and controls related to information security, cybersecurity, and data\nprivacy programs and systems to assist the Board in understanding and assessing the threats faced\nby the Company and preventing and protecting the Company from these threats.\n• Environmental, Social, Governance (“ESG”): As the Company is committed to incorporating ESG\nprinciples into its business strategies and organizational culture and working to meet its ESG-related\ncommitments and goals, the Corporate Governance Committee seeks candidates who possess a\nworking understanding of various topics and issues relevant to our commitments, progress, and\nreporting. The Corporate Governance Committee values candidates who have knowledge and\nexperience related to the physical impacts of climate change; waste and hazardous materials\nmanagement; sustainable product design and lifecycle management; sustainable sourcing practices;\nwater and wastewater management; energy efficiency management; human rights; diversity, equity\nand inclusion (DEI); government affairs, workplace health and safety, product quality and safety,\npublic company board governance; compliance and business ethics; and ESG reporting principles\nand frameworks.\n• Food and Beverage: As the Company’s business is derived from sales within the food and beverage\nindustry, the Corporate Governance Committee seeks candidates who possess a solid understanding,\npreferably gained through management or board service, of industry dynamics on a global and\nregional basis; contract manufacturing; private label, retail, Consumer Packaged Goods (CPGs) and\nfood service businesses; R&D and product innovation; food safety and quality.\n• Food Safety and Quality: The Company is subject to a range of governmental regulations and\npolicies regarding food safety and quality. For example, we are affected by laws and regulations\nrelated to seed, fertilizer, and pesticides; the purchasing, harvesting, transportation and warehousing\nof agricultural products; the processing, packaging, and sale of food and beverages, including\nwholesale operations; product labeling and marketing; food safety and food defense. Candidates\nwho possess an understanding of these requirements as well as food safety and food product\ncertifications are valued by the Corporate Governance Committee since such experience assists the\nBoard in more effectively carrying out its compliance oversight responsibilities and understanding\nhow any new laws or regulatory trends within the food industry may impact strategic decisions.\n• Investor/Public Relations: Recognizing that investors play a major role in the success and growth\nof the Company, the Corporate Governance Committee values candidates who understand how to\neffectively communicate company information to investors, and other stakeholders, and the\n21\nimportance of maintaining strong, transparent relationships with our shareholders and building long-\nterm credibility with the investment community.\n• Risk Management: The Corporate Governance Committee seeks candidates with practical expertise\nin enterprise risk management frameworks, systems, processes, tools, and techniques, to assist the\nBoard in understanding and assessing the risks and opportunities faced by the Company generally,\nincluding those inherent in its strategic initiatives.\n• Senior/Executive Leadership: The Corporate Governance Committee seeks business and other\nleaders who have demonstrated leadership, mature judgment, operating success, and an\nunderstanding of complex organizations in progressively challenging roles. Such individuals are\nbelieved to provide the most effective counsel to management, as well as critical oversight on behalf\nof stakeholders. Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or Board/Committee Chair level\nexperience is valued.\n• Strategy Planning/Business Operations: Recognizing the importance of the Board’s oversight role\nwith respect to corporate strategy, the Corporate Governance Committee seeks candidates who\npossess board, senior management and/or other experience in strategy development or analysis, as\nwell as general business operations, including sales, marketing, manufacturing operations, supply\nchain and R&D.\n• Talent Management/Compensation: The Corporate Governance Committee values candidates with\nhands-on roles in developing, managing, compensating, and motivating people. Such skills and\nexperience assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibility to ensure that the Company maintains\neffective incentive programs which attract, motivate, and retain top talent, while at the same time\nreinforcing the Company’s strategic priorities. Talent management and compensation expertise also\nserve to align the Board with leadership development and succession planning.\nA skills matrix showing the skills and expertise or each of the nominees is set forth below:\nSkills/Experience\nBolles Fisher Hollis Houde Kocher Reynoso Starr Wickramasinghe\nAccounting, Finance or\n   \nFinancial Reporting\nCorporate Governance/Other\n      \nPublic Board\nEnvironmental, Social,\n   \nGovernance\nFood and Beverage Industry       \nFood Safety and Quality  \nInvestor and Public Relations     \nRisk Management       \nSenior Leadership        \nStrategic Planning/ Business\n       \nOperations\nTalent Management/\n    \nCompensation\nDirector Independence\nUnder NASDAQ listing rules, a majority of the members of the Board must be “independent directors”. An\nindependent director under NASDAQ listing rules is a person other than an executive officer or employee or any other\nindividual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent\njudgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.\nNational Policy 58-201 – Corporate Governance Guidelines of the Canadian Securities Administrators (the “CSA”)\nrecommends that boards of directors of reporting issuers be composed of a majority of independent directors. A\ndirector is considered independent only where the board determines that the director has no “material relationship”\nwith the Company. Director independence of each of the current directors is determined by the Board with reference\n22\nto the requirements set forth by the CSA in National Instrument 52-110 - Audit Committees, as well as the rules and\nregulations of the TSX, NASDAQ and SEC.\nThe Board has determined that each of the following seven directors nominated for election are independent: Dr.\nAlbert Bolles, Rebecca Fisher, Dean Hollis, Katrina Houde, Diego Reynoso, Leslie Starr and Mahes S.\nWickramasinghe. Brian Kocher, CEO, is currently an officer of the Company, and is therefore not considered\nindependent. As a result, if all of the director nominees are elected at the Meeting, seven of the eight directors will be\nindependent. These independent directors currently comprise in full the membership of each standing Board\ncommittee described in this Proxy Statement.\nAnnual Evaluation\nThe Board, each committee and each of the individual directors are assessed annually at the end of the year as part of\nthe Company’s evaluation process to determine whether the Board and its committees are functioning effectively.\nDirectors provide feedback evaluating Board and committee effectiveness on multiple criteria. The evaluation asks\nquestions about what was done well and what could be done better and covers a broad range of matters, including\nBoard and committee structure and composition, Board and committee leadership, strategic planning, risk\nmanagement, operational performance, Board education and Board processes and effectiveness. During this annual\nassessment process, each director is required to complete an individual assessment of fellow directors, which is\nprepared and reviewed by someone other than the directors. The results of the Board and committee assessments are\nreported to, and discussed in detail at, a meeting of the full Board. Each individual director meets with the Board Chair\nor Corporate Governance Committee Chair to discuss any concerns or issues regarding board effectiveness. The most\nrecent evaluation was conducted in the fall of 2023.\nExecutive Sessions\nThe independent directors meet without management and non-independent directors at regularly scheduled in-person\nBoard meetings, generally following meetings of the full Board. As previously noted, the Chair of the Board presides\nover these meetings.\nMeeting Attendance\nThe Board held 7 duly called meetings during fiscal year 2023 and standing committees of the Board held a total of\n16 meetings. Each incumbent board member attended 85% or more of the Board meetings during their service period\nin 2023, and 100% or more of the meetings of those committees on which they served. All directors were in attendance\nvirtually at the 2023 Annual and Special Meeting of the Shareholders held on May 25, 2023.\nTerm and Age Limits\nA director’s term of office is from the date on which they are elected or appointed until the close of the next annual\nmeeting. The Board believes that individual directors should be rigorously evaluated on the basis of their skills,\nknowledge, experience, character, attendance and contributions to the Board and the business of the Company and the\nspecific needs and requirements of the Board without regard to their term of service or age. At this time, the Board\nhas, therefore, not adopted term or age limits for directors as it believes it is important to find a balance between\nensuring a mechanism for fresh ideas and viewpoints while not losing the insight, experience and other benefits of\ncontinuity contributed by longer serving directors. However, as the Board recognizes that diversity of views from\nlonger-term and newly-appointed directors can contribute to effective decision making, the Board considers the term\nof service of individual directors, the average term of the Board as a whole and turnover of directors in recent years\nwhen proposing a slate of nominees.\nDiversity\nThe Board believes that directors and executive officers with diverse backgrounds, experiences and expertise benefit\nthe Company by enabling the Board to consider issues from a variety of perspectives. In 2015, the Board approved a\nseparate written diversity policy, later revised in January 2022, which is available at our website at www.sunopta.com,\nunder the “Investor Relations” link. Among other matters, the diversity policy outlines our approach in respect of the\nidentification and nomination of women as well as indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities or members and\nvisible minorities (together with women, “designated groups”) as directors of the Company.\n23\nIn support of the Company’s commitment to diversity, when selecting qualified candidates to serve on the Board, the\nCompany considers a wide range of diversity criteria including gender, visible minorities, Indigenous people, persons\nwith disabilities, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, geographic location and other factors. The Board seeks to include\nmembers not only with diverse backgrounds, but also with a diverse set of skills and experience, including appropriate\nfinancial and other expertise relevant to the business of the Company, in order to find the best qualified candidates\ngiven the needs and circumstances of the Company. The Board has established specific targets relating to the\nidentification, nomination or representation on either the Board or among executive officers based on gender.\nSpecifically, the Company is committed to ensuring that women comprise no less than 30% of our Board and the\nCompany also aspires to have women comprise no less than 30% of our executive team by 2030. The Board will also\nseek to ensure that the Board has at least two members who are “Diverse” as defined in Rule 5605(f) of the Nasdaq\nStock Market (“Nasdaq Rule 5605(f)”), including (i) at least one member who self-identifies as Female and (ii) at least\none member who self-identifies as an Underrepresented Minority or LGBTQ+, as such terms are defined in Nasdaq\nRule 5605(f). Currently, the Board meets this requirement.\nPresently, the Board is comprised of three female directors (37.5%) and five male directors (62.5%). Assuming all of\nthe Company’s nominees are elected, the Board will continue to be comprised of three female directors (37.5%) and\nfive male directors (62.5%) who collectively represent a wide range of industries, cultural, geographic, functional and\nother perspectives. In addition, two of the nominees (25%) for election to the Board are a member of a designated\ngroup (other than women). The Company will continue to monitor annually the effectiveness of the Company’s\ndiversity policy, including its level of board diversity, and consider whether it would be appropriate to include\nadditional goals for the representation of designated groups or other diversity categories in the future. In addition, the\nBoard hopes to further expand diversity on the Board as turnover occurs while taking into account the skills,\nexperience and knowledge desired at that particular time by the Board.\nWith respect to executive officer positions, currently there are two females (25%) and six males (75%) at this level\nwithin the Company. As noted above, the Company aspires to have women comprise no less than 30% of our executive\nofficer positions by 2030. At the Vice-President level and higher, women presently comprise 7 out of 20 positions or\n35%. The Company established a Women’s Leadership Program at the end of 2019 in order to assist with the growth\nand development of future women leaders in the Company. Through external speakers, trainings, mentor relationships,\nconnection circles and other programs, the Women’s Leadership Program provides additional training and\nopportunities to further assist employees in their growth and development. While the Company monitors and considers\nthe level of representation of designated groups when appointing members of senior management, other than as noted\nabove, it has not established any specific targets or percentage representation at this time for the executive team.\nThe table below illustrates the diversity of our current Board as of March 28, 2024.\nBoard Diversity Matrix as of March 28, 2024\nBoard Size:\nTotal Number of Directors 8\nGender\nGender: Male Female Non-Binary Undisclosed\nNumber of directors based on gender identity 5 3 - -\nNumber of directors who identify in any of the categories below:\nAfrican American or Black - - - -\nAlaskan Native, American Indian, First Nations, Inuit or Métis - - - -\nArab - - - -\nAsian - - - -\nHispanic or Latinx 1 - - -\nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander - - - -\nWhite 3 3 - -\nOther category 1 - - -\nTwo or More Races or Ethnicities - - - -\n24\nLGBTQ+ -\nUndisclosed -\nCode of Conduct\nEach of the directors and executive officers of the Company is required to certify on an annual basis that they have\nreviewed and is knowledgeable as to the contents of the Company’s Business Ethics and Code of Conduct (the “Code\nof Conduct”) and is not aware of any violations of the Code of Conduct. All new employees of the Company are\nrequired to certify at the time of hiring that they have reviewed and are knowledgeable as to the contents of the Code\nof Conduct. The Company monitors compliance with the Code of Conduct through management oversight and regular\ncommunications with employees. In addition, the Company has established and maintains, through an independent\nthird-party service provider, a confidential toll-free ethics reporting hotline which all directors, officers and employees\nare advised of and encouraged to use to report matters which may constitute violations of the Code of Conduct.\nA copy of the current Code of Conduct is available, without charge, at www.sunopta.com or upon written request to\nthe Company at SunOpta Inc., 7078 Shady Oak Road, Eden Prairie, Minnesota 55344. Any amendments to, or waivers\nof, the Code of Conduct which specifically relate to any financial professional will be disclosed promptly following\nthe date of such amendment or waiver at www.sunopta.com.\nDirector Orientation and Continuing Education\nThe Company has a formal director orientation policy to ensure that all new directors receive proper orientation to\nfacilitate the level of familiarity with the Company’s practices, policies and operations required to meet Board\nresponsibilities.\nThe current process to orient new directors is as follows:\n1) The new director meets with the Chair of the Board and the Company’s CEO to discuss various information\nabout the Company, including history, vision, mission and values, organization structure, shareholdings,\nstrategic plan, fiscal business plan and budget, historical and current year to date fiscal results.\n2) The new director meets with the Chair to discuss the aspects of the Board such as organizational documents\nand Board and committee minutes for the past year, Board administration matters, expense reimbursement\npractices, and Company policies.\n3) The new director meets with other directors of the Company and certain members of management which\nallows new directors an opportunity to ask questions about the role of the Board, its committees and directors\nand the nature and operation of the Company. Following nomination, new directors are encouraged to meet\nother members of management and to visit the Company’s premises and view its operations.\n4) New directors are provided access to the Company’s continuous disclosure documents as filed with the SEC\nand on SEDAR, investor presentation material, the Board mandate and the Code of Conduct. New directors\nare required to affirm that they have read and understand the Code of Conduct.\nThe Company also encourages directors to attend other appropriate continuing education programs. Furthermore, the\nBoard and its committees received a number of presentations in 2023 to expand the Board’s knowledge of the\nCompany’s business, industry and principal risks and opportunities. Presentation topics included cybersecurity, ESG\nperformance, consumer and retail trends, labor trends, employee health and safety initiatives, product development\nand innovation, inventory counts, productivity initiatives, risk management and insurance, aseptic plant manufacturing\noperations, and regulatory updates. In addition to these presentations, written materials likely to be of interest to\ndirectors that have been published in periodicals, newspapers or by legal or accounting firms are routinely forwarded\nto directors or included with Board and committee meeting materials.\n25\nRisk Oversight\nThe Board and its Committees\nThe Board has risk oversight responsibility and sets the tone for the appropriate management of risk tolerance while\nachieving strategic objectives of the Company. The Board strives to effectively oversee the Company’s enterprise-\nwide risk management in a way that balances risk while enhancing the long-term value of the Company for the benefit\nof the shareholders. The Board understands that its focus on effective risk oversight is critical to setting the tone for\neffective risk management within the Company culture. The Board maintains an active dialogue with management to\noversee existing risk management processes, and the identification, assessment, and management of the Company’s\nmost significant risk exposures. The Board receives regular updates from management about the Company’s most\nsignificant risks to help it evaluate whether management is responding appropriately. During each regularly scheduled\nBoard meeting, the Board reviews components of the Company’s long-term strategic plans and associated principal\nissues, which includes foreseeable risks that the Company expects to face in the future.\nThe Board oversees risk management directly, as well as through its committees as follows:\nBoard Committee Risk Mitigation Role\nAudit Reviews the Company’s policies and practices with respect to risk assessment and\nrisk management, including discussing with senior management major financial\nrisks and the steps taken to monitor and control exposure to such risk.\nReviews quarterly updates regarding the Company’s Enterprise Risk Management\n(“ERM”) program and status of top risks through quarterly scorecards including key\nrisk metrics vs targets and progress against action plans. As an example, the Audit\nCommittee receives updates on initiatives and progress related to cybersecurity\nmatters from the Chief Information Officer (“CIO”) each quarter.\nCorporate Governance Considers risks related to succession planning and internal governance policies and\npractices\nCompensation Considers risks related to the attraction and retention of talent and risks relating to\nthe design of executive compensation programs and arrangements\nThe Company’s ERM Steering Committee, composed of the CEO, CFO, and Chief Administrative Officer (“CAO”)\nand other members of senior leadership, provides regular reports and recommendations to the Board to assist the Board\nwith its overall risk oversight function.\nManagement\nManagement executes the day-to-day risk management operations of the Company. Management is responsible for\nthe identification, assessment, and management of risk, the implementation of approved strategic business plans and\ninitiatives, and the operation and execution of risk management activities within authorized budgets and in accordance\nwith corporate policies and procedures. As part of the Company’s ERM program, the ERM Steering Committee meets\nquarterly to ensure alignment on risk management priorities, proactively identify, prioritize, and assess key risks,\nreview the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management strategies, assess progress against the risk management\naction plans presented by risk owners, and increase the likelihood of achieving overall Company strategy and\nobjectives.\nCybersecurity\nIn 2023, the Board reviewed and discussed cybersecurity and information security measures with the CIO. The\nCompany’s cybersecurity program is reviewed by the ERM Steering Committee on a quarterly basis. The Company\ndid not have a material cybersecurity breach during 2023.\nOur cybersecurity program is strategically crafted to achieve the paramount goals of identifying, protecting, detecting,\nand responding to all potential risks and threats. Employing a defense-in-depth strategy, we proactively identify,\ninvestigate, and resolve vulnerabilities and security incidents in a timely manner. Continuous improvement is integral\nto our cybersecurity approach. Regular assessments, conducted with the expertise of external security firms against\ninternational standards, allow us to quantify our program's effectiveness. The insights gained from these assessments\n26\nserve as a foundation for continuous improvement efforts. Outcomes are reported to our Audit Committee for\ntransparency and accountability. We rely on services from a variety of third-party providers to supply things such as\ncloud storage and networks. On an annual basis, we review these providers to assess their risk profiles. We rely on\nthese third parties to have their own cybersecurity programs commensurate with their risk, and we cannot ensure in\nall circumstances that their efforts will be successful.\nDespite facing directed attacks, our systems have withstood such challenges without material interruptions to our\nbusiness operations. Recognizing the potential impact of significant disruptions, we remain steadfast in our\ncommitment to fortify our systems against evolving threats. Any significant disruption to our ability to transact\nbusiness could adversely affect our business performance as well as our reputation.\nHeading our cybersecurity program is our CIO. Our CIO has over 30 years of experience in Software Engineering and\nInformation Technology/Cybersecurity and is supported by skilled professionals from our Information Technology\nteam. This seasoned team provides regular updates to the ERM Steering Committee. Our Audit Committee and Board\nof Directors receive regular reports from the ERM Steering Committee, as well as directly from our CIO on a quarterly\nbasis. These reports cover various cybersecurity matters, including risk assessments, mitigation strategies, areas of\nemerging risks, incidents and industry trends, and other areas of importance.\nFurthermore, our Board of Directors takes a proactive stance in overseeing our annual enterprise risk assessment. This\ncomprehensive evaluation encompasses key risks, including those associated with security, technology, and\ncybersecurity threats, demonstrating our commitment to robust governance and risk management.\nSuccession Planning\nThe Board, the Corporate Governance Committee and the Compensation Committee have been successful in\ndeveloping and retaining a team of directors and executives that has completed the turnaround of the Company and is\nnow focused on driving growth. The Corporate Governance Committee works jointly with the Compensation\nCommittee and is responsible for the normal succession planning that occurs over time, such as recruiting and\nevaluating new executive and director talent, as well as developing internal candidates. This process includes an\nongoing evaluation, with the involvement of management, of the Company’s leadership development strategies and a\nconsideration of potential candidates, including existing Company employees. The Board and management discuss\nthe strengths and gaps of key succession candidates, development progress over the prior year and future development\nplans, that include long range planning for executive development, to ensure leadership sustainability and continuity.\nFormal succession planning has been implemented at key positions in the Company in furtherance of this goal.\nBoard Committees\nThe Board presently has three committees, with the principal functions and membership described below. Each\ncommittee has a charter, which is available at our website at www.sunopta.com, under the “Investor Relations” link.\nThe following table summarizes the current membership of each of our three Board committees.

The Nominating Committee evaluates prospective nominees identified on its own initiative or referred\nto it by other Board members, management, shareholders or external sources and all self-nominated candidates. The\nNominating Committee uses the same criteria for evaluating candidates nominated by shareholders and self-nominated\ncandidates as it does for those proposed by other Board members, management and search companies.

None of our executive officers serves as a member of the compensation committee of any other entity\nthat has an executive officer serving as a member of our Board or Compensation Committee. None of our executive\nofficers serve as a member of the board of directors of any other company that has an executive officer serving as a\nmember of our Compensation Committee.\nInsider Ownership Guidelines for Directors, Officers and Executives\nOn March 1, 2021, the Board reviewed the current insider ownership guidelines and approved certain revisions to the\npolicy regarding how compliance with the policy is determined. These guidelines are reviewed on an annual basis\nand are intended to align the interests of directors and management with those of our shareholders.\nThe insider ownership guidelines encompass the following parameters:\n1. Insider ownership guidelines are mandatory for all non-employee members of the Board and members of the\nSenior Leadership Team. All persons covered by these guidelines will have the option to request an\nexemption from these requirements based on consideration of their personal circumstances by the\nCompensation Committee.\n2. Stock ownership targets established as follows:\na. Chief Executive Officer – five times base salary\nb. Directors – five times annual cash retainers\nc. Other NEOs (includes Chief Financial Officer and three most highly compensated officers) – two\ntimes base salary\nd. All other Senior Leadership Team members – one times base salary\n3. Participants may satisfy their ownership guidelines with Common Shares in these categories: shares owned\ndirectly, shares owned indirectly (e.g., by a spouse or a trust), shares represented by amounts invested in a\n401(k) plan or deferred compensation plan maintained by SunOpta or an affiliate, unvested, time-based\nRSUs, and value of “in the money”, unexercised options.\n4. Participants will be deemed to have satisfied the applicable insider ownership guidelines if the value of such\nCommon Shares equals or exceeds such amount, as calculated using the average trading price of the stock\nover the previous 90 calendar day period.\n5. All participants are provided a five-year transition period to be in compliance with the ownership target. At\nthe end of that period, the CEO, other NEOs and the Senior Leadership Team not in compliance will receive\n50% of all subsequent short-term incentive payments in the form of equity until such time as the minimum\nholding is established.\nAs of March 28, 2024, five of the eight directors were in compliance with the mandatory guidelines. All but two of\nthe executive officers of the Company were in compliance with the guidelines. The three directors and two executive\nofficers who currently do not meet the insider ownership guidelines are still within their respective transition period.\nCompensation of Directors\nAnnual compensation for non-employee directors is comprised of cash and equity-based compensation. Cash\ncompensation consists of an annual retainer and supplemental retainers for the chairs and members of Board\ncommittees. Equity compensation is comprised of an annual grant of RSUs.\nNon-employee directors may elect to receive stock in lieu of cash compensation, including from 50% to 100% of the\ncash amount. Also, non-employee directors have the option to defer receipt of annual equity compensation that would\notherwise be payable to them, subject to compliance with the Company’s Non-Employee Director Stock Deferral Plan\nand Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.\nEffective June 2023, the Board established the following schedule for non-employee director compensation:\n30\ni. Annual cash retainer of:\n• $75,000 for serving as a director;\n• $70,000 for serving as the Chair of the Board;\n• $20,000 for serving as the Chair of the Audit Committee;\n• $15,000 for serving as the Chair of the Compensation Committee;\n• $10,000 for serving as the Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee;\n• $6,000 for serving on the Audit Committee; and\n• $3,000 for serving on other committees.\nii. Annual equity compensation:\n• RSUs valued at $105,000 with a 12-month vesting period\nThe following table summarizes total compensation paid to our non-employee directors for fiscal year 2023.\nNon-Employee Director Compensation Table\nFees Earned or Paid Stock Awards Total\nName\nin Cash ($) ($)(1) ($)(2)\nDr. Albert Bolles 71,250 105,000 176,250\nRebecca Fisher 85,500 105,000 190,500\nDean Hollis 146,500 105,000 251,500\nKatrina Houde 78,750 105,000 183,750\nDiego Reynoso 39,950 105,000 144,950\nLeslie Starr 78,250 105,000 183,250\nMahes S.

The number of RSUs granted in June 2023 was\ndetermined by dividing the scheduled Annual Equity Compensation by SunOpta’s closing stock price on the grant\ndate. RSUs vest on the first anniversary of the grant date.\n(2) Includes the fair market value of Common Shares issued in lieu of cash retainers, including elections of $35,625 for Dr.\nBolles, $85,500 for Ms. Fisher, $146,500 for Mr. Hollis, $20,125 for Ms. Houde, and $47,625 for Mr. Wickramasinghe.\nThe Board believes that compensation for non-employee directors should be competitive and should fairly compensate\ndirectors for the time and skills devoted to serving our Company but, for independent directors, should not be so\nsignificant as to compromise independence.\nAll our directors are reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred for attending meetings of our Board\nor its committees and for other reasonable expenses related to the performance of their duties as directors. The Board\nbelieves that our non-employee director compensation package is competitive with the compensation offered by other\ncompanies and is fair and appropriate considering the responsibilities and obligations of our directors.\nPenalties and Sanctions and Personal Bankruptcies\nExcept as disclosed below, none of the proposed nominees for election to the Board:\n1) is, as at the date of this Proxy Statement, or was within ten years before the date of the Proxy Statement, a\n31\ndirector or chief executive officer or chief financial officer of any company (including the Company) that:\n(i) was the subject of an order (as defined in Form 51-102F5 made under National Instrument 51-102\nof the CSA) that was issued while the director or executive officer was acting in the capacity as\ndirector, chief executive officer or chief financial officer; or\n(ii) was subject to an order that was issued after the director or executive officer ceased to be a director,\nchief executive officer, or chief financial officer, and which resulted from an event that occurred\nwhile that person was acting in the capacity as a director, chief executive officer, or chief financial\nofficer; or\n2) is at the date hereof, or has been within ten years before the date of this Proxy Statement, a director or\nexecutive officer of any company (including the Company) that while that person was acting in that capacity,\nor within a year of that person ceasing to act in that capacity, became bankrupt, made a proposal under any\nlegislation relating to bankruptcy or insolvency or was subject to or instituted any proceedings, arrangement\nor compromise with creditors or had a receiver, receiver manager or trustee appointed to hold its assets; or\n3) has, within the ten years before the date of this Proxy Statement, become bankrupt, made a proposal under\nany legislation relating to bankruptcy or insolvency, or become subject to or instituted any proceedings,\narrangement or compromise with creditors, or had a receiver, receiver manager or trustee appointed to hold\nthe assets of the director, executive officer or shareholder.\nMs. Starr was appointed as a director of Chesapeake Energy Corporation (“Chesapeake”) on September 11, 2017.\nSimilar to many other oil and gas companies, Chesapeake found itself in the midst of a “double black swan event” in\nthe spring of 2020: an emerging global pandemic that sapped demand, and an oil price war that flooded the market\nwith supply. After exploring all available alternatives and on the advice of its legal and financial advisors, the board\nof directors authorized Chesapeake to file for restructuring proceedings under Chapter 11 of the United States\nBankruptcy Code, which proceedings commenced in June 2020. On February 9, 2021, following the approval and\neffectiveness of a confirmed plan of reorganization, Chesapeake emerged from bankruptcy protection with its creditors\nassuming ownership of the company and the board of directors was discharged of its duties.\nThe foregoing information, not being within the knowledge of the Company, has been furnished by the directors.\n[Remainder of page left intentionally blank]\n32\nPROPOSAL TWO – APPOINTMENT AND REMUNERATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED\nPUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND AUDITOR\nAppointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm and Auditor\nThe Audit Committee of the Board has selected Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”) as the Company’s independent auditor\nfor the 2024 fiscal year. EY has served as our auditors since 2021. We are requesting our shareholders to vote at the\nMeeting to appoint EY as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm and auditor and to authorize\nthe Audit Committee to fix their remuneration.

The Audit Committee’s policy is to require pre-approval\nfor all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the Company’s external auditor prior to their engagement\nwith the exception that management is authorized to engage the external auditor in respect of services to the extent\nthat (a) such required services could not reasonably be completed by another firm (e.g. assistance with responses to\ncontinuous disclosure review comment letters from regulatory authorities, comfort letters, consent letters, statutory\naudits), (b) each individual engagement is not more than $50,000, and (c) the aggregate for all engagements does not\nexceed $100,000. Any pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services and is generally\nsubject to a specific budget. The Audit Committee has delegated to its Chair authority to pre-approve proposed audit\n33\nand non-audit services that arise between Audit Committee meetings, provided that the decision to approve the service\nis presented to the full Audit Committee for consideration at the next scheduled Audit Committee meeting. All audit\nand non-audit services performed by EY during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 were approved in accordance\nwith this policy.\nFinancial Information Systems Design and Implementation Fees\nNo fees were billed to the Company by EY during any of the last two fiscal years for professional services described\nin Paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X (financial information systems design and implementation\nservices).\n[Remainder of page left intentionally blank]\n34\nREPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of the Company assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with\nrespect to the external reporting process and the adequacy of the Company’s internal controls. Specific responsibilities\nof the Audit Committee are set forth in the Audit Committee Charter, a copy of which can be found on SunOpta’s\nwebsite at www.sunopta.com. For the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, the members of the Audit Committee\nwere Dean Hollis, Diego Reynoso, Leslie Starr and Mahes Wickramasinghe, each of whom meets the independence\nrequirements of Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and applicable independence\nrequirements of the NASDAQ listing rules and National Instrument 52-110 – Audit Committees of the CSA.\nThe Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the Company’s audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 30, 2023 with the Company’s management. The Audit Committee has discussed with EY, the Company's\nindependent registered public accounting firm and auditor, the matters required to be discussed by the statement on\nAuditing Standards No. 61, as amended, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in\nRule 3200T. The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from EY required by applicable\nrequirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding EY communications with the Audit\nCommittee concerning independence, and has discussed with EY its independence.\nIn reliance on the review and the discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that\nthe audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December\n30, 2023, for filing with the SEC and applicable Canadian securities regulators.\nThis report has been submitted by Dean Hollis, Diego Reynoso, Leslie Starr and Mahes S.

In order to ensure an appropriate level of director accountability to the\nCompany’s shareholders and that shareholders have an opportunity to engage with the Board about executive compensation\nmatters, the Company seeks an advisory, non-binding vote on an annual basis from shareholders on the Company’s executive\ncompensation practices in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the\nDodd-Frank Act. The next such advisory vote regarding compensation of NEOs will occur in connection with the 2025\nAnnual Meeting of Shareholders.\nResolution\nIn accordance with Company policy and Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking shareholders to indicate their\nsupport for the compensation of the NEOs. This proposal, commonly known as a “say-on-pay” proposal, gives shareholders\nthe opportunity to express their views on the NEOs’ compensation. Accordingly, we will ask shareholders to vote “FOR”\nthe following resolution at the Meeting.\n“RESOLVED, that the Company’s shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the NEOs, as disclosed\nin the Company’s Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure\nrules of the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and other related\ntables and narrative discussion under the Executive Compensation caption.”\nThe “say-on-pay” vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or the\nBoard. The Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of our shareholders and to the extent there is any\nsignificant vote against the NEO compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, we will consider our shareholders’\nconcerns and the Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns.\nRecommendation of the Board of Directors; Vote Required\nThe Board of Directors recommends that the shareholders vote FOR the advisory resolution regarding the\ncompensation of the Company’s NEOs.\nThis proposal will be approved if a quorum is present at the Meeting and the votes cast in favor of this proposal constitute a\nmajority of the total votes cast on this proposal. While this vote is required by law, it will neither be binding on the Company\nor the Board, nor will it create or imply any change in the fiduciary duties of, or impose any additional fiduciary duty on, the\nCompany or the Board. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists\nat the Meeting but will have no effect on the results of the vote. Brokers and other nominees will not have discretionary\nauthority to vote your shares if you hold your shares in street name and do not provide instructions as to how your shares\nshould be voted on this proposal.\n[Remainder of page left intentionally blank]\n36\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nREPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nDear Fellow Shareholder,\nWe are pleased to provide you with SunOpta’s Compensation Discussion and Analysis (“CD&A”) which is designed to help\nyou understand SunOpta’s approach to executive compensation.\nCompensation Decision Highlights\nSunOpta is a pioneer, fueling the future of sustainable, plant-based foods and beverages. We operate as a manufacturer for\nleading natural and private label brands and also produce our own propriety brands, including SOWN®, Dream® and West\nLife™. The core of our product portfolio is a range of plant-based beverages, including oat, almond, soy, coconut and rice\nmilks and creamers, which have a favorable climate profile relative to traditional dairy milks in terms of lower carbon\nemissions and water usage. Our plant-based offerings include non-genetically modified, organic, and gluten-free products.\nOur consumer products portfolio also includes protein shakes, teas, broths, and fruit snacks. In October 2023, we completed\nthe divestiture of our commodity-based frozen fruit business (\"Frozen Fruit\"), in order to focus on value-add products in\nplant-based and healthy snack categories.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed 1,174 full-time employees in North America. Our average employee has over four\nyears of service. In 2023, our voluntary turnover was 20% (down from 22% in 2022) across the Company. We continue to\nfocus on increasing employee retention by implementing retention programs and initiatives to increase employee engagement.\nEmployee health and safety is paramount to our success. In addition to our safety training and initiatives at our manufacturing\nfacilities, we track our Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) which ended the year at 1.02, compared to a goal of 1.3.\nWe want to inspire our employees through our culture. We expect our executives and employees to exhibit behaviors of\nspeed, entrepreneurship, customer-centricity, passion, dedication, and problem solving, while creating shareholder value and\ngrowing the business.\nTo align the executives with the objectives, values and business results of the Company, the Compensation Committee\ncontinues to emphasize the following principles for compensating executives:\n• To focus on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) as the key financial\nmeasure for short-term incentives; and\n• Provide long-term incentives that are significantly performance-based, emphasizing adjusted EBITDA growth and\nsustained long-term stock price increases.\nThe Compensation Committee believes that this strategy positions the Company to create shareholder value and align the\ninterests of shareholders and management. As a result of the financial performance delivered in fiscal year 2023:\n• Partial target payout was made under the 2023 Short-Term Incentive Plan (“STIP”), as the adjusted EBITDA was\nbetween the minimum threshold and the target for payout. The PSUs associated with the 2023 STIP vested on April\n1, 2024.\n• Performance for the relative TSR metric was calculated at the end of December 2023 for the 2021 Annual Long-\nTerm Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) PSUs. The threshold level of performance required for a payout was not met and\ntherefore none of the 2021 LTIP PSUs will vest as scheduled on April 15, 2024.\nIn connection with the divestiture of Frozen Fruit, the Compensation Committee approved a one-time special cash incentive\nbonus for each of Ms. Jill Barnett, CAO, and Mr. Scott Huckins, former CFO, in the amounts of $750,000 and $500,000,\nrespectively, for successful completion of the transaction. The Compensation Committee also approved a retention bonus of\n$500,000 for Ms. Barnett provided that she remains employed by the Company through June 30, 2024.\n37\nConclusion\nThe executive compensation programs are intended to drive shareholder value creation, emphasize pay for performance and\nprovide a framework to effectively attract and retain talent. As we implement these philosophies, we take the preferences and\nperspectives of our shareholders seriously. We welcome constructive dialogue regarding the opportunities available to the\nCompany and the executive compensation arrangements we institute to align with these opportunities.\nMore complete details of our compensation program and actions are provided in the remainder of this CD&A, specifically:\n Compensation Philosophy\n Elements of Compensation\n Other Aspects of the Compensation Program\n Compensation Tables\n Potential Payments on Termination or Change of Control and Tables\n CEO Pay Ratio\n Pay Versus Performance\nBased on that review and discussion, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that the\nCD&A be included in this Proxy Statement.\nThe Compensation Committee of SunOpta Inc.:\nRebecca Fisher – Chair\nDr. Albert Bolles\nDean Hollis\nKatrina Houde\nMahes Wickramasinghe\nSay on Pay Vote Recommendation\nWe believe that shareholder support for our compensation programs is warranted, for all the\nreasons described herein, and we ask for your vote in support.\nPrevious Say on Pay and Shareholder Engagement\nThe Board and Compensation Committee are committed to the concept of pay-for-performance. Consequently, our executive\ncompensation programs are designed to reward achievement and over-achievement of goals, and to penalize performance\nshortfalls. We have historically received positive support from our shareholders on our executive compensation programs\nand at the 2023 Annual and Special Meeting of the Shareholders, approximately 89% of the shares voted were in favor of the\nadvisory resolution to support executive compensation.\nCompensation Practices\nThe Compensation Committee utilizes best practices in governing our executive compensation programs. Therefore, there\nare certain things that we do and do not do, as a matter of practice:\nWhat we DO What we DO NOT do\n Tie executive pay to results achieved by weighting  Provide change-in-control severance\nvariable pay heavily in our pay mix payments exceeding market norms\n Use equity to drive a long-term perspective aligned with  Allow stock option repricing or\nshareholders discounted stock option granting\n Promote stock ownership with competitive stock  Offer change-in-control tax gross-ups\nownership guidelines under any circumstances\n38\n Consider shareholder perspectives in our program  Pay dividends or dividend equivalents\ndesigns on unearned or unvested performance\n Maintain a clawback policy which meets or exceeds shares\nregulatory requirements  Allow our executives or directors to\n Use double-trigger change in control provisions for all hedge or pledge Company stock\nnon-pro rata payouts under cash and equity incentive  Provide excessive perquisites\nplans\n Maintain a cap on our short-term and long-term incentive\npayouts\n Assess our pay-for-performance relationship and conduct\na compensation risk assessment annually\n Use a size- and industry-appropriate peer group to\nbenchmark and assess pay competitiveness annually\nCompensation Philosophy\nOur executive compensation philosophy and the policies that support it are intended to reward our executives for the\nachievement of long-term strategic goals and their efforts to enhance shareholder value. The philosophy fosters a\nperformance-oriented environment that rewards achievement of internal Company goals and shareholder value creation. Our\npay-for-performance philosophy is based on these objectives.\nCompensation opportunities provided to executives are intended to approximate market median pay levels, assuming the\ntargeted level of performance is delivered. Performance targets are generally set in relation to the Company’s internal budget\ngoals. Then, using the target as the starting point, upside and downside payout ranges around the target are developed. These\nranges provide additional compensation opportunity to executives if results exceed targets, while penalizing under-\nperformance. Through this design, our executive compensation program motivates our team, while delivering true ‘pay-for-\nperformance’ from a shareholder perspective.\nPeer Group\nIn order to help ensure the competitiveness of our executive compensation, the Compensation Committee considers\ncompetitive compensation practices from relevant sources. To do this, we review general market survey data as well as\ncomparisons from our executive compensation peer group. Our peer group is reviewed by the Compensation Committee on\nan annual basis.\nFor 2023, the peer group consisted of the following 14 companies:\n2023 Peer Group – 14 Companies\n B&G Foods, Inc.  Hain Celestial Group, Inc.  The Simply Good Foods Co\n BellRing Brands, Inc.  J&J Snack Foods Corp.  Treehouse Foods, Inc.\n Beyond Meat, Inc.  John B. Sanfilippo & Son  Utz Brands, Inc.\n Calavo Growers, Inc.  Lancaster Colony Corp  Vital Farms, Inc.\n Cal-Maine Foods, Inc.  Seneca Foods Corporation\nIn addition to market comparisons, compensation decisions are informed by other external and internal factors:\n• Overall Company Performance: Financial and operational performance informs compensation affordability.\n• Individual Contributions: Efforts by individuals that position the Company for long-term success.\n• Responsibilities: Any changes in an executive’s job responsibilities.\n• Internal Equity: Each role’s relative importance in delivering shareholder value.\nTo support the Compensation Committee in making its determinations, the Compensation Committee has retained the\nservices of Pearl Meyer as its independent executive compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee has reviewed\nand confirmed the independence of Pearl Meyer. Pearl Meyer provides services at the direction of the Compensation\nCommittee, and the Compensation Committee has specific authority in managing all work by Pearl Meyer.\n39\nElements of SunOpta’s Compensation Program\nTo meet our compensation philosophy, we provided the following compensation components in 2023:\nType of\nCompensation Element Purpose Key Features\nFIXED Base Salary  Fixed pay  Amounts reflect individual responsibility,\nperformance, experience, and other internal\nand external factors\n Reviewed annually by the Compensation\nCommittee\nVARIABLE STIP  Cash/Equity incentive to  Specific metrics are determined annually by\nreach or surpass annual the Compensation Committee\ngoals  Ties pay to performance\n STIP is denominated in cash or PSUs based\non employee grade level\nLTIP  Multi-year incentives to  PSUs only vest if the Company achieves\nreach or surpass longer- predefined performance hurdles for the three-\nterm goals year performance period, subject to\n Aligns with shareholder continued employment through the vesting\ninterests date\n Promotes ownership  Stock options only provide value on the stock\nmentality price growth over the option’s term and vest\nratably over three years (equal annual\ninstallments)\n RSUs vest ratably over three years (equal\nannual installments)\nOTHER Benefits and  Elements and levels  Generally, part of a broad-based set of\nPerquisites necessary to be employee benefit plans, with the exception of\ncompetitive the executive physical program recently\nadded\n Very limited use of additional perquisites\nPost-  Continuity of leadership,  Double-trigger provisions for cash change-in-\nEmployment bridge for individual in control severance in all agreements\nCompensation the event of involuntary  Double-trigger equity vesting in all\n(Severance and termination agreements\nChange-in-  Encourages assessment  Non-compete (if not prohibited by law) and\nControl) of potential transactions non-solicitation restrictions required in new\nwith focus on agreements\nshareholder interests\n[Remainder of page left intentionally blank]\n40\nIn 2023, target compensation was delivered primarily through variable pay (STIP and LTIP) for the CEO and the other\nNEO’s. As these charts illustrate, our compensation design is intended to deliver a significant portion of our senior executives’\ntotal target compensation in the form of pay-at-risk. The percentages represent the average annual compensation program.\nFor 2023, the following individuals were the Company’s Named Executive Officers (“NEOs”):\nExecutive Role\nJoseph Ennen Chief Executive Officer\nGreg Gaba Chief Financial Officer\nJill Barnett Chief Administrative Officer\nChris Whitehair Senior Vice President, Supply Chain\nChad Hagen Chief Customer Officer\nFormer SVP and General Manager of Plant-\nMichael Buick\nBased Foods and Beverages\nFormer Chief Financial Officer and General\nScott Huckins\nManager of Fruit-Based Foods and Beverages\nEffective October 9, 2023 and October 13, 2023, respectively, Michael Buick, Senior Vice President and General Manager\nof Plant-Based Foods and Beverages (“PBFB”) and Scott Huckins, CFO and General Manager of Fruit-Based Foods and\nBeverages (“FBFB”) left the Company. With their departures, we eliminated the position of General Manager and adopted a\ncentralized functional structure reporting directly to the CEO. Effective October 13, 2023, Greg Gaba, our former Vice\nPresident Corporate Finance and Deputy CFO, was appointed CFO of the Company.\nBase Salary\nFor fiscal year 2023, consistent with the compensation philosophy noted above, base salary levels for executive officers were\nset based on assessments of the Company’s performance, each individual’s performance, external market comparisons and\nother external and internal factors.\nThe amounts below are the base salary rates of the NEOs as of December 30, 2023.\nExecutive Base Salary Prior Base Salary\nJoseph Ennen $810,000 $780,000\nGreg Gaba(1) $420,000 $313,224\n41\nJill Barnett $436,000 $420,000\nChris Whitehair $435,000 $420,000\nChad Hagen $365,000 $350,000\n(1) Mr. Gaba’s prior base salary is converted from CAD to USD using the one-year average exchange rate for 2023 of $0.7408 CAD to $1\nUSD.\nShort-Term Incentive Plan\nThe purpose of the STIP is to establish alignment across the organization and recognize individuals’ impact on organizational\nperformance, focusing employees on desired behaviors which link to demonstrated results.\nFor fiscal 2023, the STIP aligned with the goal of accelerating EBITDA performance relative to the fiscal 2022, while\nmaintaining rigorous expectations for quality and safety. To focus on the achievement of these improvements, as well as\nmeasure individual performance, adjusted EBITDA and an individual component were the factors that determined an\nindividual’s bonus payout. The Compensation Committee believes that the use of adjusted EBITDA in the STIP heightens\nmanagement’s focus on implementing and delivering the operational improvements.\nEBITDA Individual\nTarget Bonus STIP\nPerformance Component\nOpportunity Payout\nOutcome Outcome\nIn 2023, there was one STIP covering all STIP eligible employees, which contained two components worth 50% each. The\ncompany component was dependent on the achievement of 2023 adjusted EBITDA and could range between 0-200%. The\nindividual component was based on an employee achieving their individual goals for 2023 and could range between 0-200%\nas determined by the employee’s annual review rating. No payout occurs on the individual component unless the company\ncomponent is met.\nEmployees eligible for STIP were allocated into one of two groups: a cash payout group or an equity payout group. The cash\npayout group included employees below manager level, and the equity payout group included employees at a manager level\nor above. Each participant in the equity payout group received a PSU grant valued at their STIP target, with the number of\nshares to vest being dependent on the individual’s overall payout percentage. The cash payout group’s STIP was to be paid\nout in cash, dependent on the results of adjusted EBITDA and the individual component. If, as a result of over performance\nby the Company, an employee’s bonus payout exceeded 100% of target, then an incremental cash bonus would be paid out\nto employees in either group. No additional performance shares would be granted if the payout exceeded 100% of target.\nThis structure is consistent with the desire to maintain pay and performance alignment.\nWith the divestiture of Frozen Fruit, the Compensation Committee approved revisions to the adjusted EBITDA targets\npreviously approved for the 2023 STIP to exclude the results of operations of Frozen Fruit for third and fourth fiscal quarters\nof 2023. The revised parameters established for the Company component of the STIP were as follows:\nThreshold Target Maximum\nMeasure (50% payout) 100% Payout (200% Payout)\nSunOpta Adjusted EBITDA(1) $ 77.3 million $91 million $116 million\n(1) SunOpta Adjusted EBITDA is measured as operating income plus depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and certain\nother adjustments that are considered one-time or unusual in nature, as calculated by the Company based on the Company’s audited\nfinancials and consistent with the Company’s calculation of adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial measure reported to its\nshareholders.\n42\nEach NEO had the following range of short-term incentive opportunities in 2023.\nThreshold Payout Target Payout Maximum Payout\nExecutive\n% of Salary % of Salary % of Salary\nJoseph Ennen 62.5% 125% 250%\nGreg Gaba(1) 30% 60% 120%\nJill Barnett 30% 60% 120%\nChris Whitehair 25% 50% 100%\nChad Hagen 25% 50% 100%\nScott Huckins 37.5% 75% 150%\nMichael Buick 30% 60% 120%\n(1) The Annual Target STIP percentage is Mr. Gaba’s current STIP target percentage. His annual award was prorated based upon his time\nin the CFO role.\nIf adjusted EBITDA performance was below threshold, there would be no payout. If performance was above maximum, the\npayout would be capped at the levels noted above. In 2023, adjusted EBITDA performance triggered a company component\npayout of 81.6%.\nThe below table represents the 2023 STIP payout determination for each NEO as the result of the company and individual\ncomponents:\nTotal Payout\nCompany Individual of Target Final Result\nComponent Component STIP (No. of STIP PSUs vesting)(1)\nExecutive Percentage Percentage Percentage\nJoseph Ennen 81.6% 81.6% 81.6% 81.6% STIP PSUs vest\nGreg Gaba 81.6% 81.6% 81.6% 81.6% STIP PSUs vest\nJill Barnett 81.6% 101.6% 91.6% 91.6% STIP PSUs vest\nChris Whitehair 81.6% 81.6% 81.6% 81.6% STIP PSUs vest\nChad Hagen 81.6% 81.6% 81.6% 81.6% STIP PSUs vest\nMichael Buick(2) - - - -\nScott Huckins(2) - - - -\n(1) 2023 STIP PSUs were granted to each NEO on June 19, 2023 and vested on April 1, 2024.\n(2) Mr. Buick and Mr. Huckins departed the Company in October 2023. All of their STIP PSUs were forfeited after their departure in\naccordance with the terms of the Company’s STIP.\nLong-Term Incentives\nIn fiscal year 2023, the LTIP was unchanged from the design in 2022. Similar to the 2022 LTIP, the 2023 LTIP is a one-year\nplan with a three-year performance period.\nSpecific details and design attributes of the 2023 plan are summarized below:\nPSUs:\n• Number of shares earned is determined based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance\nrelative to the identified Russell 3000 Food and Beverage companies (62 in total) as calculated below and the\nparticipant’s continued employment through the vesting date, which is April 15, 2026.\n43\nRelative TSR vs. Russell Food and\nBeverage\nPortion of PSUs\nPerformance Hurdle\nthat will vest\n≥ 90th Percentile 200%\n75th Percentile 125%\n50th Percentile 100%\n25th Percentile 25%\n< 25th Percentile 0%\n• Achievement of the performance hurdle is determined by calculating the TSR for the Company and each of the\ncompanies in the Russell 3000 Food and Beverage designated index using a 20-trading day average closing price as\nof December 31, 2025. The following parameters apply to the calculation: dividends and cash equivalent\ndistributions for a company is considered reinvested; any company that ceases trading prior to the calculation\ntimeframe is excluded from the beginning and ending calculation (e.g., acquired companies and financial distressed\ncompanies); and performance is interpolated between scale points (between threshold and target, target and 75th,\nand 75th and maximum).\n• Vesting of any achieved performance hurdle will occur on April 15, 2026.\nStock Options:\n• Vesting provisions are ratable over three years (in equal annual installments) with a term of ten years.\nRSUs:\n• Vesting provisions are ratable over three years (in equal annual installments).\nThe Compensation Committee believes the performance-based awards described above provide significant alignment\nbetween the interests of the Company’s shareholders and the executives because the PSUs will not vest without the\nachievement of the relative TSR performance hurdles, and stock options only provide value in the event of a stock price\nincrease. Additionally, the vesting provisions in all awards provide additional retention incentive to each of the executives.\nWith the exception of grants to Mr. Gaba, 2023 LTIP grants were issued at a reduced rate of the 2023 Annual Target LTIP\n(as a percentage of base salary) noted in the table below in order to balance the 2022 LTIP grants that were issued at an\naccelerated rate of 125% of the 2022 Annual Target LTIP such that the long-term value of the program over the two-year\nperiod averaged 100% of the executive’s target. The 2023 LTIP grants were divided between PSUs (50%), RSUs (25%) and\nstock options (25%), based on the 30-day average stock price as of July 10, 2023. Executives were given the choice to\nexchange their RSUs for stock options at a 3:1 ratio of options to RSUs. Mr. Huckins, Mr. Buick and Mr. Hagen elected to\nexchange 100% or 50% of their RSUs for options.\nAnnual Target LTIP LTIP Options LTIP PSUs LTIP RSUs\nExecutive\n(% of Salary) (# of Options) (Target # of Units) (# of units)\nJoseph Ennen 371% 143,810 165,199 82,600\nGreg Gaba(1) 85% 26,094 14,988 14,988\nJill Barnett 85% 18,654 21,429 10,715\nChris Whitehair 65% 14,717 16,906 8,453\nChad Hagen 65% 23,024 14,208 3,552\nMichael Buick 70% 39,232 16,550 0\nScott Huckins 140% 116,820 49,280 0\n44\n(1) The Annual Target LTIP percentage is Mr. Gaba’s current LTIP target percentage. For 2023, Mr. Gaba’s annual LTIP award was\ndivided between 1/3 PSUs, 1/3 RSUs and 1/3 Options, which is how we allocate annual LTIP awards at the Vice-President level, and\nprorated based upon his time in his prior role and the CFO role.\nMr. Gaba was granted a special one-time award of restricted stock units (the “CFO Special RSUs”) in an amount determined\nby dividing $300,000 by the closing price of the Company's common stock as reported on Nasdaq on the Effective Date. The\nSpecial RSUs were granted effective on the date of grant and are initially 100% unvested and subject to forfeiture. One-third\nof the Special RSUs vest on each of the first three (3) anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to Mr. Gaba's continued\nemployment with the Company.\nBased on the Company’s fiscal 2023 financial performance, the 2021 LTIP PSU metrics were not attained so all of the 2021\nLTIP PSUs scheduled to vest on April 15, 2024 were forfeited as of March 2024.\nCEO Succession and Equity Grants\nOn December 6, 2023, the Company announced the hiring of Brian Kocher as CEO, effective January 2, 2024, due to the\nplanned retirement of Joseph Ennen. In connection with Mr. Kocher’s hiring, the Board of Directors approved an inducement\nequity award to Mr. Kocher, which included 144,404 RSUs (“CEO Special RSUs”), 74,000 RSUs reflecting the number of\nCommon Shares purchased by Mr. Kocher in the open market during the 75 calendar days following commencement of Mr.\nKocher’s employment (“CEO Matching RSUs\"), 230,804 stock options (“CEO Special Stock Options”) and 288,808 PSUs at\ntarget (“CEO Special PSUs”). The CEO Special RSUs, CEO Matching RSUs, and CEO Special Stock Options vest in three\nequal annual installments beginning January 2, 2025, subject to Mr. Kocher’s continued employment with the Company\nthrough the applicable vesting date. The vesting of the CEO Special PSUs is based on the Company’s TSR performance\nrelative to the identified Russell 3000 Food and Beverage companies as calculated in the Long-Term Incentives section above\nand Mr. Kocher’s continued employment through the vesting date, which is April 15, 2027.\nInducement Options Inducement PSUs\nExecutive Inducement RSUs (# of Units)\n(# of Options) (Target # of Units)\nBrian Kocher 230,804 288,808 144,404\nAs part of the succession plan, on December 4, 2023, the Board of the Company accepted the resignation of Mr. Ennen as\nCEO and Director of the Company effective January 2, 2024, in connection with Mr. Ennen’s planned retirement. Between\nJanuary 2, 2024 and April 1, 2024, Mr. Ennen served as Advisor to the Company, reporting to Dean Hollis, Chair of the\nBoard, to provide transition services to facilitate an orderly transfer of the CEO role. In connection with Mr. Ennen’s role as\nAdvisor, Mr. Ennen entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to his employment agreement providing, among other\nthings, that certain unvested RSUs and stock options granted to Mr. Ennen as part of the Company’s Amended 2013 Stock\nIncentive Plan would accelerate and immediately vest on April 1, 2024, and certain unvested PSUs may continue to vest as\nspecified in the Amendment. In addition, Mr. Ennen is eligible to participate in the Company’s 2024 STIP on a prorated\nbasis.\nOther Compensation\nOur executive officers are eligible to receive the same types of benefits that we make available to other employees, including:\n• Group health benefits, which includes medical, dental, vision and prescription drug coverage, group life insurance\nand short-term and long-term disability plans; and\n• Retirement benefits in the form of a 401(k) plan for U.S. employees and a Registered Retirement Savings Plan match\nfor Canadian employees.\nIn recent years, we have substantially reduced the scope of perquisites for executives, such as the phasing out of automobile\nallowances at the executive levels. At this time, only one of our NEOs, Mr. Hagen, has an automobile allowance. In 2021,\nthe Company enrolled in the Executive Health Program at Mayo Clinic for use by its executive officers. The Company agreed\nto pay up to $5,000 for out-of-pockets costs incurred for any executive participating in this program. For additional\ninformation regarding other compensation during 2023, see the “All Other Compensation” column in the Summary\nCompensation Table which follows.\n45\nWe have entered into employment or other agreements with our NEOs, most of which provide for certain benefits upon a\nchange of control of the Company or upon a termination of employment by the Company without cause. These arrangements\nare intended to meet both business and human resources needs, encouraging the executives to weigh potential transitions\nbased on shareholder interests, rather than personal ones, and to provide a measure of security to executives in the event of\nactual or potential change in corporate ownership/control. The potential benefits received by the NEOs in connection with a\nchange-in-control or termination of employment under certain circumstances below under “Estimated Potential Payments\nupon Termination of Employment”.\nOther Aspects of the Compensation Program\nStock Ownership Guidelines\nWe expect our senior executives to maintain substantial ownership of SunOpta stock:\nCategory Ownership Guideline\nCEO 5x base salary\nOther NEOs 2x base salary\nOther Senior Leadership Team Members 1x base salary\nIndependent Directors 5x annual cash retainer\nWe believe this creates important alignment with shareholders. Executive participants have five years to comply with these\nguidelines. If, at the end of five years, the CEO or other NEOs and members of the Senior Leadership Team are not in\ncompliance, 50% of all short-term incentive payouts are provided in equity rather than cash until the guideline is achieved.\nAssessment of Risk\nThe Compensation Committee conducts an annual review of risk associated with the compensation programs. The 2023\nreview found the programs to be within acceptable parameters.\nClawback Policy\nIf material non-compliance with any financial reporting requirement leads to an accounting restatement, the Company has\nauthority, in accordance with the Company’s standalone Clawback Policy, to recover from current and former executives any\nincentive-based pay, including cash or equity awards, which would not have been awarded based on the restated financials.\nThis authority extends to the three years preceding the restatement.\nCompensation of Named Executive Officers\nSummary Compensation Table\nNon-Equity\nName and Option Incentive Plan All Other\nPrincipal Salary Bonus Stock Awards Awards Compensation Compensation\nPosition Year ($)(1) ($)(2) ($)(3) ($)(4) ($)(5) ($)(6) Total ($)\n2023 803,077 0 2,519,186 561,431 0 19,180 3,902,874\nJoseph Ennen,\nChief\n2022 770,769 1,250 3,363,269 3,543,980 105,981 16,148 7,801,397\nExecutive\nOfficer\n2021 743,308 0 1,582,653 0 0 16,409 2,342,370\nGreg Gaba,\nChief\n2023 293,310 100,022 608,600 92,700 0 13,731 1,108,363\nFinancial\nOfficer\n2023 432,308 750,000 434,705 72,825 0 14,038 1,703,876\nJill Barnett,\nChief\n2022 414,615 1,250 518,616 372,108 27,365 14,188 1,348,142\nAdministrative\nOfficer\n2021 397,000 0 669,933 135,798 0 12,118 1,214,849\nChris 2023 431,539 0 352,571 57,455 0 15,349 856,914\nWhitehair,\n46\nSVP Supply 2022 416,769 1,250 507,787 52,416 22,922 16,244 1,017,388\nChain\n2021 405,358 0 369,431 136,164 0 14,616 925,569\nChad Hagen,\nChief\n2023 361,538 0 272,471 89,885 0 27,199 751,093\nCustomer\nOfficer\n2023 325,558 0 328,381 153,161 0 119,068 926,168\nMichael\nBuick, Former\n2022 408,769 1,250 498,518 340,694 0 11,299 1,260,530\nSVP and GM,\nPBFB\n2021 396,539 0 464,503 186,914 0 13,631 1,061,587\nScott Huckins, 2023 475,192 500,000 722,182 456,063 0 55,170 2,208,607\nFormer Chief\nFinancial 2022 580,962 1,250 1,052,396 863,836 47,929 15,291 2,561,664\nOfficer and\nGM, FBFB 2021 565,385 0 1,077,467 0 0 14,616 1,657,468\n(1) Mr. Gaba’s salary is converted from CAD to USD using the one-year average exchange rate for 2023 of $0.7408 CAD to $1\nUSD.\n(2) Consists of a $1,250 special bonus paid to all SunOpta employees in May 2022.

RSUs vest one-third per year over three years. The market value of the RSUs is based on the\n$5.47 closing market price of the Common Shares on the last trading day of 2023.\n(3) Awards made in 2021 were 2021 LTIP, in 2022 were 2022 LTIP, and in 2023 were for 2023 STIP and 2023 LTIP. For 2021\nthrough 2023 LTIP PSUs, the number of PSUs that may vest is determined based on the Company’s TSR performance and the\nparticipant’s continued employment through the applicable vesting dates, which are April 15, 2024, May 5, 2025, and April 15,\n2026, respectively. The number of shares shown in the above table related to these PSUs is based on the number of Common\nShares that would be issued at the end of the performance period at the target level of performance, subject to the NEO’s continued\nemployment. For additional information on the performance hurdles for LTIP, see “―Compensation Discussion and\nAnalysis―Long Term Incentives.” The 2023 STIP PSUs were granted to all NEOs on June 19, 2023. The market value of the\nPSUs is based on the $5.47 closing market price of the Common Shares on the last trading day of 2023.\n(4) Mr. Buick and Mr. Huckins departed the Company in October 2023, and therefore any outstanding and unvested or unexercised\nequity was forfeited after their departure in accordance with the terms of the Company’s stock incentive plan.\n[Remainder of page left intentionally blank]\n51\nOption Exercises and Stock Vested During Fiscal 2023\nThe following table details certain information concerning stock options exercised by the NEOs and stock awards that\nvested during the fiscal year 2023.\nOption Exercises and Stock Vested\nOption Awards(1) Stock Awards(2)\nNumber of Shares Value Realized on Number of Shares Value Realized on\nAcquired on Exercise Exercise Acquired on Vesting Vesting\nName (#) ($) (#) ($)\nJoseph Ennen - - 792,871 6,370,677\nGreg Gaba - - 19,609 150,534\nJill Barnett - - 81,289 635,684\nChris Whitehair - - 53,267 415,405\nChad Hagen - - 59,833 427,922\nMichael Buick - - 74,337 573,005\nScott Huckins 262,182 572,571 213,368 1,699,946\n(1) The number of shares acquired upon exercise reflects the gross number of shares acquired absent any netting for shares\nsurrendered to pay the option exercise price and/or satisfy tax withholding requirements. The value realized on exercise\nrepresents the gross number of shares acquired on exercise multiplied by the market price of our Common Shares on the exercise\ndate, less the per share exercise price.\n(2) The number of shares acquired upon vesting reflects the gross number of shares acquired absent any netting of shares surrendered\nto satisfy tax withholding requirements. The value realized is based on the market value of the underlying Common Shares on\nthe vesting date and reflects the gross value realized prior to taxes and withholding.\nPotential Payments on Termination or Change of Control\nThe Company’s Amended 2013 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) provides that, in the event of a merger, consolidation or\nplan of exchange involving the Company pursuant to which outstanding shares are converted into cash or other stock,\nsecurities or property, or a sale, lease or exchange or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, the\nCompany’s Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, provide that outstanding awards under the Plan shall be treated in\naccordance with any of the following alternatives: (i) the outstanding award may be converted into a similar award based on\nthe stock of the surviving or acquiring company, taking into account the relative values of the companies involved in the\ntransaction; (ii) the outstanding award may be cancelled by the Company and the holder would receive cash in an amount\nequal to the value of the award, as determined by the Company’s Board of Directors; or (iii) the outstanding award may\nbecome fully exercisable and the Company’s Board of Directors would provide an arrangement pursuant to which the holder\nwould have a reasonable opportunity to exercise any award or otherwise realize the value of the award.\nWe have entered into employment or other agreements with our current NEOs and we have a SunOpta Foods Inc. Severance\nPay Plan (effective October 1, 2016, amended January 1, 2020 and further amended August 1, 2021), which provide for\ncertain benefits upon a change of control of the Company or upon a termination of employment by the Company without\ncause or by the NEO with good reason, all as provided in the applicable agreement. Employment agreements entered into\nwith NEOs and other executive officers of the Company generally provide for accelerated vesting of awards only if the\nexecutive’s employment is terminated under specified circumstances within a specified period before or following a change\nof control (so-called “double-trigger” provisions). The definition of “change of control” varies among the agreements and\ngenerally includes (i) the acquisition of stock representing a majority of the voting power of the Company’s stock; (ii) at any\ntime during a period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the Board\n(“Incumbent Directors”) shall cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof; provided, however, that the term\n“Incumbent Director” shall also include each new director elected during such two-year period whose nomination or election\nwas approved by two-thirds of the Incumbent Directors then in office; (iii) any consolidation, merger or plan of exchange\ninvolving the Company as a result of which the holders of outstanding stock of the Company immediately prior to the\ntransaction do not continue to hold at least 50% of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the\n52\nsurviving corporation or a parent corporation of the surviving corporation immediately after the transaction; and (iv) the sale\nof all or substantially all of the assets of the Company. The definition of “cause” varies among the agreements.\nThe benefits to be received by the NEOs employed at the end of the fiscal year under the terms of their applicable employment\nor other agreements in connection with a change of control or upon termination of employment under certain circumstances\nare summarized as follows:\nJoseph Ennen\nTermination without cause or by executive for good reason: In the event Mr. Ennen’s employment is terminated by the\nCompany without cause or by Mr. Ennen for good reason he will be entitled to receive (i) any accrued but unpaid base salary\nand unpaid annual bonuses from prior years; (ii) a lump sum payment of up to two times his then-current base salary, plus,\nhis target bonus for the current year.\nTermination of employment following a Change of Control: In the event Mr. Ennen’s employment is terminated by the\nCompany without cause or by Mr. Ennen for good reason within 12 months following a change of control of the Company\nor, under certain circumstances, within a two-month period prior to such transaction, Mr. Ennen shall be entitled to the same\nbenefits as in the event of termination without cause or by executive for good. In the event of a change of control (as defined\nin the Employment Agreement), unvested PSUs as of the date of the change of control will be interpolated as described in\nthe Employment Agreement. If any of the payments or benefits received by Mr. Ennen in connection with a change of control\nresult in a 280G excise tax, within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, then the Company’s payments\nto Mr. Ennen will potentially be reduced if such reduction will result in a greater net benefit to Mr. Ennen.\nTermination Due to Qualifying Retirement: If Mr. Ennen’s employment with the Company terminates as a result of his\nretirement after (i) his 55th birthday and (ii) being continuously employed by the Company for five years, then any unvested\n2022 LTIP options that would otherwise vest during the 12-month period following termination shall immediately vest upon\nsuch termination. With respect to 2022 LTIP PSUs, if Mr. Ennen’s employment with the Company terminates as a result of\nhis retirement after (i) his 55th birthday, (ii) being continuously employed by the Company for five years and (iii) the one-\nyear anniversary of the award date, then on the vesting date, to the extent the performance hurdle has been achieved, a number\nof PSUs shall vest equal to the number of PSUs that would have vested had Mr. Ennen been continuously employed by the\nCompany through the vesting date based on achievement of the performance hurdle, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator\nof which is the number of days elapsed from the award date to and including the date of termination, and the denominator of\nwhich is 1096, rounded down to the nearest whole share.\nGreg Gaba\nTermination without cause: In the event Mr. Gaba’s employment is terminated by the Company without cause he will be\nentitled to receive (i) any accrued but unpaid base salary and unpaid annual bonuses from prior years; (ii) a lump sum payment\nof up to one times his then-current base salary, plus, his target bonus for the current year; and (iii) the immediate vesting of\nany granted and unvested CFO Special RSUs.\nTermination of employment following a Change of Control: In the event Mr. Gaba’s employment is terminated by the\nCompany without cause within 12 months following a change of control of the Company or, under certain circumstances,\nwithin a two month period prior to such transaction, Mr. Gaba shall be entitled to the same benefits as in the event of\ntermination without cause except that the lump sum payment will be one and a half times (instead of one times). If any of the\npayments or benefits received by Mr. Gaba in connection with a change of control result in a 280G excise tax, within the\nmeaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, then the Company’s payments to Mr. Gaba will potentially be\nreduced if such reduction will result in a greater net benefit to Mr. Gaba.\nTermination of employment in the event of death or disability: Upon a termination of Mr. Gaba’s employment due to death\nor disability, all of Mr. Gaba’s unvested CFO Special RSUs will immediately vest.\nOther NEOs\nChange of Control and Termination Following a Change of Control: Upon a change of control, all of the NEO’s unvested\noptions and RSUs shall immediately vest if a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan) occurs and at any time within 12\nmonths after the Change in Control, (a) their employment is terminated by the Company (or its successor) without Cause (as\n53\ndefined in the Plan), or (b) their employment is terminated by her for Good Reason (as defined in the Plan), provided that\nthey execute and deliver a release of claims. In addition, upon a termination of the NEO’s employment within 12 months\nfollowing a change of control without cause or for good reason, the NEO will receive severance as described under\nTermination by the Company without Cause below except that the severance payment shall be a lump sum payment of up to\none and a half times their then-current base salary, plus, their target bonus for the current year.\nTermination by the Company without Cause: Upon a termination of the NEO’s employment without cause, the NEO is entitled\nto benefits under the SunOpta Foods, Inc. Severance Pay Plan and will receive a severance payment equal to a multiple of\nthe NEO’s weekly base pay, where such multiple is determined as two weeks per year with a minimum and maximum of 39\nand 52 weeks, respectively. In addition, the Company will pay, for a period of up to 12 months, the cost of medical insurance\ncoverage for the NEO and their dependents.\nEstimated Potential Payments upon Termination of Employment\nBased on the applicable agreements with the NEOs described above, the following table sets forth the estimated benefits that\nwould have been payable to the NEOs if a change of control had occurred and each NEO’s employment was terminated on\nthe last day of the Company’s 2023 fiscal year under circumstances specified in the applicable agreements:\nPotential Payments Upon Termination – Change of Control\nLump Sum Accelerated Accelerated Accelerated\nSeverance Continuation Vesting of Vesting of Vesting of\nPayment of Benefits RSUs Stock Options PSUs Total\nName ($) ($) ($)(1) ($)(2) ($)(3) ($)\nJoe Ennen 3,645,000 20,181 375,056 0 1,076,440 5,116,677\nGreg Gaba 1,008,000 6,536 563,645 0 75,120 1,653,301\nJill Barnett 1,046,400 20,181 80,288 0 195,170 1,342,039\nChris Whitehair 978,750 16,466 114,487 0 153,172 1,262,875\nChad Hagen 821,250 20,181 128,829 0 127,644 1,097,904\n(1) These amounts represent the value of unvested RSUs that would vest in the event of a termination of employment following a\nchange of control, assuming a stock price of $5.47 per share, which was the closing price on December 30, 2022, the last trading\nday of the year.\n(2) These amounts represent the value of unvested stock options that would vest in the event of a termination of employment\nfollowing a change of control. The closing stock price on December 30, 2023 was $5.47.

Mr. Ennen’s compensation includes annualized base salary, bonuses, stock\nawards and other ancillary benefits.\n• The annual total compensation of our median employee (other than Mr. Ennen) was $68,277. This calculation is\nbased on 2023 data utilizing the methodology below.\n• The ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Ennen to the annual total compensation of the median of our\nemployees was 57 to 1.\nIn estimating the ratio set forth above, we used the following methodology:\n• As of December 30, 2023, we had 1,174 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees globally, consisting of 1,080\nemployees in the U.S. and 94 employees in Canada. This population was used to determine the identity of our median\nemployee. We recalculated median employee for 2023 since there was a significant change in our employee\npopulation following the divestiture of Frozen Fruit that had a meaningful impact on our disclosure.\nTo identify the median employee from this employee population, we first calculated each U.S. employee's W-2 (and\nequivalent income for each Canadian employee) to identify the median employee. We then calculated the median employee’s\ncompensation on the same basis as that of our CEO.\n[Remainder of page left intentionally blank]\n56\nPay Versus Performance\nAs required by Section 953(a) of the Dodd‐Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(v) of\nRegulation S‐K, we are providing the following information about the relationship between executive compensation actually\npaid and certain financial performance of the Company.\nPay Versus Performance Table\nYear-end value of $100\ninvested on 12/28/19 in:\nAverage Average\nSummary Compen-\nSummary Compen- Compen- sation Compen-\nCompen- sation sation Table Actually sation\nsation Table Actually Total for Paid to Non- Bench- Net Income Adj.\nTotal for Paid to CEO Non-CEO CEO NEOs marking Peer (Loss) (5) EBITDA (5)\nCEO (1)(2) NEOs (1)(2)(3) STKL Group (3)(4) (in millions) (in millions)\nYear $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $\n2023 3,902,874 (2,637,013) 1,259,170 184,819 219.68 97.67 (21.9) 78.5\n2022 7,801,397 10,877,055 1,546,931 2,474,398 338.96 87.14 (4.8) 83.7\n2021 2,342,370 (3,036,263) 1,214,868 89,154 279.12 105.84 (1.2) 60.6\n2020 2,679,692 33,746,240 1,396,512 4,841,175 468.67 117.09 82.4 58.7\n(1) Deductions from, and additions to, total compensation in the Summary Compensation Table by year to calculate\nCompensation Actually Paid include:\n2023 2022 2021 2020\nJoseph Ennen $ $ $ $\nTotal Compensation from Summary Compensation Table 3,902,874 7,801,397 2,342,370 2,679,692\nAdjustments for Equity Awards\nAdjustment for grant date values in the Summary Compensation Table (3,080,617) (6,907,249) (1,582,653) (874,998)\nYear-end fair value of unvested awards granted in the current year 1,462,402 10,816,607 280,412 3,733,536\nYear-over-year difference of year-end fair values for unvested awards granted in\nprior years (3,206,878) 926,983 (7,844,369) 24,110,031\nFair values at vest date for awards granted and vested in current year - - - -\nDifference in fair values between prior year-end fair values and vest date fair values\nfor awards granted in prior years (461,057) (1,760,683) 3,767,977 4,097,979\nForfeitures during current year equal to prior year-end fair value (1,253,737) - - -\nDividends or dividend equivalents not otherwise included in total compensation - - - -\nTotal Adjustments for Equity Awards (6,539,887) 3,075,658 (5,378,633) 31,066,548\nCompensation Actually Paid (as calculated) (2,637,013) 10,877,055 (3,036,263) 33,746,240\n2023 2022 2021 2020\nAverage Non-CEO NEOs $ $ $ $\nTotal Compensation from Summary Compensation Table 1,259,170 1,546,931 1,214,868 1,396,512\nAdjustments for Equity Awards\nAdjustment for grant date values in the Summary Compensation Table (606,833) (1,051,593) (760,053) (571,054)\nYear-end fair value of unvested awards granted in the current year 288,415 1,612,152 171,193 1,989,110\nYear-over-year difference of year-end fair values for unvested awards granted in\nprior years (200,316) 117,132 (831,535) 1,696,965\nFair values at vest date for awards granted and vested in current year - - - -\nDifference in fair values between prior year-end fair values and vest date fair values\nfor awards granted in prior years (103,621) 249,776 294,681 329,642\nForfeitures during current year equal to prior year-end fair value (451,996) - - -\nDividends or dividend equivalents not otherwise included in total compensation - - - -\nTotal Adjustments for Equity Awards (1,074,351) 927,467 (1,125,714) 3,444,663\nCompensation Actually Paid (as calculated) 184,819 2,474,398 89,154 4,841,175\n57\n(2) Compensation Actually Paid for 2022, 2021, and 2020 as reflected in last year’s disclosure have been adjusted to\nincorporate changes in valuation assumptions used.

The 2013 Incentive Plan was subsequently\namended on several occasions. Most recently, in May 2023, shareholders approved an amendment to the 2013 Stock Incentive\nPlan (as so amended, the “Amended 2013 Plan”) which increased the maximum number of Common Shares that may be\nissued under the Amended 2103 Plan to 15,800,000 Common Shares. However, if the outstanding Common Shares are\nincreased or decreased or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the Company by reason of\nany stock split or certain other events, appropriate adjustment will be made in the number and kind of shares available for\ngrants under the Amended 2013 Plan.\nThe Amended 2013 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Committee”). The Committee\nmay promulgate rules and regulations for the operation of the Amended 2013 Plan and related agreements and generally\nsupervises the administration of the Amended 2013 Plan. The Committee determines the individuals to whom awards are\nmade under the Amended 2013 Plan, the type of awards, the amount of the awards and the other terms and conditions of the\nawards. The Committee may also accelerate any exercise date, waive or modify any restriction with respect to an award or\nextend any exercise period, subject to the terms of the Amended 2013 Plan.\nThe Amended 2013 Plan permits the Committee to grant a variety of awards, including stock options, stock appreciation\nrights (“SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance-based awards (“PSUs”). All natural persons\nwho are employees, officers, directors, or consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible for participation in the\nAmended 2013 Plan. Of the 15,800,000 Common Shares reserved for issuance under the Amended 2013 Plan, only\n13,550,000 Common Shares may be awarded as Full Value Awards. “Full Value Awards” are stock awards for which the\nrecipient pays no cash consideration or cash consideration of less than the fair market value of the underlying shares as of the\ngrant date (as determined in accordance with the Amended 2013 Plan), except that shares issued in lieu of cash compensation\notherwise payable to a participant are not Full Value Awards.\nFor purposes of determining the exercise price of options or the value of SARs granted under the Amended 2013 Plan, the\nfair market value of the Common Shares is deemed to be the closing price of the Common Shares as reported by NASDAQ,\nor such other reported value of the Common Shares as specified by the Committee, on the date of grant in the case of options\nor the exercise date in the case of SARs.\nSubject to certain exceptions, no award granted under the Amended 2013 Plan shall become vested if the recipient does not\nremain in the service of the Company until the first anniversary of the date of grant. Furthermore, no award granted under the\nAmended 2013 Plan after March 1, 2017 shall provide for any excuse from satisfaction of the continued service conditions\nof the award as a result of a Change in Control of the Company, except that an award agreement may excuse the recipient\nfrom the continued service obligation if:\ni. the recipient’s employment or service relationship is terminated by the employer or the Company without\ncause or by the recipient for good reason in connection with the Change in Control under terms specified in the award\nagreement; or\nii. the award is not converted into an award for stock of the surviving or acquiring corporation in the Change\nin Control transaction under terms specified in the award agreement or pursuant to the Amended 2013 Plan, unless in the case\nof performance-based awards, they are settled or accelerated in accordance with specified requirements.\nA Change in Control is generally defined in the Amended 2013 Plan to include (i) any merger in which the holders of\nCommon Shares immediately prior to the merger do not continue to hold at least 50% of the voting power of outstanding\nsecurities of the surviving corporation or its parent corporation immediately after the merger, (ii) any sale of all or\nsubstantially all of the assets of the Company, (iii) at any time during a period of two consecutive years, individuals who at\nthe beginning of such period constituted the Board cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof; or (iv) any\nperson (other than the Company or any employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company), as a result of a tender or exchange\noffer, open market purchases or privately negotiated purchases from anyone other than the Company, has become the\nbeneficial owner of 50% or more of the outstanding Common Shares.\n61\nThe Committee may make awards under the Amended 2013 Plan that have terms and conditions that vary from those specified\nin the Amended 2013 Plan when such awards are granted in substitution for, or in connection with the assumption of, existing\nawards made by another corporation and assumed or otherwise agreed to be provided for by the Company in connection with\na corporate merger or other similar transaction to which the Company or an affiliated Company is a party.\nIn the event of a merger, consolidation or plan of exchange involving the Company pursuant to which outstanding shares are\nconverted into cash or other stock, securities or property, or a sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a\nseries of related transactions) of all, or substantially all, the assets of the Company, the Board, may, in its sole discretion,\nprovide that outstanding awards under the Plan shall be treated in accordance with any of the alternatives set forth in the\nAmended 2013 Plan.\nThe total compensation paid or granted by the Company in any form (including cash and awards under the Amended 2013\nPlan) to any non-employee director for service as a director for any fiscal year shall not exceed $500,000. For this purpose,\nawards under the Amended 2013 Plan will be valued at the time of grant based on the grant date fair value as determined by\nthe Company for financial accounting purposes.\nThe Amended 2013 Plan will continue until all Common Shares available for issuance under the Amended 2013 Plan have\nbeen issued and all restrictions on such shares have lapsed. However, the Board has the power to suspend, terminate, modify\nor amend the Amended 2013 Plan at any time, except that shareholder approval is required to add additional shares to the\nAmended 2013 Plan, increase the number of shares that can be issued as Full Value Awards or amend the provision\nprohibiting option re-pricing.\nTypes of Awards\nStock Options. The Committee may grant stock options to eligible individuals under the Amended 2013 Plan for varying\nperiods established at the time of grant. No employee or consultant may be granted options or stock appreciation rights for\nmore than an aggregate of 1,500,000 Common Shares in any fiscal year. The exercise price of each option may not be less\nthan 100% of the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant, except that if the stock option is intended to\nmeet all of the requirements of an “Incentive Stock Option” as defined in Section 422 of the U.S. Code and the grantee owns\nstock possessing more than 10% of the combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company, the exercise price may\nnot be less than 110% of the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. No monetary consideration is\npaid to the Company upon the granting of options.\nIncentive Stock Options are non-transferable except in the event of the death of the holder. The Committee has discretion to\nallow non-statutory stock options to be transferred to immediate family members of the optionee, subject to certain\nlimitations. Options are evidenced by and are exercisable in accordance with the terms of an option agreement entered into\nat the time of the grant. In the event of the death or other termination of an optionee’s employment with the Company, unless\notherwise determined by the Committee, the optionee’s options may be exercised for specified periods thereafter (12 months\nin the case of termination by reason of death or disability and 30 days in the case of termination for any other reason). Upon\nany termination of employment, the Committee may extend the exercise period for any period up to the expiration date of the\noption and may increase the portion of the option that is exercisable.\nWith the consent of the Committee, an optionee may request the Company to withhold shares from the exercise to cover\nrequired tax withholding or to satisfy the exercise price. Upon the exercise of an option, the number of shares available for\nissuance under the Amended 2013 Plan will be reduced by the number of shares issued upon exercise of the option plus the\nnumber of shares, if any, withheld upon exercise to satisfy the exercise price or required tax withholding. Option shares that\nare not purchased prior to the expiration, termination or cancellation of the related option will become available for future\nawards under the Amended 2013 Plan.\nUnless shareholder approval is obtained, no stock option may be (i) amended to reduce the exercise price, or (ii) canceled in\nexchange for cash, another award or any other consideration at a time when the exercise price of the option exceeds the fair\nmarket value of the Common Shares.\nStock Appreciation Rights. The Committee may grant SARs to eligible individuals under the Amended 2013 Plan. A SAR\ngives the holder the right to payment from the Company of an amount equal in value to the excess of the fair market value\non the date of exercise of one common share over its fair market value on the date of grant (or, if granted in connection with\nan option, the exercise price per share under the option to which the SAR relates), multiplied by the number of shares covered\n62\nby the portion of the SAR or option that is surrendered. A SAR holder will not pay the Company any cash consideration upon\neither the grant or exercise of a SAR, except for tax withholding amounts upon exercise.\nA SAR is exercisable only at the time or times established by the Committee. If a SAR is granted in connection with an\noption, it is exercisable only to the extent and on the same conditions that the related option is exercisable. Payment by the\nCompany upon exercise of a SAR may be made in Common Shares valued at fair market value, or in cash, or partly in stock\nand partly in cash, as determined by the Committee. Upon the exercise of a SAR for shares, the number of shares reserved\nfor issuance under the Plan will be reduced by the number of shares covered by the SAR. Cash payments for SARs will not\nreduce the number of shares available for awards under the Amended 2013 Plan. If a SAR is not exercised prior to the\nexpiration, termination or cancellation of the SAR, the unissued shares subject to the SAR will become available for future\nawards under the Amended 2013 Plan.\nStock Awards, including Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units. The Committee may grant Common Shares to eligible\nindividuals as stock awards (including restricted stock and RSUs) under the Amended 2013 Plan. Generally, no cash\nconsideration (other than required tax withholding) will be paid by award recipients to the Company in connection with stock\nawards. Stock awards shall be subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions determined by the Committee including with\nrespect to transferability and forfeiture of the shares issued. Stock awards subject to restrictions may be either restricted stock\nawards under which shares are issued immediately upon grant subject to forfeiture if vesting conditions are not satisfied, or\nRSUs under which shares are not issued until after vesting conditions are satisfied. Upon the issuance of shares under a stock\naward after March 1, 2017, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan will be reduced by the number of shares\nissued plus any shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations.\nPerformance-Based Awards. The Committee may grant PSUs, payable in stock or cash as determined by the Committee. All\nor part of the Common Shares subject to the awards will be earned (or cash will be paid) if performance targets established\nby the Committee for the period covered by the award are met and the recipient satisfies any other requirements established\nby the Committee. The performance targets may be expressed as one or more targeted levels of performance with respect to\none or more of the following objective measures with respect to the Company or any subsidiary, division or other unit of the\nCompany: earnings, earnings per share, stock price increase, total shareholder return (stock price increase plus dividends),\nreturn on equity, return on assets, return on capital, economic value added, revenues, operating income, inventories, inventory\nturns, cash flows, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\n(EBITDA) or any of the foregoing before the effect of acquisitions, divestitures, accounting changes, restructuring or other\nspecial charges. PSUs may be made as awards of restricted shares subject to forfeiture if performance goals are not satisfied,\nawards under which shares are not issued until the performance conditions are satisfied or as cash-based awards. No recipient\nmay be granted in any fiscal year PSUs under which the maximum number of shares that may be issued exceeds 500,000\nshares or the maximum dollar amount that may be paid exceeds $5,000,000. Upon the issuance of shares under a PSU after\nMarch 1, 2017, the number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under the Amended 2013 Plan will be reduced by the\nnumber of shares issued plus any shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations. The payment of PSUs in cash will\nnot reduce the number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under the Amended 2013 Plan. The number of shares issued\npursuant to stock awards and performance-based awards that are forfeited to the Company will become available for future\ngrants under the Amended 2013 Plan.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nPursuant to the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), a total of 3,000,000 Common Shares have been\nreserved for the grant of options under the ESPP, subject to adjustment upon changes in capitalization of the Company. The\npurpose of the ESPP is to provide employees of the Company and its designated subsidiaries with an opportunity to purchase\nCommon Shares. It is the intention of the Company to have the ESPP qualify as an \"Employee Stock Purchase Plan\" under\nSection 423 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The ESPP will continue in effect\nuntil June 30, 2025, unless sooner terminated by the Board.\nAny person who has been continuously employed as an employee for 30 days and works at least 20 hours per week (each an\n“Employee”) is eligible to participate, subject to the requirements and limitations of the ESPP. No Employee may be granted\nan option under the ESPP (i) if, immediately after the grant, such Employee (or any other person whose Common Shares\nwould be attributed to such Employee pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code) would own Common Shares and/or hold\noutstanding options to purchase Common Shares possessing five percent or more of the total combined voting power or value\nof all classes of shares of the Company or of any subsidiary of the Company, or (ii) which permits his or her rights to purchase\nstock under all employee stock purchase plans (described in Section 423 of the Code) of the Company and its subsidiaries to\n63\naccrue at a rate which exceeds USD $25,000 or the Canadian equivalent based on the exchange rate on the previous December\n31 (determined at the time such option is granted) for each calendar year in which such option is outstanding at any time.\nThe ESPP is implemented by a series of “Offering Periods”, namely the period of either 12 or 14 weeks commencing on\nMarch 1st, June 1st, September 1st and December 1st of each year (or at such other time or times as may be determined by\nthe Board). Each participant may elect to have payroll deductions made on each payroll during the Offering Period in an\namount not less than 1% and not more than 10% of such participant's compensation on each such payroll. On the last business\nday of each Offering Period (the “Exercise Date”), each eligible Employee participating in such Offering Period is granted\nthe option to purchase a number of shares of the Common Stock determined by dividing such Employee's contributions\naccumulated prior to the Exercise Date by the applicable Exercise Price. “Exercise Price” means, with respect to an Offering\nPeriod, an amount equal to the average of the closing price of the Common Shares for the period of five consecutive trading\ndays ending on the last trading day of such Offering Period multiplied by 100%, minus 15%. Unless a participant withdraws\nfrom the ESPP, his or her option for the purchase of Common Shares will be exercised automatically on the last business day\nof the Offering Period, and the maximum number of full Common Shares subject to the option will be purchased for him or\nher at the applicable Exercise Price with the accumulated contributions in his or her account.\nDuring a participant's lifetime, a participant's option to purchase Common Shares is exercisable only by him or her. Neither\ncontributions credited to a participant's account nor any rights with regard to the exercise of an option or to receive Common\nShares under the ESPP may be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of in any way (other than by will, the\nlaws of descent and distribution or as a designated beneficiary provided herein) by the participant. Upon termination of the\nparticipant's employment for any reason, including retirement or death, the contributions credited to his or her account will\nbe returned to him or her or, in the case of his or her death, to the person or persons entitled thereto and his or her option will\nbe automatically terminated.\nThe Board may at any time terminate or amend the ESPP. However, subject to certain specified exceptions, no such\ntermination or amendment may adversely affects the rights of any participant. In addition, to the extent necessary to comply\nwith Section 423 of the Code (or any successor rule or provision or any applicable law or regulation), the Company will\nobtain stockholder approval in such a manner and to such a degree as so required. Without stockholder consent and without\nregard to whether any participant rights may be considered to have been adversely affected, the Board is entitled to change\nthe Offering Periods, change the discount factor between 0% and 15%, limit the frequency and/or number of changes in the\namount withheld during an Offering Period, establish the exchange ratio applicable to amounts withheld in a currency other\nthan Canadian or United States dollars, permit payroll withholding in excess of the amount designated by a participant in\norder to adjust for delays or mistakes in the Company's processing of properly completed withholding elections, establish\nreasonable waiting and adjustment periods and/or accounting and crediting procedures to ensure that amounts applied toward\nthe purchase of Common Stock for each participant properly correspond with amounts withheld from the participant's\ncompensation, and establish such other limitations or procedures as the Board determines in its sole discretion advisable that\nare consistent with the ESPP.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nThe following table sets forth the securities authorized for issuance under the Amended 2013 Plan and the ESPP as of\nDecember 30, 2023.\nNumber of Securities\nNumber of Remaining Available\nSecurities to be for Future Issuance\nIssued Upon Weighted-Average Under Equity\nExercise of Exercise Price of Compensation Plans\nOutstanding Outstanding (Excluding Securities\nOptions, Warrants, Options, Warrants Reflected in Column\nPlan Category and Rights and Rights (a))\n(a) (b) (c)\nEquity compensation plans approved by\nsecurities holders:\nAmended 2023 Plan 4,545,342 (1) $6.55 (3) 3,619,054\n64\nESPP - 425,566\nEquity compensation plans not approved by\nsecurities holders 960,061 (2) $3.36 (3) -\nTotal 5,505,403 $5.63 (3) 4,044,620\n(1) Represents common shares of the Company issuable in respect of 2,388,042 stock options, 599,724 restricted stock units and\n1,557,576 performance share units granted under the Amended 2023 Plan.\n(2) Represents common shares of the Company issuable in respect of a special one-time grant of stock options in connection with the\nappointment of Mr. Ennen as CEO on April 1, 2019.\n(3) Vested RSUs and PSUs entitle the holder to receive one common share per unit without payment of additional consideration.\nAccordingly, these units are disregarded for purposes of computing the weighted-average exercise price.\nAnnual Burn Rate\nIn accordance with the policies of the TSX, the following table sets out the burn rate of the awards granted under the\nCompany’s security-based compensation arrangements, namely the Stock Incentive Plans and Employee Stock Purchase\nPlan, as of the end of the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, and for the two preceding fiscal years.

Brian?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian W. Kocher\nChief Executive Officer & Director, SunOpta, Inc.\nGood afternoon and thank you for joining us today. For today's call, I'll start with the highlights of our latest\nquarter's performance along with an update on business trends and key priorities. Greg will follow with the review\nof the financials and our outlook. Then we'll take your questions.\nThe third quarter played out as expected. We once again demonstrated our ability to drive significant growth,\nimprove productivity and profitability, and build processes for sustainable shareholder value creation. Last quarter,\nwe told you that we continued to see revenue growth from innovation, share expansion at existing customers, and\nshare growth with new customers. We also highlighted the temporary operating expense investments in our\nsupply chain to accelerate future sustainable efficiencies, capacity growth, and margin expansion. We guided to\nwhat we could see and work diligently on key metrics, including revenue growth, volume growth, margin\nexpansion, and increasing adjusted EBITDA. The short story, we delivered.\nFor the quarter, revenue growth of 16% was driven by volume growth of 21%, reflecting broad-based strength\nacross customers, channels, and major product categories. We are winning with winning customers as a solution\nprovider and an innovation partner. Our success in operational initiatives was evidenced by the 60-basis point\nyear-over-year improvement in adjusted gross margin, as well as our 13% increase in adjusted EBITDA.\nImportantly, including the operational efficiency investments we projected, we improved gross margin, adjusted\ngross margin, and adjusted EBITDA sequentially over the second quarter of 2024.\nLet me provide a few data points to give you some perspective on the breadth and depth of our growth. We again\ndrove double-digit revenue growth from each of our top three customers. Our top five customers posted 30%\naverage year-over-year revenue growth. Our fruit snacks business grew by 42%, reflecting 40% sales volume\ngrowth. In total, our beverages and broths product lines grew revenue by 14%.\nOur foodservice channel again increased revenue by double-digits as our major customers continued to lean into\nconsumers growing preference for plant-based beverages across their menu options. I love our categories and\nevery category in which we participate is growing. As examples, across all channels on a consolidated basis,\nshelf-stable plant-based milks continue to grow at a mid-single-digit rate. Protein shakes increased 17% over the\nlast 52-week period. The Better For You fruit snacks category grew by 21% over the last 52 weeks, with our\ncustomers commanding well over 75% of the segment share. Even a stable consumer category like broth is up\n8% over the last 52 weeks.\nOur co-manufacturing and private label solution provider model has consistently demonstrated revenue growth\npotential. We are growing revenue through share gains, as evidenced by our most recent announcement to\nexpand Dream Oatmilk across North America in partnership with one of our largest customers. Our R&D teams\n3\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSunOpta, Inc.\n(STKL) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 05-Nov-2024\nare developing new, innovative product solutions on behalf of our customers. We are deeply wired into our\ncustomers' supply chain processes. And we work closely with them on longer-term inventory, product, and\npromotional plans. All of this gives us insight into and confidence about our future revenue growth opportunities.\nMoving on to our operational performance. As you know, the supply chain has been a major area of focus for me.\nWe are committed to improving its effectiveness and using those efficiencies to expand margin and fulfill our unit\nvolume growth opportunities. While we've already realized many meaningful improvements in a relatively short\nperiod of time, I'm even more excited about the longer-term potential to drive greater productivity and efficiency.\nBased on our work over the past several quarters, we believe there is significant runway for us to unlock trapped\ncapacity in our existing network through 2026 and beyond.\nDuring Q3, as planned and similar to Q2, we chose to take advantage of our exceptional revenue growth and\nmake additional short-term operating expense investments in our supply chain to either shore up certain\nprocesses or accelerate sustainable efficiencies. These incremental investments were focused on process\nadvancements, scheduling, training, and uptime improvements in our aseptic network. Individually and\ncollectively, these projects are making meaningful progress. Our 20-plus-percent volume growth over the past six\nmonths provides strong evidence of the success of these investments and also gives us a high degree of\nconfidence in our ability to sustain the efficiencies longer-term. In summary, we have a much clearer vision in our\nopportunity to sustainably expand margins and meaningfully increase our return on invested capital.\nLet me share some recent examples of the progress. Third quarter output versus the prior year was up 18% in our\naseptic facilities and up 49% in our fruit snack facilities. Similar to Q2, the higher output was driven by greater\nefficiency from our established lines and facilities, as well as new capacity deployed over the last 18 months.\nDuring September, we had our second consecutive record-breaking production month at our fruit snack facility in\nOmak, Washington. Our Allentown facility achieved its highest operating uptime metrics of the year in September.\nOat extraction in Modesto, which came online during Q2, continues to ramp from a volume perspective. Given our\nrecently announced Dream Oatmilk distribution expansion, our investment in capacity proved to be very timely.\nOutput in Midlothian is increasing, with the third line contributing as expected.\nTo provide just a few data points on Midlothian's performance this quarter, the facility produced more than double\nthe volume of 3Q 2023 and more telling about the opportunities ahead produced 20% more units than in the\nsecond quarter of 2024. We continue to see opportunities to drive further improvement in Midlothian run rates and\noutput. Most importantly, our margin output and manufacturing cost per unit was the strongest in the final month\nof the quarter, which aligns with our guidance for expanding margins in Q4. Supply chain excellence is the best\nreturn on investment we can make today.\nBased on our high degree of confidence in our supply chain improvement opportunities, we are prioritizing\nefficiency initiatives to create additional production capacity over incremental capital investments. I am most\nexcited about the clear, practical, and tangible path we have to unlock trapped capacity for years to come. We\ncan see a future where our unlocked capacity enables expanded margin and significantly defers the timing while\nreducing the overall amount of capital investment needed for growth. While it's still early in our supply chain\njourney, we are starting to see the benefits and we look forward to updating you on our progress during our next\nearnings call.\nWe are confident in our direction and our expectations for the future continue to be based on what we see, not\nwhat we hope. Our priorities remain the same. First, drive operational improvements to fulfill customer growth and\nexpand sustainable margins. Secondly, grow volume through expanding our current customer relationships via\nboth share gains and innovative solutions, acquiring new customers, and expanding our TAM. And thirdly,\n4\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSunOpta, Inc.\n(STKL) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 05-Nov-2024\nmaintain our disciplined financial approach and continue deleveraging to under 3 times adjusted EBITDA by the\nend of the year. Our immediate focus is on delivering another good quarter and we are reaffirming our fiscal 2024\nrevenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance as well as our midterm target of $125 million adjusted EBITDA run rate\nby late fiscal 2025 or early fiscal 2026. We will provide our outlook for 2025 on our next earnings call when we\nannounce fourth quarter results.\nIn summary, we continue to deliver strong results. We are a growth company in growing categories with winning\ncustomers. And over the past four consecutive quarters, we've consistently delivered top and bottom line results\nthat were in line or better than expected. Our revenue growth is broad-based and volume-driven at rates that are\nseveral times faster than the respective categories in which we participate. Our temporary operating expense\ninvestments and focus on operational excellence and productivity positions us for sustainable margin\nimprovement commencing in the fourth quarter and accelerating through 2025 and into 2026. I am confident in\nthe direction of our business and our significant potential to drive growth, cash flow, and shareholder value over\nthe longer-term.\nNow, I'll turn the call over to Greg to cover the third quarter and full year outlook in more detail.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGreg Gaba\nChief Financial Officer, SunOpta, Inc.\nThank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another strong quarter. Revenue of $176 million was up\n16% compared to last year and continued to be driven by outstanding broad-based volume growth. Gross profit\nincreased $3.3 million or 16% to $23.6 million in the quarter, and reported gross margin was 13.4%. Adjusted\ngross margin was 17% compared to 16.4% in the prior year, reflecting higher sales and production volumes that\ndrove improved plant utilization, partially offset by incremental depreciation for newly launched production assets,\nalong with some manufacturing inefficiencies as we continued short-term investments to drive future sustainable\nsupply chain efficiencies.\nOperating income of $1.5 million was up slightly compared to prior year, as increased gross profit and lower\nbusiness development costs and employee severance cost following the divestiture of Frozen Fruit were largely\noffset by higher variable compensation and increased professional fees related to operational productivity\ninitiatives. Loss from continuing operations was $5.5 million, compared to a loss of $5.7 million in the prior year\nperiod. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased 13% to $21.5 million compared to $19.1 million\nlast year.\nTurning to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, debt was $290 million, which was $13 million lower than\nthe end of Q2. Net leverage was 3.3 times, a decrease from 3.5 times last quarter. And we expect to achieve our\ntarget of being under 3 times levered by the end of the year. Year-to-date cash provided by operating activities of\ncontinuing operations increased significantly during the quarter to $19.2 million and year-to-date cash used in\ninvesting activities of continuing operations was $16.5 million.\nNow turning to our full year outlook. We are reaffirming our outlook for fiscal 2024. We continue to expect revenue\nin the range of $710 million to $730 million, which represents growth of 13% to 16% and adjusted EBITDA of $88\nmillion to $92 million, which represents growth of 12% to 17%.\nIn summary, it was another quarter of exceptional, volume-driven, top line growth rates with improved gross\nmargin and cash flow. We continue to accelerate short-term investments in the supply chain initiatives, which we\nanticipate will wind down in the fourth quarter. These investments are expected to deliver higher sustainable\n5\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSunOpta, Inc.\n(STKL) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 05-Nov-2024\nmargins, improve profitability, and provide great momentum as we enter 2025, helping us achieve higher rates of\nreturn and significant long-term value for shareholders.\nBefore opening the call for questions, just a reminder that for competitive reasons, we do not provide detailed\ncommentary regarding customer or SKU level activity.\nAnd with that, operator, please open the call for questions.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from\nthe line of Jim Salera of Stephens. Your line is open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJim Salera Q\nAnalyst, Stephens, Inc.\nHey, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking our question. Wanted to ask on obviously recent headline news, a\nbig customer of yours removing surcharge on plant-based add-ons for their drinks. Just any thoughts on how that\ncould potentially both increase the demand for your product among people who are familiar with plant-based add-\nons? And do you have any sense for if that incremental surcharge was kind of a prohibiting factor for maybe\npeople that haven't tried the plant-based milk and this opens up an opportunity for them to try it for the first time\nand then kind of convert and bring them into the fold?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian W. Kocher A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, SunOpta, Inc.\nYeah, Jim, thanks for the question. Let me kind of answer that and then also put it into context for you. If I think\nabout it, in general, we believe anything that fosters trial, penetration, or repeat buys, in general, is good for us.\nSo I think, in general, that's how we view that, those types of activities. Now, I will also say, we don't comment on\nany particular customer. But as you remember, we are tied into the supply chains of our top 15 customers. So we\nwork with them on product development, on responses to consumer demands, on pricing developments, and\nmake sure that our solutions are available to ensure that they're in supply and they can satisfy their customer. So\nI guess that's a long way of saying, look, we've been working with our customer base throughout foodservice and\nretail in trying to ensure that we're meeting the demands and providing solutions for that.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Andrew Strelzik of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDaniel Gold Q\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets Corp.\nHi. This is Daniel Gold on for Andrew Strelzik. Thanks for taking my question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian W. Kocher A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, SunOpta, Inc.\nSure, Daniel.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n6\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSunOpta, Inc.\n(STKL) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 05-Nov-2024\nDaniel Gold Q\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets Corp.\nThanks. Revenue guidance implies still a pretty wide range here at 4Q. What are the swing factors for the high\nand low end of that range?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGreg Gaba A\nChief Financial Officer, SunOpta, Inc.\nYeah, Daniel, it's Greg. Thanks for the question. We put our guidance out for the back half of the year and we\nraised twice already this year. And when we look at the quarter, it basically came in exactly as we expected. So\nnot to overthink it, we just kept the guidance. We reaffirmed it for the full year and didn't make any full changes.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Ryan Meyers of Lake Street Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRyan Meyers Q\nAnalyst, Lake Street Capital Markets LLC\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just kind of as a follow-up to the unchanged guidance question, is\nthere any potential for new business to come in the pipeline here in Q4 where there could be upside, or is most of\nthe capacity for this quarter pretty much accounted for already?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian W. Kocher A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, SunOpta, Inc.\nYeah, Ryan, hey, it's a really good question. We appreciate it. I will go back to we continue to try to frame our\nguidance and our outlook and what we can see versus what we hope that happens. We know we've seen a lot of\ndata that's come through over the course of the last several weeks. We've worked with customers. So I think\nwe're fairly confident in our guidance for the fourth quarter, probably just in terms of repeating Greg's answer and\nfeedback, I wouldn't overthink it too much. We had the guidance. We basically came in for the quarter the way we\nthought in the third quarter and therefore we left the fourth quarter the same.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Brian Holland of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian Holland Q\nAnalyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.\nYeah. Thanks. Good afternoon. I'm curious, you referenced at the top, Brian, top customer growth at a pretty\nmeaningful magnitude. Curious, if you can sort of discern for us between, you know, how much of that is a by-\nproduct of you picking up incremental business with these customers versus what these customers' underlying\ngrowth trend is? And to the extent that it's the former, how sustainable do you view that magnitude of growth to be\nfor you?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian W. Kocher A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, SunOpta, Inc.\nYeah, Brian, thank you. Great question. Let me start even with our categories, because I think the other thing that\nwe mentioned in our prepared remarks and I want to make sure it doesn't get lost in the Q&A. Every category\nwe're participating in is growing. If you look at shelf-stable, plant-based beverages growing mid-single-digits. If\nyou look at broth, growing. If you look at fruit snacks, growing. So, first and foremost, it starts off with categories\nthat are growing.\n7\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSunOpta, Inc.\n(STKL) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 05-Nov-2024\nI think we also have had some investments starting in last year into the beginning of this year that were TAM\nexpansion. So, clearly, our investments in protein shake capacity, as well as some other innovation I would say\nwas clearly TAM expansion or innovation related that helped spur growth.\nAnd then we also have been very open about shares that we've gained. If you remember, at our heart, we are a\ncustomer-focused solution provider, customer-focused solution provider. And that gives us the opportunity to\ninnovate with our customers. It gives us the opportunity to grow the market. But it also gives us the opportunity to\nsee share advances and share increases. And if you look at our revenue for the first six months of the year, we\nwould have said that we're probably a third TAM expansion, a third share growth with existing customers, and a\nthird share growth with new customers. I think if you look at this third quarter, it's more 50/50 between new\nproducts and share growth.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Alex Fuhrman of Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Your line is\nopen.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAlex Joseph Fuhrman Q\nAnalyst, Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC\nHey, guys, thanks for taking my question and I'll add my congratulations on another really good quarter. Wanted\nto ask about the announcement you guys had about a month ago about expanding your Dream brand, the oat\nmilk barista product through the coffee shop channel, looks like a pretty big rollout of 6,700 stores. I think my\nunderstanding here of your business in the coffee shop channel has been consumers wouldn't generally see your\nproduct or your product would be in a fairly nondescript container. Can you talk a little bit about this shifted to\nhaving a bigger role for your brands in the coffee shop channel? Does this represent any sort of a change in\nstrategy now that you have a larger portfolio of brands to work with?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian W. Kocher A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, SunOpta, Inc.\nYeah, Alex, appreciate the question. I don't know that I would go so far as to say this is a change in strategy.\nCertainly, having our brand available to consumers is a unique option for any one of our customers. And again,\nyou know we can do co-manufacturing, we can do private label, but we can also have a brand offering. I think the\nopportunity that led to this distribution expansion was one of providing a supply chain solution. We have several\ncustomers that we are constantly working with their supply chain challenges or opportunities. And this happened\nto be a unique opportunity where we could draft a solution that could be implemented relatively quickly and\nimplemented on a wide scale, and our brand was the best product or the best format to do that.\nSo I don't know that I would think of it as a strategy change as much as a perfect example of how we try to\nprovide solutions for our customer base. And when you provide solutions, you get chances on innovation. When\nyou provide solutions, you get chances for share growth and this was one of those.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAlex Joseph Fuhrman Q\nAnalyst, Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC\nOkay. That's really helpful. Thanks, Brian.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n8\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSunOpta, Inc.\n(STKL) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 05-Nov-2024\nJohn Baumgartner Q\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC\nGood afternoon. Thanks for the question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian W. Kocher A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, SunOpta, Inc.\nHey, John. Good to hear from you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn Baumgartner Q\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC\nHey. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Maybe first off, Brian, I wanted to ask about reinvestment. As\nyou're sort of rolling through these process efficiencies and as the business develops, the volumes and customers\ndevelop, how do you think about other areas of potential reinvestment, whether it's R&D, adding support or\nresources to the sales force? How do we think about your ability to maintain OpEx leverage going forward?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian W. Kocher A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, SunOpta, Inc.\nYeah. Thanks, John. Appreciate that. Look, we're really excited, first and foremost, about our demand generation\nengine. I think we've been saying that for several quarters now. We also have tried to be responsible in providing\nan outlook or guiding to what we see and not what we hope that happens. But then go work our tails off to make\nwhat we hope happens is a reality. So I continue to believe that we'll have operating expense leverage as we go\nthrough here. We are a solutions provider that are drafting great answers and great initiatives for our customers to\ncontinue growing and our categories to continue growing. So I love that aspect of it. And we can do that while\ncontinuing to think about how we support our customers in R&D, how we support them with the sales team in\nrepresentation.\nIf you look at investment, it is abundantly clear to Greg and I and it's more clear today than it was three months\nago, it was more clear three months ago than six months ago. Our next best dollar investment is in supply chain\nefficiencies. If we can unlock the trapped capacity in our network, we have an opportunity to really drive margin\nand more importantly even do so in a way that that either defers and/or reduces ultimately the amount of growth\nCapEx that is required to service our growth.\nSo I'm excited about that. In fact, we still have a little bit of work to do to quantify the financials on that, and we\nlook forward to sharing that with you when we announce our fourth quarter results. But we can tell you as of today\nthat we believe we have a line of sight into operational improvements that would fuel our volume growth well into\n2026 and possibly even further without significant CapEx, without significant growth CapEx. And we're really\nexcited about that.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn Baumgartner Q\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC\nOkay. And to follow up on the efficiency there, I think part of the process efficiency, there was some expectation\nto get some benefits for inventory. I'm curious, thinking about working capital, do you have to hold more inventory\ngoing forward to accommodate stronger growth? Are there efficiencies in procurement and supply chain that are\naccretive to working capital? Just sort of your thoughts there on the balance of that.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n9\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSunOpta, Inc.\n(STKL) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 05-Nov-2024\nGreg Gaba A\nChief Financial Officer, SunOpta, Inc.\nYeah. For inventory levels, they were up this quarter. A couple of reasons why. One, our revenue is growing. And\nas revenue grows, the absolute dollars of inventory will go up. In addition, it's a little bit seasonal, John, as we are\ngoing into our broth season. So we do typically have an inventory build here in Q3 to get us prepared for the Q4\nbroth season. So I would look at it more in the terms of days on hand. And we do strive for certain targets there\nand we expect those to be consistent going forward. But as revenue grows, the absolute dollar inventory will\ngrow.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn Baumgartner Q\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC\nThanks, Greg. Thanks, Brian.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Andersen of William Blair. Your line is open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJon Andersen Q\nAnalyst, William Blair & Co. LLC\nGood afternoon. Congrats on the good quarter. I may have missed this earlier, so I apologize. But this year, your\nvolume has been extremely strong and it seems like you satisfied that demand, but it has caused some\nmanufacturing inefficiencies as a result, thus spurring your investments in the supply chain. How do you balance\nthat equation of chasing that growth when it's there versus trying to maintain some balance in your operations to\ndeliver on profit objectives, return objectives? And then as a second part, could you talk a little bit about where\nyou sit today from a capacity standpoint in terms of sales? And how incremental, you know, are these short-term\nor near-term investments you're making in the second half of this year? How incremental is that to your capacity\ngoing forward? Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian W. Kocher A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, SunOpta, Inc.\nOkay, Jon, lots to unpack there. Let me start with the second part of your question first, because it's a really\nimportant point that I want to make sure everyone understands and really is more clear for us now than it has\nbeen certainly in the 10 months that I've been here. What we've very clearly understand today is the next best\ndollar that we can spend in investment is unlocking trapped capacity in our operating system, in our supply chain.\nAnd trapped capacity comes from all kinds of things. It comes from equipment downtime. It comes from sequence\nand scheduling. Potentially, it comes from order of production, product mix.\nThere's all types of things that impact capacity and utilization rates. I am more clear today and we, as an\norganization, are more clear today that we have runway to satisfy our growth initiatives and what we've talked\nabout in the investment community with long-term growth targets, we're more confident in our ability to drive\noperational efficiencies, which unlock that capacity and allow us to service growth well into 2026 and potentially\nfurther out, thereby deferring significant growth CapEx. We don't have all of our answers yet, so we've got a little\nbit more work to do. But we're looking forward to sharing that with everyone when we announce our fourth quarter\nresults and provide an outlook on 2025 at the same time. So I think that's the answer to the second question.\nThe answer to the first part of the question on efficiencies and how do you balance that, I think, one of – there's\ntwo answers. One is a lot of times when you are looking to fill your facilities and your plants, you're looking to gain\nvolume. And you take the volume when you can get it, not necessarily when it's convenient. I think we're probably\n10\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSunOpta, Inc.\n(STKL) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 05-Nov-2024\npast that phase in our growth strategy now. And we have the opportunity, as I said, to fund volume growth\nthrough operational efficiencies, but also ensures that we're working with our customers so that it's the right type\nof growth. We clearly have a plan to expand margins, to use that operational efficiency to expand margins. We\nhave a margin target that we're marching to at 20% gross margin. It won't be tomorrow. It will be over the course\nof several quarters. But we do that by balancing not only operational efficiency, but the right type of growth as\nwell. So, hopefully, that clarifies it.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJon Andersen Q\nAnalyst, William Blair & Co. LLC\nThat's really helpful. I appreciate it. Could I squeeze in a follow-up? Your value-added fruit snack business has\nbeen a good business for a long time, but it doesn't necessarily seem like it's a total fit or clean fit with kind of the\naseptic packaging and processing and packaging that you do in the beverage space. Is that a business we should\nthink about as core or central to your strategy going forward, or are you always thinking about a range of strategic\nalternatives across the portfolio, including that part of the business? Thanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian W. Kocher A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, SunOpta, Inc.\nJon, I love the product categories we're in. Every one of them is growing. That fruit snacks category is growing\nlike crazy. I think over the last 52-week period, it's up 21%. It's actually up more in the last 26-week period. So I'm\nreally excited about fruit snacks. I actually think, although the operating mechanism is different, hot extrusion,\nsingle flow wrap, multipacks in fruit snacks, aseptic processing in our beverage and broth category. Although the\noperating facilities are different, the customer base, the solution orientation, the opportunity to innovate, the\nopportunity to work with our customers on solving their supply chain challenges, the opportunity to grow with them\nas we solve supply chain challenges, they're actually extremely similar in terms of our go-to-market approach. So\nit feels to me like it's a very core part of our business in a growing category where we can distinguish ourselves\nwith customer-focused innovative solutions. So I really like the portfolio.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJon Andersen Q\nAnalyst, William Blair & Co. LLC\nWell said. Thanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Biolsi of Hedgeye. Your line is open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDaniel Biolsi Q\nAnalyst, Hedgeye Risk Management, LLC\nThank you. Brian, I was hoping you can follow up on some of the answers you were talking about with the\nproductivity gains your team has achieved in Q3 and the rest of the year and what that opportunity is for next\nyear, how much of that is at the newest plants, getting that up to where the other more existing plants are and just\nbringing up to speed and how much is just sort of across the board with all your plants.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian W. Kocher A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, SunOpta, Inc.\nYeah. So [ph] the way (00:47:06) I think about it, Daniel, I'm really proud of what we've done in the supply chain\nso far. If you look at us year-to-date, I think we're up 18% in total. Actually, in the third quarter, we are. Year-to-\ndate, it's a little more. If I split that out, what I'll call our existing, so maybe legacy is a way to think of it. Plants and\nmanufacturing lines, they were up 10%. So, yes, part of it is the new assets. We're filling those. They're getting up\n11\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSunOpta, Inc.\n(STKL) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 05-Nov-2024\nto speed. They're getting up to the efficiency and throughput levels that we want in mature assets. But the other\npiece of that is our mature assets are all – we're also increasing output there. Again, that's what gives us so much\nconfidence that that we can drive and fulfill the revenue growth that we see over 2025 and into 2026, potentially\neven further. We can fulfill that with operational excellence initiatives because we're already seeing that in our\nmature legacy assets.\nTo give you some perspective, and I think we said this last time, a 10% increase in that asset production is the\nequivalent of a manufacturing line. That's a free manufacturing line. We didn't have to pay any CapEx for that.\nNow, again, it's a little bit clouded because some of the volume gains that we took on came with some\ninefficiencies. And we've had to shore up a few processes, as well as build sustainable processes for future\nmargin expansion. But the fact of the matter is we see a path and we're excited about fulfilling our volume growth\nthrough operational efficiency initiatives, and not through investment CapEx.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDaniel Biolsi Q\nAnalyst, Hedgeye Risk Management, LLC\nWell then I'm looking forward to what you announce next quarter on what you see [indiscernible] (00:49:01).\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian W. Kocher A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, SunOpta, Inc.\nYeah. We need a little bit of work still to kind of crystallize everything, but we're excited to talk about what 2025\ncan bring.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDaniel Biolsi Q\nAnalyst, Hedgeye Risk Management, LLC\nThanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Your next follow-up question comes from line of Jim Salera of Stephens. Your line is open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJim Salera Q\nAnalyst, Stephens, Inc.\nYes. Just one follow-up question to my earlier question. You talked about how there's a big opportunity for\npenetration in retail and kind of closing the household penetration gap between plant-based milk and traditional\ndairy milk. Do you have a sense for in the coffee shop channel, what that mix or what that penetration is at right\nnow and where you think that could go to?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian W. Kocher A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, SunOpta, Inc.\nJim, it's harder. That coffee shop data is much harder to get a hold of as you know. I think what I tried to do is\nmake a more general statement, which was we view that we benefit any time there's product initiatives,\nassortment initiatives, pricing initiatives, or distribution initiatives that encourage penetration, trial or repeat buys.\nWe think we benefit in those scenarios. So that that's a more general comment. I think I would keep steering this\nback to a couple of high-level points.\nWe've guided to kind of 10% revenue growth, 10% long-term revenue growth. We're more confident in that today\nthan we were three months ago. We're confident in our demand generation engine. And part of that is because,\nagain, we are tied in to our top 15 customers and work with them on their innovation pipeline, their new product –\n12\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSunOpta, Inc.\n(STKL) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 05-Nov-2024\ntheir product assortment, and when they make changes in promotional volume or pricing initiatives, we're there\nright beside them to help them ensure that they've got supply to meet the demand.\nSo all of that shapes our guidance and our outlook. And we try to use all of that information as we then speak to\nyou and others about what we think the potential of our business is. So, I guess, that's some background to say\nwe've incorporated this data. We adjust the data based upon what we see and not hope, and then can\ncommunicate responsibly to you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJim Salera Q\nAnalyst, Stephens, Inc.\nGreat. Appreciate the thoughts. Thank you, guys.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Your next follow-up question comes from the line of Brian Holland of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian Holland Q\nAnalyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.\nYeah. Thanks. Forgive me if this was referenced at some earlier point, but can you frame how much of a drag the\nmanufacturing efficiencies and supply chain investments you referenced were to EBITDA in the quarter? And for\nhow long this should continue to kind of weigh on the results? Obviously, to the extent that these are transitories,\nit would be helpful to get a sense of kind of what the underlying trajectory here is.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGreg Gaba A\nChief Financial Officer, SunOpta, Inc.\nYeah, Brian, we didn't quantify the amount, but what I will say with 21% volume growth in the quarter, that does\ncreate a lot of stress on the system, right. And not all of the cost is to third-parties. A lot of the cost is internal cost\nand its opportunity cost such as training, process improvement, working on equipment reliability. I mean, we\nexpect that those costs are going to wind down here and they have been winding down, and we would expect\nthose to be completely gone by the end of the fourth quarter.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian Holland Q\nAnalyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.\nHelpful. Thanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: That concludes our Q&A session. I'll now turn the conference back over to CEO, Brian Kocher, for\nclosing remarks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian W. Kocher\nChief Executive Officer & Director, SunOpta, Inc.\nThank you, and thanks to all of you for listening and joining. Hey, if you walk away with two things from this\nquarter, I hope you walk away with the following two. One, our customer-focused solution provider model is an\nenduring growth engine. The value of our solutions and the offerings to our customers are reflected in the share\ngains and the TAM expansion, which is that we've realized which are driving four straight quarters of plus 14%\nrevenue growth. And that also underpins our confidence in our long-term growth algorithm. And we're really\nconfident in our demand generation engine.\n13\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSunOpta, Inc.\n(STKL) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 05-Nov-2024\nI think the other area and we've hit this a couple of times, but I want to make sure it's clear. We have a better\nvision and increasing confidence in our ability to improve operationally through our supply chain. Those initiatives\nunlock trapped capacity within the existing manufacturing network, and that capacity is sufficient to service our\ngrowth, volume growth needs into 2026 and potentially beyond without the need for significant growth CapEx.\nThose would be the two points that I really hope you walk away from.\nWe'll update you in more detail when we provide 2025 outlook next quarter. So we're looking forward to talking\nabout our fourth quarter to providing you 2025 outlook on the next earning call. And until then, we thank you for\nyour support and look forward to talking to you soon.
