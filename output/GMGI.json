The B2B division of Golden Matrix develops and licenses proprietary gaming platforms for its extensive list of clients\nand RKings, its B2C division, operates a high-volume eCommerce site enabling end users to enter paid-for competitions on its proprietary\nplatform in authorized markets. The Company also owns and operates MEXPLAY, a regulated online casino in Mexico.\nMeridianbet Group, founded in 2001 and acquired by Golden Matrix in 2024, is a well-established online sports betting and gaming group,\nlicensed and currently operating in 15 jurisdictions across Europe, Africa and South America. Meridianbet Group’s successful business\nmodel utilizes proprietary technology and scalable systems, thus allowing it to operate in multiple countries and currencies and with an\nomni-channel approach to markets, including retail, desktop online and mobile.\nThe companies’ sophisticated software automatically declines any gaming or redemption requests from within the United States, in strict\ncompliance with current US law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA or AEBITDA, is a “non-GAAP financial measures” presented as a supplemental measure of the Company’s performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Net Debt and Net Debt Leverage are not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States, or GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, interest income, taxes, depreciation and\namortization, and also excludes stock-based compensation expense and restructuring costs. Net Debt is defined as total debt less cash\nand cash equivalents. Net Debt Leverage Ratio is defined as net debt as of the balance sheet date divided by annualized adjusted EBITDA\nfor the quarter then ended. We believe that using Net Debt and Net Debt Leverage Ratio is useful to investors in determining our leverage\nratio since we could choose to use cash and cash equivalents to retire debt. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe it provides\nadditional useful information to investors due to the various noncash items during the period. Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt and Net Debt\nLeverage are not recognized in accordance with GAAP, are unaudited, and have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider\nthem in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted\nEBITDA, Net Debt and Net Debt Leverage do not reflect cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual\ncommitments; Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt and Net Debt Leverage do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital\nneeds; Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt and Net Debt Leverage do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements\nnecessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments; although depreciation and amortization are\nnoncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt\nand Net Debt Leverage do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in this industry may calculate\nAdjusted EBITDA, Net Debt and Net Debt Leverage differently than the Company does, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.\nThe Company’s presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual\nor nonrecurring items. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the section titled “Reconciliation of Net\nIncome to Adjusted Earnings excluding Interest Expense, Interest Income, Depreciation Expense, Amortization Expense, Stock-based\nCompensation Expense and Restructuring Costs” and “Reconciliation of Net Debt and Leverage Calculation”, included at the end of this\nrelease.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements made in this press release contain forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws,\nincluding within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“forward-looking statements”).

The\nCompany employs approximately 1,200 personnel, operating both online (mobile and web) and approximately 700 company-owned or franchised betting shops, with a primary focus (in those\nshops) on sports betting, online casino games, and virtual games.

This is complemented by a variety of slot machines and online casinos, eSports, fixed odds games, and other entertainment options, contingent on the regulatory parameters of the\nspecific jurisdictions. While sports betting is a primary focus, the Company’s online casino revenue has grown significantly over the past years. Following the closing of the Purchase (defined\nbelow) and effective April 1, 2024, as discussed below, the Company expanded into the business-to-business (“B2B”) segment where it develops and owns online gaming intellectual property (IP)\nand builds configurable and scalable, turn-key, and white-label gaming platforms for international customers, located primarily in the Asia Pacific region. As part of the Purchase, the Company\nacquired a proprietary Internet gaming enterprise software system that provides for unique casino and live game operations on the platforms that include GM-X System (“GM-X”) and GM-Ag\nSystem, Turnkey Solution and White Label Solutions. These platforms are provided to Asia Pacific Internet-based and land-based casino operators as a turnkey technology solution for regulated\nreal money Internet gaming (“RMiG”), Internet sports gaming, and virtual simulated gaming (“SIM”). In addition, following the Purchase, the Company broadened its operations in pay-to-enter\nprize competitions in the UK\nOn April 9, 2024, GMGI completed the acquisition (the “Purchase”) of 100% of Meridian Tech Društvo Sa Ograničenom Odgovornošću Beograd, a private limited company formed and\nregistered in and under the laws of the Republic of Serbia (“Meridian Serbia”); Društvo Sa Ograničenom Odgovornošću “MeridianBet” Društvo Za Proizvodnju, Promet Roba I Usluga, Export\nImport Podgorica, a private limited company formed and registered in and under the laws of Montenegro (“MeridianBet Montenegro”); Meridian Gaming Holdings Ltd., a company formed and\nregistered in the Republic of Malta; and Meridian Gaming (Cy) Ltd, a company formed and registered in the republic of Cyprus (collectively, “MeridianBet Group”), from Aleksandar Milovanović,\nZoran Milošević and Snežana Božović (collectively, the “Sellers”).

Identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any\nnon-controlling interest. Any adjustments to the purchase price allocation are made during the measurement period, not exceeding one year from the acquisition date, in accordance with ASC 805.\nThe Company recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquired subsidiary at fair value. The excess of the purchase price and the fair value of non-controlling interest in the acquired\nsubsidiary over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the subsidiary is recognized as goodwill. Identifiable assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Acquisition-related\ncosts are expensed as incurred.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to\nsuch estimates and assumptions include contingent liability, stock-based compensation, warrant valuation, accrued expenses and collectability of accounts receivable. The Company evaluates its\nestimates on an on-going basis and bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions the Company believes to be reasonable. Due to inherent uncertainties, actual\nresults could differ from those estimates.\n18\nTable of Contents\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company has adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements”, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in US GAAP, and\nexpands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 does not require any new fair value measurements, but it does provide guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair\nvalue hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entity’s own\nassumptions (unobservable inputs).\nThe hierarchy consists of three levels:\n· Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n· Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets of liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active;\nor other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n· Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe Company uses Level 3 inputs for its valuation methodology for its assets and liabilities.\nFinancial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, intangible assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and customer deposits. The carrying\namounts of such financial instruments in the accompanying balance sheets approximate their fair values due to their relatively short-term nature. It is management’s opinion that the Company is\nnot exposed to any significant currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\nThe functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency. For these foreign entities, we translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars using average exchange\nrates for the period for income statement amounts and using end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities. We record these translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss), a separate component of equity, in our consolidated balance sheets. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company has foreign currency translation\nadjustments of $1,818,258 and $(1,492,622), respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company has foreign currency translation adjustments of $(287,685) and\n$(1,316,847), respectively.\nWe record exchange gains and losses resulting from the conversion of transaction currency to functional currency as a component of other income (expense). The Company incurred\nforeign exchange gains and (losses) of $(219,060) and $366,183 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and $(337,581) and $320,852 during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCash\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company currently has no cash equivalents at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance based on known\ntroubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $260,094 and $203,676,\nrespectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, there was $132,014 and $36,322, respectively, of bad debt expense recorded, and during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, and 2023, there was $218,801 and $108,742, respectively, of bad debt expense recorded.\n19\nTable of Contents\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are capitalized when a future benefit is determined. Intangible assets are amortized over the anticipated useful life of the intangible asset.\nSoftware Development Costs\nThe Company capitalizes internal software development costs subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a software application in accordance with guidelines established by\nASC 985-20-25 “Costs of Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Marketed”, requiring certain software development costs to be capitalized upon the establishment of technological feasibility. The\nestablishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of these costs require considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors\nsuch as anticipated future revenue, estimated economic life, and changes in software and hardware technologies. Amortization of the capitalized software development costs begins when the\nproduct is available for general release to customers. Capitalized costs are amortized based on the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product.\nOther intangible assets\nOther intangible assets, including customer relationships, patents, and trademarks, that are acquired by the Company and have finite useful lives, are at cost less accumulated\namortization and any accumulated impairment losses. Costs incurred after the asset is placed in service are recognized in the income statement as incurred.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 350-30-65 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, the Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important, which could trigger an impairment review include the following:\n1. Significant underperformance compared to historical or projected future operating results;\n2. Significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; and\n3. Significant negative industry or economic trends.\nWhen the Company determines that the carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment and\nthe carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from projected undiscounted cash flows, the Company records an impairment charge. The Company measures any impairment based on a\nprojected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent to the current business model. Significant management\njudgment is required in determining whether an indicator of impairment exists and in projecting cash flows. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives. The\nCompany incurred amortization expense of $1,962,157 and $420,801 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and $4,317,523 and $1,357,453 during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nInventories\nPrizes\nRKings and Classics for a Cause purchase prizes to be awarded to winners of prize competitions and giveaways; these prizes are recorded as inventory.

The Company believes that we are not exposed to matters that will individually, or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nNotwithstanding the above, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of\nmanagement’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company is involved in a dispute with one of its Cyprus subsidiaries’ minority owners. Meridian Malta owns 51% of the Cypriot company, Fair Champions Meridian Ltd. (“Fair\nChampions”). Meridian Malta and the minority shareholders of Fair Champions are engaged in four related court actions, two of which (one from each side) seek the liquidation of that company.\nThe proceedings are pending in the District Court of Limassol, cases General Application No. 378/2016; General Application No. 542/2020; Case No. 1080/2017; and Case No. 418/2017. The actions\nwere initiated between September and February 2020. Given the parties’ petitions for relief, the ultimate liquidation of that entity is likely, though it is also possible the Court will engineer one set\nof parties buyout of the other. In the third action, the minority shareholders are asserting derivative claims on behalf of Fair Champions. In the fourth, Meridian Serbia has sued certain minority\nshareholders for misrepresentations made at the time of the Company Parties’ acquisition of its majority interest in Fair Champions. The MeridianBet Group is seeking reimbursement of the sum it\npaid for that interest. The Company is vigorously defending this dispute and believes that dispute will be resolved in the Company's favor, and as such, a reserve has not been accrued.\nMeridian Malta is participating in a dispute with the Greek tax authorities (acting through the Audit Centre for Large Enterprises). The MeridianBet Group has conducted business\nremotely (i.e., via internet) in Greece through Meridian Malta. Meridian Malta—like two dozen other remote betting entities—is locked in a tax dispute with the Greek tax authorities relating to tax\nyears 2012 through 2014. The Greek authorities filed initial assessments, which Meridian Malta then appealed. The bases of the appeals included arguments that (i) Greece incorrectly assessed\nMeridian Malta’s tax liability; and (ii) Meridian Malta paid taxes on its Greek revenues in Malta, so it is exempt from further taxes under the two countries’ double taxation treaty. The appeals are at\nvarious stages of adjudication. These actions, instituted in December 2018 and April 2019, are pending in the Administrative Court of Appeal of Athens and the Supreme Court of Greece,\nrespectively. The Company is vigorously defending this dispute and believes that dispute will be resolved in the Company's favor, but out of prudence, for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, the Company had accrued a tax expense of $1,468,472 as contingent liability for the said dispute.\nThe Company is in a dispute with Mr. Paul Hardman (one of the former owners of RKings) with regards to a certain consideration totaling approximately $670,650 (GBP 500,000) that he\nhas alleged is still owed to him pursuant to the RKings Purchase Agreement, and which we allege was forfeited. That amount is accrued and included in the Company’s liabilities as of September\n30, 2024. The Company’s dispute and claims against Mr. Hardman stem from breaches of the terms of the RKings Purchase Agreement by Mr. Hardman. The Company is vigorously pursuing the\nclaim of breach of the RKings Purchase Agreement against Mr. Hardman; however, no formal legal action has been initiated by either party to date.\nNOTE 22 - MERIDIANBET GROUP PURCHASE AGREEMENT\nOn January 12, 2023, Golden Matrix entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement of Share Capital (the “Original Purchase Agreement”) with the Sellers, the owners of MeridianBet Group.\nOn June 28, 2023, Golden Matrix entered into an Amended and Restated Sale and Purchase Agreement of Share Capital dated June 27, 2023, with the Sellers on June 28, 2023 (the “A&R\nPurchase Agreement”), which amended and restated the Original Purchase Agreement and Golden Matrix entered into a First Amendment to Amended and Restated Sale and Purchase Agreement\nof Share Capital with the Sellers on September 22, 2023 (the “First Amendment”).\n50\nTable of Contents\nOn January 24, 2024, on, and effective on, January 22, 2024, Golden Matrix and the Sellers entered into a Second Amendment to Amended and Restated Sale and Purchase Agreement of\nShare Capital (the “Second Amendment”) which extended the required closing date of the Purchase from March 31, 2024, to June 30, 2024, or such other later date as may be approved by the\nmutual consent of the parties.\nOn, and effective on, April 8, 2024, Golden Matrix and the Sellers entered into a Third Amendment to Amended and Restated Sale and Purchase Agreement of Share Capital (the “Third\nAmendment”, and the A&R Purchase Agreement as amended to date, the “Purchase Agreement”) which amended the Purchase Agreement to among other things: (a) change the effective date of\nthe acquisition to April 1, 2024, unless otherwise agreed by the parties; (b) reduce the cash payment payable at closing of the acquisition to $12 million, and to defer $18 million until April 26, 2024,\nprovided that if such amount is not paid by April 26, 2024, any unpaid amount accrues interest at the rate of three percent per annum (from the effective date of the closing); (c) remove the right\nfor a portion of the closing cash payment to be paid by the cash on hand of MeridianBet Group; (d) provide for Meridian Serbia to be owned by a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of\nGolden Matrix following the closing; (e) provide for the transfer of certain of the Sellers’ ownership of Meridian Gaming Ltd., a Kenyan limited company to MeridianBet Group as a post-closing\nobligation (due within 12 months of the closing); (f) waive certain required timing obligations in connection with the delivery of closing schedules by both Golden Matrix and the Sellers; and (g)\nmake certain conforming changes to the Purchase Agreement in connection with the items above.\nOn April 9, 2024, the Purchase was completed, and Golden Matrix acquired 100% of MeridianBet Group, effective for all purposes as of April 1, 2024.

The purpose of the\nagreement is to ensure the continued running of the MeridianBet Group in the ordinary course, for a finite period of time, by one or more individuals who (i) have grown such entities to their\ncurrent, profitable levels, earning them an important level of corporate and business knowledge; and (ii) have the native-language abilities to easily communicate with mid-level and low-level\nemployees, among other material advantages. The violation of that materiality-based restriction would also raise an option for the Sellers to suspend or terminate (at their discretion) the Voting\nAgreement. The Management Agreement does not, other than in connection with the day-to-day operations of MeridianBet Group, restrict the Board of Directors or management’s ability to\nmanage MeridianBet Group or the Company as a whole.\n54\nTable of Contents\nPursuant to the Management Agreement, Mr. Milošević serves as the manager of MeridianBet Group and supervises and direct the day-to-day operation of MeridianBet Group as Chief\nExecutive Officer thereof.

As a result of the Purchase,\nthe Sellers became the majority stockholders of the Company and received rights to appoint certain persons to the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to the Series C Preferred Stock (as\ndiscussed in greater detail above under “Series C Preferred Stock”).\nThe Purchase has been accounted for as a business combination for accounting purposes, with MeridianBet Group being deemed the accounting acquirer and Golden Matrix being\ndeemed the accounting acquiree. Therefore, the historical basis of MeridianBet Group’s assets and liabilities have not been remeasured as a result of the acquisition. As described more fully in\n“NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES” and above, the assets and liabilities of Golden Matrix have been recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date and are\nincluded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In identifying MeridianBet Group as the acquiring entity, the companies considered the structure of the acquisition, the relative\nequity ownership and the largest portion of the voting rights, in the combined companies after the closing of the acquisition, along with the composition of the board of directors.\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe consolidated financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805,\n“Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”), which requires, among other things, that assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the\nacquisition date. The acquisition method of accounting uses the fair value concepts defined in ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement” (“ASC 820”). The preliminary fair value of purchase\nconsideration for the acquisition has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on a preliminary valuation of their respective fair values and may change when the final\nvaluation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is determined.\nThe following is an estimate of the allocation of the purchase price to acquired identifiable assets and assumed liabilities:\nPurchase Price Allocation Amounts\nCash and cash equivalents $ 17,355,360\nAccount receivable, net 4,321,191\nInventory, prizes 2,408,020\nProperty, plant & equipment 37,518\nOther assets 540,764\nliabilities (5,118,881)\nNet tangible assets 19,543,972\nGoodwill 58,188,969\nIntangible assets 30,210,000\nFair value of total estimated purchase consideration transferred $ 107,942,941\nThe fair value of the consideration transferred is based on the fair value of 36,742,287 outstanding shares of Golden Matrix’s common stock as of April 1, 2024, at a share price of $2.86 per\nshare on the same date, plus the fair value of 1,000 outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock. Since each share of Series B Preferred Stock can be converted into 1,000 shares of common\nstock, the fair value of the 1,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock is equivalent to 1,000,000 shares of common stock, also valued at $2.86 per share as of April 1, 2024.\nGolden Matrix’s results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on April 1, 2024.

Instead, for entities\nlike the MeridianBet Group, the primary resources are operating licenses, data, and software infrastructure. The ability to procure, process, and effectively utilize these resources plays a\nfundamental role in delivering competitive offerings and ensuring seamless and globally competitive operations.\n62\nTable of Contents\nData providers: Given that the essence of sports betting revolves around accurate and real-time data, data providers are a critical resource for the MeridianBet Group. The MeridianBet\nGroup relies on third-party data providers who deliver real-time sports data, statistical information, and analytical insights. This data underpins the companies’ sportsbook offering and feeds into\nthe dynamic odds-setting and risk management systems the brand uses. The availability of this data and the reliability of the providers are crucial for the daily operation of the MeridianBet\nGroup’s business.\nSoftware infrastructure: The MeridianBet Group’s proprietary sports betting technology forms the backbone of its operations. This includes its platform, which enables online and offline\nbetting across multiple geographies, currencies, broadband internet connectivity conditions and regulatory demands. Maintaining, updating, and enhancing this software infrastructure is vital to\nits capacity to deliver a seamless and secure betting experience. It also ensures its offerings remain cutting-edge and competitive.\nContent suppliers: In addition to data providers, the MeridianBet Group relies, to some extent, on various third-party suppliers for its gaming content, particularly in the areas of casino\ngames, slots, roulette, and other RNG games. The MeridianBet Group has a team of well-established and experienced professionals capable of creating a broad segment of user acquisition\ncontent. The availability of high-quality and diverse gaming content is key to attracting and retaining customers, which is why the portion of in-house built casino products is constantly growing.\nHuman resources: The MeridianBet Group relies on the skills and expertise of its workforce, which includes everyone from the cashiers and odds setters, to the software engineers who\nmaintain and develop its technical infrastructure, customer support personnel, who interface directly with the customers, as well as the compliance and regulatory team customer support\nrepresentatives.\nIntellectual Property\nThe MeridianBet Group’s intellectual property includes, among other things, extensive software-driven technological platforms, in-house developed games, licensed games, the content\nof its websites, its registered domain names, registered and unregistered trademarks, certain trade secrets, and licenses. The MeridianBet Group believes that its intellectual property is an\nessential asset of its business and that its registered domain names and technology infrastructure will give it a competitive advantage in the marketplace. The MeridianBet Group relies on a\ncombination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, as well as contractual provisions, to protect its proprietary technology and brands. The\nMeridianBet Group also relies on copyright laws to protect the appearance and design of its sites and applications, although to date it has not registered for copyright protection on any particular\ncontent. The MeridianBet Group has registered numerous Internet domain names related to its business in order to protect its proprietary interests.

Other registered trademarks include “Meridian” and “Expanse Studios.”\nThe information on, or that may be accessed through, the MeridianBet Group’s websites is not incorporated by reference into this filing and should not be considered a part of this filing.\nGovernmental Regulations\nI. General\nThe MeridianBet Group operates within a diverse regulatory environment across key markets. In general, gambling activities are controlled by a specific regulatory authority in each\ncountry, usually as a separate and autonomous public body. Such regulatory bodies are generally, in turn, subject to the authority of the subject country’s Ministry of Finance or equivalent.\nThese regulatory bodies are responsible for supervising the granting and revocation of licenses, inspecting retail premises and digital conditions of websites designated for providing betting and\ngaming services, and ensuring compliance with rules and regulations.\nProhibitions and sanctions in the regulatory landscape are generally similar across jurisdictions. In the event of noncompliance, regulatory authorities have various enforcement measures\nat their disposal. These measures may include sending compliance warnings and adherence requests, imposing financial fines, imposing temporary or permanent prohibitions on operations,\nseizing assets through bank guarantees, and mandating fines.\nThis regulatory framework also empowers commissions to inspect premises and take necessary actions if noncompliance is identified. This may involve temporarily or permanently\nclosing facilities and seizing equipment to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.\nII. Overview of the Licensing System\nThe licensing system varies across jurisdictions but generally involves a thorough evaluation of applicant suitability and adherence to regulatory requirements. Licenses are typically\ngranted by the regulatory authority after satisfying specific conditions and meeting the necessary criteria.\nThese conditions may include, but are not limited to, conducting background checks on the applicant, ensuring financial stability, conducting a personal fit-and-proper test of the entity’s\nultimate beneficial owner, designated directors and key management, and insisting the applicant demonstrate compliance with anti-money laundering regulations, implement responsible gaming\nmeasures, and provide secure and fair gaming environments for players (technical checks of the platform and services such as random number generator (RNG) certifications).\nSanctions for noncompliance with licensing requirements can range from warnings and fines to temporary or permanent revocation of licenses. Additionally, regulatory authorities may\nhave the power to impose other penalties, such as seizing assets or imposing mandatory fines.\nThe MeridianBet Group closely monitors the evolving regulatory landscape in each jurisdiction where it operates in order to comply with such rules. By maintaining proactive\nengagement with regulators, staying abreast of legal and regulatory developments, and implementing robust compliance measures, the MeridianBet Group demonstrates a commitment to\nresponsible and compliant operations.\n64\nTable of Contents\ni.

The MeridianBet Group actively monitors underage gambling and\nexploits to vulnerable customers, and takes steps to address problematic gaming. The MeridianBet Group promotes responsible gambling, fair and credible products and services, and implements\nsecurity measures against fraudulent behavior and gaming addiction. The MeridianBet Group also strictly prohibits access by minors and provides self-protection measures for customers.\n65\nTable of Contents\nIV. Responsible and Safer Gaming Policies and Standards\nThe MeridianBet Group is committed to responsible gambling, encompassing various aspects, to ensure a safe and transparent gaming environment. By implementing strict corporate\nstandards, the MeridianBet Group prioritizes fair and credible products and services, working to protect player’s privacy and ensuring responsible processing of payment data. The MeridianBet\nGroup’s vigilant monitoring seeks to prevent fraudulent behavior, complying with national and European Union anti-money laundering directives.\nThe Extent to Which the Business Is or May Be Seasonal\nLike many businesses in the gaming and betting industry, the MeridianBet Group experiences a degree of seasonality in its operations. In particular, its sports betting segment can be\naffected by the annual sports calendar. The months of late June and the first week of July tend to have less sports betting activity due to a decline in major sporting events during this period.\nThis is because many prominent sports leagues, such as football (soccer) and basketball, conclude their seasons in the late spring, and there’s often a pause before other significant sporting\nevents begin in mid-July and early October, respectively.\nHowever, the MeridianBet Group has implemented strategic measures to attempt to mitigate these seasonal downturns and ensure steady revenue flow throughout the year:\nDiversified offerings: The MeridianBet Group has a comprehensive portfolio of betting options that include casino games, eSports, and virtual sports, all of which are not dependent on\nreal-world sporting seasons. During quieter periods in the sports calendar, the MeridianBet Group intensifies the promotion of these other gaming products to attempt to maintain customer\nengagement and revenue.\nCross-selling: By developing an in-depth understanding of its customer base, the MeridianBet Group is able to effectively cross-sell its various product offerings. When sports betting\nactivities are low, it focuses on cross-selling efforts to promote other segments, primarily traditional casino games.\nGlobal market presence: Operating in multiple international markets allows the MeridianBet Group to benefit from different sports seasons across the world, which can offset seasonal\nslowdowns in certain regions such as Europe.\nCompetition\nThe competitive landscape of the gaming industry where the MeridianBet Group operates is varied yet complex, shaped by various factors such as regulatory environments, market\nsaturation and dynamics, technological advancements, and consumer behaviors. In each core market–- Serbia, Montenegro, Malta, and Cyprus–- the MeridianBet Group faces different levels of\ncompetition from several industry players, each with their own strategies and strengths.\nIn Serbia, the competitive landscape includes five companies which, together with about ten other operators of marginal materiality, comprise the bulk of the market. Each competitor runs\ndifferent business models based predominantly on capital intensive retail investments in slot technology, other gaming operations, and food-and-beverage and entertainment operations. Despite\na relative diversity of competition, the MeridianBet Group believes that it differentiates itself by offering unique value propositions (a leading number of standard and live betting options as well\nas online casino games), advanced betting technologies, and superior customer service.\nIn Montenegro, the MeridianBet Group has three relevant competitors. As the oldest market player in Montenegro, the MeridianBet Group attempts to distinguish itself through an\ninnovative product portfolio and a solid understanding of local market dynamics.\n66\nTable of Contents\nThe situation in Malta is unique given its regulatory status as a global gaming hub and a high-stakes environment marked by intense competition from several industry leaders.\nNevertheless, the MeridianBet Group believes it has a competitive advantage by leveraging its strong operational capabilities and adapting to the rapid market changes typical of such a dynamic\nindustry hub.\nIn Cyprus, the MeridianBet Group faces off against five competitors of varying market relevance. In this challenging competitive scenario, it focuses on customizing its product offerings\nto cater to the unique tastes and preferences of the local customer base.\nIrrespective of the geographical location, the MeridianBet Group operates in both online and retail segments. This dual-mode of operation allows the MeridianBet Group to serve a wider\ncustomer base, cater to different customer preferences, and remain resilient in the face of market uncertainties. In the online segment, the companies use advanced technologies to provide\nseamless and secure gaming experiences. In the retail segment, the MeridianBet Group focuses on building a network of strategically located betting shops to ensure easy accessibility for its\ncustomers.\nCompetition in the gaming industry is driven by several factors. These include, but are not limited to, (1) technological innovation, (2) the quality of customer service, (3) the variety and\nnovelty of betting and casino games and options offered, (4) promotional strategies, (5) pricing, and (6) trustworthiness. Given the high level of competition, operators like the MeridianBet Group\nconstantly innovate and refine their strategies to create competitive advantages and drive customer loyalty.\nDrawing on two decades of industry experience, the MeridianBet Group believes that it understands the nuances of each market and is able to tailor its strategies in an effort to navigate\nthe diverse competitive landscape. By focusing on its strengths and continuously enhancing its product offerings and service quality, the MeridianBet Group aims to maintain its competitive\nposition in the gaming industry.\nThe MeridianBet Group has taken a proactive approach to protecting the market for locally licensed operators by working closely with its own local licensee (where relevant, other\nlicensed operators, and local regulators and tax-collection agencies), all to ensure only licensed groups operate in its markets. These measures safeguard revenue collections for all three parties,\nmeaning the local operators, the tax authorities, and the MeridianBet Group, by working to prevent unlicensed third parties from illegally competing for gaming customers and diverting the\nauthorities’ attention from having to attempt to collect taxes on that competition. To date, these collaborative measures have not only reinforced the rule of law, but also resulted in ensuring the\nprompt flow of funds to taxing and regulatory authorities, and have had the effect of warding off any proposals by those authorities to increase taxes or fees on the local operators (and, by\nextension, the MeridianBet Group). That, in turn, has had the beneficial effect of allowing the local operators to keep their fees and charges low, ensuring that end-users will not become more\nattracted to black market offerings.\nDependence on One or a Few Major Customers\nThe MeridianBet Group, like almost all companies in the gaming industry, caters to a very broad and diverse customer base. The nature of the gaming sector is such that revenue is\nusually generated from a wide array of customers, as opposed to being concentrated in a single or a few major customers. This dispersion of customers minimizes the risk of revenue instability\ntied to any specific customer or group of customers.\nWith operations spread across several geographical locations, including Serbia, Montenegro, Malta, and Cyprus, the MeridianBet Group’s customer base is distributed across these\nregions. The MeridianBet Group also maintains a diverse demographic of customers in terms of age, gaming preferences, and betting behaviors.\nMoreover, the MeridianBet Group’s business model is designed to mitigate the dependence on a few significant customers. By offering a wide variety of games, betting options, and\ncustomer-focused services, the MeridianBet Group attracts a diverse group of customers, thus ensuring revenue continuity and stability.\n67\nTable of Contents\nProperties\nThe MeridianBet Group’s headquarters are located in Belgrade, Serbia. As of the date of this report, the MeridianBet Group owns or leases facilities for corporate functions, business\noperations, and other related purposes at locations throughout its numerous jurisdictions. The MeridianBet Group believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable\nsegments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the MeridianBet Group may be subject to legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. These may include, but are not\nlimited to, claims relating to: its products and services; workforce, technology, and business processes, such as worker classification and patent claims; and intellectual property, such as\ntrademarks and copyright infringement claims. The results of any future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and, regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the\nMeridianBet Group because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, harm to brand and reputation, and other factors.\nThe MeridianBet Group may become involved in material legal proceedings in the future.\nEmployees\nThe MeridianBet Group is committed to investing in its employees while nurturing a work environment that fosters global and cross functional collaboration. Its leadership team actively\nworks to attract, develop, and retain talent from a range of backgrounds and experiences.\nObjective and Growth Strategy\nOur objective in managing our resources is to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and meet our growth objectives while maximizing returns to shareholders.\nLiquidity is necessary to meet (i) the working capital needs of our operations, (ii) fund our growth and expansion plans, and (iii) consummate strategic acquisitions. We have met, and plan to\ncontinue to meet, our cash requirements through our operations and sales of equity and debt securities. As to the funding of strategic acquisitions, we may issue additional debt in addition to\nraising funds through the sales of the Company’s capital stock.\nThe Company’s financial performance is subject to global economic conditions and their impact on levels of spending by consumers and customers, particularly discretionary spending\nfor entertainment, gaming and leisure activities. Economic recessions may have adverse consequences across industries, including the global entertainment and gaming industries, which may\nadversely affect the Company’s business and financial condition. As a result of rising interest rates and inflation, there is substantial uncertainty about the strength of the global economies. In\naddition, changes in general market, economic and political conditions in domestic and foreign economies or financial markets, including fluctuation in stock markets resulting from, among other\nthings, trends in the economy, and increases in inflation and interest rates, as are being currently experienced, may reduce users’ disposable income and/or lead to recessions.\nWe believe that our business will continue to be resilient through a continued economic downturn or recession, or slowing or stalled recovery therefrom, and that we have the liquidity to\naddress the Company’s financial obligations and alleviate possible adverse effects on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\n68\nTable of Contents\nKey elements of our growth strategy include plans to:\n· Continue to invest in our people, technology, products and encouraging innovation.\n· Maintain organic revenue growth in all B2C markets.\n· Streamline business operations, improving processes identifying cost synergies and focusing on improving overall margins.\n· Execute on our roadmap and strategic business plans with diversity of gaming products, differentiated product strategy and cross-platform initiatives.\n· Expand our global reach by obtaining gaming licenses in existing and newly regulated markets within the Sportsbook and igaming industries.\n· Scale the distribution of our internally developed games from Expanse Studios.\n· Support our existing customers via AI tools and loyalty programs available via our recently updated technology systems.\n· Complete our 5th generation gaming software with improvements in metrics.\n· Expand our global reach by securing new gaming distributors, casino and sportsbook operator customers in existing and newly regulated markets.\n· Invest in sales and marketing initiatives to aggressively pursue new deployment opportunities in developing markets such as Africa and Central and South America, as well as\nexploring opportunities in the U.S.\n· Invest in sales and marketing initiatives to drive customers to our platforms in Europe, Asia, Africa and Central and South America.\n· Expand the prizes and prize options available to customers on our tournament platforms.\n· Pursue acquisitions of accretive and synergistic companies and assets with the goal of expanding our competitive position in the markets in which we operate.\nThe Company does not intend to make significant investments (except for potential acquisitions) to support our business growth strategy. We believe that our business model is highly\nscalable and our existing resources can be leveraged to (i) develop new offerings and features, (ii) enhance our existing platform, and (iii) improve our operating infrastructure.\nThe Company may face significant costs with respect to legal fees incurred in the applications for licenses, continued regulatory requirements, and legal representation.\nTo acquire complementary businesses and technologies, we may need to pursue equity or debt financing to secure additional funds. Our ability to obtain additional capital will depend on\nour business plans, investor demand, our operating performance, capital markets conditions and other factors. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those\nsecurities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our then issued and outstanding equity or debt, and our existing shareholders may experience dilution. If we are unable\nto obtain additional capital when required, or on satisfactory terms, our ability to continue to support our business growth or to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen\ncircumstances could be adversely affected, and our business may be harmed.\nWe may acquire other businesses, and our business may be detrimentally affected if we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our company or otherwise manage\nthe growth associated with multiple acquisitions.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to make acquisitions of new or complementary businesses, products, brands, or technologies. In some cases, the costs of such acquisitions\nmay be substantial, including the costs of professional fees and due diligence efforts. There is no assurance that the time and resources expended on pursuing a particular acquisition will result in\na completed transaction, or that any completed transaction will ultimately be successful. In addition, we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition or strategic investment opportunities or may\nbe unable to obtain the required financing or regulatory approvals, and therefore we may be unable to complete such acquisitions or strategic investments on favorable terms. We may pursue\nacquisitions that our investors may not agree with, and we cannot assure investors that any acquisition or investment will be successful or otherwise provide a favorable return on investment. In\naddition, if we fail to successfully close transactions, integrate new technology or operational teams, or integrate the products and technologies associated with these acquisitions into our\ncompany, our business could be seriously harmed.\n69\nTable of Contents\nRecent Events\nFifth Amendment to Amended and Restated Sale and Purchase Agreement of Share Capital\nSee “NOTE 23 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS” in the notes to the financial statements included under “Item 1.

EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA are “non-GAAP financial measures” presented as a supplemental measure of the Company’s performance. They are not presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company\nuses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a metric of profits and successful operations management. In particular, we use Adjusted EBITDA as a milestone for the purposes of certain incentive\ncompensation programs applicable to some of our officers and directors, in order to evaluate our company’s performance and determine whether certain restricted stock units vest as of the end of\nDecember 31, 2024. EBITDA means net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA means EBITDA before stock-based compensation, and restructuring\ncosts which include charges or expenses attributable to acquisition related costs. Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as supplemental to, and not as an alternative for net income or loss\ncalculated in accordance with GAAP.\n72\nTable of Contents\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because we believe it provides additional useful information to investors due to the various noncash items during the period. EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are unaudited, and have\nlimitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash expenditures, or future or contractual commitments; EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, capital\nexpenditures or working capital needs; EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments,\non debt or cash income tax payments; although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. In addition, other companies in this industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\ndifferently than the Company does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. The Company’s presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that future results\nwill be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure,\nbelow. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in their entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view non-\nGAAP measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nReconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to Net income (loss):\nThree Months Period Ended Nine Months Period Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income (loss) $ (3,295,629) $ 3,520,060 $ 669,019 $ 11,886,052\n+ Interest expense 790,193 4,049 827,048 31,930\n- Interest income (58,475) (25,807) (163,023) (35,532)\n+ Taxes 1,864,122 316,733 2,670,788 1,148,270\n+ Depreciation 1,145,210 878,516 3,173,473 2,670,258\n+ Amortization 1,962,157 473,047 4,317,523 1,357,453\nEBITDA $ 2,407,578 $ 5,166,598 $ 11,494,828 $ 17,058,431\n+ Stock-based compensation 1,614,751 - 3,252,803 -\n+ Restructuring costs 314,555 112,488 906,286 313,699\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 4,336,884 5,279,086 15,653,917 17,372,130\nResults of Operations\nThree months endedSeptember 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations for the interim periods indicated, and the changes between the periods.

General and administrative expenses consisted primarily of stock-based compensation, depreciation expenses, amortization expenses,\nsalary and wages, professional fees, marketing expenses, rents and utilities.\nStock-based compensation (within G&A) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $3,203,212, compared to $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a $3,203,212\nincrease from the prior period, which was due mainly to RSUs granted to employees and directors of the Company, as well as shares issued for services during the period.\nAmortization expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were $4,317,523, compared to $1,357,453 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a $2,960,070, or 218%\nincrease from the prior period, which was due mainly to the amortization of the new intangible assets recognized as a result of the acquisition of Golden Matrix.\nSalaries and wages for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were $15,287,955, compared to $10,617,553 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a $4,670,402 or 44% increase\nfrom the prior period, which was due partially to $1,723,740 of salaries paid to employees of Golden Matrix after the acquisition. Salaries paid to employees of the MeridianBet Group increased by\n$2,946,662, which was due mainly to increased headcount to both support revenue growth and to enable the entry into new markets for the current period, as well as an increase in employee\nsalaries, compared to the prior period.\n77\nTable of Contents\nProfessional fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were $2,578,121, compared to $1,405,627 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a $1,172,494 or 83% increase from\nthe prior period, which was due partially to the $618,144 of professional fees of Golden Matrix after the acquisition, in connection with the acquisition of Classics, fund raising and accounting\nfees. Professional fees of MeridianBet Group increased by $554,350, which was mainly due to consulting services as well as legal and audit services, in connection with the acquisition with\nGolden Matrix.\nMarketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were $12,731,111, compared to $9,055,553 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a $3,675,558 or 41% increase\nfrom the prior period, which was due partially to the $2,101,402 of marketing fees from Golden Matrix after the acquisition, in connection with prize competitions in the UK, trade promotions in\nAustralia and online casino business in Mexico, and the resale of gaming content in the Asia Pacific region. Marketing expenses of MeridianBet Group increased by $1,574,156, primarily driven by\nour focused efforts around the European football/soccer championship (EURO 2024, June/July '24) and the Summer Olympic Games in August/September ‘24. We invested in new video content\non YouTube, TV commercials, billboards, and strategic sponsorships. Additionally, our expanded online campaigns on Facebook and Google, along with organizing trips for our customers, reflect\nour traditionally rooted commitment to investing in customer engagement and brand visibility.\nRents and utilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were $4,948,076, compared to $4,132,949 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an $815,127 or 20% increase from\nthe prior period, which was mainly due to the opening of new betting shops, which contributed to the growth of rent and utility costs, as well as the general increase in heating, electricity,\ntelephone and internet costs, due to inflationary trends.\nInterest expense. The interest expense increased by $795,118, or 2,490%, to $827,048 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from $31,930 for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. The increase was mainly due to the amortization of debt discount related to the issuance of the Secured Convertible Note.\nInterest earned. The interest earned increased by $127,491, or 359%, to $163,023 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from $35,532 for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. The increase was mainly due to earned interest income from term deposits with banks.\nForeign exchange loss. The foreign exchange loss increased by $(658,433), to $(337,581) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from a gain of $320,852 for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. This increased loss was primarily due to the depreciation of the USD against the Euro and GBP, currencies in which the Company holds debts.\nOther Income. Other income is related to income from marketing services for third-party advertising in MeridianBet Group betting shops, sale of fixed assets, value-added-tax (VAT)\nrefunds, income from compensation for damages, income from reduction of liabilities and other income that is not directly related to the Company's core activity. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, and 2023, other income amounted to $1,498,563 and $725,372, respectively. The increase of $773,191 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus the nine months\nended September 30, 2023, is attributable to other operating income from the franchise partners such as marketing services, customer support services, staff training services etc.\nProvision for income taxes . The provision for income tax increased by $1,522,518, or 133%, to $2,670,788 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from $1,148,270 in the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributed to (a) $1,468,472 income tax accrued for dispute detailed in NOTE 21 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES, and (b)\n$466,014 in income taxes from prize competitions in the UK and trade promotions in Australia, acquired as of April 1, 2024 as part of the Golden Matrix acquisition, partially offset by a $411,968\ndecrease in income taxes from MeridianBet Group.\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest. Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity is measured at their proportionate share of the\nacquired entity’s and for (a) Bit Tech Tanzania in the percentage of 10%, (b) Meridian Gaming Peru in the percentage of 24.5%, (c) Fair Champions Meridian Cyprus in the percentage of 49%, and\n(d) Classics Holding Pty Ltd Australia in the percentage of 20%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest amounted to $18,924\nand $171,159, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the net loss incurred by the companies for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nNet income attributable to GMGI. Net income attributable to GMGI decreased by $11,064,798, or 94%, to net income $650,095 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from net\nincome of $11,714,893 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to an increase in the general and administrative expenses, foreign exchange losses, interest\nexpenses, and provision for income taxes as discussed above.\nOur operating results are difficult to forecast. Our prospects should be evaluated in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties commonly encountered by comparable development stage\ncompanies.\n78\nTable of Contents\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated unaudited financial statements, which have been prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these unaudited financial statements requires management to make estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates past\njudgments and estimates, including those related to bad debts, accrued liabilities, goodwill and contingencies. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other\nassumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not\nreadily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The accounting policies and related risks described in the\nCompany’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2023, filed with the Commission on January 17, 2024, are those that depend most heavily on these judgments and\nestimates. As of September 30, 2024, there had been no material changes to any of the critical accounting policies contained therein. “NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES,” of the\nnotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2023, filed with the Commission on January 17, 2024, describes\nthe significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting estimates include transactions, assets,\nliabilities and obligations that are stated in foreign local currency and their conversion to US currency. Resulting loss on currency conversions related to assets and liabilities is recognized in\nshareholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and realized foreign currency translation adjustments are recognized in\nother income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nItem 3. Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nPursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K (§ 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a “smaller reporting company,” as defined by\nRule 229.10(f)(1).\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures\nThe Company’s Chief Executive Officer (the principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial/accounting officer) have evaluated the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon such evaluation, the Chief Executive\nOfficer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that\ninformation required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act, is recorded properly, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the rules and forms of the Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosures.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide\nonly reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and\nthat management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n79\nTable of Contents\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nAlthough we may, from time to time, be involved in litigation and claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business, we are not currently a party to any material legal\nproceeding, except as discussed under “Note 21 – Commitments and Contingences”, under the heading Legal Matters, in the notes to the financial statements included under “Item 1. Financial\nStatements”, which are incorporated by reference into this “Item 1. Legal Proceedings”. In addition, we are not aware of any material legal or governmental proceedings against us or contemplated\nto be brought against us. The impact and outcome of litigation, if any, is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm\nour business. We believe the ultimate resolution of any such current proceeding will not have a material adverse effect on our continued financial position, results of operations or cash flows;\nhowever, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s\nexpectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThere have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2023, filed with the\nCommission on January 17, 2024 (the “Form 10-K”), under the heading “Risk Factors”, except as discussed below, and investors should review the risks provided in the Form 10-K and below,\nprior to making an investment in the Company. The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or\nunknown, including but not limited to those described in the Form 10-K, under “Risk Factors”, and below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company’s actual\nfinancial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial conditions and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could\nmaterially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.\nAleksandar Milovanović beneficially owns greater than 50% of our outstanding shares of common stock, which means that we are deemed a “controlled company” under the rules\nof Nasdaq and allows him to exercise significant voting control over us, which limits shareholders’ abilities to influence corporate matters and could delay or prevent a change in corporate\ncontrol.\nAleksandar Milovanović, currently controls approximately 58.3% of the voting power of our capital stock. As a result, we are a “controlled company” under the rules of Nasdaq. Under\nthese rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group or another company is a “controlled company” and can elect to be exempt from certain\ncorporate governance requirements, including requirements that:\n· a majority of the Board of Directors consist of independent directors;\n· the board maintains a nominations committee with prescribed duties and a written charter; and\n· the board maintains a Compensation Committee with prescribed duties and a written charter and comprised solely of independent directors.\n80\nTable of Contents\nAs a “controlled company,” we may elect to rely on some or all of these exemptions, although we do not currently intend to take advantage of any of these exemptions. Accordingly,\nshould the interests of Mr. Milovanović differ from those of other stockholders, and/or we choose to take advantage of the “controlled company” exemptions, other stockholders may not have\nthe same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the Nasdaq corporate governance standards. Even if we do not avail ourselves of these exemptions in the\nfuture, our status as a controlled company could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price. If we choose to take advantage of the exemptions\nunder the rules of Nasdaq relating to “controlled companies” in the future, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate\ngovernance requirements of Nasdaq.\nAdditionally, a required term and condition of the closing of the MeridianBet Group acquisition (the “Closing”) was that the Company and each of the Sellers enter into a Nominating and\nVoting Agreement, which provides among other things, that each Seller will vote their voting shares “For” appointment of those director nominees, nominated to the Board by the independent\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee which is composed of two members and not vote their shares to remove any directors nominated by the committee, subject to certain\nexceptions.\nAnother required term and condition of the Closing was that the Company and Mr. Milošević enter into a Day-to-Day Management Agreement, which prohibits the Company or its\nexecutives from materially interfering in the operation of the business of, and day-to-day operations of, MeridianBet Group by its current leadership (i.e., Mr. Milošević, as Chief Executive Officer),\nwhile the Voting Agreement is in place.\nConsequently, Company stockholders have less influence over the management and policies of the Company and the Sellers are effectively in control of the Company.\nAs a result of his significant ownership in the Company, Mr. Milošević has significant influence on the shareholder vote. Consequently, he has the ability to influence matters affecting\nour shareholders and therefore exercise control in determining the outcome of a number of corporate transactions or other matters, including (i) making amendments to our certificate of\nincorporation; (ii) whether to issue additional shares of common stock and preferred stock, including to himself; (iii) employment decisions, including compensation arrangements; (iv) whether to\nenter into material transactions with related parties; (v) election of directors; and (vi) any merger or significant corporate transactions, including with himself or other related parties. As a potential\ninvestor in the Company, you should keep in mind that even if you own shares of our common stock and wish to vote them at annual or special shareholder meetings, your shares will have little\neffect on the outcome of corporate decisions. Because Mr. Milošević will significantly influence the vote on all shareholder matters, investors may find it difficult to replace our management if\nthey disagree with the way our business is being operated. The interests of Mr. Milošević may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other shareholders.\nIn addition, this concentration of ownership might adversely affect the market price of our common stock by: (1) delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of our Company; (2)\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving our Company; or (3) discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to\nobtain control of our Company.\nThe issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and exercise of warrants will cause immediate and substantial dilution to existing shareholders.\nCommencing on September 20, 2024, the Company was required to begin paying the outstanding principal amount of the Secured Convertible Note in 20 consecutive monthly payments\nof $600,000 each, provided that between payment dates, the Investor may increase the Repayment Amount, to up to $1,000,000 by providing written notice to the Company with such payment to\nbe due and payable within two days of the receipt of such notice, for up to two monthly payments while the Note is outstanding.\n81\nTable of Contents\nAt the option of the Company, the monthly payment can be made in cash, shares of the common stock of the Company at a price based on 90% of the average five (5) lowest daily volume\nweighted average prices during the twenty (20) days prior to the payment date subject to a floor price of $1.75 per share, or a combination of cash and Repayment Shares, provided that if at the\ntime the Repayment Share Price is deemed to be the Floor Price, then in addition to the Repayment Shares, the Company will pay the Investor an added amount of cash as determined pursuant to\na formula contained in the Note. In order for the Company to issue any Repayment Shares, the Repayment Shares must either be eligible for immediate resale under Rule 144 or be registered under\nthe Securities Act. Any portion of a monthly payment being made in cash shall include a premium of five percent (5%) of such cash amount. The conversion price of the Note is $4.00, a 150%\npremium over the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date the Purchase Agreement was entered into, subject to customary adjustments, however, if new securities, other than\nexempted securities, are issued by the Company at a price less than the conversion price, the conversion price shall be reduced to such price, subject to the Floor Price.\nThe Lind Warrant entitles the holder to purchase up to 750,000 shares of common stock of the Company until July 1, 2029, at an exercise price of $4.00 per Warrant Share, subject to\ncustomary adjustments. In addition, the exercise price is subject to adjustment in the event of the issuance of new securities, other than exempted securities, at an effective price less than the\nexercise price, which results in the exercise price being reduced to an exercise price equal to the consideration per share deemed to have been paid for such new securities, subject to a minimum\nexercise price of $2.25. The Lind Warrant also provides for cashless exercise to the extent that the Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise thereof are not covered by an effective registration\nstatement or upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the Lind Warrant) and automatic exercise rights upon expiration of the Lind Warrant, to the extent that the VWAP\nof the Company’s common stock on the day immediately preceding the expiration date is more than the exercise price, and the Warrant Shares are not then covered by an effective registration\nstatement. The Lind Warrant is also subject to a similar Maximum Percentage limitation as set forth in the Secured Convertible Note.\nThe Deferred Cash Convertible Promissory Note with Milovanović (together with the Secured Convertible Note, the “Convertible Notes”) has a current principal balance of $0.7 million\nand does not accrue interest unless an event of default thereunder occurs and upon an event of default accrues interest at 12% per annum. The full amount of the Deferred Cash Convertible Note\nis due and payable on December 17, 2025, unless earlier paid. Milovanović has the right, from time to time, to declare the remaining balance of the Deferred Cash Convertible Note to be due and\npayable, prior to January 1, 2025, upon written notice to the Company, after which the Company has three days to pay such amount(s).\nThe Deferred Cash Convertible Note is convertible into shares of common stock of the Company, at any time, from time to time, at the option of Milovanović, with written notice to the\nCompany, based on a conversion price, determined at the option of Milovanović of either (A) (i) the average closing sales price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq market over the\nthirty trading day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the conversion notice; (ii) minus a discount of 15%; or (B) $3.00, subject to a floor of $2.00 per share.\nOn July 1, 2024 and July 31, 2024, a total of $97,419 and $96,910 of the Deferred Cash Convertible Note was repaid by the Company. On September 4, 2024, a total of $2,000,000 owed under\nthe Deferred Cash Convertible Note was converted into 1,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company pursuant to the terms of the Deferred Cash Convertible Note. On September 23, 2024, a\ntotal of $100,504 of the Convertible Note was repaid. As of September 30, 2024 and the date of this Report, a total of $705,167 remained outstanding under the Deferred Cash Convertible Note.\nThe issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and exercise of the Lind Warrants will result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests of other\nstockholders since the holders of the Convertible Notes and the Lind Warrants may ultimately receive and sell the full amount of shares issuable in connection with the conversion of such\nConvertible Notes and exercise of the Lind Warrants. Although the Secured Convertible Note and Lind Warrant may not be converted/exercised by the holder thereof if such conversion would\ncause such holder to own more than 4.99% of our outstanding common stock (which may be increased to 9.99% as set forth in the Note and the Lind Warrant), these restrictions do not prevent\nsuch holder from converting/exercising some of their holdings, selling those shares, and then converting/exercising the rest of their holdings, while still staying below the 4.99% limit. In this way,\nthe holder could sell more than these limits while never actually holding more shares than the limits allow. If the holder of the Secured Convertible Note chooses to do this, it will cause substantial\ndilution to the then holders of our common stock.\n82\nTable of Contents\nThe availability of shares of common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes or exercise of the Lind Warrants for public resale, as well as any actual resales of these shares,\ncould adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock upon the conversion of our Convertible Notes or exercise of\nLind Warrants, or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock may have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial\namounts of our common stock upon the conversion of our Convertible Notes or exercise of the Lind Warrants, or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our\ncommon stock to decline.\nIn addition, the common stock issuable upon the conversion of our Convertible Notes and exercise of the Lind Warrants may represent overhang that may also adversely affect the\nmarket price of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a company’s stock in the market than there is demand for that stock. When this happens the price of our\nstock will decrease, and any additional shares which stockholders attempt to sell in the market will only further decrease the share price. If the share volume of our common stock cannot absorb\nshares sold by holders of the Convertible Notes and the Lind Warrants, then the value of our common stock will likely decrease.\nWe are required to file a registration statement to permit the public resale of the shares of common stock that may be issued upon the conversion of the Secured Convertible Note and\nexercise of the Lind Warrants, which was declared effective on September 20, 2024. The influx of those shares into the public market could potentially have a negative effect on the trading price of\nour common stock.\nWe are required to make amortization payments of the amounts owed under the Secured Convertible Note upon the occurrence of certain events and we may not have sufficient cash\nto make such payments, if required.\nCommencing September 20, 2024, we were required to begin paying the outstanding principal amount of the Note in 20 consecutive monthly payments of $600,000 each (the first payment\nof which was timely made), provided that between payment dates, the Investor (Lind Global Asset Management VIII LLC) may increase the Repayment Amount, to up to $1,000,000 by providing\nwritten notice to the Company with such payment to be due and payable within two days of the receipt of such notice, for up to two monthly payments while the Secured Convertible Note is\noutstanding. At the option of the Company, the monthly payment can be made in cash, shares of the common stock of the Company at a price based on 90% of the average five (5) lowest daily\nvolume weighted average prices during the twenty (20) days prior to the payment date subject to a floor price of $1.75 per share, or a combination of cash and Repayment Shares, provided that if\nat the time the Repayment Share Price is deemed to be the Floor Price, then in addition to the Repayment Shares, the Company will pay the Investor an added amount of cash as determined\npursuant to a formula contained in the Secured Convertible Note. In order for the Company to issue any Repayment Shares, the Repayment Shares must either be eligible for immediate resale\nunder Rule 144 or be registered under the Securities Act. Any portion of a monthly payment being made in cash shall include a premium of five percent (5%) of such cash amount.\nWe may not have cash available to pay the required Repayment Amounts and the payment of the Repayment Amount in shares of common stock may cause significant dilution to\nexisting shareholders.\nWe face significant penalties if we fail to keep effective the required registration statement to register the resale of the Note Shares and Warrant Shares.\nThe Company agreed to file a registration statement (with the Securities and Exchange Commission no later than sixty (60) days from July 1, 2024, covering the resale of all of the shares of\ncommon stock of the Company issuable to the Investor pursuant to the Note and the Lind Warrant, which was timely filed and became effective on September 20, 2024. The Investor was also\ngranted piggyback registration rights. Events of default include, but are not limited to, a payment default on any other indebtedness in excess of $500,000; failure to observe or perform any other\ncovenant, condition or agreement contained in the Secured Convertible Note or any transaction documents; failure of the Company to instruct its transfer agent to issue unlegended share\ncertificates; the Company’s shares are no longer publicly-traded or cease to be listed; if after six months, the shares are not available for immediate resale under Rule 144; and at any time after\nDecember 3, 2024, the Company’s market capitalization is below $250 million for ten consecutive days. Upon an event of default, subject to any applicable cure periods, the holder may demand\nthat all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount be converted into shares of common stock of the Company at the lower of the conversion price and 80% of the average of the three lowest\ndaily VWAPs during the 20 days prior to the delivery of the conversion notice, subject to the Floor Price, provided that if at the time of such demand the conversion price is deemed to be the\nFloor Price, then in addition, to the shares of common stock of the Company at the Floor Price, the Company will pay the holder an additional amount of cash as determined pursuant to a formula\ncontained in the Secured Convertible Note. Upon the occurrence of an event of default as described in the Secured Convertible Note and subject to certain cure rights set forth therein, the holder\nmay at any time at its option declare the Secured Convertible Note immediately due and payable, together with an additional 20% of the outstanding principal amount thereof.\n83\nTable of Contents\nThe failure to maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement could require us to pay significant penalties to the Investor and/or could reduce the conversion price of the\nSecured Convertible Note.\nEconomic downturns and adverse political and market conditions could adversely negatively affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company’s financial performance is subject to European, African, Central and South American, and Asian Pacific economic conditions and their impact on levels of spending by\nconsumers and customers, particularly discretionary spending for entertainment, gaming and leisure activities. Demand for the Company’s products may also decline as a result of an economic\ndownturn, or economic uncertainty in the Company’s key markets, particularly in Europe, Africa, Central and South America, Asia Pacific and Mexico. Economic recessions have had, and may\ncontinue to have, far reaching adverse consequences across industries, including the global entertainment and gaming industries, which may adversely affect the Company’s business and\nfinancial condition. There is currently substantial uncertainty about the strength of the European, African, and Central and South American economies, which may currently or in the near term be\nin a recession and have experienced rapid increases in uncertainty about the pace of potential recovery. A continued economic downturn or recession, or slowing or stalled recovery therefrom,\nmay have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nIn addition, changes in general market, economic, and political conditions in domestic and foreign economies or financial markets, including fluctuation in stock markets resulting from,\namong other things, trends in the economy and inflation, as are being currently experienced in certain countries, may reduce users’ disposable income. Any one of these changes could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nAdditionally, the Company’s business depends on the overall demand for gaming platforms, systems and gaming content and other technology offerings, and on the economic health of\ncustomers that benefit from the Company’s products. Economic downturns or unstable market conditions may cause customers to decrease their spending on the Company’s products and\nadversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations (although sometimes, paradoxically, it has the opposite effect). Similarly, economic downturns could also\ndecrease the amount of disposable income end-users have available for gaming platforms, systems and gaming content. Additionally, as described above, public health crises may disrupt the\noperations of the Company’s customers and partners for an unknown period of time, including as a result of travel restrictions and/or business shutdowns, all of which could negatively impact\nthe Company’s business and results of operations, including cash flows.\nEconomic uncertainty may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items, which has affected and may continue to adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and\nservices.\nThe Company’s products and services may be considered discretionary items for consumers. Factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include\ngeneral economic conditions and other factors such as consumer confidence in future economic conditions, fears of recession and trade wars, the price of energy, fluctuating interest rates, the\navailability and cost of consumer credit, the availability and timing of government stimulus programs, levels of unemployment, inflation, and tax rates. As global economic conditions continue to\nbe volatile or economic uncertainty remains, and with increasing inflation and interest rates, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to reductions as a\nresult of significant increases in employment, financial market instability, and uncertainties about the future. Unfavorable economic conditions have led, and in the future may lead, consumers to\nreduce their spending on gaming products and services, which in turn leads to a decrease in the demand for the Company’s products and services. Consumer demand for the products and\nservices of the Company may decline as a result of an economic downturn, or economic uncertainty. The Company’s sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer\ndemand may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n84\nTable of Contents\nIn February 2022, an armed conflict escalated between Russia and Ukraine. The sanctions announced by the United States and other countries against Russia and Belarus following\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine to date include restrictions on selling or importing goods, services, or technology in or from affected regions and travel bans and asset freezes impacting connected\nindividuals and political, military, business, and financial organizations in Russia and Belarus. The United States and other countries could impose wider sanctions and take other actions should\nthe conflict further escalate. Separately, in October 2023, Israel and certain Iranian-backed Palestinian forces began an armed conflict in Israel, the Gaza Strip, and surrounding areas. Although the\nCompany does not currently, and does not plan to, do business in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, or Israel, it is not possible to predict the broader consequences of these ongoing conflicts, which\ncould include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts. It is also not possible to predict with certainty these ongoing conflicts and additional adverse effects on\nexisting macroeconomic conditions, consumer spending habits, currency exchange rates, and financial markets, all of which have impacted and could further impact the business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations of the Company.\nA reduction in discretionary consumer spending, from an economic downturn or disruption of financial markets or other factors, could negatively impact the financial\nperformance of the Company.\nGaming and other leisure activities that the Company and its customers offer represent discretionary expenditures and players’ participation in those activities may decline if discretionary\nconsumer spending declines, including during economic downturns, when consumers generally earn less disposable income. Changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer\npreferences are driven by factors beyond the Company’s control, such as:\n· perceived or actual general economic conditions;\n· fears of recession and changes in consumer confidence in the economy;\n· high energy, fuel and other commodity costs;\n· the potential for bank failures or other financial crises;\n· a soft job market;\n· an actual or perceived decrease in disposable consumer income and wealth;\n· increases in taxes, including gaming taxes or fees; and\n· terrorist attacks or other global events.\nDuring periods of economic contraction, the Company’s revenues may decrease while most of the Company’s costs remain fixed and some costs even increase, resulting in decreased\nearnings.\nThe Company’s financial performance is, and will be, subject to European, African, Central and South American, Asian Pacific and Mexican economic conditions and their impact on\nlevels of spending by consumers and customers, particularly discretionary spending for entertainment, gaming and leisure activities. Economic recessions may have adverse consequences across\nindustries, including the global entertainment and gaming industries, which may adversely affect the Company’s business and financial condition. There is substantial uncertainty about the\nstrength of the European, African, Central and South American, Asian Pacific and Mexican economies, which may currently or in the near term be in a recession and have experienced rapid\nincreases in uncertainty about the pace of potential recovery. In addition, changes in general market, economic and political conditions in domestic and foreign economies or financial markets,\nincluding fluctuation in stock markets resulting from, among other things, trends in the economy and inflation, as are being currently experienced, may reduce users’ disposable income.\n85\nTable of Contents\nWe believe that the Company’s business will continue to be resilient through a continued economic downturn or recession, or slowing or stalled recovery therefrom, and that the\nCompany will have the liquidity to address the Company’s financial obligations and alleviate possible adverse effects on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or\nprospects.\nThe Company’s ongoing investments in new products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could divert management attention and harm the Company’s financial\ncondition and operating results.\nThe Company has invested in new products, services, and technologies. Such investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital\nand, in pursuing new strategies, the entities may incur unanticipated liabilities. These endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of resources and management\nattention from then current operations. In addition, new and evolving products and services, raise technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect the\nCompany’s brand and demand for its products and services. Because all of these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be\nsuccessful and will not harm the reputation, financial condition, and operating results of the Company.\nThe Company operates in a rapidly evolving industry and if it fails to successfully develop, market or sell new products or adopt new technology, it could materially adversely\naffect its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company competes in a market characterized by rapid technological advances, evolving standards in software technology and frequent new product introductions and\nenhancements that may render existing products and services obsolete. Competitors are continuously upgrading their product offerings with new features, functions and content. In order to\nremain competitive, the Company will need to continuously modify and enhance its technology platform and service offerings. The Company may not be able to respond to rapid technological\nchanges in its industry. In addition, the introduction of new products or updated versions of existing products has inherent risks, including, but not limited to, risks concerning:\n· product quality, including the possibility of software defects, which could result in claims against us or the inability to sell our products;\n· the accuracy of our estimates of customer demand, and the fit of the new products and features with a customer’s needs;\n· the need to educate our personnel to work with the new products and features, which may strain our resources and lengthen sales;\n· market acceptance of initial product releases; and\n· competitor product introductions or regulatory changes that render our new products obsolete.\nThe Company may not be successful in creating new technology for its products in the future. The Company may encounter errors resulting from a significant rewrite of software code. In\naddition, as the Company transitions to newer technology platforms for its products, its customers may encounter difficulties in the upgrade process, which could cause the Company to lose\nrevenue.\nDeveloping, enhancing and localizing software is expensive, and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle. The Company’s future plans include\nadditional investments in development of the Company’s software and other intellectual property. We will need to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to development efforts\nto maintain our competitive position. However, the Company may not receive significant revenue from these investments for several years, if at all. In addition, as the Company or its competitors\nintroduce new or enhanced products, the demand for the Company’s products, particularly older versions of the Company’s products may decline.\n86\nTable of Contents\nIf the Company is not able to compete effectively against companies with greater resources, the Company’s prospects for future success will be jeopardized.\nThe gaming platforms, systems and gaming content industries are highly competitive. The Company competes with numerous local competitors for such services. Many of the\nCompany’s competitors are larger, more established companies with greater resources to devote to marketing, as well as greater brand recognition. Moreover, if one or more of the Company’s\ncompetitors or suppliers were to merge, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect the Company’s competitive position. If we do not compete effectively, the Company’s net\nsales, margins, and profitability and the Company’s future prospects for success may be harmed.\nChanges in ownership of competitors or consolidations within the gaming industry may negatively impact pricing and lead to downward pricing pressures which could\nreduce the revenue of the Company.\nA decline in demand for the products and services of the Company in the gaming industry could adversely affect the Company’s business. Demand for the Company’s products and\nservices is driven primarily by the expansion of existing online gaming, and the expansion of new channels of distribution, such as online gaming via cellphones and other devices. Additionally,\nconsolidation within the online gambling market could result in the Company facing competition from larger combined entities, which may benefit from greater resources and economies of scale.\nAlso, any fragmentation within the industry creating a number of smaller, independent operators with fewer resources could also adversely affect the Company’s business as these operators\nmight cause a further slowdown in the replacement cycle for the Company’s products.\nThe online gaming industry is highly competitive, and if the Company fails to compete effectively, it could experience price reductions, reduced margins or loss of revenues.\nThe online gaming industry is highly competitive. A number of companies offer products and services that are similar to the Company’s products and services and target the same\nmarkets as the Company. Certain of the Company’s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources, greater\nname recognition, broader or more integrated product offerings, larger technical staffs and a larger installed customer base than it does. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly to\nnew or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, develop superior products, and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of the Company’s\nproducts than the Company can.\nBecause of the rapid growth of the gaming industry, and the relatively low capital barriers to entry in the software industry, the Company expects additional competition from other\nestablished and emerging companies. Additionally, the Company’s competitors could combine or merge to become more formidable competitors or may adapt more quickly than we can to new\ntechnologies, evolving industry trends and changing customer requirements. If we fail to compete effectively, (a) we could be compelled to reduce prices in order to be competitive, which could\nreduce margins, or (b) we would lose market share, any of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s strategy, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCompetition within the global entertainment and gaming industries is intense and the existing and future offerings of the Company may not be able to compete against other\ncompeting forms of entertainment such as television, movies and sporting events, as well as other entertainment and gaming options on the Internet. If the Company’s offerings do not\ncontinue to be popular, the Company’s business could be harmed.\nThe Company operates in the global entertainment and gaming industries. The users of the Company’s offerings face a vast array of entertainment choices. Other forms of entertainment,\nsuch as television, movies, sporting events and in-person casinos, are more well established and may be perceived by users to offer greater variety, affordability, interactivity and enjoyment. The\nCompany’s products and services compete with these other forms of entertainment for the discretionary time and income of end users. If we are unable to sustain sufficient interest in the\nCompany’s products, services and offerings in comparison to other forms of entertainment, including new forms of entertainment, the Company’s business model may not continue to be viable.\n87\nTable of Contents\nThe Company faces the risk of fraud, theft, and cheating.\nThe Company faces the risk that third-parties, employees or consultants may attempt or commit fraud or theft or cheat using the Company’s products. Such risks include backdoors,\nnefarious code and other efforts. Failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely manner could result in losses in the Company’s operations and those of the Company’s customers. Negative\npublicity related to such acts or schemes could have an adverse effect on the Company’s reputation, potentially causing a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.\nThe Company faces cyber security risks that could result in damage to the Company’s reputation and/or subject them to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits and restrictions on the\nCompany’s use of data.\nThe information systems and data of the Company, including those they maintain with the Company’s third-party service providers, may be subject to cyber security breaches in the\nfuture. Computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate the Company’s network security and misappropriate, copy or pirate the Company’s confidential information or that of third\nparties, create system disruptions or cause interruptions or shutdowns of the Company’s internal systems and services. The Company’s websites may become subject to denial-of-service\nattacks, where a website is bombarded with information requests eventually causing the website to overload, resulting in a delay or disruption of service. Computer programmers and hackers also\nmay be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack the Company’s products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of the Company’s\nproducts. Also, there is a growing trend of advanced persistent threats being launched by organized and coordinated groups against corporate networks to breach security for malicious\npurposes.\nThe techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper, or illegal access to the Company’s systems, the Company’s data or customers’ data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage\nsystems are constantly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been\nlaunched. Although the Company has developed, and plans to develop, systems and processes designed to protect the Company’s data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other\nsecurity breaches and expects to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections, there can be no assurance that these security measures will provide absolute security.\nDisruptions in the availability of their computer systems, through cyber-attacks or otherwise, could damage our computer or telecommunications systems, impact our ability to service our\ncustomers, adversely affect our operations and results of operations, and have an adverse effect on our reputation. The costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems, bugs, viruses, worms,\nmalicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of\nexisting or potential customers and may impede our sales, distribution and other critical functions. We may also be subject to regulatory penalties and litigation by customers and other parties\nwhose information has been compromised, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of the Company’s websites, applications, products, or services could harm our business.\nThe systems of the Company may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service and other\ncyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, and other natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist\nattacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. Some of our systems are not, and will not be, fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all\neventualities.\nA prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed, or functionality of their products and services will result in a loss of revenue and could materially harm\nour business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in their services could cause current or potential customers to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors\nor to avoid or reduce the use of our products and services, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. Moreover, if any system failure or similar event results in damages to our\ncustomers or our business partners, these customers or partners could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses, and those claims, even if unsuccessful,\nwould likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address.\n88\nTable of Contents\nThe full-time availability and expeditious delivery of the products and services of the Company is, and will be, a critical part of our offerings to our consumers. The Company continually\nrefines its technology, implementing system upgrades. Despite network security, disaster recovery and systems management measures in place, we may encounter unexpected general systems\noutages or failures that may affect our ability to conduct development activities, provide maintenance services for our products and services, manage our contractual arrangements, accurately\nand efficiently maintain our books and records, record our transactions, provide critical information to our management and prepare our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, these\nunexpected systems outages or failures may require additional personnel and financial resources, disrupt our business or cause delays in the reporting of our financial results. We may also be\nrequired to modify, enhance, upgrade or implement new systems, procedures and controls to reflect changes in our business or technological advancements, which could cause us to incur\nadditional costs and require additional management attention, placing burdens on our internal resources.\nThe Company also relies on facilities, components, and services supplied by third parties, including data center facilities and cloud storage services. If these third parties cease to provide\nthe facilities or services, experience operational interference or disruptions, breach their agreements with us, fail to perform their obligations and meet our expectations, or experience a\ncybersecurity incident, our operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and damage to our reputation and brands, and materially\nand adversely affect our business. The Company does not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may result from interruptions in their service as a\nresult of systems failures and similar events.\nThere may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, that could subject the Company to significant\nreputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\nThe Company uses, transmits and stores confidential information including, among other things, personally identifiable information (“PII”) with respect to customers and employees. The\nCompany devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these\nmeasures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation,\nfinancial condition and operating results. The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with third parties. Although we take steps to secure confidential information\nthat is provided to third parties, such measures are not always, and may not always be, effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and may occur\nin the future, and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nFor example, we may experience a security breach impacting our information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information.\nSuch an incident could, among other things, impair our ability to attract and retain customers for our products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage supplier\nrelationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against us.\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure our information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data. As with all\ncompanies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other\nirregularities. In addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, we are also subject to specific obligations relating to payment card data. Under payment card\nrules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the\nCompany fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process\npayment cards if we fail to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n89\nTable of Contents\nThe Company has business operations located in non-U.S. countries which subject it to additional costs and risks that could adversely affect our operating results.\nAll of the operations of the Company take place outside of the U.S. Compliance with international laws and regulations that apply to their international operations likely involves some\ncost savings (e.g., compliance in an African country may cost less than U.S. compliance), while involving cost increases in other respects. However, our ultimate goal is to move into regulated\nU.S. markets in the future. As a result of our international operations, we are subject to, and will be subject to, a variety of risks and challenges in managing an organization operating in various\ncountries, including those related to:\n· challenges caused by distance as well as language and cultural differences;\n· general economic conditions in each country or region;\n· regulatory changes;\n· political unrest, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities;\n· public health risks, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations;\n· longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n· difficulties in transferring funds from certain countries;\n· laws such as the UK Bribery Act 2010 and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws which also prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials; and\n· reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nIf we are unable to expand or adequately staff and manage our existing development operations located outside of the U.S., we may not realize, in whole or in part, the anticipated benefits\nfrom these initiatives (including lower development expenses), which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOther than Slovenia and Croatia, none of the Balkan nations have been offered membership in the European Union. However, Serbia was granted formal “EU candidate status” in 2012 and\nhas been in formal accession negotiations since 2014. If Serbia were to join the European Union, the costs entailed in complying with newly-applicable European regulations could be significant\nand that could in turn materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe results of operations of the Company may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency values.\nThe Company receives revenues and pays expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including Serbian Dinar (RSD), European Union Euros (EUR), British Pound Sterling (GBP),\nMexican Peso, Bosnia-Herzegovina Convertible Mark (BAM), Peruvian Sol (PEN), and Tanzanian Shilling (TZS). Changes in the value of the currencies we receive revenues and pay expenses in,\nversus each other, and the U.S. dollar, could result in an adverse charge being recorded to the Company’s income statement. Our currency remeasurement gains and losses are charged against\nearnings in the period incurred.\nThe Company depends on the services of key personnel to execute its business strategy. If it loses the services of its key personnel or we are unable to attract and retain other\nqualified personnel, we may be unable to operate our business effectively.\nWe believe that the future success of the Company will depend on the services of a number of key management and operating personnel. Some of these key employees have strong\nrelationships with our customers and our business may be harmed if these employees leave. In addition, the ability of the Company to manage growth depends, in part, on our ability to identify,\nhire and retain additional qualified employees. The Company faces intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous technologies, software and service companies. If we are\nunsuccessful in attracting and retaining these key management and operating personnel, our ability to operate our business effectively could be negatively impacted and our business, operating\nresults and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\n90\nTable of Contents\nThe Company relies on third party cloud services and such providers or services have in the past, and may in the future, encounter technical problems and service interruptions.\nThe Company hosts its services on a combination of proprietary and cloud servers. Such servers have in the past and may in the future experience slower response times or interruptions\nas a result of increased traffic or other reasons. The Company does not have control over the operations of the facilities or infrastructure of the third-party service providers that they use. Such\nthird parties’ facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages and similar events or acts of misconduct. The\ncontinuing and uninterrupted performance of the Company’s platform will be critical to our success. The Company has experienced, and in the future may experience, interruptions, delays and\noutages in service and availability from these third-party service providers from time to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting\ndisruptions and capacity constraints. In addition, any changes in these third parties’ service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the requirements of the Company’s users. Since our\nplatform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our offerings. It may become increasingly\ndifficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times, as the Company expands, and the usage of our offerings increases. Any negative publicity arising from\nthese disruptions could harm our reputation and brand and may adversely affect the usage of our offerings. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation, reduce the\navailability or usage of our platform, lead to a significant loss of revenue, increase our costs, and impair our ability to attract new customers, any of which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nThe operations of the Company rely heavily on an uninterrupted supply of electrical power.\nAny unscheduled disruption in the supply of electrical power to the Company, our customers or our service providers, or the Internet in general, could result in an immediate, and\npossibly substantial, loss of revenues due to a shutdown of our operations, those of our customers or service providers. In the event such electrical power were to be out for a prolonged period\nof time, it could prevent the Company from generating revenues, result in a decrease in demand for our services or result in lawsuits or other litigation against us.\nThe business of the Company is vulnerable to changing economic conditions and to other factors that adversely affect the industries in which we operate.\nThe demand for entertainment and leisure activities tends to be highly sensitive to changes in consumers’ disposable income, and thus can be affected by changes in the economy and\nconsumer tastes, both of which are difficult to predict and beyond the control of the Company. Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, including recessions, economic slowdown,\nsustained high levels of unemployment, and increasing fuel or transportation costs, may reduce customers’ disposable income or result in fewer individuals visiting casinos, whether land-based\nor online, or otherwise engaging in entertainment and leisure activities, including gaming. As a result, the Company cannot ensure that demand for our products or services will remain constant.\nContinued or renewed adverse developments affecting economies throughout the world, including a general tightening of availability of credit, decreased liquidity in many financial markets,\nincreasing interest rates, increasing energy costs, acts of war or terrorism, transportation disruptions, natural disasters, declining consumer confidence, sustained high levels of unemployment or\nsignificant declines in stock markets, could lead to a further reduction in discretionary spending on leisure activities, such as gaming. Any significant or prolonged decrease in consumer spending\non entertainment or leisure activities could reduce the Company’s cash flows and revenues. If the Company experiences a significant unexpected decrease in demand for its products, we could\nincur losses.\nThe Company’s results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate or where our customers or service providers operate and we do not\ncurrently have, and are not expected to have, insurance in place to mitigate such risks.\nThe Company, its customers and service providers have, and will have, operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and other geological events,\nincluding hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods that could disrupt operations. Any serious disruption at any of our facilities or the facilities of our customers or service providers due to a natural\ndisaster could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and increase our costs and expenses. If there is a natural disaster or other serious disruption at any of our facilities, it could cause a\nsignificant disruption to our operations, cause us to incur significant costs to relocate or re-establish these functions and negatively impact our operating results. While we intend to seek\ninsurance against certain business interruption risks, the Company does not currently have any insurance in place and any eventual insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses\nincurred as a result of natural or other disasters. In addition, any natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to the operations of customers or suppliers may adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations or financial condition.\n91\nTable of Contents\nThe insurance coverage of the Company may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, and our insurance costs may increase.\nThe Company has insurance policies with coverage features and insured limits that it believes are customary in their breadth and scope. However, in the event of a substantial loss, the\ninsurance coverage that the Company carries may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of its lost investment or could result in certain losses being totally uninsured.\nMarket forces beyond our control may limit the scope of the insurance coverage we can obtain in the future or our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates, including officer and director\ninsurance, which the Company may be unable to obtain on favorable terms, if at all. Certain catastrophic losses may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify obtaining insurance. As a result, if\nthe Company were to suffer such a catastrophic loss it could have a material adverse effect on the operations of, and prospects of, the Company and we may not be successful in obtaining future\ninsurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels.\nThere is a risk that the Company’s network systems will be unable to meet the growing demand for its products and services.\nThe growth of internet usage has caused frequent interruptions and delays in processing and transmitting data over the internet. There can be no assurance that the internet\ninfrastructure or the network systems of the Company will be able to meet the demand placed on them by the continued growth of the internet, the overall online gaming and interactive\nentertainment industry and their customers.\nThe internet’s viability as a medium for products and services offered by us could be affected if the necessary infrastructure is not sufficient, or if other technologies and technological\ndevices eclipse the internet as a viable channel.\nEnd-users of our products and services will depend on internet service providers and our system infrastructure (or those of their licensed partners) for access to us or their licensees’\nproducts and services. Many of these services have experienced service outages in the past and could experience service outages, delays, and other difficulties due to system failures, stability, or\ninterruption.\nMalfunctions of third-party communications infrastructure, hardware and software expose the Company to a variety of risks it cannot control.\nThe business of the Company depends upon the capacity, reliability and security of the infrastructure owned by third parties over which the Company’s offerings are deployed. The\nCompany has no control over the operation, quality, or maintenance of a significant portion of that infrastructure or whether or not those third parties will upgrade or improve their equipment. The\nCompany instead depends on these companies to maintain the operational integrity of their connections. If one or more of these companies is unable or unwilling to supply or expand their levels\nof service in the future, the operations of the Company could be adversely impacted. Also, to the extent the number of users of networks utilizing the Company’s future products and services\nsuddenly increases, the technology platform and secure hosting services which will be required to accommodate a higher volume of traffic may result in slower response times or service\ninterruptions. System interruptions or increases in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users and, if sustained or repeated, could reduce the appeal of the networks to users.\nIn addition, users depend on real-time communications; outages caused by increased traffic could result in delays and system failures. These types of occurrences could cause users to perceive\nthat the products and services of the Company do not function properly and could therefore adversely affect the Company’s ability to attract and retain licensees, strategic partners, and\ncustomers.\n92\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s products are generally part of new and evolving industries, which presents significant uncertainty and business risks.\nThe gaming platforms, systems and gaming content industries are relatively new and continue to evolve. Whether these industries grow and whether their business will ultimately\nsucceed, will be affected by, among other things, mobile platforms, legal and regulatory developments (such as passing new laws or regulations or extending existing laws or regulations to online\ngaming and related activities), taxation of gaming activities, data and information privacy and payment processing laws and regulations, and other factors that are unable to be predicted and\nwhich are beyond the control of the Company.\nGiven the dynamic evolution of these industries, it can be difficult to plan strategically, including as it relates to product launches in new or existing jurisdictions which may be delayed or\ndenied, and it is possible that competitors will be more successful than the Company is at adapting to change and pursuing business opportunities. Additionally, as the online gaming industry\nadvances, including with respect to regulation in new and existing jurisdictions, the Company may become subject to additional compliance-related costs, including regulatory infractions,\nlicensing, and taxes. If our product offerings do not obtain popularity or maintain popularity, or if we fail to grow in a manner that meets our expectations, or if we cannot offer product offerings in\nparticular jurisdictions that may be material to our business, then our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nAdditionally, possible future changes in governmental regulations pose material risks to the Company. These changes may include amendments to existing rules or the introduction of\nnew ones, shifts in regulatory focus or policy, or changes in the enforcement or interpretation of current rules and policies. These could lead to increased compliance costs, restrictions or\nprohibitions on current operations, or required alterations to the way the Company’s services are offered or marketed, any of which may result in a material adverse effect on the results of\noperations and financial condition of the Company.\nThe Company is subject to various laws relating to trade, export controls, and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect its operations, reputation,\nbusiness, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, including exposure to complex foreign and U.S. regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act (the “FCPA”) and other anti-corruption laws which generally prohibit U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of\nobtaining or retaining business. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions and other penalties. It may be difficult to oversee the\nconduct of any contractors, third party partners, representatives or agents who are not their employees, potentially exposing the Company to greater risk from their actions. If our employees or\nagents fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing their international operations, the Company may face legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties,\nadministration actions and criminal sanctions. Any determination that the Company has violated any anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse impact on our businesses. Changes in\ntrade sanctions laws may restrict their business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned entities.\nViolations of these laws and regulations could result in significant fines, criminal sanctions against the Company, its officers or employees, requirements to obtain export licenses,\ndisgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, prohibitions on the conduct of their businesses and their inability to market and sell or offer the Company’s\nproducts or services in one or more countries. Additionally, any such violations could materially damage the Company’s reputation, brand, international expansion efforts, ability to attract and\nretain employees and the Company’s business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company also has to deal with significant amounts of cash in their operations and are, and will be, subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violation\nof anti-money laundering laws or regulations could have a material adverse impact on their business.\n93\nTable of Contents\nFailure to comply with regulatory requirements in a particular jurisdiction, or the failure to successfully obtain a license or permit applied for in a particular jurisdiction, could\nimpact the ability of the Company to comply with licensing and regulatory requirements in other jurisdictions, or could cause the rejection of license applications or cancellation of existing\nlicenses in other jurisdictions.\nCompliance with the various regulations applicable to online gaming is costly and time-consuming. Regulatory authorities at the federal, state and local levels (both in the U.S. and in\nforeign jurisdictions) have broad powers with respect to the regulation and licensing of real money online gaming operations and may revoke, suspend, condition or limit the licenses of the\nCompany, or those of our customers, impose substantial fines on us or our customers, and take other actions, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects. These laws and regulations are dynamic and subject to potentially differing interpretations, and various legislative and regulatory bodies may\nexpand current laws or regulations or enact new laws and regulations regarding these matters. The Company strives to comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to its business. It is\npossible, however, that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules. Non-compliance with\nany such law or regulations could expose the Company or its customers to claims, proceedings, litigation and investigations by private parties and regulatory authorities, as well as substantial\nfines and negative publicity, each of which may materially and adversely affect the business of the Company and/or those of our customers.\nThe gaming licenses of the Company, or its customers could be revoked, suspended or conditioned at any time. The loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license\nor affect our (or our customer’s) eligibility for such a license in another jurisdiction, and any of such losses, or potential for such loss, could cause the Company to cease offering some or all of its\nofferings in the impacted jurisdictions or cause any of its customers to cease offering their products in those jurisdictions. The Company and its customers may be unable to obtain or maintain all\nnecessary registrations, licenses, permits or approvals, and could incur fines or experience delays related to the licensing process, which could adversely affect its operations or those of its\ncustomers. The delay or failure to obtain or maintain licenses by the Company in any jurisdiction may prevent it from distributing its offerings, increasing its customer base and/or generating\nrevenues. The Company may not be able to obtain and maintain the licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct its operations. Any failure by the Company or its customers to maintain\nor renew existing licenses, registrations, permits or approvals could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the Company.\nThe product offerings of the Company must be approved in most regulated jurisdictions in which they are offered; this process cannot be assured or guaranteed.\nIf the Company fails to obtain necessary gaming licenses in a given jurisdiction, we would likely be prohibited from distributing and providing our product offerings in that particular\njurisdiction. If we fail to seek, do not receive, or receive a suspension or revocation of a license in a particular jurisdiction for our product offerings (including any related technology and\nsoftware) then we cannot offer the same in that jurisdiction and our gaming licenses in other jurisdictions may be impacted. Furthermore, some jurisdictions require license holders to obtain\ngovernment approval before engaging in some transactions. We may not be able to obtain all necessary licenses in a timely manner, or at all. Delays in regulatory approvals or failure to obtain\nsuch approvals may also serve as a barrier to entry to the market for our product offerings. If the Company is unable to overcome the barriers to entry, it will materially affect our results of\noperations and future prospects.\nTo the extent new online gaming jurisdictions are established or expanded, the Company cannot guarantee it will be successful in penetrating such new jurisdictions or expanding its\nbusiness or customer base in line with the growth of existing jurisdictions. As the Company directly or indirectly enters into new markets, it may encounter legal, regulatory and political\nchallenges that are difficult or impossible to foresee and which could result in an unforeseen adverse impact on planned revenues or costs associated with the new market opportunity. If the\nCompany is unable to effectively develop and operate directly or indirectly within these new markets or if its competitors are able to successfully penetrate geographic markets that it cannot\naccess or where it faces other restrictions, then the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition could be impaired. The failure of the Company to obtain or maintain the\nnecessary regulatory approvals in jurisdictions, whether individually or collectively, would have a material adverse effect on its business.\n94\nTable of Contents\nLegislative and regulatory changes could negatively affect the business of the Company and the business of its customers.\nLegislative and regulatory changes may affect demand for or place limitations on the placement of the products of the Company. Such changes could affect the Company in a variety of\nways. Legislation or regulation may introduce limitations on their products or opportunities for the use of our products and could foster competitive products or solutions at our or our customers’\nexpense. Our business will likely also suffer if our products become obsolete due to changes in laws or the regulatory framework. Moreover, legislation to prohibit, limit or add burdens to our\nbusiness may be introduced in the future in jurisdictions where gaming has been legalized. In addition, from time to time, legislators and special interest groups have proposed legislation that\nwould expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations or which may otherwise adversely impact our operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate and will operate in the future.\nLegislative or regulatory changes negatively impacting the gaming industry as a whole, or the Company’s customers, in particular, could also decrease the demand for our products.\nOpposition to gaming could result in restrictions or even prohibitions of gaming operations in any jurisdiction or could result in increased taxes on gaming revenues. Tax matters, including\nchanges in state, federal or other tax legislation or assessments by tax authorities could have a negative impact on our business. A reduction in growth of the gaming industry or in the number of\ngaming jurisdictions or delays in the opening of new or expanded casinos could reduce demand for our products. Changes in current or future laws or regulations or future judicial intervention in\nany particular jurisdiction may have a material adverse effect on our existing and proposed foreign and domestic operations. Any such adverse change in the legislative or regulatory environment\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nMaterial increases to taxes or the adoption of new taxes or the authorization of new or increased forms of gaming could have a material adverse effect on the future financial\nresults of the Company.\nWe believe that the prospect of significant revenue is one of the primary reasons that jurisdictions permit or expand legalized gaming. As a result, gaming companies are typically subject\nto significant revenue-based taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. From time-to-time, federal, state,\nand local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. In addition, worsening economic conditions could\nintensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes, property taxes and/or by authorizing additional gaming properties each subject to\npayment of a new license fee. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in such laws or in the administration of such laws. Such changes, if adopted, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company. The large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected\nbudget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming or new or increased gaming taxes and/or\nproperty taxes and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts. Any new or increased gaming or the material increase or adoption of additional taxes or fees, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the future financial results of the Company.\nAdditionally, changes in taxation rates or the taxation base could have a significant impact on the Company’s financial performance. For example, a shift from taxing gross income to a\nturnover-based approach could significantly increase the Company’s tax liabilities. However, the Company believes this risk is limited in the European Union which has issued Value Added Tax\n(VAT) Directive (article 135), which provides wide discretion to both member and candidates, as to whether to impose additional excise duties such as VAT on the betting and gambling\nindustries. While this has been used as a precedent to counter similar draft legislations in various markets, the risk of changed taxation norms, remains. Currently, most global markets (including\nthe vast majority of U.S. states) align with the U.K. model, taxing on gross revenue, avoiding the imposition of distinct, special tax duties beyond standard ones, similar to other industries.\nChanges in tax laws or requirements could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.\n95\nTable of Contents\nGaming opponents may persist in their efforts to curtail the expansion of legalized gaming, which, if successful, could limit the growth of the Company’s operations.\nThere is significant debate over, and opposition to, land-based and interactive gaming. We cannot assure that this opposition will not succeed in preventing the legalization of gaming in\njurisdictions where it is presently prohibited, prohibiting or limiting the expansion of gaming where it is currently permitted or causing the repeal of legalized gaming in any jurisdiction. Any\nsuccessful effort to curtail the expansion of, or limit or prohibit, legalized gaming could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition of the Company.\nIn addition, there is significant opposition in some jurisdictions to gaming (online or otherwise). Such opposition could lead these jurisdictions to adopt legislation or impose a regulatory\nframework to govern interactive gaming specifically. These could result in a prohibition on gaming or increase their costs to comply with these regulations, all of which could have an adverse\neffect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition of the Company.\nThe gaming industry is highly regulated, and the Company must adhere to various regulations and maintain applicable licenses to continue their operations. Failure to abide by\nregulations or maintain applicable licenses could be disruptive to their business and could adversely affect their operations.\nThe Company and its products are, and will be, subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do\nbusiness and their products are used. Such entities currently block direct access to wagering on websites from jurisdictions in which they do not have a license to operate through IP address\nfiltering. Individuals are required to enter their age upon gaining access to their platforms and any misrepresentation of such users age will result in the forfeiting of his or her deposit and any\nwithdrawals from such users account requires proof of government issued identification. In addition, their payment service providers use their own identify and internet service provider\n(ISP) verification software. Despite all such measures, it is conceivable that a user, underage, or otherwise could devise a way to evade their blocking measures and access their website from the\nUnited States or any other foreign jurisdiction in which the Company is not currently permitted to operate.\nViolations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. Licenses, approvals or findings of suitability may be revoked, suspended or conditioned. In\nsum, the Company may not be able to obtain or maintain all necessary registrations, licenses, permits or approvals. The licensing process may result in delays or adversely affect our operations\nand our ability to maintain key personnel, and our efforts to comply with any new licensing regulations will increase our costs.\nThe Company may be unable to obtain licenses in new jurisdictions.\nThe Company is subject to regulation in any jurisdiction where our customers access our websites. To expand into any such jurisdiction, we may need to be licensed, or obtain approvals\nof our products or services. If they do not receive a license, or receive a revocation of a license, in a particular jurisdiction for our products, we would not be able to sell or place our products or\nservices in that jurisdiction. Any such outcome could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and any growth plans for the business of the Company.\nAdditionally, in some markets such as Malta and Cyprus, some of the Company’s main services and products require approval from relevant governmental authorities – i.e., gaming\ncommissions. However, the process for this approval is transparent and typically lasts a few weeks. In the event the Company is delayed in obtaining, or prevented from obtaining, future\napprovals, it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the Company, and as a result, the Company.\nThe Company relies on its management and if they were to leave, its business could be adversely affected.\nThe Company is largely dependent upon the personal efforts and abilities of its existing management, including the MeridianBet Group’s Chief Executive Officer Zoran Milošević, who\nplays an active role in the operations of the MeridianBet Group and the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Brian Goodman, who plays an active role in our operations. Moving forward,\nshould the services of Mr. Milošević or Mr. Goodman be lost for any reason, the Company will incur costs associated with recruiting replacements and any potential delays in operations which\nthis may cause. If we are unable to replace such individuals with suitably trained alternative individual(s), we may be forced to scale back or curtail our operations.\nThe Company does not have any key person life insurance policies on our executive officers. If our executive officers do not devote sufficient time towards their business, the Company’s\nresults of operations, cash flow and revenues, may suffer.\n96\nTable of Contents\nPotential competition from existing executive officers, after they leave our employment, and subject to the non-compete terms of the Purchase Agreement, could negatively\nimpact the profitability of the Company.\nEach of the Sellers agreed to a three year non-compete, agreeing to not compete against the Company following the Closing in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Malta,\nin connection with the manufacturing, selling, creating, renting, marketing, producing, undertaking, developing, supplying, or otherwise dealing with or in any product or service, that the\nMeridianBet Group or the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries and/or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries is researching, developing, manufacturing, distributing, selling\nand/or providing at any time during the two years prior to any competitive action by any Seller, in the betting and gambling industry (subject to the terms of, and exceptions set forth in, the\nPurchase Agreement), However, none of the Sellers will be prohibited from competing with us after such three year period; none of the executive officers or employees of MeridianBet Group or its\nsubsidiaries will be restricted from competing against us at any time; and none of the Sellers will be restricted from competing against us in any jurisdictions other than Serbia, Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, Montenegro, and Malta, including, but not limited to in other jurisdictions where the Company operates.\nAccordingly, any of these individuals could be in a position to use industry experience gained while working with us to compete with us. Such competition could distract or confuse\ncustomers, reduce the value of our intellectual property and trade secrets, or have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations and cash flows. Any of the foregoing could\nreduce our future revenues, earnings or growth prospects. Additionally, the ability of the Company to enforce the non-compete provisions set forth in the Purchase Agreement in foreign\njurisdictions may be limited by the laws of such jurisdictions, which may prohibit or ban non-competes, or result in the terms thereof being limited, reduced, modified or void.\nThe operations of the Company are seasonal.\nLike many businesses in the gaming and betting industry, the Company experiences a degree of seasonality in its operations. In particular, our sports betting segment can be affected by\nthe annual sports calendar. The months of late June and the first week of July tend to have less sports betting activity in certain markets due to a decline in major sporting events during this\nperiod. This is because many prominent sports leagues, such as football (soccer) and basketball, conclude their seasons in the late spring, and there’s often a pause before other significant\nsporting events begin in mid-July and early October respectively. This is less significant in certain sports such as football (soccer), where the Northern Hemisphere’s summer often includes major\ninternational events such as the World Cup, European Cup, and Olympic games. It is also mitigated by the Company’s other revenue streams.\nThe risks related to international operations, in particular in countries outside of the United States and Canada, could negatively affect the Company’s results including foreign\nexchange and currency risks that could adversely affect its operations, and the Company’s ability to mitigate its foreign exchange risk through hedging transactions may be limited.\nThe Company expects to derive more than 90% of its revenue from transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar and currently 100% of the Company’s\noperations take place in jurisdictions other than the United States. As such, the Company’s operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign government policies and legislation or\nsocial instability and other factors which are not within the control of the Company, including, but not limited to, recessions in foreign economies, expropriation, nationalization and limitation or\nrestriction on repatriation of funds, assets or earnings, longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, changes in consumer tastes and trends,\nrenegotiation or nullification of existing contracts or licenses, changes in gaming policies, regulatory requirements or the personnel administering them, currency fluctuations and devaluations,\nexchange controls, economic sanctions and royalty and tax increases, risk of terrorist activities, revolution, border disputes, implementation of tariffs and other trade barriers and protectionist\npractices, taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, volatility of financial markets and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, difficulties in the protection of\nintellectual property particularly in countries with fewer intellectual property protections, the effects that evolving regulations regarding data privacy may have on the Company’s online\noperations, adverse changes in the creditworthiness of parties with whom the Company has significant receivables or forward currency exchange contracts, labor disputes and other risks arising\nout of foreign governmental sovereignty over the areas in which the Company’s operations are conducted. The Company’s operations may also be adversely affected by social, political and\neconomic instability, and by laws and policies of such foreign jurisdictions affecting foreign trade, taxation and investment. If the Company’s operations are disrupted and/or the economic\nintegrity of its contracts is threatened for unexpected reasons, our businesses may be harmed.\n97\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s international activities may require protracted negotiations with host governments, national companies and third parties. Foreign government regulations may favor or\nrequire the awarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. In the event of a dispute arising in\nconnection with the Company’s operations in a foreign jurisdiction where they conduct their business, the Company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be\nsuccessful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdictions of the courts of United States or enforcing American judgments in such other jurisdictions. The Company may also be hindered or\nprevented from enforcing rights with respect to a governmental instrumentality because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Accordingly, the Company’s activities in foreign jurisdictions\ncould be substantially affected by factors beyond the Company’s control, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Some countries in which the Company may operate\nmay be considered politically and economically unstable.\nDoing business in the industries in which the Company operates often requires compliance with numerous and extensive procedures and formalities. These procedures and formalities\nmay result in unexpected or lengthy delays in commencing important business activities. In some cases, failure to follow such formalities or obtain relevant evidence may call into question the\nvalidity of the entity or the actions taken. Management is unable to predict the effect of additional corporate and regulatory formalities which may be adopted in the future including whether any\nsuch laws or regulations would materially increase the Company’s cost of doing business or affect its operations in any area.\nThe Company may in the future enter into agreements and conduct activities outside of the jurisdictions where they currently carry on business, which expansion may present challenges\nand risks that we have not faced in the past, any of which could adversely affect their results of operations and/or financial condition.\nIn addition, as the majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, fluctuations in the exchange rate\nbetween the United States Dollar (USD), Serbian Dinar (RSD), European Union Euros (EUR), British Pound Sterling (GBP), Mexican Peso, Bosnia-Herzegovina Convertible Mark (BAM), Peruvian\nSol (PEN), Tanzanian Shilling (TZS), and other currencies may have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition and operating results. The Company’s consolidated financial\nresults are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange rate exposures arise from current transactions and anticipated transactions denominated in\ncurrencies other than United States dollars and from the translation of foreign-currency-denominated balance sheet accounts into United States dollar-denominated balance sheet accounts. The\nCompany is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations because portions of their revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, particularly the\nSerbian Dinar (RSD), European Union Euros (EUR), British Pound Sterling (GBP), Mexican Peso, Bosnia-Herzegovina Convertible Mark (BAM), Peruvian Sol (PEN), and Tanzanian Shilling (TZS).\nIn particular, uncertainty regarding global economic conditions and the current debt crisis poses a risk to the stability of each of the aforementioned currencies. Exchange rate fluctuations could\nadversely affect their operating results and cash flows and the value of their assets outside of the United States. If a foreign currency is devalued in a jurisdiction in which the Company is paid in\nsuch currency, then its customers may be required to pay higher amounts for their products, which they may be unable or unwilling to pay.\nWhile the Company may enter into forward currency swaps and other derivative instruments intended to mitigate the foreign currency exchange risk, there can be no assurance it will do\nso or that any instruments that it enters into will successfully mitigate such risk. If we enter into foreign currency forward or other hedging contracts, we would be subject to the risk that a\ncounterparty to one or more of these contracts may default on its performance under the contracts. During an economic downturn, a counterparty’s financial condition may deteriorate rapidly and\nwith little notice, and they may be unable to take action to protect their exposure. In the event of a counterparty default, we could lose the benefit of any hedging contract, which may harm our\nbusiness and financial condition. In the event that one or more of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to eventually recover any benefit lost as a result of that\ncounterparty’s default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty. We expect that the Company will not be able to hedge all of our exposure to any particular foreign currency, and we may\nnot hedge our exposure at all with respect to certain foreign currencies. Changes in exchange rates and our limited ability or inability to successfully hedge exchange rate risk could have an\nadverse impact on the liquidity and results of operations of the Company.\n98\nTable of Contents\nLitigation costs and the outcome of litigation could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.\nFrom time to time, the Company may be subject to litigation claims through the ordinary course of its business operations regarding, but not limited to, employment matters, security of\nconsumer and employee personal information, licensing and registration issues, contractual relations with suppliers, marketing and infringement of trademarks and other intellectual property\nrights. Litigation to defend the Company against claims by third parties, or to enforce any rights that the Company may have against third parties, may be necessary, which could result in\nsubstantial costs and diversion of the Company’s resources, causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company may from time to time\nin the future be party to various and at times numerous legal, administrative and regulatory inquiries, investigations, proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Because\nthe outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain, if one or more of such legal matters were to be resolved against the Company for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the\nCompany’s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nMeridianBet Group’s operations are subject to potential future disruptions from military activities, skirmishes, coups, terrorist activities and wars, in the Balkans.\nThe Balkans are a geographical area located in southeastern Europe including Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, European\nTurkey, and large parts of Croatia and Serbia. Sometimes the term also includes Romania and southern parts of Slovenia. A significant portion of the operations of MeridianBet Group, are located\nin the Balkans (particularly revenues earned by Meridian Serbia and Meridian Montenegro). The Balkans have historically been the subject of numerous wars and skirmishes, including in the\n1990s – in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Macedonia and Kosovo, and in the 2000s – in Macedonia. While the area has seen significantly more peace in recent\nyears, ethnic and political tensions still exist in the region and future wars, skirmishes, coups, terrorist activities and political tensions, may create unrest, result in public services or utilities\nbecoming unavailable, result in the unavailability of electricity or internet connectivity, and/or create damage to, the inability of MeridianBet Group to use or operate, its facilities. In recent years,\nfor example, there have been increasing tensions between Serbia and its neighbors, including Montenegro and the disputed territory of Kosovo (the final status of which remains unsettled). Any\nof the above may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and cash flows of the Company; result in significant losses, which may not be insured; and/or prevent certain\nsubsidiaries of the Company from operating for prolonged periods of time.\nThe Company will likely need to raise funding to pay the post-closing obligations associated with the Purchase Agreement, the terms of which may not be favorable, may necessitate\nthe payment of interest which otherwise would not need to be paid, and may cause dilution.\nThe consideration payable to the Sellers includes cash and stock which will come due in the future. The unpaid portion of the purchase price currently includes: (i) $2,875,000 of\nContingent Cash Consideration due to the Sellers including $2,675,000 due to Milovanović two business days after written demand for payment thereof, at any time after November 9, 2024 and the\nremainder which is due over the next several months; (ii) $20,000,000 in cash, of which $10,000,000 is due 12 months after the date of the Closing and $10,000,000 is due 18 months after the date of\nthe Closing; and (ii) promissory notes in the amount of $15,000,000, due 24 months after the Closing. The Company also currently owes $0.7 million under the Deferred Cash Convertible\nPromissory Note with Milovanović.\n99\nTable of Contents\nThe Company will likely need to raise funds in the future to pay such amounts (or certain portions thereof) to the Sellers. Debt funding may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If\nwe raise additional funds by issuing equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our then issued and outstanding\nequity or debt, and our existing shareholders may experience dilution. If we are unable to obtain additional capital when required, or on satisfactory terms, we may be in breach of the Purchase\nAgreement, and the Sellers may seek damages from us as a result of such breach.\nAdditionally, the payment of interest on any debt funding, or dividends on any equity funding, may be material, and may decrease the funds available for operations. Furthermore,\ncovenants in any debt or equity funding, may make it harder or more expensive for us to raise funding in the future.\nThe Company relies on third-party providers to validate the identity and identify the location of their users, and if such providers fail to perform adequately or provide accurate\ninformation or they do not maintain business relationships with them, the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company could be adversely affected.\nThere is no guarantee that the third-party geolocation and identity verification systems that the Company relies on will perform adequately, or be effective. The Company relies on\ngeolocation and identity verification systems to ensure that we are in compliance with certain applicable laws and regulations, and any service disruption to those systems would prohibit us from\noperating and adversely affect our business. Additionally, incorrect or misleading geolocation and identity verification data with respect to current or potential users received from third-party\nservice providers may result in them inadvertently allowing access to our product offerings to individuals who should not be permitted to access them, or otherwise inadvertently denying access\nto individuals who should be able to access such product offerings, in each case based on an inaccurate identity or geographic location determination. Their third-party geolocation service\nproviders rely on their ability to obtain information necessary to determine geolocation from mobile devices, operating systems, and other sources. Changes, disruptions or temporary or\npermanent failure to access such sources by their third-party service providers may result in the inability of the Company to accurately determine the location of users. Moreover, our inability to\nmaintain existing contracts with third-party service providers, or to replace them with equivalent third parties, may result in their inability to access geolocation and identity verification data\nnecessary for our day-to-day operations. If any of these risks materialize, the Company may be subject to disciplinary action, fines or lawsuits, may lose licenses, and our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Company relies on third-party payment processors to process deposits and withdrawals made by users, and if they cannot manage their relationships with such third parties and\nother payment-related risks, their business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Company relies on a limited number of third-party payment processors to process deposits and withdrawals made by users. If any of their third-party payment processors terminates\ntheir relationship or refuses to renew their agreements on commercially reasonable terms, the Company would need to find an alternate payment processor, and may not be able to secure similar\nterms or replace such payment processor in an acceptable time frame. Further, the software and services provided by our third-party payment processors may not meet the expectations of the\nCompany, may contain errors or vulnerabilities, may be compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause the Company to lose its ability to accept online payments or other\npayment transactions or make timely payments to its users, any of which could make their technology less trustworthy and convenient and adversely affect its ability to attract and retain users, or\ncomply with applicable laws and regulations.\nNearly all of the Company payments are made by credit card, debit card or through other third-party payment services, which subjects it to certain regulations and the risk of fraud. They\nmay in the future offer new payment options to users that may be subject to additional regulations and risks. We are also subject to a number of other laws and regulations relating to the\npayments that we accept from users, including with respect to money laundering, money transfers, privacy and information security. If we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations, we\nmay be subject to civil or criminal penalties, fines and/or higher transaction fees and may lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment card transactions, which could make our\nproduct offerings less convenient and attractive to users. If any of these events were to occur, the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company could be adversely\naffected. Additionally, we may be subject to fines or penalties for failing to comply with applicable rules and regulations which could include criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant\nassets or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make changes to our business practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny.\n100\nTable of Contents\nOur Facility Agreement requires that we meet certain ratios and comply with certain positive and negative covenants. Our failure to comply with those requirements may result in\nan event of default occurring under our Facility Agreement, and the lender thereunder requiring us to pay amounts due or foreclosing on our assets.\nThe Facility Agreement includes certain customary representations, warranties and covenants of Meridian Serbia, and requires Meridian Serbia to meet certain annual financial ratios,\nincluding maintaining a ratio of net debt/EBITDA of less than or equal to 3.0x, determined on an annual basis, beginning on December 31, 2024. Pursuant to the terms of the Facility Agreement,\nMeridian Serbia is prohibited from declaring a dividend or making any payment on Meridian Serbia’s share capital, repaying any debt to any of its shareholders, granting loans to any party, or\nmaking any payment to any affiliates, without the prior written consent of Unicredit Bank, to the extent any of the forgoing would exceed 6,000,000 Euros (approximately $6,460,000) in aggregate\non an annual basis, provided that for 2024, such limit is increased by 20,000,000 Euros (approximately $21,500,000).\nEvents of default under the Facility Agreement include the failure to timely pay amounts thereunder when due, breaches by Meridian Serbia or us under the Facility Agreement or\nGuaranty, respectively, and/or other security agreements securing such documents, if Meridian Serbia’s accounts are blocked for more than 15 consecutive days, if Meridian Serbia fails to\nprovide any required security pursuant to the terms of the Facility Agreement within 15 calendar days from the date of Unicredit Bank’s request, if 20% or more of Meridian Serbia’s assets are\nseized or impaired, by any judgment or order, if a liquidation or bankruptcy of Meridian Serbia occurs, the occurrence of a material adverse effect on Meridian Serbia, if a change of control of\nMeridian Serbia occurs, or Meridian Serbia’s failure to comply with the required net debt/EBITDA ratio.\nIf an event of default occurs under the Facility Agreement, Unicredit Bank can declare all amounts owed under the Facility Agreement immediately due and payable, prohibit the lending\nof any additional funds to Meridian Serbia, and charge the amount of default interest as is in compliance with applicable statutory regulations.\nAmounts borrowed under the Facility Agreement are secured by a mortgage on substantially all of Meridian Serbian’s real estate; a pledge by Golden Matrix Group Beograd-Novi\nBeograd (“Golden Matrix Serbia”)(which is wholly-owned by the Company and which in turn owns 100% of Meridian Serbia) of all of the outstanding capital stock of Meridian Serbia; a pledge by\nthe Company of all of its ownership in Golden Matrix Serbia; and an assignment of Meridian Serbia’s insurance policies. We also guaranteed the full amount owed to Unicredit Bank pursuant to\nour entry into a Guaranty Agreement.\nIf an event of default occurs under the Facility Agreement, the lender may enforce their guaranty, enforce their security interests, attempt to foreclose on our assets or securities or those\nof MeridianBet Group, which could force us to curtail certain of our assets or sell assets or operations to raising funding. As a result, our cash flows, assets and operations, may be materially\naffected and the value of our securities may decline in value.\nOur Secured Convertible Note with the Investor is secured by a Security Agreement over substantially all of our assets and a pledge of the securities of certain of our subsidiaries.\nOn July 2, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Lind Global Asset Management VIII LLC, a Delaware limited partnership, pursuant to which the Company issued to\nthe Investor a secured, two-year, interest free convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $12,000,000.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Secured Convertible Note, the Company entered into a Security Agreement with the Investor dated July 2, 2024, whereby the Company granted a\nsecurity interest in, and pledges and assigns to the Investor over, all personal and fixture property of every kind and nature and all proceeds and products thereof of the Company, subject to the\nliens held by Unicredit Bank Serbia JSC Belgrade, to secure the payment and performance in full of all of the obligations of the Company to the Investor.\n101\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, on July 2, 2024, we and the Investor entered into a Pledge Agreement pursuant to which the Company pledged to the Investor all of the Company’s rights, title and interest in\nand to all stock and other equity interests the Company owns in RKings Competitions Ltd. and GMG Assets Limited, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, to secure the repayment of the Note.\nAfter such time as the principal amount of the Secured Convertible Note is $6,000,000 or less and, so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing, at the request of the\nCompany, the Investor agreed to release its lien on its collateral under the Security Agreement and Pledge Agreement.\nAs a result of the above, the Investor, in the event of the occurrence of a default under the Secured Convertible Note may enforce its security interests over our assets and/or our\nsubsidiaries which secure such obligations, may take control of our assets and operations, and/or force us to curtail or abandon certain of our current business plans and operations. If that were\nto happen, any investment in the Company (including, but not limited to any investment in our common stock) could lose value.\nOur stock repurchases are discretionary and even if effected, they may not achieve the desired objectives.\nOn July 15, 2024, the Board approved the purchase of up to $5 million in shares of the Company’s common stock. A total of 700 shares of common stock were purchased during the\nquarter ended September 30, 2024, and the repurchase program is scheduled to expire on July 15, 2025, when a maximum of $5.0 million of the Company’s common stock has been repurchased, or\nwhen such program is discontinued by the Board of Directors. Under the stock repurchase program, shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market or through negotiated\ntransactions at prevailing market rates, or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. Repurchases will be made at management’s discretion at prices management considers to be\nattractive and in the best interests of both the Company and its stockholders, subject to the availability of stock, general market conditions, the trading price of the stock, alternative uses for\ncapital, and the Company’s financial performance.\nThere can be no assurance that any repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline\nbelow the levels at which we repurchase such shares. The amounts and timing of the repurchases may also be influenced by general market conditions, regulatory developments (including recent\nlegislative actions which, subject to certain conditions, may impose an excise tax of 1% on our stock repurchases) and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock. If our\nfinancial condition deteriorates or we decide to use our cash for other purposes, we may suspend repurchase activity at any time.\nItem 2.
