Revenue of $2.5 million year-to-date, an 18.3% increase compared to the same year ago period.\n  * Gross profit of $418,000 as compared to $470,000 in the second quarter of 2024.\n  * Gross margin of 47% as compared to 54% in the second quarter of 2024.

While we experienced a slight reduction in cases during the summer months, we are pleased to have demonstrated solid performance through the third quarter in 2024 with revenue growth of 18% year-to-date compared to the prior year period. Our restructured sales operation is beginning to deliver results by driving exposure to our newly published clinical data and the new SE platform; however, we did experience unexpected reimbursement pre-authorization headwinds within the quarter that we believe to be transient in nature. We expect future coding clarity combined with our recently published clinical data will positively contribute to revenue results moving forward.We've experienced an exciting and transformational several months. Notably, initial clinical experience with the new Catamaran SE, which extends our line of offerings with a smaller Catamaran implant and access profile, has received positive initial reviews. We will continue to collect feedback during the fourth quarter from this \"alpha\" period of the SE before our full commercial launch in early 2025. Additionally, the publication of our post-market clinical trial data in the Catamaran SI Joint Fusion System® MAINSAIL™ study further supports Tenon's conviction that the Catamaran procedure is safe and effective in treating patients suffering with SI joint disruption or degenerative sacroiliitis. Importantly, the data from this first publication and subsequent studies is critical empirical evidence to support insurance coverage of this important technology.Lastly, as we announced in August, we are pleased to have Kevin Williamson join Tenon as Chief Financial Officer. Kevin's focus on strategic finance to bolster our balance sheet has helped to position the company for the long term. With the support of our recent capital raise, we are confident that we have the cash runway to advance Tenon into our next phase of growth with upcoming catalysts, including the full enrollment of our post-market clinical trial for the Catamaran SI Joint Fusion System and the next release of the study's interim analysis, which remains imminent,\" concluded Foster.**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results** Revenue was $0.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 6%, compared to $0.9 million in the comparable year ago period. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $2.5 million, an increase of 18%, compared to $2.1 million in nine months ended September 30, 2023. The fluctuations in revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to a decrease of 15% and an increase of 5%, respectively, in the number of surgical procedures in which the Catamaran System was used. The number of procedures in the third quarter was impacted by the longer timeline of implementation, training and development of our restructured sales operation, as well as unexpected reimbursement pre-authorization impacts, leading to fewer surgeries performed during the quarter.Gross profit in the third quarter of 2024 was $0.4 million, or 47% of revenues, compared to $0.5 million, or 57% of revenues in the comparable year ago quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit was $1.4 million, or 54% of revenues, compared to a gross profit of $0.7 million, or 32% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin percentage has sustained a healthy level due to the absorption of more production overhead costs into our standard cost and operating leverage created due to lower relative fixed costs.Operating expenses totaled $3.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to expenses of $3.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses totaled $12.0 million compared to $13.3 million in the prior year period. Operating expenses decreased due to the restructuring of our sales operations that reduced sales and marketing expenses and a decline in research and development. With a continued investment in growth, expanding the sales force is a priority and increases in sales and marketing are expected in future quarters.Net loss was $3.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, an improvement from a loss of $3.3 million in the same period of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loss was $10.6 million compared to $12.5 million in the previous year period. The Company expects to incur additional losses in the future.As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $9.2 million, as compared to $2.4 million as of December 31, 2023. On September 17, 2024, the Company closed a public offering and received gross proceeds of approximately $4.5 million while receiving a total of $9.6 million in aggregate in net proceeds from equity financing transactions in September. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no outstanding debt.**Q3 2024 Earnings Conference Call** Management will host an investor conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET (1:30 p.m. PT) today, Wednesday, November 13, 2024, to discuss Tenon's third quarter 2024 financial results, provide a corporate update, and conclude with Q&A with the Company's covering analysts.

(NASDAQ:TNON) (\"Tenon\" or the \"Company\"), a company transforming care for patients suffering from certain Sacroiliac Joint (SIJ) disorders, today announced completion of the initial clinical cases utilizing the Company's new Catamaran SE SI Joint Fixation Device. The new implant offers a 30% reduction in implant width as compared to the original Catamaran Fixation Device, providing physicians with options for smaller SI joint anatomy or revising previously treated SI joints with failed alternative SI joint implants where space is limited.![](https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/b51fda75-d666-485c-a803-56ae226582af/937005/catamaran-logo.png)Initial user experience with the Catamaran SE is underway with a select group of physician operators who are expected to provide valuable feedback to support a broader Catamaran SE market introduction in the coming months. Successful procedures utilizing the Catamaran SE have been completed in various centers of excellence throughout the country including in Idaho, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Arizona, and Utah.The Catamaran and Catamaran SE SI Joint Fixation Devices are single robust, fully MRI-compatible titanium implants. Each device consists of two pontoons, connected by an osteotome bridge, designed to transfix the SI joint along its longitudinal axis, providing immediate fixation and stabilization of the joint, with the aim of achieving a successful long-term fusion. The Catamaran implant was developed with respect to AO principles of arthrodesis including 1) adequate joint preparation, 2) rigid fixation and stabilization, and 3) adequate bone graft augmentation. Via a minimally invasive inferior-posterior approach, the Catamaran & Catamaran SE implants are delivered within the dense cortical bone of the sacrum and ilium to transfix and stabilize the SI joint for the treatment of SIJ dysfunction. To date there have been over 750 Catamaran fixation devices implanted to treat primary SI Joint dysfunction and sacroiliitis, as well as revise previously treated SI joints with failed alternative SI joint implants.This news of the initial clinical use of the Catamaran SE follows the Catamaran SI Joint Fusion System MAINSAIL Study's impressive interim outcomes publication. [Click here](https://pr.report/3vv3) to view this publication in its entirety.Brian F. Richardson, MD, Interventional Pain Physician with Southwest Pain and Spine Center in Logan, UT., commented, \"The new Catamaran SE with its smaller implant size continues to enhance the minimally invasive nature of the SI joint procedure, while at the same time providing immediate stabilization of the joint with the goal of long-term fusion. The new and smaller instrumentation along with a ratcheted manual drilling option makes implantation of the SE fixation device from an inferior-posterior approach simple and reproducible. The ability to now have implant size options with the Catamaran Fixation Device will be beneficial as it pertains to meeting the individual anatomic needs of each of my SI joint patients.\"Steven M. Foster, President and CEO of Tenon Medical, stated, \"We are pleased with the initial clinical performance of the Catamaran SE as conveyed to us by our alpha physician users. The SE expands the Catamaran implant offering with a smaller profile device yet still maintains the core AO principles of arthrodesis we have established with the original Catamaran implant. We look forward to the opportunity to treat more SIJ patients with our physician partners by now providing them choices for varying patient anatomy and treatment strategies.\"**About Tenon Medical, Inc.** Tenon Medical, Inc., a medical device company formed in 2012, has developed The Catamaran SI Joint Fusion System that offers a novel, less invasive approach to the SI joint using a single, robust titanium implant.
