(Larimar) (Nasdaq: LRMR), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing treatments for complex rare diseases, last week presented data from the Company’s Phase 1 studies and the Phase 2 dose exploration study of nomlabofusp at the [International Congress for Ataxia Research (ICAR)](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=EB4mwWFScqS-tXVuVsS7E9Euo-8hQQvC9_ncIZ-iHUpbfM7L4jP6Hpn6lrZN9MgF3AKvJudEwfui-sg8NZMhSKUN8ZWUquhcxqd4jvXRkjqZfcHn0fbbkNX6UZhZX95DyJA1MZKQYIJly-ytU8tGRg==) in London, U.K. Data from a total of 61 adults with FA who participated in these studies evaluating short-term (up to 28 days) subcutaneous administration of 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg nomlabofusp were further evaluated and presented in three posters during the conference (posters available in the Our Science section at [www.larimartx.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=vFQpZLEwKur63zo9lJQ_G6VEfWMmG73iShQjVypj0g4iniUXtaIwLNccT3vFT067jdCcr_dK62vxC_wMuwMrVg==)).\n\n“As our nomlabofusp program advances towards potential registration, we are continuing to evaluate the characteristics and activity of nomlabofusp. Using modeling and simulation based on the data collected from our completed clinical studies, long-term daily administration of 50 mg nomlabofusp was predicted to achieve tissue FXN levels in most patients similar to the average FXN levels observed in asymptomatic heterozygous carriers,” said Carole Ben-Maimon, MD, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Larimar. “Importantly, in study participants with FA, gene expression and lipid profiles in buccal cells and plasma, respectively, were observed to improve directionally towards values seen in healthy controls, suggesting that nomlabofusp has the potential to affect downstream metabolic pathways that may be disrupted in patients with FA.”\n\nDr. Ben-Maimon, continued, “As we move ahead with the development of nomlabofusp, it is important to consider the totality of the data observed to date. Nomlabofusp has shown dose dependent increases in tissue FXN levels as well as changes in gene expression and lipid profiles in the same study population. Our studies have included a broad population of adults with FA and will be expanding study participants to include children and adolescents with the initiation of our pediatric pharmacokinetic (PK) run-in trial later this year. With the ongoing open label extension study, we are collecting long-term safety, PK and FXN data with the intent of supporting a potential accelerated approval using FXN as a novel surrogate endpoint. Our Biologics License Application (BLA) submission remains targeted for the second half of 2025. We look forward to sharing a nomlabofusp program update in mid-December of 2024.”\n\nDr. Rusty Clayton, Chief Medical Officer of Larimar added, “We were pleased that the relationships between tissue FXN levels and disease characteristics in patients with FA across our three completed investigational studies are representative of those in the broader FA population reported in the literature. Data from this representative population supports our dose prediction modeling and simulation designed to aid in our nomlabofusp dose selection for patients with FA across age groups and with different baseline characteristics. We look forward to further enhancing our model with data from our upcoming pediatric PK run-in study, as well as long-term data from our open label extension (OLE) study. Most importantly, the activity of nomlabofusp in participants from our Phase 2 study was encouraging, as it showed a trend towards normalization of dysregulated gene expression and lipid profiles identified by comparing profiles between patients with FA and healthy volunteers. We expect to build on these initial data with additional analyses of an expanded data set as we continue to advance our nomlabofusp development program.”\n\n**Disease characteristics and tissue FXN concentrations in nomlabofusp clinical studies** FA is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by GAA repeats in the FXN gene that result in FXN deficiency. The variable number of GAA repeats leads to a diverse spectrum of disease characteristics. Tissue FXN levels are known to correlate with age of onset and inversely correlate with the number of GAA repeats and rate of disease progression. The data presented at ICAR described the characteristics of and tissue FXN levels in adult participants in the nomlabofusp clinical studies.\n\n  * **Nomlabofusp study participants were representative of the broad population of adults with FA**\n  * Lower tissue FXN levels were associated with younger age of onset and more severe and rapidly progressive disease\n  * Relationships between disease characteristics and baseline buccal cell FXN levels were consistent with previous published studies\n  * Baseline buccal cell FXN levels correlate with baseline skin cell FXN levels in adults with FA participating in nomlabofusp clinical studies\n\n\n\n**Prediction of skin FXN levels after nomlabofusp administration based on data from the Phase 1 studies and Phase 2 dose exploration studies** FXN deficiency is the root cause of FA, and based on the literature, on average patients with FA have 21%-35% of the mean tissue FXN levels observed in healthy controls, and asymptomatic heterozygous carriers on average have ~50% of the mean FXN levels in buccal cells observed in healthy controls. The modeling used the skin tissue FXN levels measured in the completed clinical studies evaluating short-term administration of nomlabofusp to predict the potential increase in skin FXN levels after long-term administration of nomlabofusp.\n\n  * Dose-dependent increases in nomlabofusp exposure and skin FXN levels were observed in adults with FA after short-term administration of 25, 50, 75 or 100 mg nomlabofusp\n  * **Daily administration of 50 mg nomlabofusp is predicted to achieve skin FXN levels****>****50% of healthy controls in most patients, which is similar to mean tissue FXN levels observed in asymptomatic heterozygous carriers**\n  * Prediction model will be further optimized with long-term administration data from the ongoing OLE and data from adolescents and children as it becomes available\n\n\n\n**Effect of nomlabofusp on plasma lipid profiles and tissue gene expression in adults with FA** Deficiency in the mitochondrial protein FXN results in metabolic dysfunction and abnormal gene expression and lipid profiles in patients with FA. This study evaluated the impact of short-term administration of nomlabofusp on gene and lipid profiles in patients with FA as part of an initial exploratory analysis.\n\n  * In subsets of identified genes and lipids, gene expression and triglyceride levels were altered in study participants with FA at baseline compared with values observed in healthy controls (gene expression measured from buccal cells and lipid profiling measured from plasma)\n  * **Improvement in gene expression and lipid profiles was observed in study participants with FA as post-treatment values trended towards values observed in normal controls, suggesting that nomlabofusp administration affects downstream metabolic pathways**\n  * Further evaluation of changes in gene expression and lipid profiles after treatment with nomlabofusp is ongoing, including following long-term administration in the OLE study\n\n\n\n**About Larimar Therapeutics**Larimar Therapeutics, Inc.

(Larimar) (Nasdaq: LRMR), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing treatments for complex rare diseases, today reported its third quarter 2024 operating and financial results.\n\n“Our nomlabofusp program continues to advance, with the potential to be the first frataxin protein replacement therapy for patients with FA. All sites are activated with ongoing enrollment in our OLE study evaluating the long-term safety, PK and frataxin levels in patients with FA following daily subcutaneous administration. In mid-December, we plan to provide a development program update that will include available safety, PK, and frataxin data from patients receiving 25 mg of nomlabofusp daily for up to 180 days in our OLE study. We expect to also provide an update on enrollment,” said Carole Ben-Maimon, MD, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Larimar. “In November, we look forward to presenting at the International Congress for Ataxia Research (ICAR) meeting new data on results from our completed dose exploration study including exploratory gene and lipid expression results following nomlabofusp treatment. In addition, we will also be presenting two posters with data from patients participating in our Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) studies and Phase 2 dose exploration study. One poster will provide patient data on baseline disease characteristics and baseline tissue frataxin levels, and the other will present the relationship between dose, PK and tissue frataxin levels using modeling and simulation. We remain on track to initiate a PK run-in study in adolescent patients with FA in the fourth quarter of this year which is the first step towards evaluating nomlabofusp treatment in pediatric patients.”\n\nDr. Ben-Maimon continued, “On the regulatory front, we were pleased to recently receive Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway (ILAP) designation from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) which aims to facilitate patient access by accelerating time to market in the U.K. We also held our first meetings with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as part of the Support for Clinical Trials Advancing Rare Disease Therapeutics (START) pilot program and appreciate the dialogue and interaction designed to help advance our development program. In parallel, we began work to further understand the continued areas of unmet need in the FA therapeutic landscape from the perspective of physicians, payers, and most importantly, patients. We will use this information to develop our commercial approach and to refine our market entry strategy. Finally, we continue scaling up our manufacturing efforts and collecting required data to support a potential accelerated approval path. Our targeted BLA submission remains on track for the second half of 2025.”\n\n**Recent Highlights**\n\n  * Today, Larimar announced that it will provide a nomlabofusp development program update in mid-December 2024 that will include available safety, PK and frataxin data, as well as available clinical outcomes observations from patients currently receiving a daily 25 mg dose of nomlabofusp for approximately 30 to 180 days in the OLE study. An update on enrollment in the OLE study will also be provided.\n  * Larimar recently received ILAP designation from the MHRA for nomlabofusp for the treatment of adults and children with FA. ILAP aims to facilitate patient access to novel treatments by accelerating time to market through opportunities for enhanced engagements with U.K. regulatory authorities and other stakeholders. Along with the receipt of the ILAP designation, nomlabofusp has already been granted orphan drug designations in the U.S. and the European Union (EU), Fast Track and Rare Pediatric Disease designations in the U.S., PRIME designation in the EU, and selected to be in the START pilot program by the FDA.\n  * Larimar is on track to initiate by year-end a PK run-in study in an initial cohort of 12-15 adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) with FA. Initiation of a second cohort of 12-15 children (2 to 11 years of age) is planned to follow next year. Study participants will be randomized 2:1 to receive either nomlabofusp or placebo daily. Following assessment of safety and exposure data of each cohort in the PK run-in study, participants will be eligible to screen for the OLE study.\n  * Larimar is on track for a planned initiation of a global confirmatory/registration study planned mid-2025 with potential sites in the U.S., Europe, U.K., Canada, and Australia. Larimar continues to target BLA submission for the second half of 2025 to support accelerated approval.\n  * In September 2024, Larimar announced that data from the Company’s nomlabofusp Phase 1 studies and Phase 2 dose exploration study, some of which has been previously disclosed, will be presented at the ICAR meeting being held November 12-15, 2024, in London, U.K.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results** As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $203.7 million, which provides projected cash runway into 2026.\n\n_Third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023_\n\nThe Company reported a net loss for the third quarter of 2024 of $15.5 million, or $0.24 per share, compared to a net loss of $9.1 million, or $0.21 per share, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nResearch and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $13.9 million compared to $6.6 million for the third quarter of 2023.
