(NASDAQ: TEM), a technology company leading the adoption of AI to advance precision medicine and patient care, today announced publication of its study, “[Actionable structural variant detection via RNA-NGS and DNA-NGS in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjamanetwork.com%2Fjournals%2Fjamanetworkopen%2Ffullarticle%2F2825627&esheet=54149934&newsitemid=20241111944537&lan=en-US&anchor=Actionable+structural+variant+detection+via+RNA-NGS+and+DNA-NGS+in+patients+with+advanced+non-small+cell+lung+cancer&index=1&md5=b4b5bb770ba92b452b300e820afb455a),” in _JAMA Network Open_. \n\nTempus recently conducted a retrospective study of more than 5,500 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and found that concurrent RNA- and DNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) led to the detection of more actionable structural variants compared to DNA sequencing alone. Specifically, 8.8% of patients had at least one actionable variant – _ALK_ , _RET_ , _ROS1_ , or _NTRK1/2/3_ fusions, or _MET_ exon 14 skipping alterations – identified by one or both assays. Overall, the concurrent use of RNA and DNA sequencing resulted in a 15.3% increase in identifying patients with actionable variants and more than doubled the detection of emerging, rare structural variants compared to DNA sequencing alone. These findings suggest that concurrent RNA and DNA testing should be more widely implemented in clinical settings to maximize the detection of structural variants. \n\n“This large study underscores the importance of using both RNA- and DNA-based comprehensive genomic profiling as a standard of care in advanced NSCLC, and more broadly in solid tumors,\" said Halla Nimeiri, MD, Chief Development Officer at Tempus. \"By integrating RNA and DNA sequencing, we can detect a wider range of actionable alterations that might otherwise go undetected by DNA testing alone. This combined approach enhances clinicians' ability to provide more personalized treatment options for patients.\" \n\nTo read the full study, visit [tempus.com/publications](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tempus.com%2Fpublications%2Factionable-structural-variant-detection-via-rna-ngs-and-dna-ngs-in-patients-with-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer%2F&esheet=54149934&newsitemid=20241111944537&lan=en-US&anchor=tempus.com%2Fpublications&index=2&md5=97ebb74dbe4a4d39419c0d5b794fe06a). \n\n**About Tempus**\n\nTempus is a technology company advancing precision medicine through the practical application of artificial intelligence in healthcare.

The acquisition will provide Tempus with expanded testing capabilities for inherited cancer risk. These services are becoming more and more important for healthcare professionals navigating critical medical decisions with cancer patients and their relatives. \n\nIn addition to expanding and enhancing the company’s hereditary screening portfolio, the acquisition of Ambry will complement Tempus’ strategy of using data to advance clinical and scientific innovation. Ambry’s extensive product offerings will also allow Tempus to expand into new disease categories, including pediatrics, rare disease, immunology, women’s reproductive health, and cardiology. \n\n**Financial Outlook and Guidance**\n\nTempus continues to expect full year 2024 revenue of approximately $700 million, which represents approximately 32% year-over-year growth and approximately $(105 million) in adjusted EBITDA, an improvement of approximately $50 million over 2023. \n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\nA conference call and webcast will begin today, November 4, 2024 after market close at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

In particular, Adjusted EBITDA is a key measurement used by Tempus management to make operating decisions, including those related to analyzing operating expenses, evaluating performance, and performing strategic planning and annual budgeting. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. \n\nTempus does not provide guidance for net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, and similarly cannot provide a reconciliation between Ambry's forecasted EBITDA and its net income (loss) or between Tempus' forecasted Adjusted EBITDA and net loss without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of reliable estimates for certain components of net income (loss) and the respective reconciliations. These forecasted items are not within Tempus’ or Ambry's control, as applicable, may vary greatly between periods and could significantly impact future financial results. \n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, about Tempus, Ambry and their respective industries that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.
