(Nasdaq: TRNS) (“Transcat” or the “Company”), a leading provider\nof accredited calibration services, cost control and optimization services, and distribution and rental of value-\nadded professional grade handheld test, measurement, and control instrumentation, today reported financial results for its\nsecond quarter ended September 28, 2024 (the “second quarter”) of fiscal year 2025, which ends March 29, 2025 (“fiscal\n2025”). Results include the previously reported acquisitions of TIC-MS, Inc. (\"TIC-MS\") effective March 27, 2023,\nSteriQual, Inc. (\"SteriQual\"), effective July 12, 2023, Axiom Test Equipment, Inc. (“Axiom”), effective August 8, 2023 and\nBecnel Rental Tools, LLC (\"Becnel\") effective April 15, 2024.\n“Consolidated revenue was up 8%. Consistent demand in our Calibration Services business was supported by our\ndifferentiated value proposition which resonates well in the highly regulated end markets we serve, including life\nsciences,” commented Lee D. Rudow, President and CEO. “Service Revenue grew 6% versus prior year, the 62nd\nconsecutive quarter of growth. Service organic revenue growth of 4% was below historical trends and was significantly\nimpacted by a decline in our Nexa cost control and optimization services business. Excluding Nexa, we are pleased with\nservice organic growth of 9% versus prior year.”\n“Though the magnitude of Nexa's slowdown was greater than what we expected, we have identified the root causes and\nare committed to returning the Nexa business to growth. This includes fully integrating Nexa's sales and marketing into\nTranscat's dynamic growth process and renaming the business Transcat Solutions, to fully leverage our industry leading\nbrand.\"\n\"Nexa has performed very well since acquisition in calendar 2021, and while collaborating on a regular basis to drive\ncalibration sales growth, we allowed that group to operate in a more autonomous fashion and missed an opportunity to\nfully integrate Nexa into the proven Transcat sales and marketing processes. Integration is now well underway, and we\nhave the power of the Transcat leadership team focused on pipeline expansion, which we believe will contribute to the\nreturn to high single digit organic Services revenue growth in the first half of fiscal 2026.”\nMr. Rudow added, “Distribution Revenue grew 11% versus prior year. However, Becnel revenue was negatively impacted\nby two hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, which pressured second quarter Distribution margins. Becnel is a well-run\nbusiness that has cultivated strong customer relationships with companies that highly utilize Transcat’s core\ninstrumentation and calibration services. We fully expect Becnel to deliver sequential improvements in the third and fourth\nquarters and expect Distribution Gross Margins to return to levels consistent with the second half of fiscal 2024.”\n“Transcat has a proven history of successfully identifying, acquiring, and integrating dynamic companies that have\nexpanded our addressable markets, widened the breadth of offerings, and allowed us to leverage existing infrastructure.\nIn addition to strong returns, the acquisitions present compelling cross-sell synergies to drive organic revenue growth into\nthese newly acquired customer bases. Transcat’s acquisition pipeline remains robust and is focused on all our strategic\nchannels.”\nTranscat Reports Second Quarter Results with growth in Revenue and Gross Profit\nOctober 28, 2024\nPage 2 of 14\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2025 Review\n(Results are compared with the second quarter of the fiscal year ended March 30, 2024 (“fiscal 2024”))\n($ in thousands) Change\nFY25 Q2 FY24 Q2 $'s %\nService Revenue $ 44,083 $ 41,431 $ 2,652 6.4 %\nDistribution Revenue 23,743 21,373 2,370 11.1 %\nRevenue $ 67,826 $ 62,804 $ 5,022 8.0 %\nGross Profit $ 21,206 $ 20,125 $ 1,081 5.4 %\nGross Margin 31.3 % 32.0 %\nOperating Income $ 3,735 $ 1,643 $ 2,092 127.3 %\nOperating Margin 5.5 % 2.6 %\nNet Income $ 3,286 $ 460 $ 2,826 614.3 %\nNet Margin 4.8 % 0.7 %\nAdjusted EBITDA* $ 8,861 $ 9,330 $ (469 ) (5.0 )%\nAdjusted EBITDA* Margin 13.1 % 14.9 %\nDiluted EPS $ 0.35 $ 0.06 $ 0.29 483.3 %\nAdjusted Diluted EPS* $ 0.52 $ 0.60 $ (0.08 ) (13.3 )%\n*See Note 1 on page 5 for a description of these non-GAAP financial measures and pages 10, 11 and 12 for the\nreconciliation tables.\nConsolidated revenue was $67.8 million, an increase of $5.0 million or 8.0%.

Consolidated gross profit was up $5.0 million, or\n12.9%, and gross margin expanded to 32.6% or 110 basis points. Consolidated operating expenses increased\n$2.5 million, or 7.6%, driven by incremental expenses from acquired businesses, increased intangibles amortization\nexpense and investments in technology and our employee base to support future growth, offset by the previously\nmentioned amended NEXA Earn-Out agreement in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. As a result, consolidated\noperating income was $8.8 million compared with $6.3 million in last fiscal year’s period.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $19.1 million which represented an increase of $1.3 million or 7.1%. Net income per diluted share\nincreased to $0.83 from $0.43 and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.20 versus $1.12 last year. The effective tax\nrate was 13.9% compared to 25.3% in the prior year, due to the timing of discrete benefits related to share-based\ncompensation items.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Overview\nOn September 28, 2024, the Company had $23.8 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand and $80.0 million\navailable for borrowing under its secured revolving credit facility. Total debt was $3.0 million versus $4.2 million on March\n30, 2024. The Company’s leverage ratio, as defined in the credit agreement, was 0.08 on September 28, 2024,\ncompared with 0.10 on March 30, 2024.\nOutlook\nMr. Rudow concluded, “We are very proud of the consistent results the Transcat team has delivered year in and year out\nover an extended period of time. That said, we are disappointed with the NEXA-impacted aggregated results in fiscal Q2.\nWe experienced short term, isolated revenue challenges in the NEXA services channel in the quarter but believe the swift\nactions our exceptional team is already taking will rectify the situation in the near term, as we continue to execute on our\nhighly successful core growth strategy.”\n“We expect FY25 organic Service revenue growth in the mid-single digits when normalized for the extra week in fiscal\n2024 and gross margin expansion. We anticipate a return to high single digit organic growth by the first half of fiscal\n2026.”\n“Automation of our calibration processes and focus on productivity remain key enablers of margin expansion. We have\ndemonstrated the ability to leverage these tools to improve our operational efficiency, which has become visible in our\nfinancial performance over time.”\n“We continue to work our robust acquisition pipeline and are pleased with the current flow of strategic opportunities.”\nTranscat expects its income tax rate to range between 21% and 23% in fiscal 2025. This estimate includes Federal,\nvarious state, Canadian and Irish income taxes and reflects the discrete tax accounting associated with share-based\npayment awards.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nTranscat will host a conference call and webcast on Tuesday, October 29, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. ET.

The Company’s management\nbelieves Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management, investors\nand others to evaluate and compare the performance of its core operations from period to period by removing the impact\nof the capital structure (interest), tangible and intangible asset base (depreciation and amortization), taxes, stock-based\ncompensation expense and other items, which is not always commensurate with the reporting period in which it is\nincluded. As such, the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of performance when evaluating its business\nsegments and as a basis for planning and forecasting. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under\nGAAP and is not calculated through the application of GAAP. As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the\nGAAP measure of net income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation of, but in conjunction with, the GAAP\nmeasure. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be\ncomparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies. See pages 10 and 11 for the Adjusted\nEBITDA Reconciliation tables.\nIn addition to reporting Diluted Earnings Per Share, a GAAP measure, we present Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\n(net income plus acquisition related amortization expense, acquisition related transaction expenses, acquisition related\nstock-based compensation, and acquisition amortization of backlog; divided by the average diluted shares outstanding\nduring the period), which is a non-GAAP measure. Our management believes Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share is an\nimportant measure of our operating performance because it provides a basis for comparison of our business operations\nbetween current, past and future periods by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating\nperformance. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and is not\ncalculated through the application of GAAP. As such, it should not be considered as a substitute or alternative for the\nGAAP measure of Diluted Earnings Per Share and, therefore, should not be used in isolation of, but in conjunction with,\nthe GAAP measure. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, as presented, may produce results that vary from the GAAP\nmeasure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies. See page\n12 for the Adjusted Diluted EPS Reconciliation table.\nABOUT TRANSCAT\nTranscat, Inc. is a leading provider of accredited calibration, reliability, maintenance optimization, quality and compliance,\nvalidation, Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS), and pipette services.

We believe operating free cash flow is an important liquidity measure that\nreflects the cash generated by the business, after the purchases of technology, capabilities and assets, that can then be used for, among other things, strategic\nacquisitions, investments in the business, and funding ongoing operations. Operating free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and is not\ncalculated through the application of GAAP. As such, it should not be considered as a substitute or alternative for the GAAP measure of net cash provided by\noperations and, therefore, should not be used in isolation of, rather in conjunction with, the GAAP measure. Operating free cash flow, as presented, may produce\nresults that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.\n8\nBalance Sheet Supports Growth Strategy\n($ in millions)\nCapitalization\nNote: Components may not add to totals September 28, September 23,\ndue to rounding 2024 2023 0.08x leverage ratio at quarter-end\nCash, cash equivalents, & (Total debt to TTM Adjusted EBITDA*)\n$23.8 $1.2\nmarketable securities\n$80.0M available from credit facility at\nTotal debt 3.0 53.3\nquarter-end\nTotal net debt ($20.8) $52.0\nShareholders’ equity 268.8 138.3\nRevolving credit facility was paid off with\nTotal capitalization $271.8 $191.5\nthe proceeds from the Secondary\nDebt/total capitalization 1.1% 27.8%\nOffering during FY24.\nNet debt/total capitalization -7.7% 27.2%\n* See supplemental slides for a description of this non-GAAP financial measure, Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation and other important information regarding Adjusted EBITDA.\n9\nOutlook*\n2025 Expectations\nService segment: For Fiscal 2025, expect Service organic revenue growth to be in the mid-\nsingle digits when normalized for the extra week in fiscal 2024 and Service gross margin\nexpansion.\nTotal Transcat: We expect the fiscal 2025 income tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 23%.\nMid-to-long Term Outlook\n• Strong organic growth in our Service segment remains a centerpiece of our strategy\n• Our business continues to benefit from a predominantly life science-oriented market,\ndriven by regulation and recurring revenue streams\n• We have generated sustainable margin improvement over the past several years and\nwe believe the improvement will continue\n• We anticipate demonstrating more leverage on the S,G&A investments we have made\nin the years ahead\n• Acquisitions that strengthen our fundamental value proposition will continue to be an\nimportant component of our go-forward strategy\n* Outlook provided as of May 15, 2024 10\nConference Call and Webcast Playback\n• Replay Number: 412-317-6671 passcode: 13749365\nTelephone replay available through Tuesday, November 5th, 2024\n• Webcast / Presentation / Replay available at\nhttps://www.transcat.com/investor-relations\n11\nSupplemental Information\n12\nAdjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\n($ in thousands) FY 2024 FY 2025 FY 2025\nQ2 Q2 Q2 TTM\nNet Income $ 460 $ 3 ,286 $ 17,932\n+ Interest Expense / (Income), net 890 ( 210) (1,147)\n+ Other Expense / (Income) (49) 232 663\n+ Tax Provision 342 427 4,884\nOperating Income $ 1 ,643 $ 3 ,735 $ 22,332\n+ Depreciation & Amortization 3,269 4,399 1 5,931\n+ Transaction Expense 328 32 (1,690)\n+ Acquisition Earn-Out Adjustment 2,800 - -\n+ Other (Expense) / Income 49 ( 231) ( 661)\n+ Noncash Stock Compensation 1,241 926 3,965\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 9 ,330 $ 8 ,861 $ 39,877\nIn addition to reporting net income, a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle (“GAAP”) measure, we present Adjusted EBITDA\n(earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock compensation expense, restructuring expense and\nnon-cash loss on sale of building), which is a non-GAAP measure.

Both the earnings release and the\nslides that will be referenced during our prepared remarks can be found on our website, transcat.com, in\nthe Investor Relations section.\nIf you would please refer to Slide 2. As you are aware, we make forward-looking statements during the\nformal presentation and Q&A portion of this teleconference. These statements apply to future events\nwhich are subject to risks and uncertainties, as well as other factors that could cause the actual results to\ndiffer materially from where we are today.\nThese factors are outlined in the news release, as well as in the documents filed by the Company with the\nSEC. You can find those on our website, where we regularly post information about the Company, as well\nas on the SEC's website at sec.gov.\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update or correct any of the forward-looking statements contained\nin this call, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.\nPlease review our forward-looking statements in conjunction with these precautionary factors.\nAdditionally, during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe will be\nuseful in evaluating our performance.

Thank you for joining us on the call today.\nTranscat delivered strong performance from our core calibration services business again in the second\nquarter of fiscal 2025.\nConsolidated revenue was up 8% to $67.8 million, driven by the consistent demand for our calibration\nservices, as well as solid performance in our traditional rental business, which includes both our Transcat\nand Axiom rental platforms.\nConsolidated gross profit grew 5%, was driven by growth in both our service and distribution segments. In\nthe second quarter, service recorded its 62 straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth, as our\ncalibration services continued to perform at a very high level.\nOverall, service revenue growth was 6% and 4% organic growth. The 6% growth is below historical trends\nand was significantly impacted by a decline in our NEXA cost control and optimization services business\nthat was beyond the magnitude of what we anticipated. We've identified the root causes that need to be\naddressed, which primarily center around the immediate need for NEXA to be fully integrated into\nTranscat's dynamic and proven sales and marketing processes.\nIn addition, we are renaming the business Transcat Solutions to fully leverage Transcat's industry-leading\nbrand. All of these actions are underway with NEXA. We are making meaningful progress, and we're\n2\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

We have a strong pipeline of new business opportunities entering the back half of\nthe fiscal year. The core service business continues to benefit from recurring revenue streams, as well as\nour industry-leading value proposition, which continues to resonate throughout the highly regulated\nmarkets we serve, including both life sciences and aerospace and defense.\nTurning to distribution, in second quarter gross profits grew 10% on double-digit revenue growth.\nHowever, Becnel revenue and profit was negatively impacted by two hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico,\nwhich pressured second quarter distribution margins.\nOverall, Transcat's core business performed well in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, and our exceptional\nteam is working to overcome the near-term NEXA challenges, which we believe are very fixable and\ninclude channel marketing and pipeline expansion, which is already strengthening. We are confident that\nbusiness will return to growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2026.\nBecnel continues to be a well-run company and a strong niche market with significant opportunity for\nsustainable growth. We fully expect Becnel to deliver sequential improvements in the third and fourth\nquarters and distribution margins to return to levels consistent with the second half of fiscal 2024.\nThe balance sheet remains strong, our revolving credit facility was paid off last year, and we are in an\nexcellent capital position to support our strategic growth plan that includes a very active M&A initiative.\nWith that, I'll turn things over to Tom for a more detailed look at the second quarter financial results.\nThomas Barbato\nThanks, Lee.\nI'll start on Slide 4 of the earnings deck posted on our website, which provides detail regarding our\nrevenue on a consolidated basis and by segment for the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\nSecond quarter consolidated revenue of $67.8 million was up 8% versus prior year.\nLooking at it by segment, service revenue grew 6% with 4% of the growth coming organically and the\nother 2% from acquisition. As Lee mentioned, service revenue grew 9% organically when excluding\nNEXA.\nTurning to distribution, revenue of $23.7 million grew 11%, and we continue to see good performance\nfrom the higher margin traditional rental businesses.\nTurning to Slide 5, our consolidated gross profit for the second quarter of $21.2 million was up 5% from\nprior year. Service gross profit increased 4% versus prior year. We continue to leverage higher levels of\ntechnician productivity and our differentiated value proposition, but that could not offset the pressure we\nsaw as a result of the lower-than-expected NEXA revenue.\nDistribution segment gross profit of $6.6 million was up 10%, but margins were lower than expected as a\nresult of the two Gulf of Mexico hurricanes impacting Becnel results in the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 6, Q2 net income of $3.3 million was up from $0.5 million in the prior year. Q2 of last year\nincluded a $2.8 million non-cash charge related to the amended NEXA earn out agreement.\n3\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

We reported adjusted\ndiluted earnings per share as well to normalize for the impact of upfront and ongoing acquisition related\ncosts. Q2 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.52.\nFlipping to Slide 7, where we show our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. We use Adjusted\nEBITDA, which is non-GAAP, to gauge the performance of our business because we believe it is the best\nmeasure of our operating performance and ability to generate cash. As we continue to execute on our\nacquisition strategy, this metric becomes even more important to highlight as it does adjust for one-time\ndeal related transaction costs, as well as the increased level of non-cash expenses that will hit our\nincome statement from acquisition purchase accounting.\nWith that in mind, second quarter consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $8.9 million was down 5% from the\nsame quarter in the prior year, as lower than expected NEXA revenue negatively impacted services\nEBITDA and Becnel pressure distribution EBITDA. As always, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to\noperating income and net income can be found in the supplemental section of this presentation.\nMoving to Slide 8, operating cash flow was mostly consistent with last year. Q2 capital expenditures were\n$2.2 million higher than prior year and continue to be centered around service segment capabilities, rental\npool assets, technology, and future growth projects. The spend was in line with expectations.\nSlide 9 highlights our strong balance sheet. At quarter-end, we had total net cash of $20.8 million with a\nleverage ratio of 0.08X. We had $80 million available from our credit facility.\nLastly, we expect to file our Form 10-Q on November 6.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to you, Lee.\nLee Rudow\nOkay. Thanks, Tom.\nOver the past 12 years, we've successfully and consistently delivered organic service revenue growth,\nsustainable gross margin expansion, and delivered strong free cash flow. We expect these metrics to\nimprove in the back half of fiscal 2025 and return to more normal levels in the first half of fiscal 2026.\nGiven the temporary setback in the NEXA's sales channel, for the full 2025 fiscal year, we expect organic\nservice revenue growth in the mid-single digits when normalized for the extra week in fiscal 2024.\nOur M&A strategy has been very successful and will continue to be an important component of our overall\ngrowth plan as we look to continue to strengthen our core business and expand our adjustable markets.\nThrough acquisitions, we expect to expand our geographical footprint, capabilities, and expertise. And, of\ncourse, we're always interested in bolt-on opportunities where we can leverage our current infrastructure\nto drive both cost synergies and growth opportunities.\nWe currently have a very robust acquisition pipeline with the potential to increase the trajectory of our\nbusiness. As I mentioned earlier, we have a strong balance sheet, which will continue to support the\nconversion of our M&A pipeline. We will continue to leverage continuous process improvement and\nautomation as key enablers to future margin expansion, and we expect service gross margin expansion\nfor the full 2025 fiscal year.\n4\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a\nquestion, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in\nthe question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your questions from the queue.\nFor participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing\nthe star keys. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. The first question comes from the line of\nScott Buck with H.C. Wainwright. Please go ahead.\nScott Buck\nHey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Lee, can you give us a sense of when you\nstarted to recognize that NEXA was falling short of expectations?\nLee Rudow\nListen, we have—Scott, we have multiple sales channels throughout the organization, probably 10 or so,\nand at any given time and any given quarter, they're not all going to be operating to full capacity, all\ncylinders, if you will. There's always little pockets that you keep your eye on, and I think we probably saw\nsome of that in the first quarter, but nothing that would have led us to believe that we would have the\ndrop-off we had in Q2. That came up a little unexpected. Like I said in the earnings script, we dove right\ninto the root causes. It's a really good business, but we dove right into the root causes and just saw that\nthere was just some very fixable processes within their—the way they manage their pipeline. We're all\nover it, and we'll get them turned around pretty quickly. It's subtle in the first quarter and just hit us a little\nbit unexpected in the second. That's how I would characterize it.\nScott Buck\nI appreciate that. It sounds like there's no additional read-through on the rest of the business, or any kind\nof macroeconomic read-through based on the softness you saw in the second quarter there?\nLee Rudow\nNo, I don't think so. Like I said, the core calibration business organically grew 9%. We like not only the\nperformance in the second quarter, we like the pipeline going into the back half of the year. That's steady.\nCertainly, the rental business, which is a big component these days of the distribution segment, that's\nvery strong, and we expect Becnel to perform well. As we look in the back half of the year now, I think the\nother areas of the Company are performing as we would expect. We just had this isolated miss that we're\ngoing to fix.\nScott Buck\nNo, that's helpful. On M&A, besides the larger deal at the beginning of the year, it's been relatively slow.\nCan you talk a little bit about pricing and what you're seeing there? Clearly you guys are open to doing\ndeals, so I'm just curious what the other side of those transactions look like today.\nLee Rudow\n5\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

From an M&A pipeline perspective, I don't have any concern. We have as good of an M&A pipeline\nas robust, we like to use that word. I think it characterizes it well and accurately. We have a great\npipeline. We're working strategic deals that we think are a good fit for the Company. It appears quiet\nexternally, I get that. Internally, it's not quiet at all. We'll continue to work that pipeline. I think you'll see—\nyou look at what we've done in the past, you'll see that layout in the near future as time goes by. We have\nthe capacity to get even more deals done if they're appropriate and they're a good fit than we've got done\nin the past because we built the infrastructure, Scott, to do that. No concern on my end. I like the way the\npipeline looks.\nScott Buck\nGreat. Appreciate that, Lee. Last one, Tom, just curious, OpEx for the second half of the year, is the first\nhalf a fair run race or should we see some operating expense creep there as you support some of these\ngrowth initiatives?\nThomas Barbato\nYes, I would expect some increase sequentially in the Q3 and Q4.\nScott Buck\nOkay, perfect. I appreciate the time, guys. Thank you.\nLee Rudow\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Greg Palm with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please go\nahead.\nGreg Palm\nYes, thanks. Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to follow up a little bit on NEXA.\nIt wasn't too long ago that you were characterizing that business as exceeding the expectations. I think it\nwas even, I don't know, end of last year or earlier this year, where you talked about that business more\nthan doubled since being acquired. I guess I'm still a little bit confused on what went wrong in such a\nshort amount of time. Maybe you can just dig into that a little bit more if you can.\nLee Rudow\nYes, I get the question. Thanks, Greg. Yes, look, this business, the first couple of years since we acquired\nthem, the first couple of years was really flying high. We're talking about high growth rates, really\nperforming well. I think because of that, we probably gave them more autonomy than we typically would\nfor an acquisition. Greg, we integrate quickly. We do a good job integrating. We get the synergies. We\nbring these companies together. That's what makes us different. I think we didn't run that playbook, to be\nhonest, with NEXA because we have a company that was doing so well for the first couple of years.\nWe're not talking quarters. We're talking years, four quarters.\nI made the decision. It's on me and the team made the decision to support me. Let's let them keep doing\n6\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

We collaborated. They helped us win calibration business, but we didn't get involved\nwith the day-to-day operations, the processes, the procedures, the pipeline, the marketing. We just let\nthem do their thing. I think that was probably a mistake. We probably went too long. We got it now. We\nget it. We have all of our top people working on expanding their pipeline, coordinating the marketing, and\nmaking them a Transcat company, under the name Transcat Solutions. We're very confident that'll solve\nthe problem. Sometimes success hides some flaws. That's probably a fair way to characterize it. Again,\nhighflyer for two plus years, that's why it caused a little bit off guard, but we'll get good stuff.\nGreg Palm\nYes. No, I appreciate that. That's helpful color. If you're able to, can you provide the revenue decline\nspecific to NEXA? I don't know if you've got the year-to-date level as well. Just remind us, is it mostly\nproject-based revenue? I'm just curious to know what the visibility is like.\nLee Rudow\nYes, we're not going to get into the specific numbers, but it's a combination. They've got some project-\nbased business. They've got some ongoing business. It depends on what channel within their company,\nbut it's a mix that leans towards project-based, which is probably some of the core issues around what we\ngot behind on without the recognition. We know how to combat that and fix it. Hopefully, it won't be an\nissue once we get them turned around.\nGreg Palm\nYes. Just to be clear, it sounds like you're characterizing this as more company-specific than something\nmarket-related, competitively related, something of that nature. It sounds fixable. I guess that's what I'm\ntrying to get at.\nLee Rudow\nI think so. I don't see a problem with the industry. We have other areas of our Company that serve the\nexact same industry, almost in the exact same way. If you remember, we acquired a company called\nSteriQual. We've got validation business that operates in the same space with some of the same\nattributes and characteristics as the NEXA business, and they're performing well. We don't see it. That's\nnot to say there aren't certain pockets of industry slowdown within life sciences that cycle in and out\nquarter-to-quarter, but nothing systemic. I think that's why it's isolated and fixable.\nThomas Barbato\nOne thing I want to just mention, Greg, and maybe just correct something, is when Lee, in his prepared\nremarks, talked about, we're confident the business will return to growth. I think he might have misspoke.\nWe said that business, we believe, will return to growth in the first half of fiscal 2026. When we talk about\nit being fixable, we talk about the timeframe to fix it. It's a near-term fix in our mind.\nGreg Palm\nYes. Okay. My other last question, just on Becnel, you talked about a little bit of issues related to the\nhurricanes. Was there a revenue issue as well, or was it mostly on the cost side? Are you able to quantify\nwhat that impact was? I don't know if you can give a gross margin, ex-Becnel, kind of like you gave the\norganic service, ex-NEXA, but any clarification there would be helpful as well.\nLee Rudow\n7\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

Just to clarify, Greg, to the issue with the hurricanes caused a revenue issue. It's both a revenue and\nprofit issue. Had we not seen those issues, and I think the way we've got it in the press release is that we\nexpect distribution margins in the second half of this year to be more in line with what we saw in the\nsecond half of last year, so certainly north of 30%.\nGreg Palm\nGot it. Okay. Okay. All right. I will leave it there. Thanks.\nLee Rudow\nThanks, Greg.\nOperator\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Ted Jackson with Northland Securities. Please go\nahead.\nEdward Jackson\nHey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\nThomas Barbato\nHey, Ted.\nLee Rudow\nGood morning, Ted.\nEdward Jackson\nI'm going to beat the dead horse of NEXA or Transcat Services now. With the fall off in business there\nand the things that you're doing to repair it, you mentioned a couple of things. One of them was sales\nchannels and how you had various sales channels, and some were stronger, and some were weaker, and\nthat you were going to basically go in in terms of management of those channels to make some repairs\nthere. On that front, I'm curious, when you get into maybe some discussion around what are the different\nchannels from which you go to market with that business and where were the issues? With regards to\npipeline management, what's the difference between how Transcat manages the pipeline in your\nprocesses vis-a-vis NEXA? What are the actual changes that you're making there to refill the pipeline?\nI've got some things outside of NEXA to ask after that. Thanks.\nLee Rudow\nLet me start with your last question first. When you think about pipeline development and you look at the\nway NEXA perform sales, execute their sales and marketing plan, you know they had one salesperson,\nfor example, and they grew with that salesperson, like I said. Transcat has 80 salespeople. If you count\ninside salespeople and customer service people as well and business development people, strategic\naccount managers, we've got a lot of touches into the marketplace, particularly in life sciences where you\nsee the NEXA services, soon-to-be Transcat Solutions, operate. It's the difference of, had we gotten our\nsales engine behind this sooner, it just would have helped. It would have helped in a big way. That's the\n8\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

Whether you're talking distribution or calibration services, there's just\nno—we're second to none in terms of brand strength. When you put that brand strength behind the\nsolutions business, which was NEXA, you're going to get a lot of benefit. We have a core—we do work\nwith almost every single pharmaceutical company, med device company in North America. Maybe not all\nof them, but most. Had we opened up those channels earlier and instead of collaborating really\nintegrated, I think we wouldn't have this problem today. That's what we're doing now.\nAs far as one of your other questions, Ted, about channels, I think we have pipette channels, we have\nrental channels, biomedical, marine. Like I said, generally most of them perform well, but in any given\nquarter, you might see softness here or timing there. You could have ships deployed to the Middle East,\nwhich could affect our marine business. There's just different things that can happen, but that's normal.\nThat's normal, and you don't dive into those numbers as long as you think you're going to hit your\naggregated organic number, which we have just very, very consistently. There's a type of challenge that\nwe were talking about. Again, that's how we characterize it. I hope I got to all your questions. If I didn't,\njust shoot it back at me.\nEdward Jackson\nNo, you did. Actually, I'm going to ask a little bit more around NEXA before I move on. My perception with\nregards to how you were managing NEXA, and granted it was being very successful, was that you were\nletting them—you were building a business around them, if you would, and really letting them operate.\nYou can correct me if I'm wrong. To me, this is why I think it seems like such a shift for us on the outside\nbecause we're not on the inside seeing everything that happens. NEXA, with such a shift and bringing\nTranscat processes and channels and—because at the end of the day, it really is somewhat of a\nrestructuring for NEXA. NEXA is at its core a consulting business, which is really more of a person\nbusiness. Should there be some concern with regards to turnover within some of the talent base of\nNEXA? If you go through and if you change your go-to market and your pipeline management and bring it\nin to have it be more managed in the structure of Transcat (multiple speakers). It's a culture change and\nthat's where I'm going with it. Just some discussion around that, and then I'll drop NEXA, I promise.\nLee Rudow\nOkay. I don't see that as a concern at all. When I look at what NEXA does well and still does well, it's the\ncapabilities they have and the delivery of their services. You mentioned consulting services and some of\nthem fit well with that—characterizing it that way. They've always had strong delivery of their services. I\ndon't see—and probably 90% of their staff, to 95%, that's exactly what they do. They do the CMMS work,\nthey do the reliability work, they do the interval and optimization adjustments. That's not going to change.\nWhat we're bringing is really incremental. We're bringing sales and marketing leadership and a strong\nbrand incrementally to the process that they have because their problem is with sales. In hindsight, it was\npredictable this was going to happen at some point. I think when we put the companies together, it really\nstarts to become a one plus one equals three. They'll keep doing what they do well. We'll interject,\nintercede, and integrate where we have the expertise. I think both companies get better. That's different\nthan the collaboration we've done in the past. That's integration and I'll be it late to the game by a quarter\nor two but that's where we are today. That's why my confidence level is high. We bring the incremental\nbenefits and brand to their core delivery of their services, which has always been strong. I don't see a\ncultural change at all.\nEdward Jackson\n9\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

The other ones might be easy. Going over to back now, the hurricanes impacted the business, and\nthis is just because I'm ignorant with regards to how the business might flow, but say you get into like\nconstruction equipment and things like that, a lot of times after you have an event, in this case two\nevents, that there's actually—it's more than just the business. You have a disruption in the business but\nthen because there's additional maintenance, additional things that need to be done to actually repair\nbecause of the hurricanes that you actually have some extra wind in your sails. Would that be the case\nwith Becnel, or is it just to get it—it’ll bounce back to its normal state to where it would have been? Do you\nunderstand what I'm asking there?\nThomas Barbato\nYes, it'll be more normal state, Ted. The amount of incremental that could be generated is not meaningful.\nEdward Jackson\nOkay. Okay. The next question, your inventory dropped by, I don't know, close to $3 million sequentially.\nIs there something that drove that down? How would we think about that as we go beyond—we go into\nthat third quarter, fourth quarter and beyond?\nThomas Barbato\nNo. It's something that myself and Mike West have been hyper-focused on the past couple of quarters. As\nyou know when you could focus on inventory, it takes a little time to build some momentum. Obviously,\nit's just looking to improve the cash conversion cycle. We've been hyper-focused on that, and it's not\nindicative of any changes in that distribution business.\nEdward Jackson\nNo, so would that be the new norm then if I would—you know how much I care about cash flow.\nThomas Barbato\nNo, absolutely. No, I'm sorry. I missed making that point, right, is that yes, we would expect that to be the\nnew norm. On occasion, as you know, we get opportunities to make strategic buys at additional\ndiscounts. We'll continue to do that where it makes good financial sense. Hopefully, when we do that, it'll\nwork its way through in the current quarter or maybe the subsequent quarter. Yes, think of it as more of\nthe norm.\nEdward Jackson\nOn the gross margin side, particularly as it relates to the distribution business, your number there was at\na level not seen since, I guess, the first quarter of last year. Is that all Becnel? Is there anything else that\nwent on in there that caused that to go down? Or it was just really this one time?\nThomas Barbato\nNo, it's primarily Becnel. It's primarily Becnel, and that's why we're comfortable saying that for the second\nhalf of the year, we should be back more to levels we had in the second half of last year, which are north\nof 30%.\nEdward Jackson\n10\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

Please go ahead.\nZhihua \"Martin\" Yang\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you help us get a sense of how big is NEXA in\nrevenue contribution on an annual basis?\nLee Rudow\nYes, it's when we look at services, I'm going to say, and Tom, correct me if I'm wrong, but it's somewhere\nbetween 5% and 10%, probably right in the middle.\nThomas Barbato\nYes, closer to 10%.\nLee Rudow\nCloser to 10%, and that's what's so interesting. It's such a small part of the business, but where you didn't\nget labor out and you didn't anticipate that some of the changes in revenue, Martin, it's just that you can\n11\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

Again, we'll—we got our arms around it now. Yes, I think that range\nis accurate. Yes.\nZhihua \"Martin\" Yang\nThanks. One more question on organic growth for services. In the past quarters, as well as this just\nreported quarter, when you track all the other acquired business, are they all—all of them growing, have\ngrown organically?\nLee Rudow\nThe way…\nMichael West\nWe don't really talk about performance at the individual unit level. Keep in mind that from a service\nstandpoint, most of our growth is impacted by organic growth because we haven't had a—we haven't\nacquired a services business since April of last year. The point we made is that when you back out NEXA\nour organic growth is at 9% and the businesses are all…\nLee Rudow\nContributing.\nMichael West\n…contributing to that growth.\nZhihua \"Martin\" Yang\nGot it. One last question for me. Given what you have seen in NEXA, would you apply perhaps a bit more\nscrutiny to other acquired business in terms of sales marketing or other business processes?\nLee Rudow\nInteresting—I get the question. My knee-jerk reaction is, of course, we always will and do, but remember,\nwe integrate all the businesses we acquire. When we run the Transcat acquisition playbook, it's always\nour intention to integrate fast and then integrate completely. We think we're really good at it. Historically,\nour track record shows that. NEXA was an exception. It was a different business, although related and\nvery much in the ecosystem in which we perform our calibration services, they were a highflyer. They\nwere performing very, very well for an extended period of time and we decided not to run the playbook,\nMartin. I don't think this applies. The other businesses—some businesses have better quarters than\nothers. Generally speaking, we always review this at the board level and internally as well. These\nbusinesses perform very well across the board and through the year. I think NEXA is more of an outlier\nand an exception. We did learn from it. There's no question about that and I wouldn't expect that to\nhappen again. I think we'll get better in that respect for sure.\nZhihua \"Martin\" Yang\nGot it.

(Nasdaq: TRNS) (“Transcat” or the “Company”), a leading provider of\naccredited calibration services, cost control and optimization services, and distribution and rental of value-\nadded professional grade handheld test, measurement, and control instrumentation, today reported financial results for its\nfirst quarter ended June 29, 2024 (the “first quarter”) of fiscal year 2025, which ends March 29, 2025 (“fiscal\n2025”). Results include the previously reported acquisitions of TIC-MS, Inc. (\"TIC-MS\") effective March 27, 2023,\nSteriQual, Inc. (\"SteriQual\"), effective July 12, 2023, Axiom Test Equipment, Inc. (“Axiom”), effective August 8, 2023 and\nBecnel Rental Tools, LLC (\"Becnel\") effective April 15, 2024.\n“We are pleased with our strong first quarter results as gross margins expanded 310 basis points versus prior year from\nincreased Service productivity and growth in Rentals in the Distribution segment. Consolidated revenue was up 10%\ndriven by consistent demand in highly regulated end markets, our successful integration of acquired companies, and\nwidened breadth of offerings” commented Lee D. Rudow, President and CEO. “The Transcat team performed well during\nthe first quarter as adjusted EBITDA grew 20% and margins expanded driven by our differentiated value proposition along\nwith outstanding execution of automation and productivity enhancements.”\nMr. Rudow added, “Transcat’s positive acquisition momentum continued in the first quarter with the purchase of Becnel\nRental Tools. Becnel is a well-run business that has cultivated strong customer relationships, with companies which are\nhigh users of Transcat's core instrumentation and calibration services. Becnel differentiates our higher margin rental\nportfolio along with a growing operator-based service model and has already provided opportunities for cross-selling of\nTranscat’s products and services. Our growing, diversified portfolio enables strong performance when combined with our\nteam’s commitment to execution points to a very bright future ahead for Transcat.”\nTranscat Reports Strong First Quarter Results with Significant Gross Margin Expansion and EBITDA Growth\nJuly 29, 2024\nPage 2 of 13\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2025 Review\n(Results are compared with the first quarter of the fiscal year ended March 30, 2024 (“fiscal 2024”))\n($ in thousands) Change\nFY25 Q1 FY24 Q1 $'s %\nService Revenue $ 43,778 $ 39,853 $ 3,925 9.8 %\nDistribution Sales 22,929 20,745 2,184 10.5 %\nRevenue $ 66,707 $ 60,598 $ 6,109 10.1 %\nGross Profit $ 22,655 $ 18,710 $ 3,945 21.1 %\nGross Margin 34.0 % 30.9 %\nOperating Income $ 5,099 $ 4,640 $ 459 9.9 %\nOperating Margin 7.6 % 7.7 %\nNet Income $ 4,408 $ 2,949 $ 1,459 49.5 %\nNet Margin 6.6 % 4.9 %\nAdjusted EBITDA* $ 10,212 $ 8,481 $ 1,731 20.4 %\nAdjusted EBITDA* Margin 15.3 % 14.0 %\nDiluted EPS $ 0.48 $ 0.38 $ 0.10 26.3 %\nAdjusted Diluted EPS* $ 0.68 $ 0.52 $ 0.16 30.8 %\n*See Note 1 on page 5 for a description of these non-GAAP financial measures and pages 10, 11 and 12 for the\nreconciliation tables.\nConsolidated revenue was $66.7 million, an increase of $6.1 million or 10.1%.

We have successfully and\nconsistently delivered organic Service revenue growth, gross margin expansion, free cash flow, and expanded our\naddressable markets through acquisition. We believe our unique value proposition drives a sustainable competitive\nadvantage in the highly regulated markets that we serve, particularly the Life Science, Aerospace, and Defense markets,\nalong with a growing Rentals business. We expect another year of organic Service revenue growth in the high single-digit\nto low double-digit range when normalized for the extra week in fiscal 2024 and gross margin expansion. Automation of\nour calibration processes and overall productivity improvements will continue to be key enablers of future margin\nexpansion. We will continue to leverage our expertise and proven track record of successful acquisitions to drive\nsynergistic growth opportunities with a sharp focus on integration. Our robust and diverse acquisition pipeline enables\nstrategic, accretive acquisitions that will be a key component of our go-forward strategy.”\nTranscat expects its income tax rate to range between 24% and 26% in fiscal 2025. This estimate includes Federal,\nvarious state, Canadian and Irish income taxes and reflects the discrete tax accounting associated with share-based\npayment awards.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nTranscat will host a conference call and webcast on Tuesday, July 30, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. ET.

The Company’s management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of operating\nperformance because it allows management, investors and others to evaluate and compare the performance of its core\noperations from period to period by removing the impact of the capital structure (interest), tangible and intangible asset\nbase (depreciation and amortization), taxes, stock-based compensation expense and other items, which is not always\ncommensurate with the reporting period in which it is included. As such, the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a\nmeasure of performance when evaluating its business segments and as a basis for planning and forecasting. Adjusted\nEBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and is not calculated through the application of GAAP. As\nsuch, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of net income and, therefore, should not be used\nin isolation of, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may produce results that vary\nfrom the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other\ncompanies. See pages 10 and 11 for the Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation tables.\nIn addition to reporting Diluted Earnings Per Share, a GAAP measure, we present Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\n(net income plus acquisition related amortization expense, acquisition related transaction expenses, acquisition related\nstock-based compensation, acquisition amortization of backlog and restructuring expense; divided by the average diluted\nshares outstanding during the period), which is a non-GAAP measure. Our management believes Adjusted Diluted\nEarnings Per Share is an important measure of our operating performance because it provides a basis for comparison of\nour business operations between current, past and future periods by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative\nof our core operating performance. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share is not a measure of financial performance under\nGAAP and is not calculated through the application of GAAP. As such, it should not be considered as a substitute or\nalternative for the GAAP measure of Diluted Earnings Per Share and, therefore, should not be used in isolation of, but in\nconjunction with, the GAAP measure. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, as presented, may produce results that vary\nfrom the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other\ncompanies. See page 12 for the Adjusted Diluted EPS Reconciliation table.\nABOUT TRANSCAT\nTranscat, Inc. is a leading provider of accredited calibration, reliability, maintenance optimization, quality and compliance,\nvalidation, Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS), and pipette services.
