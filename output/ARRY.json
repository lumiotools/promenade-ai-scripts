This investment aligns with ARRAY’s ongoing commitment to innovation, sustainability, and its goal of future-proofing the business through new growth opportunities.\n\nSwap Robotics is currently in the process of closing a pre–Series A funding round targeting strategic investors, including ARRAY. With this investment, ARRAY positions itself at the forefront of the rapidly developing automation sector within the utility-scale solar industry, particularly focused on photovoltaic (PV) installation technology. Under the investment agreement, ARRAY has agreed to provide two additional investments of $1 million each if Swap attains certain agreed-upon milestones.\n\n“Swap Robotics is developing a disruptive technology that perfectly fits with our mission to innovate and lead in the solar industry,” said Kevin G. Hostetler, chief executive officer at ARRAY. “As the utility-scale PV installation market stands at a crossroads, ripe for automation, we see an exciting opportunity to set new standards that drive project efficiency and customer value. Our investment empowers us to pursue growth in global markets and reinforces ARRAY’s role as a thought leader.”\n\nThe integration of Swap Robotics’ cutting-edge technology with ARRAY’s existing products opens new possibilities for enhanced project cycle time efficiency and field installation savings. Automated module installation, powered by Swap Robotics, offers the potential for significant savings that would strongly benefit developers and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) companies looking to streamline project costs. In addition, Swap Robotics’ innovations promise to enhance the value of other disruptive technologies.\n\n“ARRAY is the perfect strategic partner as we continue to revolutionize solar construction with our automated solutions,” said Tim Lichti, chief executive officer at Swap Robotics. “Together, we will reshape how solar power is deployed, making installations faster, safer, and more cost-effective while preparing for the next generation of utility-scale projects.”\n\nAutomation represents a major leap forward for ARRAY’s future product development. The investment will drive the continued evolution of ARRAY’s tracker technology, facilitating automation-optimized designs that seamlessly integrate with robotic installation solutions. ARRAY’s approach to automation seeks to differentiate ARRAY’s solutions from others in the competitive solar marketplace while avoiding direct competition with EPCs.\n\n“Having evaluated a number of startups in the utility-scale solar robotics space for robotic panel laying, we chose to partner with Swap Robotics due to their years of experience on solar sites, their innovative and cost-effective approach, and their safety track record,” said Aaron Gabelnick, chief technology officer at ARRAY.\n\nARRAY’s investment in Swap Robotics is only a piece of its broader strategy of developing innovative products to meet the evolving needs of our customers. By embracing automation, ARRAY demonstrates its commitment to furthering global decarbonization efforts and making solar energy more accessible and affordable.\n\n“Swap Robotics has quietly gained several years of experience in the field with dozens of heavy-duty robots that have been operating in the world’s harshest conditions,” said Lichti. “The company’s heavy-duty robots have over 8,000 miles of autonomous outdoor navigation in the last 18 months alone.”\n\n**About ARRAY** ARRAY Technologies (NASDAQ: ARRY) is a leading global renewable energy company and provider of utility-scale solar tracking technology. Engineered to withstand the harshest conditions on the planet, ARRAY’s high-quality solar trackers and sophisticated software maximize energy production, accelerating the adoption of cost-effective and sustainable energy. Founded and headquartered in the United States, ARRAY relies on its diversified global supply chain and customer-centric approach to deliver, commission, and support solar energy developments around the world, lighting the way to a brighter, smarter future for clean energy.

In the O&M phase, Swap robots address what can be the single largest line-item expense for utility scale solar sites: managing the vegetation. Both the hardware and software of Swap’s 100% electric robotics platform is designed and built in-house. Having pioneered the world’s first 100% electric “rough cut” and offsetable cutting decks, Swap robots cut the vegetation on thousands of acres of solar sites. The Swap robotics platform can also address the single biggest labor expense in the EPC phase: laying solar panels. Swap’s practical approach is the result of Swap staff and robots having worked on solar sites for years. Swap Robotics has investments from several global leaders in the solar industry, including one of U.S.’s top three largest solar EPC’s and O&M’s, as well as some of the largest solar asset owners and solar vegetation management companies in the United States. Swap’s ten-year goal is to be the clear world leader in utility-scale solar robotics. Swap is on a mission to speed the clean energy transition through becoming the leading outdoor work robotics platform.\n\n**Forward Looking Statements** This press release contains forward-looking statements.

Our orderbook remains healthy at $2 billion, with over 20% of our global orderbook now representing orders of OmniTrack™, which demonstrates the rapid expansion of solar projects utilizing land with diverse terrain. Additionally, a significant portion of orders in our domestic orderbook include customers evaluating domestic content, and we remain confident in our ability to provide 100% domestic trackers. Our high-probability pipeline remains robust, and we are greatly encouraged by the overall momentum in the business,” said Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Hostetler.\n\nMr. Hostetler continued, “As we look to 2025 and beyond, we will continue to work with our customers to understand their challenges and expected timing of projects. While there are likely some persistent headwinds that will continue to impact the U.S. market, such as interconnection and permitting delays, shortages of long lead-time electrical equipment, and labor constraints, we also believe there are dynamics that will facilitate incremental improvement in 2025. These factors include the financing environment, clarity around AD/CVD tariffs for imported modules, and additional transparency on IRA incentives for utility-scale solar. As we assess these dynamics, we feel optimistic about strong double-digit top-line growth in 2025, but we will continue to do our due diligence within this environment. As always, ARRAY will remain steadfast and focused on the key elements within our control – excellent customer engagement and support, operational execution, and product enhancements and innovation.”\n\n**Executed Contracts and Awarded Orders**\n\nTotal executed contracts and awarded orders at September 30, 2024 were $2.0 billion.\n\n**F****ull Year 2024 Guidance**\n\nFor the year ending December 31, 2024, the Company expects:\n\n  * Revenue to be in the range of $900 million to $920 million\n  * Adjusted EBITDA(2) to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million\n  * Adjusted net income per share(2) to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.65\n\n\n\nThe narrowing of our top-line guidance is reflective of continued softness in the Brazil market, which was anticipated within the range of scenarios in our guide. We expect U.S. and international volumes to be down with declining ASP when compared to 2023. We now anticipate adjusted gross margin of approximately 34% for the year, driven by the realization of torque tube and structural fastener 45X benefits and strong operational execution. Our expected Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income per share ranges have moved slightly lower when compared to prior guidance as a result of project mix within the narrowed top-line guide combined with increased strategic investments and additional non-recurring expenses. Finally, we now expect increased free cash flow of $100 million to $115 million given our focus on working capital enhancements.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nARRAY management will host a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s financial results.

Forward-looking statements include statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” \"seek,\" “should,” “will,” “would” or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms.\n\nARRAY’s actual results and the timing of events could materially differ from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, including without limitation: changes in growth or rate of growth in demand for solar energy projects; competitive pressures within our industry; a loss of one or more of our significant customers, their inability to perform under their contracts, or their default in payment; a drop in the price of electricity derived from the utility grid or from alternative energy sources; a failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting; a further increase in interest rates, or a reduction in the availability of tax equity or project debt capital in the global financial markets, which could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a solar energy system; electric utility industry policies and regulations, and any subsequent changes, may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar energy systems, which may significantly reduce demand for our products or harm our ability to compete; the interruption of the flow of materials from international vendors, which could disrupt our supply chain, including as a result of the imposition of additional duties, tariffs and other charges or restrictions on imports and exports; geopolitical, macroeconomic and other market conditions unrelated to our operating performance including the military conflict in Ukraine and Russia, the Israel-Hamas war, attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and rising inflation and interest rates; changes in the global trade environment, including the imposition of import tariffs or other import restrictions; our ability to convert our orders in backlog into revenue; fluctuations in our results of operations across fiscal periods, which could make our future performance difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations for a particular period to fall below expectations; the reduction, elimination or expiration, or our failure to optimize the benefits of government incentives for, or regulations mandating the use of, renewable energy and solar energy, particularly in relation to our competitors; failure to, or incurrence of significant costs in order to, obtain, maintain, protect, defend or enforce, our intellectual property and other proprietary right; significant changes in the cost of raw materials; defects or performance problems in our products, which could result in loss of customers, reputational damage and decreased revenue; delays, disruptions or quality control problems in our product development operations; our ability to obtain key personnel or failure to attract additional qualified personnel; additional business, financial, regulatory and competitive risks due to our continued planned expansion into new markets; cybersecurity or other data incidents, including unauthorized disclosure of personal or sensitive data or theft of confidential information; failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting; risks related to actual or threatened public health epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks or crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition; changes to tax laws and regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including our ability to optimize those changes brought about by the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act; and the other risks and uncertainties described in more detail in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents on file with the SEC, each of which can be found on our website, www.arraytechinc.com.\n\nExcept as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.\n\n**Non-GAAP****Financial****Information** This press release includes certain financial measures that are not presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), including Adjusted gross profit, Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per share, and Free cash flow. We define Adjusted gross profit as gross profit plus (i) developed technology amortization and (ii) other costs if applicable. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus (i) other (income) expense, (ii) foreign currency transaction (gain) loss, (iii) preferred dividends and accretion, (iv) interest expense, (v) income tax (benefit) expense, (vi) depreciation expense, (vii) amortization of intangibles, (viii) amortization of developed technology, (ix) equity-based compensation, (x) change in fair value of contingent consideration, (xi) goodwill impairment, (xii) certain legal expenses, (xiii) certain acquisition related costs if applicable, and (xiv) other costs. We define Adjusted net income as net income to common shareholders plus (i) amortization of intangibles, (ii) amortization of developed technology, (iii) amortization of debt discount and issuance costs (iv) preferred accretion, (v) equity-based compensation, (vi) change in fair value of derivative assets, (vii) change in fair value of contingent consideration, (viii) goodwill impairment, (ix) certain legal expenses, (x) certain acquisition related costs if applicable, (xi) other costs, and (xii) income tax (benefit) expense of adjustments. We define Free cash flow as Cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchase of property, plant and equipment. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP results and results excluding special items (“non-GAAP”) is included within this presentation. We calculate net income (loss) per share as net income (loss) to common shareholders divided by the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the applicable period and we define Adjusted net income per share as Adjusted net income (as detailed above) divided by the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the applicable period.\n\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the reader’s understanding of our past financial performance and our prospects for the future. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company’s performance, as well as in planning and forecasting future periods. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\nAmong other limitations, Adjusted gross profit, Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; do not reflect income tax expense or benefit; and other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted gross profit, Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income differently than we do, which limits their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, Adjusted gross profit, Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted gross profit, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of gross profit to Adjusted gross profit and net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\n\n(1) A reconciliation of the most comparable GAAP measure to its Non-GAAP measure is included below.(2) A reconciliation of projected Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income per share, which are forward-looking measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, is not provided because we are unable to provide such reconciliation without unreasonable effort. The inability to provide a quantitative reconciliation is due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty predicting the occurrence, the financial impact and the periods in which the components of the applicable GAAP measures and non-GAAP adjustments may be recognized. The GAAP measures may include the impact of such items as non-cash share-based compensation, revaluation of the fair-value of our contingent consideration, and the tax effect of such items, in addition to other items we have historically excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income per share. We expect to continue to exclude these items in future disclosures of these non-GAAP measures and may also exclude other similar items that may arise in the future (collectively, “non-GAAP adjustments”). The decisions and events that typically lead to the recognition of non-GAAP adjustments are inherently unpredictable as to if or when they may occur. As such, for our 2024 outlook, we have not included estimates for these items and are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.\n\n**ARRAY Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries****Consolidated Balance Sheets _(unaudited)_**_(in thousands, except per share and share amounts)_  \n---  \n**September 30,2024**| **December
