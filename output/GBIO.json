(Nasdaq:GBIO), a biotechnology company innovating genetic medicines for people living with rare and prevalent diseases, reported business highlights and third quarter 2024 financial results.\n\n“There is immense potential for a new class of redosable, selectively targeted _in vivo_ genetic medicines to fulfill the needs of people living with diseases that remain unaddressed by existing treatment options,” said Geoff McDonough, chief executive officer of Generation Bio. “Our cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle (ctLNP) platform has recently demonstrated highly selective _in vivo_ delivery of mRNA to T cells in non-human primates (NHPs), a key milestone on the path to developing _in vivo_ programs for T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.”\n\nGeneration Bio recently presented data at the European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ESGCT) 31st Annual Congress from an NHP study showing that a single IV dose of a ctLNP delivering mRNA selectively to T cells transduced most circulating T cells with balanced distribution to CD4+ and CD8+ cells. These data confirm and improve on the potency and biodistribution profiles seen in previous murine and NHP studies, which have shown minimal off-target distribution to LNP clearance tissues. The NHP study was conducted as part of the company’s collaboration with Moderna, Inc.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Cash Position** : Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $199.8 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $264.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2023. The company continues to believe that its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will fund its operating expenses and capital expenditures into the second half of 2027.\n  * **R &D Expenses**: Research and development (R&D) expenses were $15.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $21.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n  * **G &A Expenses**: General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $9.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $11.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n  * **Net Loss:** Net loss was $15.3 million, or $0.23 basic and diluted net loss per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $28.3 million, or $0.43 basic and diluted net loss per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**About Generation Bio** Generation Bio is innovating non-viral genetic medicines to provide durable and redosable treatments for hundreds of millions of patients living with rare and prevalent diseases. The company is developing two distinct and complementary platforms: a potent, highly selective cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle (ctLNP) delivery system and a novel immune-quiet DNA (iqDNA) cargo produced by a scalable capsid-free manufacturing process that uses proprietary cell-free rapid enzymatic synthesis (RES). With these platforms, Generation Bio aims to develop the next wave of non-viral genetic medicines to support its mission to extend the reach of genetic medicine to more people living with more diseases, around the world.\n\nFor more information, please visit [www.generationbio.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=b1ODo-Y0Y5cwkbCK7Z1UDTy3hfWEmRgi7kT-ZpvqHr_InndA_YcHZNrcdcrglMeV92yNS8TnbS97b-0im3sf-3kQkAHk2LL2qbLDmZnzmHw=).\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** Any statements in this press release about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, including statements about the company’s strategic plans or objectives, cash resources, technology platforms, research and clinical development plans, and preclinical data, and other statements containing the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” and similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

In the study, conducted as part of Generation Bio’s partnership with Moderna, Inc., NHPs received a single 1 mg/kg dose of ctLNP-mRNA, which transduced most T cells with balanced distribution to CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Untargeted LNPs did not elicit T cell transduction. The biodistribution of ctLNP-mRNA to the liver, spleen, lung, and monocytes was minimal. These results in NHPs confirm and improve on results from prior murine studies.\n\n![GBIO ESGCT 2024_Figure 1](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/3c098872-7ae4-4b14-979b-2062296d6ad2/gbio-esgct-2024-figure-1.png)\n\n_Figure 1: Highly specific transduction of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells with T cell targeted ctLNP achieved following 1 mg/kg dose of ctLNP-mRNA, with no monocyte uptake above baseline_\n\n“The robust and selective _in vivo_ delivery to T cells in an NHP model gives us the conviction to pursue development of T cell targeted _in vivo_ genetic medicines,” said Matt Stanton, Ph.D., chief science officer of Generation Bio.\n\nThe company also presented updates on iqDNA, which is a partially single-stranded DNA molecule that avoids recognition by primary DNA sensors in mice and NHPs. Recent work on the iqDNA platform has focused on methods of improving protein expression, including priming second strand synthesis by encoding the promoter region as double-stranded and stabilizing iqDNA against degradation by exonucleases.\n\nDr. Stanton added: “Our research on iqDNA continues to yield important insights into the characterization and behavior of this new molecule. We are pursuing increasingly focused areas of research to make iqDNA ready for the development of novel genetic medicines.”\n\nTo learn more about the data presented at ESGCT, visit the [Scientific Presentations](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=G8nE7kLDoe1CpJIL_eZgkzADdlEcPhjULM_JOYdQfQ_OYA54bhTvXykiXmUdlJmNYWMLihBLlfRMV5wAKALxCwvwa-t1ZzyicGu2m2bMjUYsXryOVcoX2oWv5EvP4-6Nil7-dwfEVZreySEJflfFBDAC53AzUFPUsPbhLTKkqAM=) page of Generation Bio’s website.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nAny statements in this press release about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, including statements about the company’s strategic plans or objectives, technology platforms, research and clinical development plans, and preclinical data and other statements containing the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” and similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
