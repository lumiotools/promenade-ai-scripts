(“TWFG”, the “Company” or “we”) (NASDAQ: TWFG), a high-growth insurance distribution company, today announced results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter****2024****Highlights**\n\n  * Total Written Premium for the quarter increased 13.0% to $400.1 million, compared to $354.1 million in the same period in the prior year\n  * Total revenues for the quarter increased 14.5% to $54.6 million, compared to $47.7 million in the same period in the prior year\n  * Organic Revenue Growth Rate* for the quarter was 7.6%\n  * Net income for the quarter was $6.9 million, compared to $7.6 million in the same period in the prior year\n  * Adjusted Net Income* for the quarter decreased 4.0% from the prior year period to $8.3 million, and Adjusted Net Income Margin* for the quarter was 15.3%\n  * Adjusted EBITDA* for the quarter increased 29.7% over the prior year period to $11.7 million, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin* for the quarter increased to 21.5% over the prior year period\n  * Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter was $11.7 million, compared to $7.4 million in the same period in the prior year\n  * Adjusted Free Cash Flow* for the quarter was $11.5 million, compared to $4.6 million in the same period in the prior year\n\n\n\n*Organic Revenue Growth Rate, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of Organic Revenue Growth Rate to total revenue growth rate, Adjusted Net income and Adjusted EBITDA to net income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to diluted earnings per share, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow to cash flow from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, are outlined in the reconciliation table accompanying this release.\n\n“Our thoughts and prayers go out to all those impacted by Hurricanes Beryl, Francine, Helene and Milton. Our agents, employees and carrier partners are working hard to help those impacted recover and rebuild,” stated Gordy Bunch, Founder, Chairman, and CEO.\n\n“Our third quarter results illustrate the resiliency of our agents, carriers, employees, and business model with total revenues increasing by 14.5% over the prior year period and Adjusted EBITDA increasing by 29.7%. We generated 7.6% organic growth and increased our Adjusted EBITDA margin to 21.5%.\n\n“In addition, our third quarter recruiting efforts continued to outpace our historical growth trends with our agency-in-a-box offering launching 86 new TWFG locations in the quarter. The 86 new agencies opened 13 new states for TWFG Branches in AL, CT, ID, IN, MO, NV, NM, OR, SC, SD, TN, WA and WY which we believe will provide future growth for our business.\n\n“Finally, I want to remind our fellow stockholders that experienced agents typically take between two to three years to become productive. We do not expect the 100-plus new branches we launched in 2024 to have a significant impact on revenues this year or next, but over the long term we expect the agents we are onboarding in 2024 to contribute meaningfully to our longer-term organic growth. \n\n“I want to thank all our dedicated employees who contributed to our positive results this quarter while navigating multiple hurricanes and an IPO.”\n\n**Third****Quarter****2024****Results**\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, Total Written Premium was $400.1 million, a 13% increase compared to the same period in the prior year. Revenues were $54.6 million, an increase of 14.5% compared to the same period in the prior year. Organic Revenues, a non-GAAP measure that excludes contingent income, fee income, and other income, for the third quarter of 2024 were $47.3 million compared to $42.8 million in the same period in the prior year. Organic Revenue Growth Rate in the third quarter was 7.6%, driven by strong new business growth, offset by normalizing premium retention and the impact of a change in one of our MGA programs that switched from a commission based on written premium to a flat fee starting in the first quarter of this year, with the greatest impact being felt in the current quarter.\n\nTotal commission expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $30.8 million, a 5.2% decrease from $32.5 million in the same period in the prior year. Commission expenses decreased despite 9.7% growth in commission income due to the conversion of nine branches to corporate branches, which transitioned our non-employee commission-based colleagues to employees. Upon conversion, these corporate branch employees received salaries, employee benefits, and bonuses for services rendered instead of commissions. Salaries and employee benefits for the third quarter of 2024 were $8.3 million, up 146% from $3.4 million in the same period in the prior year. Approximately $1.0 million of the increase was due to equity compensation expense, while $3.9 million of the increase was due to the branch conversions and 2023 corporate branch acquisitions, along with the growth in the business. Other administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $4.8 million, a 71.2% increase compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was due to growth in the business, increase in corporate branches and the absorption of public company costs.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, net income was $6.9 million, and net income margin was 12.6%, compared to $7.6 million of net income and net income margin of 15.9%, in the same period in the prior year. Adjusted Net Income for the third quarter of 2024 was $8.3 million, compared to $8.7 million in the same period in the prior year. Adjusted Net Income Margin for the third quarter was 15.3%, compared to 18.2% in the same period in the prior year.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $11.7 million, an increase of 29.7% over the prior year period. Our Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 21.5% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 19.0% in the same period in the prior year.\n\nCash flow from operating activities for the third quarter was $11.7 million, compared to $7.4 million in the same period in the prior year.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow for the third quarter of 2024 was $11.5 million, compared to $4.6 million in the same period in the prior year.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $191.2 million. We had $50.0 million unused capacity on our revolving credit facility of $50.0 million as of September 30, 2024. The total outstanding term notes payable balance was $6.4 million as of September 30, 2024.\n\n**Adjusted Net Income Calculation Methodology**\n\nSince the second quarter of 2024, we have used the revised calculation methodology for Adjusted Net Income, which includes amortization expenses among the add-back adjustments to our net income when calculating our Adjusted Net Income. Our legacy calculation methodology reflected the impact of intangible asset amortization as a reduction to our Adjusted Net Income. The revised calculation methodology excludes the effect of intangible asset amortization when calculating our Adjusted Net Income by reflecting it among the add-back adjustments to our net income. We believe that the revised calculation of Adjusted Net Income is more consistent with the method and presentation used by most of our peers and will allow management to better evaluate our performance relative to our peer companies. We believe that the revised calculation more effectively represents what our stakeholders consider useful in assessing our performance.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nTWFG will host a conference call and webcast tomorrow at 9:00 AM ET to discuss these results.\n\nTo access the call by phone, participants should [register at this link](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=MqSZG06E2N5vz_wiT9ZLCgyo2El4xwkTdeAFNfx74aROr6dNia4hAI9VsqM0bawVFED0RtGR4hEtc7VOOpzP6o6fe3Cufa2JMjbw7-61vNMnj4xxvNl3Nzdb9M4htogZO_FM6FtfDpfInHgaB3VJksTprsBrG2xsGtGKN4B1_iQ=), where they will be provided with the dial in details.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this report, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as “may,” “might,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue,” the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us, may include projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business. These statements are only predictions based on our current expectations and projections about future events. There are important factors that could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed under the captions entitled “Risk factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our prospectus (the “IPO Prospectus”) relating to our Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (Registration No. 333-280439), filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and in our other filings with the SEC. You should specifically consider the numerous risks outlined under “Risk factors” in the IPO Prospectus.\n\nAlthough we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators**\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**\n\nOrganic Revenue, Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Margin, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Free Cash Flow included in this release are not measures of financial performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and should not be considered substitutes for GAAP measures, including revenues (for Organic Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth), net income (for Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Margin, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin), and cash flow from operating activities (for Adjusted Free Cash Flow) which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for revenues, net income, operating cash flow or other consolidated financial statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate any or all of these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\n**_Organic Revenue._** Organic Revenue is total revenue (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) for the relevant period, excluding contingent income, fee income, other income and those revenues generated from acquired businesses with over $0.5 million in annualized revenue that have not reached the twelve-month owned mark.\n\n**_Organic Revenue Growth._** Organic Revenue Growth is the change in Organic Revenue period-to-period, with prior period results adjusted to include revenues that were excluded in the prior period because the relevant acquired businesses had not reached the twelve-month-owned mark but have reached the twelve-month owned mark in the current period. We believe Organic Revenue Growth is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of acquisitions, which affects the comparability of results from period to period.\n\n**_Adjusted Net Income._** Adjusted Net Income is a supplemental measure of our performance and is defined as net income (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) before amortization, non-recurring or non-operating income and expenses, including equity-based compensation, adjusted to assume a single class of stock (Class A) and assuming noncontrolling interests do not exist. We believe Adjusted Net Income is a useful measure because it adjusts for the after-tax impact of significant one-time, non-recurring items and eliminates the impact of any transactions that do not directly affect what management considers to be our ongoing operating performance in the period. These adjustments generally eliminate the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state, and local taxes, with respect to our allocable share of any net taxable income of TWFG Holding Company, LLC. Adjusted Net Income pre-IPO did not reflect adjustments for income taxes since TWFG Holding Company, LLC is a limited liability company and is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Post-IPO, the calculation will incorporate the impact of federal and state statutory tax rates on 100% of our adjusted pre-tax income as if the Company owned 100% of TWFG Holding Company, LLC.\n\n**_Adjusted Net Income Margin._** Adjusted Net Income Margin is Adjusted Net Income divided by total revenues. We believe that Adjusted Net Income Margin is a useful measurement of operating profitability for the same reasons we find Adjusted Net Income useful and also because it provides a period-to-period comparison of our after-tax operating performance.\n\n**_Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share._** Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share is Adjusted Net Income divided by diluted shares outstanding after adjusting for the effect of (i) the exchange of 100% of the outstanding Class B common stock of the Company (the “Class B Common Stock”) and Class C common stock of the Company (the “Class C Common Stock”) (together with the related limited liability units in TWFG Holding Company, LLC (the “LLC Units”)) into shares of Class A common stock of the Company (“Class A Common Stock”) and (ii) the vesting of 100% of the unvested equity awards and exchange into shares of Class A Common Stock. This measure does not deduct earnings related to the noncontrolling interests in TWFG Holding Company, LLC for the period prior to July 19, 2024, when we did not own 100% of the business. The most directly comparable GAAP financial metric is diluted earnings per share. We believe Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share may be useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance and efficiency because this measure is widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such measure, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon acquisition activity and capital structure. This measure also eliminates the impact of expenses that do not relate to core business performance, among other factors.\n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA._** Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance and is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude equity-based compensation and other non-operating items, including, certain nonrecurring or non-operating gains or losses, including equity-based compensation. EBITDA is defined as net income (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it adjusts for significant one-time, non-recurring items and eliminates the ongoing accounting effects of certain capital spending and acquisitions, such as depreciation and amortization, that do not directly affect what management considers to be our ongoing operating performance in the period. These adjustments eliminate the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA Margin._** Adjusted EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a useful measurement of operating profitability for the same reasons we find Adjusted EBITDA useful and also because it provides a period-to-period comparison of our operating performance.\n\n**_Adjusted Free Cash Flow._** Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a supplemental measure of our performance. We define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as cash flow from operating activities (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) less cash payments for tax distributions, purchases of property, plant, and equipment and acquisition-related costs. We believe Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a useful measure of operating performance because it represents the cash flow from the business that is within our discretion to direct to activities including investments, debt repayment, and returning capital to stockholders.\n\nThe reconciliation of the above non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measure is outlined in the reconciliation table accompanying this release.\n\n**_Key Performance Indicators_**\n\n**_Total Written Premium._** Total Written Premium represents, for any reported period, the total amount of current premium (net of cancellation) placed with insurance carriers. We utilize Total Written Premium as a key performance indicator when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our performance. We believe Total Written Premium is a useful metric because it is the underlying driver of the majority of our revenue.\n\n**Contacts** Investor Contact:Jeff Arricale for TWFGEmail:

(\"TWFG\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: TWFG), a high-growth insurance distribution company, today announced results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n[ ![Gordy Bunch - Founder and CEO The Woodlands Financial Group, TWFG Insurance \\(PRNewsfoto/The Woodlands Financial Group\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/431185/TWFG_Gordy_Bunch_III.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/431185/TWFG_Gordy_Bunch_III.html)\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Total Written Premium for the quarter increased 20.3% to $393.6 million, compared to $327.2 million in the same period in the prior year\n  * Total revenues for the quarter increased 17.4% to $53.3 million, compared to $45.4 million in the same period in the prior year\n  * Organic Revenue Growth Rate* for the quarter was 13.8%\n  * Net income for the quarter was $6.9 million, compared to $7.1 million in the same period in the prior year\n  * Adjusted Net Income* for the quarter increased 18.1% over the prior year period to $9.8 million, and Adjusted Net Income Margin* for the quarter was 18.4%\n  * Adjusted EBITDA* for the quarter increased 25.8% over the prior year period to $10.8 million, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin* for the quarter was 20.2%\n  * Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter was $7.4 million, compared to $6.9 million in the same period in the prior year\n  * Adjusted Free Cash Flow* for the quarter was $3.7 million, compared to $1.9 million in the same period in the prior year\n\n\n\n*Organic Revenue Growth Rate, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of Organic Revenue Growth Rate to total revenue growth rate, Adjusted Net income and Adjusted EBITDA to net income, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow to cash flow from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, are outlined in the reconciliation table accompanying this release.  \n---  \n  \n\"We delivered a strong second quarter and our value proposition to independent and captive agents continues to resonate in the marketplace\" stated Gordy Bunch, Founder, Chairman, and CEO. \"In the second quarter, total revenues increased 17.4% over the prior year period and we generated 13.8% organic growth. Over the past couple of years, we have seen unprecedented disruption in the personal lines market, impacting thousands of our clients and highlighting the value our local agents and their staff bring to policyholders as we navigate a recalibration of carrier risk appetite and product availability.\" \"We are seeing signs of improved underwriting margins at our carrier partners and an increase in underwriting appetite, which bodes well for new business opportunities and more orderly renewals for our agents and their customers.\" \n\nBunch added \"It has been a busy and historic year for TWFG thus far in 2024. We converted nine branches to corporate locations in January. We completed our initial public offering in July, which included significant participation by our employees, existing stockholders, and agents. In the first half of the year, we welcomed 44 experienced former captive agents to the TWFG family. This opportunistic onboarding of seasoned, client-focused agents demonstrates how TWFG is uniquely positioned to capture the ongoing shift from captive distribution to independent distribution. I want to remind our fellow stockholders that experienced agents typically take between two to three years to become productive with us as they transition from the captive model and relaunch their careers as independent agents. We do not expect this influx of talent to have a significant impact on revenues this year or next, but over the long-term we expect the agents we are onboarding in 2024 to contribute meaningfully to our organic growth.\" \n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, Total Written Premium was $393.6 million, a 20.3% increase compared to the same period in the prior year. Revenues were $53.3 million, an increase of 17.4% compared to the same period in the prior year. Organic Revenues, a non-GAAP measure that excludes contingent income, fee income, and other income, for the second quarter of 2024 were $47.4 million, a 16.6% increase from $40.7 million in the same period in the prior year. Organic Revenue Growth was driven by strong premium retention of 93% and healthy new business premium.\n\nTotal commission expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $32.0 million, a 3.5% increase from $30.9 million in the same period in the prior year. Commission expenses grew slower than the 16.5% growth in commission income due to the conversion of nine branches to corporate branches, which transitioned our non-employee commission-based colleagues to employees. Upon conversion, these corporate branches' employees received salaries, employee benefits, and bonuses for services rendered instead of commissions. Salaries and employee benefits for the second quarter of 2024 were $6.8 million, up 102.3% from $3.4 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the aforementioned branch conversions along with the growth in the business. Other administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $3.7 million, a 36.8% increase compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was driven by branch conversions, growth in the business, and public company costs.\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, net income was $6.9 million, and net income margin was 13.0%, compared to $7.1 million of net income and net income margin of 15.6%, in the same period in the prior year. Adjusted Net Income for the second quarter of 2024 was $9.8 million, compared to $8.3 million in the same period in the prior year. Adjusted Net Income Margin for the second quarter was 18.4%, compared to 18.3% in the same period in the prior year.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $10.8 million, an increase of 25.8% over the prior year period. Our Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 20.2% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 18.8% in the same period in the prior year.\n\nCash flow from operating activities for the second quarter was $7.4 million, compared to $6.9 million in the same period in the prior year.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow for the second quarter of 2024 was $3.7 million, compared to $1.9 million in the same period in the prior year.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $25.8 million. We had $9.0 million unused capacity on our revolving credit facility of $50.0 million as of June 30, 2024, the outstanding balance of which was subsequently repaid in connection with the IPO. The total outstanding term notes payable balance was $7.0 million as of June 30, 2024.\n\n**Adjusted Net Income Calculation Methodology**\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, we revised the calculation of Adjusted Net Income to include amortization expenses among the add-back adjustments to our net income when calculating our Adjusted Net Income. Our legacy calculation methodology reflected the impact of intangible asset amortization as a reduction to our Adjusted Net Income. The revised calculation methodology excluded the effect of the intangible asset amortization when calculating our Adjusted Net Income by reflecting it among the add-back adjustments to our net income. We believe that the revised calculation of Adjusted Net Income is more consistent with the method and presentation used by most of our peers and will allow management to better evaluate our performance relative to our peer companies. We believe that the revised calculation more effectively represents what our stakeholders consider useful in assessing our performance.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nTWFG will host a conference call and webcast tomorrow at 9:00 AM ET to discuss these results.\n\nTo access the call by phone, participants should _register at this link_ , where they will be provided with the dial in details.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this report, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as \"may,\" \"might,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential\" or \"continue,\" the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us, may include projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business. These statements are only predictions based on our current expectations and projections about future events. There are important factors that could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed under the captions entitled \"Risk factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our prospectus (the \"IPO Prospectus\") relating to our Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (Registration No. 333-280439), filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. You should specifically consider the numerous risks outlined under \"Risk factors\" in the IPO Prospectus.\n\nAlthough we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators**\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**\n\nOrganic Revenue, Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Free Cash Flow included in this release are not measures of financial performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and should not be considered substitutes for GAAP measures, including revenues (for Organic Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth), net income (for Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin), and cash flow from operating activities (for Adjusted Free Cash Flow) which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for revenues, net income, operating cash flow or other consolidated financial statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate any or all of these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\n**_Organic Revenue._** Organic Revenue is total revenue (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) for the relevant period, excluding contingent income, fee income, other income and those revenues generated from acquired businesses with over $0.5 million in annualized revenue that have not reached the twelve-month owned mark.\n\n**_Organic Revenue Growth._** Organic Revenue Growth is the change in Organic Revenue period-to-period, with prior period results adjusted to include revenues that were excluded in the prior period because the relevant acquired businesses had not reached the twelve-month-owned mark but have reached the twelve-month owned mark in the current period. We believe Organic Revenue Growth is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of acquisitions, which affects the comparability of results from period to period.\n\n**_Adjusted Net Income._** Adjusted Net Income is a supplemental measure of our performance and is defined as net income (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) before amortization, non-recurring or non-operating income and expenses, including equity-based compensation, adjusted to assume a single class of stock (Class A) and assuming noncontrolling interests do not exist. We believe Adjusted Net Income is a useful measure because it adjusts for the after-tax impact of significant one-time, non-recurring items and eliminates the impact of any transactions that do not directly affect what management considers to be our ongoing operating performance in the period. These adjustments generally eliminate the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state, and local taxes, with respect to our allocable share of any net taxable income of TWFG Holding Company, LLC. Adjusted Net Income pre-IPO did not reflect adjustments for income taxes since TWFG Holding Company, LLC is a limited liability company and is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Post-IPO, the calculation will incorporate the impact of federal and state statutory tax rates on 100% of our adjusted pre-tax income as if the Company owned 100% of TWFG Holding Company, LLC.\n\n**_Adjusted Net Income Margin._** Adjusted Net Income Margin is Adjusted Net Income divided by total revenues. We believe that Adjusted Net Income Margin is a useful measurement of operating profitability for the same reasons we find Adjusted Net Income useful and also because it provides a period-to-period comparison of our after-tax operating performance.\n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA._** Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance and is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude equity-based compensation and other non-operating items, including, certain nonrecurring or non-operating gains or losses. EBITDA is defined as net income (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it adjusts for significant one-time, non-recurring items and eliminates the ongoing accounting effects of certain capital spending and acquisitions, such as depreciation and amortization, that do not directly affect what management considers to be our ongoing operating performance in the period. These adjustments generally eliminate the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA Margin._** Adjusted EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a useful measurement of operating profitability for the same reasons we find Adjusted EBITDA useful and also because it provides a period-to-period comparison of our operating performance.\n\n**_Adjusted Free Cash Flow._** Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a supplemental measure of our performance. We define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as cash flow from operating activities (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) less cash payments for tax distributions, purchases of property, plant, and equipment and acquisition-related costs. We believe Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a useful measure of operating performance because it represents the cash flow from the business that is within our discretion to direct to activities including investments, debt repayment, and returning capital to stockholders.\n\nThe reconciliation of the above non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measure is outlined in the reconciliation table accompanying this release.\n\n**_Key Performance Indicators_**\n\n**_Total Written Premium._** Total Written Premium represents, for any reported period, the total amount of current premium (net of cancellation) placed with insurance carriers. We utilize Total Written Premium as a key performance indicator when planning, monitoring and evaluating our performance. We believe Total Written Premium is a useful metric because it is the underlying driver of the majority of our revenue.\n\n**Contacts** Investor Contact:Jeff Arricale for TWFGEmail: _jeff.arricale@twfg.com_\n\nPR Contact:Alex Bunch for TWFGEmail: _alex@twfg.com_\n\n**Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (Unaudited)** _(Amounts in thousands, except unit and per unit data)_  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****June 30 ,** |  **Six Months Ended****June 30 ,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Revenues**  \nCommission income |  $ 48,662 |  $ 41,771 |  $ 91,207 |  $ 78,458  \nContingent income |  1,258 |  1,003 |  2,334 |  1,988  \nFee income |  2,689 |  2,208 |  4,921 |  4,236  \nOther income |  657 |  394 |  1,117 |  550  \nTotal revenues |  53,266 |  45,376 |  99,579 |  85,232  \n**Expenses**  \nCommission expense |  31,962 |  30,896 |  58,405 |  58,392  \nSalaries and employee benefits |  6,816 |  3,370 |  13,070 |  6,706  \nOther administrative expenses |  3,744 |  2,736 |  6,874 |  5,231  \nDepreciation and amortization |  2,968 |  1,134 |  5,981 |  2,195  \n**Total operating expenses** |  45,490 |  38,136 |  84,330 |  72,524  \n**Operating income** |  7,776 |  7,240 |  15,249 |  12,708  \nInterest expense |  (872) |  (173) |  (1,714) |  (258)  \nOther non-operating income (expense), net |  14 |  — |  12 |  (11)  \n**Net income from continuing operations** |  6,918 |  7,067 |  13,547 |  12,439  \nNet income from discontinued operation, net of tax |  — |  — |  — |  834  \n**Net income** |  $ 6,918 |  $ 7,067 |  $ 13,547 |  $ 13,273  \n**Weighted average units used in the computation of net income per unit:**  \nBasic |  659,439 |  631,750 |  659,439 |  631,750  \nDiluted |  659,439 |  631,750 |  659,439 |  631,750  \n**Net income per unit:**  \nNet income from continuing operations per unit -

(“TWFG”, the “Company” or “we”) (NASDAQ: TWFG), a high-growth insurance distribution company, today announced results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter****2024****Highlights**\n\n  * Total Written Premium for the quarter increased 13.0% to $400.1 million, compared to $354.1 million in the same period in the prior year\n  * Total revenues for the quarter increased 14.5% to $54.6 million, compared to $47.7 million in the same period in the prior year\n  * Organic Revenue Growth Rate* for the quarter was 7.6%\n  * Net income for the quarter was $6.9 million, compared to $7.6 million in the same period in the prior year\n  * Adjusted Net Income* for the quarter decreased 4.0% from the prior year period to $8.3 million, and Adjusted Net Income Margin* for the quarter was 15.3%\n  * Adjusted EBITDA* for the quarter increased 29.7% over the prior year period to $11.7 million, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin* for the quarter increased to 21.5% over the prior year period\n  * Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter was $11.7 million, compared to $7.4 million in the same period in the prior year\n  * Adjusted Free Cash Flow* for the quarter was $11.5 million, compared to $4.6 million in the same period in the prior year\n\n\n\n*Organic Revenue Growth Rate, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of Organic Revenue Growth Rate to total revenue growth rate, Adjusted Net income and Adjusted EBITDA to net income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to diluted earnings per share, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow to cash flow from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, are outlined in the reconciliation table accompanying this release.\n\n“Our thoughts and prayers go out to all those impacted by Hurricanes Beryl, Francine, Helene and Milton. Our agents, employees and carrier partners are working hard to help those impacted recover and rebuild,” stated Gordy Bunch, Founder, Chairman, and CEO.\n\n“Our third quarter results illustrate the resiliency of our agents, carriers, employees, and business model with total revenues increasing by 14.5% over the prior year period and Adjusted EBITDA increasing by 29.7%. We generated 7.6% organic growth and increased our Adjusted EBITDA margin to 21.5%.\n\n“In addition, our third quarter recruiting efforts continued to outpace our historical growth trends with our agency-in-a-box offering launching 86 new TWFG locations in the quarter. The 86 new agencies opened 13 new states for TWFG Branches in AL, CT, ID, IN, MO, NV, NM, OR, SC, SD, TN, WA and WY which we believe will provide future growth for our business.\n\n“Finally, I want to remind our fellow stockholders that experienced agents typically take between two to three years to become productive. We do not expect the 100-plus new branches we launched in 2024 to have a significant impact on revenues this year or next, but over the long term we expect the agents we are onboarding in 2024 to contribute meaningfully to our longer-term organic growth. \n\n“I want to thank all our dedicated employees who contributed to our positive results this quarter while navigating multiple hurricanes and an IPO.”\n\n**Third****Quarter****2024****Results**\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, Total Written Premium was $400.1 million, a 13% increase compared to the same period in the prior year. Revenues were $54.6 million, an increase of 14.5% compared to the same period in the prior year. Organic Revenues, a non-GAAP measure that excludes contingent income, fee income, and other income, for the third quarter of 2024 were $47.3 million compared to $42.8 million in the same period in the prior year. Organic Revenue Growth Rate in the third quarter was 7.6%, driven by strong new business growth, offset by normalizing premium retention and the impact of a change in one of our MGA programs that switched from a commission based on written premium to a flat fee starting in the first quarter of this year, with the greatest impact being felt in the current quarter.\n\nTotal commission expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $30.8 million, a 5.2% decrease from $32.5 million in the same period in the prior year. Commission expenses decreased despite 9.7% growth in commission income due to the conversion of nine branches to corporate branches, which transitioned our non-employee commission-based colleagues to employees. Upon conversion, these corporate branch employees received salaries, employee benefits, and bonuses for services rendered instead of commissions. Salaries and employee benefits for the third quarter of 2024 were $8.3 million, up 146% from $3.4 million in the same period in the prior year. Approximately $1.0 million of the increase was due to equity compensation expense, while $3.9 million of the increase was due to the branch conversions and 2023 corporate branch acquisitions, along with the growth in the business. Other administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $4.8 million, a 71.2% increase compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was due to growth in the business, increase in corporate branches and the absorption of public company costs.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, net income was $6.9 million, and net income margin was 12.6%, compared to $7.6 million of net income and net income margin of 15.9%, in the same period in the prior year. Adjusted Net Income for the third quarter of 2024 was $8.3 million, compared to $8.7 million in the same period in the prior year. Adjusted Net Income Margin for the third quarter was 15.3%, compared to 18.2% in the same period in the prior year.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $11.7 million, an increase of 29.7% over the prior year period. Our Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 21.5% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 19.0% in the same period in the prior year.\n\nCash flow from operating activities for the third quarter was $11.7 million, compared to $7.4 million in the same period in the prior year.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow for the third quarter of 2024 was $11.5 million, compared to $4.6 million in the same period in the prior year.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $191.2 million. We had $50.0 million unused capacity on our revolving credit facility of $50.0 million as of September 30, 2024. The total outstanding term notes payable balance was $6.4 million as of September 30, 2024.\n\n**Adjusted Net Income Calculation Methodology**\n\nSince the second quarter of 2024, we have used the revised calculation methodology for Adjusted Net Income, which includes amortization expenses among the add-back adjustments to our net income when calculating our Adjusted Net Income. Our legacy calculation methodology reflected the impact of intangible asset amortization as a reduction to our Adjusted Net Income. The revised calculation methodology excludes the effect of intangible asset amortization when calculating our Adjusted Net Income by reflecting it among the add-back adjustments to our net income. We believe that the revised calculation of Adjusted Net Income is more consistent with the method and presentation used by most of our peers and will allow management to better evaluate our performance relative to our peer companies. We believe that the revised calculation more effectively represents what our stakeholders consider useful in assessing our performance.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nTWFG will host a conference call and webcast tomorrow at 9:00 AM ET to discuss these results.\n\nTo access the call by phone, participants should [register at this link](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=MqSZG06E2N5vz_wiT9ZLCgyo2El4xwkTdeAFNfx74aROr6dNia4hAI9VsqM0bawVFED0RtGR4hEtc7VOOpzP6o6fe3Cufa2JMjbw7-61vNMnj4xxvNl3Nzdb9M4htogZO_FM6FtfDpfInHgaB3VJksTprsBrG2xsGtGKN4B1_iQ=), where they will be provided with the dial in details.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this report, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as “may,” “might,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue,” the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us, may include projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business. These statements are only predictions based on our current expectations and projections about future events. There are important factors that could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed under the captions entitled “Risk factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our prospectus (the “IPO Prospectus”) relating to our Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (Registration No. 333-280439), filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and in our other filings with the SEC. You should specifically consider the numerous risks outlined under “Risk factors” in the IPO Prospectus.\n\nAlthough we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators**\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**\n\nOrganic Revenue, Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Margin, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Free Cash Flow included in this release are not measures of financial performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and should not be considered substitutes for GAAP measures, including revenues (for Organic Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth), net income (for Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Margin, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin), and cash flow from operating activities (for Adjusted Free Cash Flow) which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for revenues, net income, operating cash flow or other consolidated financial statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate any or all of these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\n**_Organic Revenue._** Organic Revenue is total revenue (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) for the relevant period, excluding contingent income, fee income, other income and those revenues generated from acquired businesses with over $0.5 million in annualized revenue that have not reached the twelve-month owned mark.\n\n**_Organic Revenue Growth._** Organic Revenue Growth is the change in Organic Revenue period-to-period, with prior period results adjusted to include revenues that were excluded in the prior period because the relevant acquired businesses had not reached the twelve-month-owned mark but have reached the twelve-month owned mark in the current period. We believe Organic Revenue Growth is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of acquisitions, which affects the comparability of results from period to period.\n\n**_Adjusted Net Income._** Adjusted Net Income is a supplemental measure of our performance and is defined as net income (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) before amortization, non-recurring or non-operating income and expenses, including equity-based compensation, adjusted to assume a single class of stock (Class A) and assuming noncontrolling interests do not exist. We believe Adjusted Net Income is a useful measure because it adjusts for the after-tax impact of significant one-time, non-recurring items and eliminates the impact of any transactions that do not directly affect what management considers to be our ongoing operating performance in the period. These adjustments generally eliminate the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state, and local taxes, with respect to our allocable share of any net taxable income of TWFG Holding Company, LLC. Adjusted Net Income pre-IPO did not reflect adjustments for income taxes since TWFG Holding Company, LLC is a limited liability company and is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Post-IPO, the calculation will incorporate the impact of federal and state statutory tax rates on 100% of our adjusted pre-tax income as if the Company owned 100% of TWFG Holding Company, LLC.\n\n**_Adjusted Net Income Margin._** Adjusted Net Income Margin is Adjusted Net Income divided by total revenues. We believe that Adjusted Net Income Margin is a useful measurement of operating profitability for the same reasons we find Adjusted Net Income useful and also because it provides a period-to-period comparison of our after-tax operating performance.\n\n**_Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share._** Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share is Adjusted Net Income divided by diluted shares outstanding after adjusting for the effect of (i) the exchange of 100% of the outstanding Class B common stock of the Company (the “Class B Common Stock”) and Class C common stock of the Company (the “Class C Common Stock”) (together with the related limited liability units in TWFG Holding Company, LLC (the “LLC Units”)) into shares of Class A common stock of the Company (“Class A Common Stock”) and (ii) the vesting of 100% of the unvested equity awards and exchange into shares of Class A Common Stock. This measure does not deduct earnings related to the noncontrolling interests in TWFG Holding Company, LLC for the period prior to July 19, 2024, when we did not own 100% of the business. The most directly comparable GAAP financial metric is diluted earnings per share. We believe Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share may be useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance and efficiency because this measure is widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such measure, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon acquisition activity and capital structure. This measure also eliminates the impact of expenses that do not relate to core business performance, among other factors.\n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA._** Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance and is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude equity-based compensation and other non-operating items, including, certain nonrecurring or non-operating gains or losses, including equity-based compensation. EBITDA is defined as net income (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it adjusts for significant one-time, non-recurring items and eliminates the ongoing accounting effects of certain capital spending and acquisitions, such as depreciation and amortization, that do not directly affect what management considers to be our ongoing operating performance in the period. These adjustments eliminate the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA Margin._** Adjusted EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a useful measurement of operating profitability for the same reasons we find Adjusted EBITDA useful and also because it provides a period-to-period comparison of our operating performance.\n\n**_Adjusted Free Cash Flow._** Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a supplemental measure of our performance. We define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as cash flow from operating activities (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) less cash payments for tax distributions, purchases of property, plant, and equipment and acquisition-related costs. We believe Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a useful measure of operating performance because it represents the cash flow from the business that is within our discretion to direct to activities including investments, debt repayment, and returning capital to stockholders.\n\nThe reconciliation of the above non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measure is outlined in the reconciliation table accompanying this release.\n\n**_Key Performance Indicators_**\n\n**_Total Written Premium._** Total Written Premium represents, for any reported period, the total amount of current premium (net of cancellation) placed with insurance carriers. We utilize Total Written Premium as a key performance indicator when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our performance. We believe Total Written Premium is a useful metric because it is the underlying driver of the majority of our revenue.\n\n**Contacts** Investor Contact:Jeff Arricale for TWFGEmail:

(\"TWFG\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: TWFG), a high-growth insurance distribution company, today announced results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n[ ![Gordy Bunch - Founder and CEO The Woodlands Financial Group, TWFG Insurance \\(PRNewsfoto/The Woodlands Financial Group\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/431185/TWFG_Gordy_Bunch_III.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/431185/TWFG_Gordy_Bunch_III.html)\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Total Written Premium for the quarter increased 20.3% to $393.6 million, compared to $327.2 million in the same period in the prior year\n  * Total revenues for the quarter increased 17.4% to $53.3 million, compared to $45.4 million in the same period in the prior year\n  * Organic Revenue Growth Rate* for the quarter was 13.8%\n  * Net income for the quarter was $6.9 million, compared to $7.1 million in the same period in the prior year\n  * Adjusted Net Income* for the quarter increased 18.1% over the prior year period to $9.8 million, and Adjusted Net Income Margin* for the quarter was 18.4%\n  * Adjusted EBITDA* for the quarter increased 25.8% over the prior year period to $10.8 million, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin* for the quarter was 20.2%\n  * Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter was $7.4 million, compared to $6.9 million in the same period in the prior year\n  * Adjusted Free Cash Flow* for the quarter was $3.7 million, compared to $1.9 million in the same period in the prior year\n\n\n\n*Organic Revenue Growth Rate, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of Organic Revenue Growth Rate to total revenue growth rate, Adjusted Net income and Adjusted EBITDA to net income, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow to cash flow from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, are outlined in the reconciliation table accompanying this release.  \n---  \n  \n\"We delivered a strong second quarter and our value proposition to independent and captive agents continues to resonate in the marketplace\" stated Gordy Bunch, Founder, Chairman, and CEO. \"In the second quarter, total revenues increased 17.4% over the prior year period and we generated 13.8% organic growth. Over the past couple of years, we have seen unprecedented disruption in the personal lines market, impacting thousands of our clients and highlighting the value our local agents and their staff bring to policyholders as we navigate a recalibration of carrier risk appetite and product availability.\" \"We are seeing signs of improved underwriting margins at our carrier partners and an increase in underwriting appetite, which bodes well for new business opportunities and more orderly renewals for our agents and their customers.\" \n\nBunch added \"It has been a busy and historic year for TWFG thus far in 2024. We converted nine branches to corporate locations in January. We completed our initial public offering in July, which included significant participation by our employees, existing stockholders, and agents. In the first half of the year, we welcomed 44 experienced former captive agents to the TWFG family. This opportunistic onboarding of seasoned, client-focused agents demonstrates how TWFG is uniquely positioned to capture the ongoing shift from captive distribution to independent distribution. I want to remind our fellow stockholders that experienced agents typically take between two to three years to become productive with us as they transition from the captive model and relaunch their careers as independent agents. We do not expect this influx of talent to have a significant impact on revenues this year or next, but over the long-term we expect the agents we are onboarding in 2024 to contribute meaningfully to our organic growth.\" \n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, Total Written Premium was $393.6 million, a 20.3% increase compared to the same period in the prior year. Revenues were $53.3 million, an increase of 17.4% compared to the same period in the prior year. Organic Revenues, a non-GAAP measure that excludes contingent income, fee income, and other income, for the second quarter of 2024 were $47.4 million, a 16.6% increase from $40.7 million in the same period in the prior year. Organic Revenue Growth was driven by strong premium retention of 93% and healthy new business premium.\n\nTotal commission expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $32.0 million, a 3.5% increase from $30.9 million in the same period in the prior year. Commission expenses grew slower than the 16.5% growth in commission income due to the conversion of nine branches to corporate branches, which transitioned our non-employee commission-based colleagues to employees. Upon conversion, these corporate branches' employees received salaries, employee benefits, and bonuses for services rendered instead of commissions. Salaries and employee benefits for the second quarter of 2024 were $6.8 million, up 102.3% from $3.4 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the aforementioned branch conversions along with the growth in the business. Other administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $3.7 million, a 36.8% increase compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was driven by branch conversions, growth in the business, and public company costs.\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, net income was $6.9 million, and net income margin was 13.0%, compared to $7.1 million of net income and net income margin of 15.6%, in the same period in the prior year. Adjusted Net Income for the second quarter of 2024 was $9.8 million, compared to $8.3 million in the same period in the prior year. Adjusted Net Income Margin for the second quarter was 18.4%, compared to 18.3% in the same period in the prior year.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $10.8 million, an increase of 25.8% over the prior year period. Our Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 20.2% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 18.8% in the same period in the prior year.\n\nCash flow from operating activities for the second quarter was $7.4 million, compared to $6.9 million in the same period in the prior year.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow for the second quarter of 2024 was $3.7 million, compared to $1.9 million in the same period in the prior year.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $25.8 million. We had $9.0 million unused capacity on our revolving credit facility of $50.0 million as of June 30, 2024, the outstanding balance of which was subsequently repaid in connection with the IPO. The total outstanding term notes payable balance was $7.0 million as of June 30, 2024.\n\n**Adjusted Net Income Calculation Methodology**\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, we revised the calculation of Adjusted Net Income to include amortization expenses among the add-back adjustments to our net income when calculating our Adjusted Net Income. Our legacy calculation methodology reflected the impact of intangible asset amortization as a reduction to our Adjusted Net Income. The revised calculation methodology excluded the effect of the intangible asset amortization when calculating our Adjusted Net Income by reflecting it among the add-back adjustments to our net income. We believe that the revised calculation of Adjusted Net Income is more consistent with the method and presentation used by most of our peers and will allow management to better evaluate our performance relative to our peer companies. We believe that the revised calculation more effectively represents what our stakeholders consider useful in assessing our performance.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nTWFG will host a conference call and webcast tomorrow at 9:00 AM ET to discuss these results.\n\nTo access the call by phone, participants should _register at this link_ , where they will be provided with the dial in details.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this report, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as \"may,\" \"might,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential\" or \"continue,\" the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us, may include projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business. These statements are only predictions based on our current expectations and projections about future events. There are important factors that could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed under the captions entitled \"Risk factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our prospectus (the \"IPO Prospectus\") relating to our Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (Registration No. 333-280439), filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. You should specifically consider the numerous risks outlined under \"Risk factors\" in the IPO Prospectus.\n\nAlthough we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators**\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**\n\nOrganic Revenue, Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Free Cash Flow included in this release are not measures of financial performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and should not be considered substitutes for GAAP measures, including revenues (for Organic Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth), net income (for Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin), and cash flow from operating activities (for Adjusted Free Cash Flow) which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for revenues, net income, operating cash flow or other consolidated financial statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate any or all of these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\n**_Organic Revenue._** Organic Revenue is total revenue (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) for the relevant period, excluding contingent income, fee income, other income and those revenues generated from acquired businesses with over $0.5 million in annualized revenue that have not reached the twelve-month owned mark.\n\n**_Organic Revenue Growth._** Organic Revenue Growth is the change in Organic Revenue period-to-period, with prior period results adjusted to include revenues that were excluded in the prior period because the relevant acquired businesses had not reached the twelve-month-owned mark but have reached the twelve-month owned mark in the current period. We believe Organic Revenue Growth is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of acquisitions, which affects the comparability of results from period to period.\n\n**_Adjusted Net Income._** Adjusted Net Income is a supplemental measure of our performance and is defined as net income (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) before amortization, non-recurring or non-operating income and expenses, including equity-based compensation, adjusted to assume a single class of stock (Class A) and assuming noncontrolling interests do not exist. We believe Adjusted Net Income is a useful measure because it adjusts for the after-tax impact of significant one-time, non-recurring items and eliminates the impact of any transactions that do not directly affect what management considers to be our ongoing operating performance in the period. These adjustments generally eliminate the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state, and local taxes, with respect to our allocable share of any net taxable income of TWFG Holding Company, LLC. Adjusted Net Income pre-IPO did not reflect adjustments for income taxes since TWFG Holding Company, LLC is a limited liability company and is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Post-IPO, the calculation will incorporate the impact of federal and state statutory tax rates on 100% of our adjusted pre-tax income as if the Company owned 100% of TWFG Holding Company, LLC.\n\n**_Adjusted Net Income Margin._** Adjusted Net Income Margin is Adjusted Net Income divided by total revenues. We believe that Adjusted Net Income Margin is a useful measurement of operating profitability for the same reasons we find Adjusted Net Income useful and also because it provides a period-to-period comparison of our after-tax operating performance.\n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA._** Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance and is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude equity-based compensation and other non-operating items, including, certain nonrecurring or non-operating gains or losses. EBITDA is defined as net income (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it adjusts for significant one-time, non-recurring items and eliminates the ongoing accounting effects of certain capital spending and acquisitions, such as depreciation and amortization, that do not directly affect what management considers to be our ongoing operating performance in the period. These adjustments generally eliminate the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA Margin._** Adjusted EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a useful measurement of operating profitability for the same reasons we find Adjusted EBITDA useful and also because it provides a period-to-period comparison of our operating performance.\n\n**_Adjusted Free Cash Flow._** Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a supplemental measure of our performance. We define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as cash flow from operating activities (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) less cash payments for tax distributions, purchases of property, plant, and equipment and acquisition-related costs. We believe Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a useful measure of operating performance because it represents the cash flow from the business that is within our discretion to direct to activities including investments, debt repayment, and returning capital to stockholders.\n\nThe reconciliation of the above non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measure is outlined in the reconciliation table accompanying this release.\n\n**_Key Performance Indicators_**\n\n**_Total Written Premium._** Total Written Premium represents, for any reported period, the total amount of current premium (net of cancellation) placed with insurance carriers. We utilize Total Written Premium as a key performance indicator when planning, monitoring and evaluating our performance. We believe Total Written Premium is a useful metric because it is the underlying driver of the majority of our revenue.\n\n**Contacts** Investor Contact:Jeff Arricale for TWFGEmail: _jeff.arricale@twfg.com_\n\nPR Contact:Alex Bunch for TWFGEmail: _alex@twfg.com_\n\n**Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (Unaudited)** _(Amounts in thousands, except unit and per unit data)_  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****June 30 ,** |  **Six Months Ended****June 30 ,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Revenues**  \nCommission income |  $ 48,662 |  $ 41,771 |  $ 91,207 |  $ 78,458  \nContingent income |  1,258 |  1,003 |  2,334 |  1,988  \nFee income |  2,689 |  2,208 |  4,921 |  4,236  \nOther income |  657 |  394 |  1,117 |  550  \nTotal revenues |  53,266 |  45,376 |  99,579 |  85,232  \n**Expenses**  \nCommission expense |  31,962 |  30,896 |  58,405 |  58,392  \nSalaries and employee benefits |  6,816 |  3,370 |  13,070 |  6,706  \nOther administrative expenses |  3,744 |  2,736 |  6,874 |  5,231  \nDepreciation and amortization |  2,968 |  1,134 |  5,981 |  2,195  \n**Total operating expenses** |  45,490 |  38,136 |  84,330 |  72,524  \n**Operating income** |  7,776 |  7,240 |  15,249 |  12,708  \nInterest expense |  (872) |  (173) |  (1,714) |  (258)  \nOther non-operating income (expense), net |  14 |  — |  12 |  (11)  \n**Net income from continuing operations** |  6,918 |  7,067 |  13,547 |  12,439  \nNet income from discontinued operation, net of tax |  — |  — |  — |  834  \n**Net income** |  $ 6,918 |  $ 7,067 |  $ 13,547 |  $ 13,273  \n**Weighted average units used in the computation of net income per unit:**  \nBasic |  659,439 |  631,750 |  659,439 |  631,750  \nDiluted |  659,439 |  631,750 |  659,439 |  631,750  \n**Net income per unit:**  \nNet income from continuing operations per unit -
