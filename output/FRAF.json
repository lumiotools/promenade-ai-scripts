Long-term net outflows were $32.6 billion, including $20.7 billion of reinvested distributions.\nExcluding Western Asset Management, our long-term net inflows were $16.0 billion.\n“During the fiscal year, we continued to increase our presence in our key focus areas which reflect areas of long-term client\ndemand. Client interest in alternative and multi-asset investment strategies generated positive flows for the year. Private\nmarkets fundraising totaled $14.8 billion with flagship funds in secondary private equity and alternative credit exceeding fund\ntargets. We saw strong growth across a broad range of investment vehicles with retail SMA, ETF and Canvas® AUM\nincreasing by 29%, 89% and 94% year-over-year, respectively – all to record highs. From a regional perspective, our\ninternational business continued to be a strength of the firm and experienced positive long-term net flows for the year,\nculminating in over $500 billion in AUM.\n“Our acquisition of Putnam Investments has exceeded our expectations. Since closing on January 1, Putnam’s AUM has grown\n21% to $180 billion and Franklin Templeton has generated positive net flows of approximately $11 billion in Putnam strategies,\n1\nbenefiting from our global distribution platform. The transaction has also exceeded our annual run-rate cost savings target of\n$150 million. We have returned $946 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n“We remain committed to our vision of building innovative and collaborative relationships with our clients and look forward to\nunlocking new opportunities that reflect the high standards that have defined Franklin Templeton as a trusted partner over 75\nyears. I would like to thank our employees around the world for their dedication and commitment to always putting our clients\nfirst.”\n% Quarter % Fiscal Year Ended\nQuarter Ended Change Ended Change September 30,\nQtr. vs. Year vs. %\n30-Sep-24 30-Jun-24 Qtr. 30-Sep-23 Year 2024 2023 Change\nFinancial Results\n(in millions, except per share data)\nOperating revenues $ 2,211.2 $ 2,122.9 4% $ 1,986.1 11% $ 8,478.0 $ 7,849.4 8%\nOperating income (loss) (150.7) 222.5 NM 338.3 NM 407.6 1,102.3 (63%)\nOperating margin (6.8%) 10.5% 17.0% 4.8% 14.0%\nNet income (loss)¹ $ (84.7) $ 174.0 NM $ 295.5 NM $ 464.8 $ 882.8 (47%)\nDiluted earnings (loss) per\nshare (0.19) 0.32 NM 0.58 NM 0.85 1.72 (51%)\nAs adjusted (non-GAAP):2\nAdjusted operating income $ 451.6 $ 424.9 6% $ 511.7 (12%) $ 1,713.1 $ 1,823.8 (6%)\nAdjusted operating margin 26.3% 25.7% 32.4% 26.1% 29.9%\nAdjusted net income $ 315.2 $ 326.4 (3%) $ 427.0 (26%) $ 1,276.7 $ 1,332.2 (4%)\nAdjusted diluted earnings per\nshare 0.59 0.60 (2%) 0.84 (30%) 2.39 2.60 (8%)\nAssets Under Management\n(in billions)\nEnding $ 1,678.6 $ 1,646.6 2% $ 1,374.2 22% $ 1,678.6 $ 1,374.2 22%\nAverage3 1,667.5 1,632.6 2% 1,419.1 18% 1,565.8 1,400.4 12%\nLong-term net flows (31.3) (3.2) (6.9) (32.6) (21.3)\nTotal assets under management (“AUM”) were $1,678.6 billion at September 30, 2024, up $32.0 billion or 2% during the\nquarter due to the positive impact of $63.5 billion of net market change, distributions, and other, partially offset by $31.3\nbillion of long-term net outflows, inclusive of $37.0 billion of long-term net outflows at Western Asset Management, and $0.2\nbillion of cash management net outflows.

Management believes these non-GAAP measures\nare useful indicators of our financial performance and may be helpful to investors in evaluating our relative performance against\nindustry peers.\n“Adjusted operating income,” “adjusted operating margin,” “adjusted net income” and “adjusted diluted earnings per\nshare” are defined below, followed by reconciliations of operating income (loss), operating margin, net income attributable to\nFranklin Resources, Inc. and diluted earnings per share on a U.S. GAAP basis to these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP\nmeasures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, any financial information prepared in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Additional reconciling\nitems may be added in the future to these non-GAAP measures if deemed appropriate.\nAdjusted Operating Income\nWe define adjusted operating income as operating income (loss) adjusted to exclude the following:\n• Elimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products.\n• Acquisition-related items:\n◦ Acquisition-related retention compensation.\n◦ Other acquisition-related expenses including professional fees, technology costs and fair value adjustments\nrelated to contingent consideration assets and liabilities.\n◦ Amortization of intangible assets.\n◦ Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, if any.\n• Special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to past acquisitions and certain\ninitiatives undertaken by the Company.\n• Impact on compensation and benefits expense from gains and losses on investments related to deferred compensation\nplans, which is offset in investment and other income (losses), net.\n• Impact on compensation and benefits expense related to minority interests in certain subsidiaries, which is offset in net\nincome (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests.\nAdjusted Operating Margin\nWe calculate adjusted operating margin as adjusted operating income divided by adjusted operating revenues. We define\nadjusted operating revenues as operating revenues adjusted to exclude the following:\n• Elimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products.\n• Acquisition-related performance-based investment management fees which are passed through as compensation and\nbenefits expense.\n• Sales and distribution fees and a portion of investment management fees allocated to cover sales, distribution and\nmarketing expenses paid to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our funds on our behalf.\n8\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\nWe define adjusted net income as net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. adjusted to exclude the following:\n• Activities of CIPs.\n• Acquisition-related items:\n◦ Acquisition-related retention compensation.\n◦ Other acquisition-related expenses including professional fees, technology costs and fair value adjustments\nrelated to contingent consideration assets and liabilities.\n◦ Amortization of intangible assets.\n◦ Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, if any.\n◦ Write off of noncontrolling interests related to the wind down of an acquired business.\n◦ Interest expense for amortization of Legg Mason debt premium from acquisition-date fair value adjustment.\n• Special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to past acquisitions and certain\ninitiatives undertaken by the Company.\n• Net gains or losses on investments related to deferred compensation plans which are not offset by compensation and\nbenefits expense.\n• Net compensation and benefits expense related to minority interests in certain subsidiaries not offset by net income\n(loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests.\n• Unrealized investment gains and losses.\n• Net income tax expense of the above adjustments based on the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments.\nWe define adjusted diluted earnings per share as diluted earnings per share adjusted to exclude the per share impacts of\nthe adjustments applied to net income in calculating adjusted net income.\nIn calculating our non-GAAP measures, we adjust for the impact of CIPs because it is not considered reflective of our\nunderlying results of operations. Acquisition-related items and special termination benefits are excluded to facilitate\ncomparability to other asset management firms. We adjust for compensation and benefits expense related to funded deferred\ncompensation plans because it is partially offset in other income (expense), net. We adjust for compensation and benefits\nexpense and net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests to reflect the economics of certain profits\ninterest arrangements. Sales and distribution fees and a portion of investment management fees generally cover sales,\ndistribution and marketing expenses and, therefore, are excluded from adjusted operating revenues. In addition, when\ncalculating adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share we exclude unrealized investment gains and losses\nincluded in investment and other income (losses) because the related investments are generally expected to be held long term.\n9\nThe calculations of adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted\nearnings per share are as follows:\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended\n(in millions) 30-Sep-24 30-Jun-24 30-Sep-23 30-Sep-24 30-Sep-23\nOperating income (loss) $ (150.7) $ 222.5 $ 338.3 $ 407.6 $ 1,102.3\nAdd (subtract):\nElimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of\ninvestment products* 12.7 12.3 11.2 47.4 37.5\nAcquisition-related retention 46.3 43.7 56.8 263.6 164.9\nCompensation and benefits expense from gains (losses)\non deferred compensation, net 15.7 1.8 (6.0) 50.5 20.3\nOther acquisition-related expenses 31.8 33.6 4.9 97.4 50.2\nAmortization of intangible assets 83.8 84.0 86.5 338.2 341.1\nImpairment of intangible assets 389.2 — — 389.2 —\nSpecial termination benefits 12.0 16.7 8.3 75.8 63.2\nCompensation and benefits expense related to minority\ninterests in certain subsidiaries 10.8 10.3 11.7 43.4 44.3\nAdjusted operating income $ 451.6 $ 424.9 $ 511.7 $ 1,713.1 $ 1,823.8\nTotal operating revenues $ 2,211.2 $ 2,122.9 $ 1,986.1 $ 8,478.0 $ 7,849.4\nAdd (subtract):\nAcquisition-related pass through performance fees (10.5) — (5.6) (97.5) (169.7)\nSales and distribution fees (368.0) (358.3) (306.4) (1,381.2) (1,203.7)\nAllocation of investment management fees for sales,\ndistribution and marketing expenses (128.9) (122.8) (104.7) (481.9) (409.4)\nElimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of\ninvestment products* 12.7 12.3 11.2 47.4 37.5\nAdjusted operating revenues $ 1,716.5 $ 1,654.1 $ 1,580.6 $ 6,564.8 $ 6,104.1\nOperating margin (6.8%) 10.5% 17.0% 4.8% 14.0%\nAdjusted operating margin 26.3% 25.7% 32.4% 26.1% 29.9%\n10\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended\n(in millions, except per share data) 30-Sep-24 30-Jun-24 30-Sep-23 30-Sep-24 30-Sep-23\nNet income (loss) attributable to Franklin Resources,\nInc. $ (84.7) $ 174.0 $ 295.5 $ 464.8 $ 882.8\nAdd (subtract):\nNet (income) loss of consolidated investment products* (2.8) (2.4) 1.6 (3.9) 8.0\nAcquisition-related retention 46.3 43.7 56.8 263.6 164.9\nOther acquisition-related expenses 32.0 34.9 8.9 107.0 70.4\nAmortization of intangible assets 83.8 84.0 86.5 338.2 341.1\nImpairment of intangible assets 389.2 — — 389.2 —\nSpecial termination benefits 12.0 16.7 8.3 75.8 63.2\nNet gains on deferred compensation plan investments\nnot offset by compensation and benefits expense (2.9) (1.1) (1.4) (13.9) (15.5)\nUnrealized investment (gains) losses (23.9) 31.0 20.6 (51.5) (2.6)\nInterest expense for amortization of debt premium (5.2) (6.4) (6.4) (24.4) (25.4)\nNet compensation and benefits expense related to\nminority interests in certain subsidiaries not offset by\nnet income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling\ninterests 2.3 2.8 1.0 3.5 0.1\nNet income tax expense of adjustments (130.9) (50.8) (44.4) (271.7) (154.8)\nAdjusted net income $ 315.2 $ 326.4 $ 427.0 $ 1,276.7 $ 1,332.2\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share $ (0.19) $ 0.32 $ 0.58 $ 0.85 $ 1.72\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share 0.59 0.60 0.84 2.39 2.60\n__________________\n* The impact of CIPs is summarized as follows:\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended\n(in millions) 30-Sep-24 30-Jun-24 30-Sep-23 30-Sep-24 30-Sep-23\nElimination of operating revenues upon consolidation $ (12.7) $ (12.3) $ (11.2) $ (47.4) $ (37.5)\nOther income, net 32.5 42.0 21.4 104.5 88.8\nLess: income attributable to noncontrolling interests 17.0 27.3 11.8 53.2 59.3\nNet income (loss) $ 2.8 $ 2.4 $ (1.6) $ 3.9 $ (8.0)\n11\nNotes\n1.

Management believes these non-GAAP measures\nare useful indicators of our financial performance and may be helpful to investors in evaluating our relative performance against\nindustry peers.\n“Adjusted operating income,” “adjusted operating margin,” “adjusted net income” and “adjusted diluted earnings per\nshare” are defined below, followed by reconciliations of operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to\nFranklin Resources, Inc. and diluted earnings per share on a U.S. GAAP basis to these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP\nmeasures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, any financial information prepared in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Additional reconciling\nitems may be added in the future to these non-GAAP measures if deemed appropriate.\nAdjusted Operating Income\nWe define adjusted operating income as operating income adjusted to exclude the following:\n• Elimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products.\n• Acquisition-related items:\n◦ Acquisition-related retention compensation.\n◦ Other acquisition-related expenses including professional fees, technology costs and fair value adjustments\nrelated to contingent consideration assets and liabilities.\n◦ Amortization of intangible assets.\n◦ Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, if any.\n• Special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to past acquisitions and certain\ninitiatives undertaken by the Company.\n• Impact on compensation and benefits expense from gains and losses on investments related to deferred compensation\nplans, which is offset in investment and other income (losses), net.\n• Impact on compensation and benefits expense related to minority interests in certain subsidiaries, which is offset in net\nincome (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests.\nAdjusted Operating Margin\nWe calculate adjusted operating margin as adjusted operating income divided by adjusted operating revenues. We define\nadjusted operating revenues as operating revenues adjusted to exclude the following:\n• Elimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products.\n• Acquisition-related performance-based investment management fees which are passed through as compensation and\nbenefits expense.\n• Sales and distribution fees and a portion of investment management fees allocated to cover sales, distribution and\nmarketing expenses paid to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our funds on our behalf.\n7\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\nWe define adjusted net income as net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. adjusted to exclude the following:\n• Activities of CIPs.\n• Acquisition-related items:\n◦ Acquisition-related retention compensation.\n◦ Other acquisition-related expenses including professional fees, technology costs and fair value adjustments\nrelated to contingent consideration assets and liabilities.\n◦ Amortization of intangible assets.\n◦ Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, if any.\n◦ Write off of noncontrolling interests related to the wind down of an acquired business.\n◦ Interest expense for amortization of Legg Mason debt premium from acquisition-date fair value adjustment.\n• Special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to past acquisitions and certain\ninitiatives undertaken by the Company.\n• Net gains or losses on investments related to deferred compensation plans which are not offset by compensation and\nbenefits expense.\n• Net compensation and benefits expense related to minority interests in certain subsidiaries not offset by net income\n(loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests.\n• Unrealized investment gains and losses.\n• Net income tax expense of the above adjustments based on the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments.\nWe define adjusted diluted earnings per share as diluted earnings per share adjusted to exclude the per share impacts of\nthe adjustments applied to net income in calculating adjusted net income.\nIn calculating our non-GAAP measures, we adjust for the impact of CIPs because it is not considered reflective of our\nunderlying results of operations. Acquisition-related items and special termination benefits are excluded to facilitate\ncomparability to other asset management firms. We adjust for compensation and benefits expense related to funded deferred\ncompensation plans because it is partially offset in other income (expense), net. We adjust for compensation and benefits\nexpense and net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests to reflect the economics of certain profits\ninterest arrangements. Sales and distribution fees and a portion of investment management fees generally cover sales,\ndistribution and marketing expenses and, therefore, are excluded from adjusted operating revenues.

For mutual funds, 48%, 60%, 43%, and 56% of our\nmutual fund AUM3 outperformed their peers on a 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year basis.\n• Long-term net outflows were $3.2 billion and included reinvested distributions of $3.6 billion.\n– $5.9 billion was funded out of the $25 billion allocation from Great-West Lifeco (“Great-West”),\nbringing the total funded to $20.2 billion.\n• We continue to see progress across asset classes, investment vehicles, and geographies.\n– Asset class: Multi-Asset and Alternatives generated positive net flows. Our three largest alternative\nmanagers, Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners, and Lexington Partners generated a combined\ntotal of $1.1 billion of net inflows, and Franklin Venture Partners generated net inflows of over $300\nmillion.\n– Investment vehicles: Long-term net flows continued to be positive in retail SMAs, Canvas®, and\nETFs:\n\nRetail SMA AUM was $140.0 billion and generated positive net flows of $0.5 billion, the fifth\nconsecutive quarter of net inflows.\nCanvas®, our Custom Indexing solution platform, generated net inflows of $0.8 billion. AUM\no\nincreased by 13% from the prior quarter to $8.2 billion and continues to have a robust pipeline.\n\nETF AUM was $26.9 billion and generated net inflows of approximately $3.3 billion, doubling the\nprior quarter’s net flows, and was the eleventh consecutive quarter of positive net flows.\n– Non-USAUM was $491.6 billion with positive long-term net flows in each non-US region, and\naggregate positive net flows for the fifth consecutive quarter.\n• Our institutional pipeline of won but unfunded mandates was $17.8 billion and does not include the\nremaining allocation from Great-West.\n1. Excludes approximately $13 billion of AUM in our China joint venture.\n2. The adjusted effective fee rate is annualized adjusted investment management fees, excluding performance fees, divided by average\nAUM for the period.\n3. Benchmark comparisons are based on each strategy’s composite returns (composites may include retail SMA and mutual fund\nassets managed as part of the same strategy) as compared to a market index that has been selected to be generally consistent with\nthe investment objectives of the account.Multi-asset strategies that lack benchmarks consistent with their investment objectives are\nexcluded.Composite AUM measured for the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods represent 54%, 54%, 53%, and 49%, respectively, of the\nfirm’s total AUM as of June 30, 2024.Mutual fund performance is sourced from Morningstar and measures the percentage of ranked\nfund AUM in the top two quartiles of their peer groups.Mutual Fund AUM measured for the 1-, 3-, 5-and 10-year periods represents\n38%, 37%, 37%, and 35%, respectively, of the firm’s total AUM as of June 30, 2024. 2\nSummary highlights, continued\n• Alternatives: Since becoming a part of Franklin Templeton, each alternative asset manager has\ncontinued to grow and diversify across strategies, product vehicles, and clients.\n– On May 8, Benefit Street Partners announced the final close of its BSP Special Situations Fund II\nwith $850 million of total capital commitments, exceeding its target.\n– Lexington Partners announced a dedicated strategy and a highly experienced team focused on\nleading single-asset Continuation Vehicle (“CV”) transactions in response to increased investor\ndemand. Lexington has invested approximately $6 billion in CV transactions to date and the new\nteam will be focused on increasing its participation in these transactions with a differentiated\napproach.\n– Clarion Partners has three open-end funds that perpetually fundraise in the US, and this year\nlaunched a fourth open-end fund in Europe focusing on the logistics sector. Clarion continues to be\nwell-positioned with over half of its AUM in the industrial and logistics sectors and less than 8% of\nAUM in the office sector.\n– Wealth Channel: Our global distribution footprint, investor education platform and dedicated\nalternatives specialist team combined with our breadth of investment capabilities differentiate us in\nthe wealth management channel. Franklin Venture Partners recently closed a growth equity strategy\nand raised a total of over $350 million. Additionally, we announced an expansion of our wealth\nchannel strategy with a dedicated team in the EMEA region. We remain focused on product\ndevelopment including new products in secondary private equity and real estate private debt.\n• Investment Solutions leverages our capabilities across public and private asset classes to pursue\nstrategic partnerships. This quarter, Investment Solutions generated positive net flows with AUM of over\n$79 billion1.\n• Private Wealth Management: Fiduciary Trust AUM has more than doubled in the past five years from\n$16.9 billion to $38.0 billion. In 2020, we acquired Athena Capital and Pennsylvania Trust and together\nthey have grown almost 40% since acquisition. One of our priorities is to further accelerate the growth\nof our private wealth management business through organic investments and acquisitions.\n• Financial Highlights:\n– The adjusted effective fee rate2 was 37.5 bps compared to 38.5 bps in the prior quarter, reflecting a\n0.9 bps reduction attributed to the Putnam acquisition. The prior year quarter effective fee rate of 39.4\nbps included approximately 0.9 bps related to catch-up fees recognized at the closing of fundraising\nrounds for Lexington X.\n– Adjusted operating income was $424.9 million, an increase of 1.3% from the prior quarter and a\ndecrease of 10.9% from the prior year quarter.\n– Adjusted operating margin was 25.7% compared to 25.2% in the prior quarter and 30.5% in the prior\nyear quarter. The double rent being recognized in fiscal year 2024 decreases our quarterly adjusted\noperating margin by approximately 75 bps and the realization of the full quarterly Putnam-related cost\nsavings target would have improved this quarter’s margin further by approximately 35 bps.\n– Total cash and investments were $6.8 billion3 as of June 30, 2024 compared to $6.9 billionas of\nMarch 31, 2024. On July 15, we repaid our $250 million senior notes due July 2024 from existing\ncash.\n• Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) Partnership: On April 30, we announced a partnership with Microsoft to\nbuild an advanced financial AI platform that will help Franklin Templeton embed AI in its processes and\nenable digital transformation at scale. Initial areas of focus will include improvement of the productivity\nof sales and marketing teams and to create more personalized support for our clients.\n• Investment Management Technology Platform: On July 23, we announced the selection of Aladdin\nto unify our investment management technology platform across our public market asset classes. This\nwill reduce complexity, reduce long-term capital expenses, and support business growth. Beginning in\nfiscal year 2025, the transition will be phased over multiple years and will be seamless to clients.\n1. Investment Solutions includes assets managed by other investment teams.\n2.

Adjusted net income increased by 0.1% and adjusted diluted EPS declined by\n4.8% from the prior year quarter.\n– The increase from the prior quarter is primarily due to the impact of compensation and benefits expense\nrelated to the start of the calendar year in the prior quarter, a lower effective tax rate, higher realized gains on\ninvestments, and additional Putnam cost savings, partially offset by higher advertising and travel and\nentertainment expense.\n– The decline from the prior year quarter includes lower performance fees and higher occupancy expense\nrelated to consolidation of NYC office space, partially offset by the addition of Putnam and realized gains on\ninvestments.\n1.

Forward-looking statements are based on our\ncurrent expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other possible future conditions. Because\nforward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances\nthat are difficult to predict. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance.\nFactors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to\npredict all of them.\nThese and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in our recent filings with the US\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, in Risk Factors and Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30,\n2023 and our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. If a circumstance occurs after the date of this presentation that\ncauses any of our forward-looking statements to be inaccurate, whether as a result of new information, future developments or\notherwise, we undertake no obligation to announce publicly the change to our expectations, or to make any revision to our\nforward-looking statements, to reflect any change in assumptions, beliefs or expectations, or any change in events, conditions\nor circumstances upon which any forward-looking statement is based, unless required by law.\nThe information in this commentary is provided solely in connection with this commentary, and is not directed toward\nexisting or potential investment advisory clients or fund shareholders.\nInvestor Relations Contact\ninvestorrelations@franklintempleton.com\n15"

statements of Franklin Resources, Inc. (“Franklin”) and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”)\nincluded herein have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”). Under these rules and regulations, some information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared under\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been shortened or omitted. Management believes that all adjustments necessary\nfor a fair statement of the financial position and the results of operations for the periods shown have been made. All adjustments are normal and recurring.\nManagement also believes that the accounting estimates are appropriate, and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in\nmaking estimates, actual amounts may differ from these estimates. These financial statements should be read together with the Company’s audited financial\nstatements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 (“fiscal year 2023”).\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company identified that it did not eliminate the investment income from certain consolidated limited\npartnerships for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, resulting in offsetting adjustments to investment and other income, net and net income attributable to\nnonredeemable noncontrolling interest. The Company is not entitled to the economic returns associated with the underlying investments held by these limited\npartnerships.\nThere is no impact on operating income, net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc., earnings per share, total assets, total liabilities, retained\nearnings or total shareholders’ equity.

The\namendment requires annual and interim disclosures of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker by\nreportable segment and clarifies that single reportable segment entities are required to apply all existing segment disclosures in the guidance. The amendment is\neffective for the Company on October 1, 2024, and is retrospectively applicable to all prior periods presented in its consolidated financial statements. The\nCompany is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued an amendment to the existing income taxes guidance. The amendment requires the disclosure of additional\ninformation with respect to the reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the statutory rate for federal, state, and foreign income taxes and requires greater detail\nabout significant reconciling items in the reconciliation. Additionally, the amendment requires disaggregated information pertaining to taxes paid, net of\nrefunds received, for federal, state, and foreign income taxes. The amendment allows for either a prospective or retrospective approach on adoption and is\neffective for the Company on October 1, 2025.

Shares representing 4.9% of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock at closing are subject to a five-year lock-up. The remaining shares were subject\nto a 180-day lock-up following the date of closing which has expired.\nThe acquisition of Putnam accelerates the Company’s growth in the retirement sector by increasing the amount of the Company’s defined contribution\nAUM. Additionally, the acquisition expands the Company’s insurance assets, further strengthening its presence in these key market segments to better serve\nclients.\n11\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the initial and revised estimated fair value amounts recognized for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and\nresulting goodwill as of the acquisition date.

Amortization expense related to the\ntrade name was $1.6 million and $2.9 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024. The estimated remaining amortization expense is $1.4 million\nfor the year and $5.8 million per year thereafter.\nTransaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition were $18.3 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024. These costs are primarily\ncomprised of professional fees, recorded in general, administrative and other expenses. The Company also incurred $132.0 million of acquisition-related\ncompensation and benefits expense during the period, primarily related to the acceleration of expense for historical Putnam compensation arrangements,\nretention bonuses and termination benefits.\nIn addition, the Company will pay up to $375.0 million between the third and seventh anniversaries of the closing date related to revenue growth targets\nfrom the strategic partnership with Great-West and its affiliates which will be recognized in operating income.\nOperating revenues of the acquired business from January 1, 2024 through June 30, 2024 were approximately $430 million. Net income is not available\nto be separately reported due to the ongoing integration of the combined businesses.\n12\nTable of Contents\nNote 4 – Earnings per Share\nThe components of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n(in millions, except per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. $ 174.0 $ 227.5 $ 549.5 $ 587.3\nLess: allocation of earnings to participating nonvested stock and stock unit awards 7.5 10.2 23.8 26.7\nNet Income Available to Common Stockholders $ 166.5 $ 217.3 $ 525.7 $ 560.6\nWeighted-average shares outstanding – basic 516.5 490.7 507.2 490.3\nDilutive effect of nonparticipating nonvested stock unit awards 0.7 0.7 0.8 0.7\nWeighted-Average Shares Outstanding – Diluted 517.2 491.4 508.0 491.0\nEarnings per Share\nBasic $ 0.32 $ 0.44 $ 1.04 $ 1.14\nDiluted 0.32 0.44 1.03 1.14\nThere were no nonparticipating nonvested stock unit awards excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would have\nbeen antidilutive for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and such awards were insignificant for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023.\n13\nTable of Contents\nNote 5 – Revenues\nOperating revenues by geographic area were as follows:\nEurope,\nAmericas Middle East\n(in millions) Excluding and Africa,\nUnited Excluding\nfor the three months ended June 30, 2024 United States Luxembourg Asia-Pacific States Luxembourg Total\nInvestment management fees $ 1,273.7 $ 216.2 $ 71.8 $ 59.1 $ 69.1 $ 1,689.9\nSales and distribution fees 256.8 86.7 4.7 10.1 — 358.3\nShareholder servicing fees 53.2 8.1 0.5 — — 61.8\nOther 12.7 — 0.2 — — 12.9\nTotal $ 1,596.4 $ 311.0 $ 77.2 $ 69.2 $ 69.1 $ 2,122.9\nEurope,\nAmericas Middle East\n(in millions) Excluding and Africa,\nUnited Excluding\nfor the nine months ended June 30, 2024 United States Luxembourg Asia-Pacific States Luxembourg Total\nInvestment management fees $ 3,819.8 $ 630.1 $ 210.2 $ 173.8 $ 222.1 $ 5,056.0\nSales and distribution fees 718.8 250.3 14.3 29.6 — 1,013.0\nShareholder servicing fees 136.8 23.6 1.8 0.1 — 162.3\nOther 31.1 0.7 3.4 — 0.3 35.5\nTotal $ 4,706.5 $ 904.7 $ 229.7 $ 203.5 $ 222.4 $ 6,266.8\nEurope,\nAmericas Middle East\n(in millions) Excluding and Africa,\nUnited Excluding\nfor the three months ended June 30, 2023 United States Luxembourg Asia-Pacific States Luxembourg Total\nInvestment management fees $ 1,232.3 $ 192.3 $ 64.3 $ 53.9 $ 70.6 $ 1,613.4\nSales and distribution fees 213.5 75.4 5.1 10.0 — 304.0\nShareholder servicing fees 30.3 8.0 0.5 — — 38.8\nOther 11.9 0.5 0.4 — — 12.8\nTotal $ 1,488.0 $ 276.2 $ 70.3 $ 63.9 $ 70.6 $ 1,969.0\nEurope,\nAmericas Middle East\n(in millions) Excluding and Africa,\nUnited Excluding\nfor the nine months ended June 30, 2023 United States Luxembourg Asia-Pacific States Luxembourg Total\nInvestment management fees $ 3,672.9 $ 570.7 $ 214.4 $ 162.0 $ 198.5 $ 4,818.5\nSales and distribution fees 634.1 217.4 15.1 30.7 — 897.3\nShareholder servicing fees 90.2 23.5 1.6 0.2 — 115.5\nOther 30.1 0.8 0.8 — 0.3 32.0\nTotal $ 4,427.3 $ 812.4 $ 231.9 $ 192.9 $ 198.8 $ 5,863.3\nOperating revenues are attributed to geographic areas based on the locations of the subsidiaries that provide the services, which may differ from the\nregions in which the related investment products are sold.\nRevenues earned from sponsored funds were 82% of the Company’s total operating revenues for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 83%\nfor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023.\n14\nTable of Contents\nNote 6 – Investments\nThe disclosures below include details of the Company’s investments, excluding those of consolidated investment products (“CIPs”).

(“Franklin”) and its subsidiaries\n(collectively, the “Company”). The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2023 filed with\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in subsequent filings on Form\n10-Q and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.\nOVERVIEW\nFranklin is a holding company with subsidiaries operating under our Franklin Templeton® and/or subsidiary brand names. We are a global investment\nmanagement organization that derives operating revenues and net income from providing investment management and related services to investors in\njurisdictions worldwide. We deliver our investment capabilities through a variety of investment products, which include our sponsored funds, as well as\ninstitutional and high-net-worth separate accounts, retail separately managed account programs, sub-advised products, and other investment vehicles. Related\nservices include fund administration, sales and distribution, and shareholder servicing. We may perform services directly or through third parties. We offer our\nservices and products under our various distinct brand names, including, but not limited to, Franklin®, Templeton®, Legg Mason®, Alcentra®, Benefit Street\nPartners®, Brandywine Global Investment Management®, Clarion Partners®, ClearBridge Investments®, Fiduciary Trust International™, Franklin Bissett®,\nFranklin Mutual Series®, K2®, Lexington Partners®, Martin Currie®, O’Shaughnessy® Asset Management, Putnam®, Royce® Investment Partners and Western\nAsset Management Company®. We offer a broad product mix of fixed income, equity, alternative, multi-asset and cash management asset classes and solutions\nthat meet a wide variety of specific investment goals and needs for individual and institutional investors. We also provide sub-advisory services to certain\ninvestment products sponsored by other companies which may be sold to investors under the brand names of those other companies or on a co-branded basis.\n24\nTable of Contents\nThe level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management (“AUM”). As noted in the “Risk Factors” section of\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2023, the amount and mix of our AUM are subject to significant fluctuations that can negatively impact our\nrevenues and income. The level of our revenues also depends on the fees charged for our services, which are based on contracts with our funds and customers,\nfund sales, and the number of shareholder transactions and accounts. These arrangements could change in the future.\nDuring our third fiscal quarter, global equity markets provided positive returns, reflecting strong corporate earnings in certain sectors due to ongoing\nenthusiasm around artificial intelligence and expectations of an economic soft landing, although inflation remained a concern and expectations of interest rate\nreductions eased. The S&P 500 Index and MSCI World Index increased 4.3% and 2.8% for the quarter and 28.8% and 25.0% for the fiscal year to date. The\nBloomberg Global Aggregate Index decreased 1.1% during the quarter, reflecting the shift in interest rate expectations, but increased 4.7% for the fiscal year to\ndate, reflecting strong positive returns, in our first fiscal quarter.\nOur total AUM at June 30, 2024 was $1,646.6 billion, 20% higher than at September 30, 2023 and 15% higher than at June 30, 2023. Monthly average\nAUM (“average AUM”) for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 increased 15% and 10% from the same periods in the prior fiscal year.\nOn January 1, 2024, we acquired Putnam Investments (“Putnam”), a global asset management firm, from Great-West Lifeco Inc. (“Great-West”).\nThe business and regulatory environments in which we operate globally remain complex, uncertain and subject to change. We are subject to various\nlaws, rules and regulations globally that impose restrictions, limitations, registration, reporting and disclosure requirements on our business, and add\ncomplexity to our global compliance operations.\nUncertainties regarding the global economy remain for the foreseeable future. As we continue to confront the challenges of the current economic and\nregulatory environments, we remain focused on the investment performance of our products and on providing high quality service to our clients. We\ncontinuously perform reviews of our business model. While we remain focused on expense management, we will also seek to attract, retain and develop\npersonnel and invest strategically in systems and technology that will provide a secure and stable environment. We will continue to seek to protect and further\nour brand recognition while developing and maintaining broker-dealer and client relationships.

Total mutual fund AUM measured\nfor the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods represents 38%, 37%, 37% and 35% of our total AUM as of June 30, 2024.\n2 Strategy composite performance measures the percent of composite AUM beating its benchmark. The benchmark comparisons are based on each account’s/composite’s\n(strategy composites may include retail separately managed accounts and mutual fund assets managed as part of the same strategy) return as compared to a market index\nthat has been selected to be generally consistent with the asset class of the account/composite. Total strategy composite AUM measured for the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year\nperiods represents 54%, 54%, 53% and 49% of our total AUM as of June 30, 2024.\n3 Total mutual fund AUM includes performance of our alternative and multi-asset funds, and total strategy composite AUM includes performance of our alternative\ncomposites. Alternative and multi-asset AUM represent 16% and 10% of our total AUM at June 30, 2024.\nMutual fund performance data includes U.S. and cross-border domiciled mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, excludes cash management and fund\nof funds, and assumes the reinvestment of dividends.\nPast performance is not indicative of future results. For strategy composite AUM included in institutional and retail separately managed accounts and\ninvestment funds managed in the same strategy as separate accounts, performance comparisons are based on gross-of-fee performance. For investment funds\nwhich are not managed in a separate account format, performance comparisons are based on net-of-fee performance. These performance comparisons do not\nreflect the actual performance of any specific separate account or investment fund; individual separate account and investment fund performance may differ.\nThe information in this presentation is provided solely for use in connection with this document, and is not directed toward existing or potential clients of\nFranklin.\n29\nTable of Contents\nOPERATING REVENUES\nThe table below presents the percentage change in each operating revenue category.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\nPercent Percent\n(in millions) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nInvestment management fees $ 1,689.9 $ 1,613.4 5 % $ 5,056.0 $ 4,818.5 5 %\nSales and distribution fees 358.3 304.0 18 % 1,013.0 897.3 13 %\nShareholder servicing fees 61.8 38.8 59 % 162.3 115.5 41 %\nOther 12.9 12.8 1 % 35.5 32.0 11 %\nTotal Operating Revenues $ 2,122.9 $ 1,969.0 8 % $ 6,266.8 $ 5,863.3 7 %\nInvestment Management Fees\nInvestment management fees increased $76.5 million and $237.5 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to a 15% and\n10% increase in average AUM, partially offset by a decrease in performance fees and lower catch-up fees recognized at the closing of fundraising rounds in a\nsecondary private equity fund, which ended in January 2024. The increases in average AUM primarily occurred in the equity, fixed income and multi-asset\nasset classes, driven by the acquisition of Putnam.\nOur effective investment management fee rate excluding performance fees (annualized investment management fees excluding performance fees divided\nby average AUM) was 40.2 and 41.4 basis points for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to 42.0 and 41.9 basis points for the same\nperiods in the prior fiscal year.

Special\ntermination benefits increased $4.5 million and $8.9 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to the acquisition of Putnam,\npartially offset by costs associated with workforce optimization initiatives in the prior year. Compensation expense related to minority interests decreased $1.8\nmillion for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and remained flat for the nine months ended June 30, 2024.\nWe expect to incur additional acquisition-related retention expenses of approximately $60 million during the remainder of the current fiscal year, and\nannual amounts beginning at approximately $190 million in the fiscal year ending September 30, 2025 and decreasing over the following two fiscal years by\napproximately $20 million and $80 million. At June 30, 2024, our global workforce increased to approximately 10,300 employees from approximately 9,300 at\nJune 30, 2023, primarily due to the acquisition of Putnam.\nSales, Distribution and Marketing\nSales, distribution and marketing expenses by cost driver are presented below.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\nPercent Percent\n(in millions) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nAsset-based expenses $ 405.9 $ 344.0 18 % $ 1,152.1 $ 1,018.9 13 %\nSales-based expenses 60.2 50.6 19 % 170.8 145.9 17 %\nAmortization of deferred sales commissions 15.0 12.2 23 % 43.3 37.2 16 %\nSales, Distribution and Marketing $ 481.1 $ 406.8 18 % $ 1,366.2 $ 1,202.0 14 %\nAsset-based expenses increased $61.9 million and $133.2 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to expenses incurred\nby Putnam subsequent to the acquisition, increases of 4% and 3% in the related average AUM, excluding the impact of Putnam, and higher marketing support\nfees. Distribution expenses are generally not directly correlated with distribution fee revenues due to certain fee structures that do not provide full recovery of\ndistribution costs.\nSales-based expenses increased $9.6 million and $24.9 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to increases of 6% and\n10% in commissionable sales and sales-based expenses incurred by Putnam subsequent to the acquisition.\nOccupancy\nOccupancy expenses increased $47.9 million and $76.6 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, driven by impairment of the right of\nuse asset related to vacated office space and new leased office space located at One Madison Avenue, primarily associated with an initiative to consolidate our\noffice space in New York City, and expenses incurred by Putnam subsequent to the acquisition.\nInformation Systems and Technology\nInformation systems and technology expenses increased $29.3 million and $66.0 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, primarily\ndue to expenses incurred by Putnam subsequent to the acquisition, higher outsourced data services and software costs.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets decreased $1.4 million and $0.2 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to the net\neffect of intangible assets which became fully amortized during the period, partially offset by the amortization of intangible assets recognized as part of the\nacquisition of Putnam and, for the nine month period, Alcentra.\n32\nTable of Contents\nGeneral, Administrative and Other\nGeneral, administrative and other operating expenses increased $43.6 million and $80.0 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024,\nprimarily due to the acquisition of Putnam, increases of $14.6 million and $31.3 million in professional fees, and increases of $5.7 million and $15.0 million in\ntravel and entertainment expenses due to higher activity levels. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $4.4 million and $14.1 million in fund-\nrelated expenses.\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSES)\nOther income (expenses) consisted of the following:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\nPercent Percent\n(in millions) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nInvestment and other income, net $ 74.5 $ 49.8 50 % $ 300.2 $ 200.3 50 %\nInterest expense (25.7) (34.9) (26 %) (72.2) (99.3) (27 %)\nInvestment and other income of consolidated\ninvestment products, net 37.6 1.7 NM 103.7 75.3 38 %\nExpenses of consolidated investment products (8.8) (0.8) NM (20.6) (15.7) 31 %\nOther Income, Net $ 77.6 $ 15.8 391 % $ 311.1 $ 160.6 94 %\nInvestment and other income, net increased $24.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to income from equity method\ninvestees and net foreign currency gains as compared to losses in the prior year quarter, partially offset by losses on investments, as compared to gains in the\nprior year quarter. Investment and other income, net increased $99.9 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to higher net income from\nequity method investees, lower net foreign currency exchange losses, and higher dividend and interest income, partially offset by lower gains on investments.\nInvestments held by the Company generated net losses of $24.3 million and net gains of $17.3 million in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024,\nas compared to net gains of $13.8 million and $62.3 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023. The net losses in the three months ended\nJune 30, 2024 were primarily from investments in nonconsolidated funds and separate accounts, and investments measured at cost adjusted for observable price\nchanges, while the net gains in the prior year period were primarily from investments in nonconsolidated funds and separate accounts, and assets invested for\ndeferred compensation plans. The net gains in the nine months ended June 30, 2024 were primarily from assets invested for deferred compensation plans,\npartially offset by losses on investments measured at cost adjusted for observable price changes, while the net gains in the prior year were primarily from\ninvestments in nonconsolidated funds and separate accounts, and assets invested for deferred compensation plans.\nEquity method investees generated income of $41.0 million and $122.3 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to losses\nof $9.1 million and income of $43.5 million in the prior year. The income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was largely related to various global\nalternative funds, while the losses in the prior year period were primarily due to a $7.5 million other-than-temporary impairment of an equity method\ninvestment. The income in the nine months ended June 30, 2024 was largely related to various global alternative and equity funds, while the income in the prior\nyear was largely related to various global alternative, equity and fixed income funds.\nNet foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net were gains of $1.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and losses of $7.5 million for the\nnine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to net losses of $6.6 million and $40.2 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023. The U.S.\ndollar strengthened against the Euro and weakened less against the British Pound in the three months ended June 30, 2024, which resulted in net foreign\nexchange gains on cash and cash equivalents denominated in U.S. dollars held by our European subsidiaries, as compared to losses in the prior year period. The\nU.S. dollar weakened less in the nine month period against the Euro and British Pound, which resulted in lower foreign exchange losses on cash and cash\nequivalents denominated in U.S. dollars held by our European subsidiaries.\nDividend and interest income decreased $2.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to lower average balances, partially offset\nby higher yields. Dividend and interest income increased $21.1 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to higher yields.\nInterest expense decreased $9.2 million and $27.1 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to interest expense\nrecognized in the prior year periods on our term loan that was terminated on July 25, 2023 and a decrease in interest recognized on tax reserves.\n33\nTable of Contents\nInvestments held by consolidated investment products (“CIPs”) generated investment gains and other income of $37.6 million and $103.7 million in the\nthree and nine months ended June 30, 2024, largely related to gains on holdings of various funds. Investments held by CIPs generated investment gains and\nother income of $1.7 million and $75.3 million in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, largely related to gains on holdings of various equity and\nfixed income funds, substantially offset by losses on holdings of various alternative funds.\nExpenses of CIPs increased $8.0 million and $4.9 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, due to activity of the funds.\nOur cash, cash equivalents and investments portfolio by asset class and accounting classification at June 30, 2024, excluding third-party assets of CIPs,\nwas as follows:\nAccounting Classification1\nCash and Investments Equity Direct\nCash at Method Investments\n(in millions) Equivalents Fair Value Investments Other Investments in CIPs Total\nCash and Cash Equivalents $ 3,378.5 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 3,378.5\nInvestments\nAlternative — 222.6 930.8 94.6 660.3 1,908.3\nEquity — 365.2 229.4 146.2 165.1 905.9\nFixed Income — 87.2 63.8 36.1 262.4 449.5\nMulti-Asset — 45.4 3.2 — 153.2 201.8\nTotal investments — 720.4 1,227.2 276.9 1,241.0 3,465.5\nTotal Cash and Cash Equivalents and\nInvestments2, 3 $ 3,378.5 $ 720.4 $ 1,227.2 $ 276.9 $ 1,241.0 $ 6,844.0\n______________\n1 See Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2023\nfor information on investment accounting classifications.\n2 Total cash and cash equivalents and investments includes $4,188.8 million maintained for operational activities, including investments in sponsored funds and other\nproducts, and $458.7 million necessary to comply with regulatory requirements.\n3 Total cash and cash equivalents and investments includes approximately $370 million attributable to employee-owned and other third-party investments made through\npartnerships which are offset in nonredeemable noncontrolling interests, $286.1 million of investments that are subject to long-term repurchase agreements and other net\nfinancing arrangements, and $440.3 million of cash and investments related to deferred compensation plans.\nTAXES ON INCOME\nOur effective income tax rate was 22.7% and 23.7% for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to 25.4% and 25.7% for the three\nand nine months ended June 30, 2023. The rate decrease for the three month period was primarily due to state tax provision to return adjustments in the prior\nyear period and activity of CIPs for which there is no related tax impact, partially offset by benefits in the prior year from the release of valuation allowances\nfor capital losses. The rate decrease for the nine month period was primarily due to state tax provision to return adjustments and tax benefits from stock-based\ncompensation.\nOur effective income tax rate reflects the relative contributions of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which have varying tax rates.\nChanges in our pre-tax income mix, tax rates or tax legislation in such jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and net income.\nSUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nAs supplemental information, we are providing performance measures for “adjusted operating income,” “adjusted operating margin,” “adjusted net\nincome” and “adjusted diluted earnings per share,” each of which is based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles (“non-GAAP\nmeasures”). Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful indicators of our financial performance and may be helpful to investors in evaluating\nour relative performance against industry peers.\n34\nTable of Contents\n“Adjusted operating income,” “adjusted operating margin,” “adjusted net income” and “adjusted diluted earnings per share” are defined below, followed\nby reconciliations of operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. and diluted earnings per share on a U.S. GAAP\nbasis to these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, any financial information prepared\nin accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Additional reconciling items may be added\nin the future to these non-GAAP measures if deemed appropriate.\nAdjusted Operating Income\nWe define adjusted operating income as operating income adjusted to exclude the following:\n• Elimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products.\n• Acquisition-related items:\n◦ Acquisition-related retention compensation.\n◦ Other acquisition-related expenses including professional fees, technology costs and fair value adjustments related to contingent\nconsideration assets and liabilities.\n◦ Amortization of intangible assets.\n◦ Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, if any.\n• Special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to past acquisitions and certain initiatives undertaken by the\nCompany.\n• Impact on compensation and benefits expense from gains and losses on investments related to deferred compensation plans, which is offset in\ninvestment and other income (losses), net.\n• Impact on compensation and benefits expense related to minority interests in certain subsidiaries, which is offset in net income (loss) attributable to\nredeemable noncontrolling interests.\nAdjusted Operating Margin\nWe calculate adjusted operating margin as adjusted operating income divided by adjusted operating revenues. We define adjusted operating revenues as\noperating revenues adjusted to exclude the following:\n• Elimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products.\n• Acquisition-related performance-based investment management fees which are passed through as compensation and benefits expense.\n• Sales and distribution fees and a portion of investment management fees allocated to cover sales, distribution and marketing expenses paid to the\nfinancial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our funds on our behalf.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\nWe define adjusted net income as net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. adjusted to exclude the following:\n• Activities of CIPs.\n35\nTable of Contents\n• Acquisition-related items:\n◦ Acquisition-related retention compensation.\n◦ Other acquisition-related expenses including professional fees, technology costs and fair value adjustments related to contingent\nconsideration assets and liabilities.\n◦ Amortization of intangible assets.\n◦ Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, if any.\n◦ Write off of noncontrolling interests related to the wind down of an acquired business.\n◦ Interest expense for amortization of Legg Mason debt premium from acquisition-date fair value adjustment.\n• Special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to past acquisitions and certain initiatives undertaken by the\nCompany.\n• Net gains or losses on investments related to deferred compensation plans which are not offset by compensation and benefits expense.\n• Net compensation and benefits expense related to minority interests in certain subsidiaries not offset by net income (loss) attributable to redeemable\nnoncontrolling interests.\n• Unrealized investment gains and losses.\n• Net income tax expense of the above adjustments based on the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments.\nWe define adjusted diluted earnings per share as diluted earnings per share adjusted to exclude the per share impacts of the adjustments applied to net\nincome in calculating adjusted net income.\nIn calculating our non-GAAP measures, we adjust for the impact of CIPs because it is not considered reflective of our underlying results of operations.\nAcquisition-related items and special termination benefits are excluded to facilitate comparability to other asset management firms. We adjust for compensation\nand benefits expense related to funded deferred compensation plans because it is partially offset in other income (expense), net. We adjust for compensation\nand benefits expense and net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests to reflect the economics of certain profits interest arrangements.\nSales and distribution fees and a portion of investment management fees generally cover sales, distribution and marketing expenses and, therefore, are excluded\nfrom adjusted operating revenues. In addition, when calculating adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share we exclude unrealized investment\ngains and losses included in investment and other income (losses) because the related investments are generally expected to be held long term.\n36\nTable of Contents\nThe calculations of adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating income $ 222.5 $ 314.9 $ 558.3 $ 764.0\nAdd (subtract):\nElimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products* 12.3 12.1 34.7 26.3\nAcquisition-related retention 43.7 21.3 217.3 108.1\nCompensation and benefits expense from gains on deferred compensation, net 1.8 10.1 34.8 26.3\nOther acquisition-related expenses 33.6 8.7 65.6 45.3\nAmortization of intangible assets 84.0 85.4 254.4 254.6\nSpecial termination benefits 16.7 12.2 63.8 54.9\nCompensation and benefits expense related to minority interests in certain\nsubsidiaries 10.3 12.1 32.6 32.6\nAdjusted operating income $ 424.9 $ 476.8 $ 1,261.5 $ 1,312.1\nTotal operating revenues $ 2,122.9 $ 1,969.0 $ 6,266.8 $ 5,863.3\nAdd (subtract):\nAcquisition-related pass through performance fees — (11.6) (87.0) (164.1)\nSales and distribution fees (358.3) (304.0) (1,013.2) (897.3)\nAllocation of investment management fees for sales, distribution and marketing\nexpenses (122.8) (102.8) (353.0) (304.7)\nElimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products* 12.3 12.1 34.7 26.3\nAdjusted operating revenues $ 1,654.1 $ 1,562.7 $ 4,848.3 $ 4,523.5\nOperating margin 10.5% 16.0% 8.9% 13.0%\nAdjusted operating margin 25.7% 30.5% 26.0% 29.0%\n37\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n(in millions, except per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. $ 174.0 $ 227.5 $ 549.5 $ 587.3\nAdd (subtract):\nNet (income) loss of consolidated investment products* (2.4) 1.5 (1.1) 6.4\nAcquisition-related retention 43.7 21.3 217.3 108.1\nOther acquisition-related expenses 34.9 12.7 75.0 61.5\nAmortization of intangible assets 84.0 85.4 254.4 254.6\nSpecial termination benefits 16.7 12.2 63.8 54.9\nNet gains on deferred compensation plan investments not offset by\ncompensation and benefits expense (1.1) (0.5) (11.0) (14.1)\nUnrealized investment (gains) losses 31.0 9.4 (27.6) (23.2)\nInterest expense for amortization of debt premium (6.4) (6.3) (19.2) (19.0)\nNet compensation and benefits expense related to minority interests in certain\nsubsidiaries not offset by net income (loss) attributable to redeemable\nnoncontrolling interests 2.8 (1.0) 1.2 (0.9)\nNet income tax expense of adjustments (50.8) (36.1) (140.8) (110.4)\nAdjusted net income $ 326.4 $ 326.1 $ 961.5 $ 905.2\nDiluted earnings per share $ 0.32 $ 0.44 $ 1.03 $ 1.14\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share 0.60 0.63 1.81 1.76\n__________________\n* The impact of CIPs is summarized as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nElimination of operating revenues upon consolidation $ (12.3) $ (12.1) $ (34.7) $ (26.3)\nOther income, net 42.0 7.3 72.0 67.4\nLess: income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 27.3 (3.3) 36.2 47.5\nNet income (loss) $ 2.4 $ (1.5) $ 1.1 $ (6.4)\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash flows were as follows:\nNine Months Ended\nJune 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023\nOperating cash flows $ 413.1 $ 324.7\nInvesting cash flows (1,222.7) (3,278.2)\nFinancing cash flows 506.4 2,492.6\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased during the nine months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to lower net purchases of investments by\nCIPs, partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and income taxes payable. Net cash used in investing activities decreased\nprimarily due to lower net purchases of investments by collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), lower cash paid for acquisitions in the current year as\ncompared to the prior year and net liquidations of investments as compared to purchases in the prior year. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased\nprimarily due to lower net proceeds on debt of CIPs, lower net subscriptions in CIPs by noncontrolling interests, and proceeds from repurchase agreements in\nthe prior year.\n38\nTable of Contents\nThe assets and liabilities of CIPs attributable to third-party investors do not impact our liquidity and capital resources. We have no right to the CIPs’\nassets, other than our direct equity investment in them and investment management and other fees earned from them. The debt holders of the CIPs have no\nrecourse to our assets beyond the level of our direct investment, therefore we bear no other risks associated with the CIPs’ liabilities. Accordingly, the assets\nand liabilities of CIPs, other than our direct investments in them, are excluded from the amounts and discussion below.\nOur liquid assets and debt consisted of the following:\nJune 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 3,336.1 $ 3,592.8\nReceivables 1,224.6 1,181.7\nInvestments 1,115.4 1,098.8\nTotal Liquid Assets $ 5,676.1 $ 5,873.3\nLiability\nDebt $ 3,035.0 $ 3,052.8\nLiquidity\nLiquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and certain investments. Cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2024 primarily consist of\nmoney market funds and deposits with financial institutions. Liquid investments consist of investments in sponsored and other funds, direct investments in\nredeemable CIPs, other equity and debt securities, and time deposits with maturities greater than three months.\nWe utilize a significant portion of our liquid assets to satisfy operational and regulatory requirements and fund capital contributions to sponsored and\nother products. Certain of our subsidiaries are required by our internal policy or regulation to maintain minimum levels of cash and/or capital, and may be\nrestricted in their ability to transfer cash to their parent companies. Should we require more capital than is available for use, we could elect to reduce the level\nof discretionary activities, such as share repurchases or investments in sponsored and other products, we could raise capital through debt or equity issuances, or\nutilize existing or new credit facilities. These alternatives could result in increased interest expense, decreased dividend or interest income, or other dilution to\nour earnings.\nCapital Resources\nWe believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets,\ncontinuing cash flows from operations, amounts available under the credit facility discussed below, the ability to issue debt or equity securities and borrowing\ncapacity under our uncommitted commercial paper private placement program.\nIn prior fiscal years, we issued senior unsecured unsubordinated notes for general corporate purposes and to redeem outstanding notes. At June 30, 2024,\nFranklin’s outstanding senior notes had an aggregate principal amount due of $1,600.0 million. The notes have fixed interest rates from 1.600% to 2.950% with\ninterest paid semi-annually and have an aggregate carrying value, inclusive of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, of $1,586.5 million. At June 30,\n2024, Legg Mason’s outstanding senior notes had an aggregate principal amount due of $1,250.0 million. The notes have fixed interest rates from 3.950% to\n5.625% with interest paid semi-annually and have an aggregate carrying value, inclusive of unamortized premium, of $1,448.5 million at June 30, 2024.\nFranklin unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees all of the outstanding notes issued by Legg Mason. On July 15, 2024, we repaid all of the outstanding\n$250.0 million 3.950% senior notes due July 2024 issued by Legg Mason at the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of $4.9 million.\nThe senior notes contain an optional redemption feature that allows us to redeem each series of notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at any time, at a\nmake-whole redemption price. The indentures governing the senior notes contain limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to pledge voting\nstock or profit participating equity interests in our subsidiaries to secure other debt without similarly securing the notes equally and ratably. In addition, the\nindentures include requirements that must be met if we consolidate or merge with, or sell all of our assets to, another entity.\n39\nTable of Contents\nWe maintain an $800.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility that contains a financial performance covenant requiring that the Company maintain a\nconsolidated net leverage ratio, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, of no greater than 3.25 to 1.00. This facility remains undrawn as of the time\nof this filing. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at June 30, 2024.\nAt June 30, 2024, we had $500.0 million of short-term commercial paper available for issuance under an uncommitted private placement program which\nhas been inactive since 2012 and is unrated.\nOur ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit rating, the condition of the global\neconomy, investors’ willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. If we are unable to access\ncapital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted.\nUses of Capital\nWe expect that our main uses of cash will be to invest in and grow our business including through acquisitions, pay stockholder dividends, invest in our\nproducts, pay income taxes and operating expenses of the business, enhance technology infrastructure and business processes, repurchase shares of our\ncommon stock, and repay and service debt. While we expect to continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution from stock-based compensation, and expect to\ncontinue to repurchase shares opportunistically from time to time, we will likely spend more of our post-dividend free cash flow investing in our business,\nincluding seed capital and acquiring resources to help grow our investment teams and operations.\nWe typically declare cash dividends on a quarterly basis, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. We declared regular dividends of $0.93 per share\nduring the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and $0.90 per share during the nine months ended June 30, 2023. We currently expect to continue paying\ncomparable regular dividends on a quarterly basis to holders of our common stock depending upon earnings and other relevant factors.\nWe maintain a stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. Our stock repurchase program\nis effected through open-market purchases and private transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and is not subject to an expiration date.\nThe size and timing of these purchases will depend on business conditions, price, market and other factors, including the terms of any 10b5-1 stock purchase\nplan that may be in effect at any given time. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, we repurchased 4.3 million and 7.1 million shares of our\ncommon stock at a cost of $101.5 million and $172.0 million. In December 2023, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional\n27.2 million shares of our common stock in either open market or private transactions, for a total of up to 40.0 million shares available for repurchase under the\nstock repurchase program. At June 30, 2024, 34.8 million shares remained available for repurchase under the authorization approved by our Board of Directors.\nOn January 1, 2024, we acquired Putnam from Great-West for 31.6 million shares of our common stock, cash consideration paid at close of $221.7\nmillion for investments and other purchase-related amounts, and deferred cash consideration of $100.0 million paid on July 1, 2024. The cash consideration\npaid at close and the deferred consideration payment was funded from existing cash. In addition, the Company will pay up to $375.0 million between the third\nand seventh anniversaries of the closing date related to revenue growth targets from the strategic partnership with Great-West and its affiliates which will be\nrecognized in operating income.\nOn November 1, 2023, we paid $60.8 million in deferred cash consideration related to our acquisition of Alcentra from existing cash. On April 1, 2024,\nwe paid $400.0 million in deferred cash consideration related to our acquisition of Lexington from existing cash. We expect to make an additional deferred cash\npayment related to our acquisition of Lexington of $100.0 million during the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 from existing cash and sources of liquidity.\nThe funds that we manage have their own resources available for purposes of providing liquidity to meet shareholder redemptions, including securities\nthat can be sold or provided to investors as in-kind redemptions, and lines of credit. Increased liquidity risks and redemptions have required, and may continue\nto require, increased cash in the form of loans or other lines of credit to help settle redemptions and for other related purposes. While we have no legal or\ncontractual obligation to do so, we have in certain instances voluntarily elected to provide the funds with direct or indirect financial support based on our\nbusiness objectives. We did not provide financial or other support to our sponsored funds during the nine months ended June 30, 2024.\n40\nTable of Contents\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America, which require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are affected\nby our application of accounting policies. Further, concerns about the global economic outlook have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect,\nour business, financial condition and results of operations including the estimates and assumptions made by management. Actual results could differ from the\nestimates. Described below are the updates to our critical accounting policies disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2023.\nConsolidation\nWe consolidate our subsidiaries and investment products in which we have a controlling financial interest. We have a controlling financial interest when\nwe own a majority of the voting interest in a voting interest entity or are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”). Our VIEs are primarily\ninvestment products and our variable interests consist of our equity ownership interests in and investment management fees earned from these products. As of\nJune 30, 2024, we were the primary beneficiary of 75 investment product VIEs.\nBusiness Combinations\nBusiness combinations are accounted for by recognizing the acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities at\ntheir acquisition-date estimated fair values. Any excess of the purchase consideration over the acquisition-date fair values of these identifiable assets and\nliabilities is recognized as goodwill. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or\ncircumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of the related reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment quarterly.\nSubsequent to the annual impairment tests performed as of August 1, 2023, we monitored both macroeconomic and entity-specific factors, including\nchanges in our AUM to determine whether circumstances have changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its\ncarrying value or indicate that the other indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. We also monitored fluctuations of our common stock per share\nprice to evaluate our market capitalization relative to the reporting unit as a whole. During the nine months ended June 30, 2024, there were no events or\ncircumstances which would indicate that goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or definite-lived intangible assets might be impaired.\nWhile we believe that the assumptions used to estimate fair value in our impairment tests are reasonable and appropriate, future changes in the\nassumptions could result in recognition of impairment.\nFair Value Measurements\nOur investments are primarily recorded at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value on a recurring basis. We use a three-level fair value hierarchy\nthat prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or\nunobservable.\nAs of June 30, 2024, Level 3 assets represented 4% of total assets measured at fair value, which primarily related to CIPs’ investments in equity and debt\nsecurities. There were insignificant transfers into and out of Level 3 during the nine months ended June 30, 2024.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2024, there were no material changes from the market risk disclosures in our Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\n41\nTable of Contents\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nThe Company’s management evaluated, with the participation of the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, the effectiveness of\nthe Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n“Exchange Act”)) as of June 30, 2024. Based on their evaluation, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers concluded that the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024 were designed and are functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the\ninformation required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive and principal\nfinancial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThere has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange\nAct) that occurred during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting.\n42\nTable of Contents\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nFor a description of our legal proceedings, please see the description set forth in the “Legal Proceedings” section in Note 11 – Commitments and\nContingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nThere were no material changes from the Risk Factors previously disclosed in our last Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2023. These Risk\nFactors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our business also could be impacted by other risk\nfactors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. Further, our disclosure of a risk should not be interpreted to imply that\nthe risk has not already developed or materialized.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\nThe following table provides information with respect to the shares of our common stock that we repurchased during the three months ended June 30,\n2024.\nTotal Number of Shares Maximum Number of\nAverage Price Purchased as Part of Shares that May Yet Be\nTotal Number of Paid per Publicly Announced Plans Purchased Under the Plans\nMonth Shares Purchased Share or Programs or Programs\nApril 2024 691,857 $ 24.79 691,857 38,415,301\nMay 2024 3,080,243 23.58 3,080,243 35,335,058\nJune 2024 502,162 23.35 502,162 34,832,896\nTotal 4,274,262 4,274,262\nUnder our stock repurchase program, which is not subject to an expiration date, we can repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the\nopen market and in private transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including without limitation applicable federal securities laws. In\norder to pay taxes due in connection with the vesting of employee and executive officer stock and stock unit awards, we may repurchase shares under our\nprogram using a net stock issuance method. In December 2023, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 27.2 million shares of\nour common stock in either open market or private transactions, for a total of up to 40.0 million shares available for repurchase under the stock repurchase\nprogram.\nItem 6.

Instructions for accessing the virtual meeting platform online are\nincluded in the Proxy Statement for this meeting.\nOver the past several years, we have made great strides in transforming our business—all in an effort to meet the needs of our\nshareholders and clients around the world. Today, we are a more diversified company offering extensive investment expertise\nacross asset classes, investment vehicles and geographies to benefit a broader range of clients through various market conditions\nand cycles.\nIn 2023, challenging global financial markets and geopolitical uncertainty weighed on investor sentiment. In our fourth fiscal\nquarter, heightened volatility led to declines across equity and fixed income markets. Consistent with the industry, our assets\nunder management and flows were impacted by these conditions. We believe markets like these reinforce the value of active\nmanagement with a focus on risk adjusted returns and a long-term investment horizon. We have been actively engaging with\nclients to understand their needs and help them navigate the current environment.\nOne of our strategic priorities has been to increase our scale in key segments of the industry reflecting long-term client demand. In\nthis pursuit to offer more choice to more clients, we were pleased to announce the pending acquisition of Putnam Investments with\n$142 billion of assets under management (AUM) as of November 30, 2023. Our clients will benefit from Putnam’s complementary\ninvestment capabilities which have strong long-term track records. In addition, we established a partnership with Power Corporation\nof Canada and Great-West Lifeco. The Power group of companies are leaders in global insurance, retirement, asset management\nand wealth management, and this transaction will enable us to further increase our investment in these important segments to\nbetter serve each and every client.\nWe also closed our acquisition of Alcentra, a leading European credit manager, doubling our alternative credit AUM to $75 billion.\nFirmwide alternative AUM increased to $255 billion from $225 the prior year, an increase of over 13%, making Franklin Templeton\none of the largest managers of alternative assets.\nWhile continuing to invest in long-term growth initiatives, we further strengthened the foundation of our business through\ndisciplined expense management and operational efficiencies. Our balance sheet gives us the financial flexibility to continue to\ngrow our business. This year, we returned $870 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, an increase of\napproximately 13% over the prior year.\nWe encourage you to review the accompanying Proxy Statement and to vote your shares before our annual meeting on\nFebruary 6, 2024.

Under New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) rules, the ratification of the selection of an independent registered\npublic accounting firm (Proposal No. 2), is considered a “routine” matter, and holders of record holding shares for a beneficial owner\ngenerally may vote on behalf of beneficial owners who have not furnished voting instructions, subject to the rules of the NYSE concerning\ntransmission of proxy materials to beneficial owners, and subject to any proxy voting policies and procedures of those brokerage firms.\nHolders of record holding shares for a beneficial owner may not vote on the other proposals contained in this Proxy Statement, which are\nconsidered “non-routine” proposals, unless they have received voting instructions from the beneficial owner, and to the extent that they\nhave not received voting instructions, brokers report those shares as “non-votes.”\nWHAT IS THE VOTING REQUIREMENT TO APPROVE EACH OF THE PROPOSALS?\n• The election of directors (Proposal No. 1) requires that a director receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to that director at\nthe Annual Meeting. This means that the number of shares of stock voted “FOR” a director must exceed the number of votes cast\n“AGAINST” that director. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast for this purpose and will have no effect on\nthe election of directors.\n• The affirmative vote of the holders of shares of common stock having a majority of the votes present at the Annual Meeting and\nentitled to vote on the matter is necessary to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (Proposal No. 2). Abstentions\nwill have the same effect as a vote against this proposal. Broker non-votes are not expected on this proposal because brokers have\ndiscretionary authority to vote uninstructed shares on this proposal.\n• The affirmative vote of the holders of shares of common stock having a majority of the votes present at the Annual Meeting and\nentitled to vote on the matter, is necessary to approve an amendment and restatement of the 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan\n(Proposal No. 3). Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against this proposal, and broker non-votes will not have any effect\non the vote for this proposal.\nShares that are voted online during the Annual Meeting or by proxy are treated as being present at the Annual Meeting for\npurposes of establishing a quorum, and will be included in determining the number of shares represented and voted at the Annual\nMeeting with respect to such matter. Broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a\nquorum for the transaction of business and otherwise will not have any effect on the proposals above. If the persons present or\nrepresented by proxy at the Annual Meeting constitute the holders of less than a majority of the outstanding shares of common\nstock as of the record date, the Annual Meeting may be adjourned to a subsequent date for the purpose of obtaining a quorum.\nWHO PAYS FOR THIS PROXY SOLICITATION?\nYour proxy is being solicited by the Board on behalf of the Company. The Company pays the cost of soliciting your proxy and\nreimburses brokerage costs and other fees for forwarding proxy materials to you.\n4 Franklin Resources\nProposal No. 1:\nElection of Directors\nRecommendation of the Board\nThe Board recommends a vote “FOR” the election to the Board of each of the nominees\nlisted below.

The\nCorporate Governance Committee and the Board believe that there are general requirements and skills that are required of each\ndirector and other skills and experience that should be represented on the Board as a whole but not necessarily by each director.\nThe Board believes that, consistent with these requirements, each nominee displays a high degree of personal and professional\nintegrity, an ability to exercise sound business judgment on a broad range of issues, sufficient experience and background to have\nan appreciation of the issues facing our Company, a willingness to devote the necessary time to board duties, a commitment to\nrepresenting the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and dedication to enhancing stockholder value. The Board\nseeks to assemble a group of directors that, as a whole, represents a mix of experiences and skills that allows appropriate\ndeliberation on all issues that the Board might be likely to consider. The Corporate Governance Committee’s Policy Regarding\nNominations and Qualifications of Directors described below outlines the qualities that the Corporate Governance Committee and\nthe Board seek in director nominees.\nIf elected, each nominee will serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until his or her successor is elected and\nqualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal.\nIn accordance with the Company’s Director Independence Standards, described more fully below, and the rules of the NYSE,\nthe Board has affirmatively determined that it is currently composed of a majority of independent directors, and that the following\ndirector nominees are independent and do not have a material relationship with the Company: Mariann Byerwalter; Alexander\nS. Friedman; John Y. Kim; Karen M. King; Anthony J. Noto; John W. Thiel; Seth H. Waugh; and Geoffrey Y. Yang. As part of\nits determination, the Board considered the transactions and relationships described below under “Compensation Committee\nInterlocks and Insider Participation” and “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions” and applied our Director Independence\nStandards as adopted by the Board, which includes categorical standards to assist the Board of Directors in making independence\ndeterminations and specifies the types of relationships that are deemed not material and, therefore, not considered each year.\nWith respect to Mr. Noto, the Board considered that in the ordinary course of the Company’s asset management business, certain\nCompany-sponsored funds and other funds and client accounts managed by Company subsidiaries have purchased, and may\nin the future purchase, notes or securities issued by securitization trusts formed, sponsored, administered, and/ or serviced by\none or more subsidiaries of SoFi Technologies, Inc. (collectively, “SoFi”), a company for which Mr. Noto serves as chief executive\nofficer and director. The investments were made on terms generally available to other investors and were determined not to impair\nMr. Noto’s independence.\nIn the ordinary course of their asset management businesses, the Company’s specialist investment managers (“SIMs”) or other\nsubsidiaries may from time to time invest client assets in companies in which certain of our directors may be a director or in which\ncertain affiliates of our directors may be significant stockholders or invest client assets in funds and other investment vehicles\nmanaged by entities affiliated with certain of our directors.\n2024 Proxy Statement 13\nCorporate Governance\nThe Company regularly monitors regulatory developments and reviews its policies and procedures in the area of corporate\ngovernance to respond to such developments.

The Board will\nmonitor and review as necessary, but at least once annually, commercial, charitable, family and other relationships that directors\nhave with the Company to determine whether the Company’s directors are independent. For purposes of the Company’s Director\nIndependence Standards, the “Company” refers to Franklin Resources, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nFor a director to be considered independent, the Board must determine affirmatively that the director does not have material\nrelationships with the Company either directly, or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship\nwith the Company. Such determination will be made and disclosed pursuant to applicable NYSE or other applicable rules. A\nmaterial relationship can include, but is not limited to, commercial, industrial, banking, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable and\nfamily relationships.\nPolicy Regarding Multiple Board Memberships. The Board has adopted a policy regarding memberships on boards of directors\nor equivalent governance bodies of unaffiliated publicly traded companies or other entities.

If a director does not serve as a principal\nexecutive officer, such as a chief executive officer or president, of a publicly traded company, it is the policy of the Board that such\ndirector shall not accept membership on a board of directors or equivalent governance body of another publicly traded company,\nwithout first informing and obtaining the consent of the Company’s Corporate Governance Committee, if such new membership\nwould result in the member serving contemporaneously on four or more boards of directors or equivalent governance bodies of\npublicly traded companies, excluding the Company’s Board.\n14 Franklin Resources\nCorporate Governance\nProhibition Against Hedging Transactions.

This prohibition also applies to effecting economically equivalent transactions, including, but not limited to, purchasing\nand selling call or put options and swap transactions or other derivatives that would result in a net short exposure to the Company\nor any closed-end fund sponsored or advised by the Company.\nProhibition Against Pledging. Pursuant to the Company’s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, unless otherwise previously\napproved by the Compensation Committee, directors and executive officers are prohibited from directly or indirectly pledging,\nhypothecating or otherwise encumbering securities issued by the Company as collateral for indebtedness. This prohibition\nincludes, but is not limited to, holding such securities in a margin account that could cause securities issued by the Company to\nbe subject to a margin call or serve as collateral for a margin loan. Securities issued by the Company that were not received as\ncompensation are not subject to the prohibition as long as the holder of such securities remains in compliance with applicable\nStock Ownership Guidelines. If any person has subject securities issued by the Company pledged as collateral or held in a margin\naccount when such person becomes a director or executive officer of the Company, the pledge must be released within one year\nfrom the date the person became a director or executive officer.\nStock Ownership Guidelines. Our Board of Directors has adopted stock ownership guidelines for directors and executive officers.\nDirectors and executive officers are permitted a five-year grace period to reach the applicable ownership level established under\nthe guidelines. Our Directors are expected to own shares of common stock of the Company with a value of at least 5x the value of\ntheir annual cash retainer within five years of their appointment to the Board. Similarly, senior officers of the Company are expected\nto own shares of common stock of the Company with a value equal to a specific multiple of such senior officer’s base salary, as\nindicated in the table below, by five years from when he or she first assumed the position for which stock ownership is expected:\nTitle Market Value of Shares Owned as a Multiple of Base Salary\nDirector 5X\nExecutive Chairman 5X\nVice Chairman 5X\nChief Executive Officer 5X\nPresident 4X\nExecutive Vice President 4X\nSenior Vice President 3X\nChief Accounting Officer 3X\nBoth direct and certain indirect forms of ownership are recognized in achieving these guidelines, including shares owned outright,\nrestricted stock, restricted stock units, 401(k) funds invested in shares of the Company’s common stock, and funds deemed\ninvested in shares of the Company’s common stock under the 2006 Directors Deferred Compensation Plan. Shares of the\nCompany’s common stock held by immediate family members (which includes a director’s or senior officer’s spouse, children\nand parents) or entities controlled by a director or senior officer may be considered holdings of the director or senior officer for\npurposes of the guidelines only and not as an admission of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. As of December 21, 2023,\nall directors and officers were in compliance with these guidelines.\nExecutive Compensation Clawback Policy\nThe Company’s general employee compensation clawback practices provide for recovery of compensation amounts (i) in\nconnection with fraud or a breach of securities law by an individual or (ii) when (A) the Company issues a restatement of financial\nresults to correct a material error; (B) the Compensation Committee determines, in good faith, the individual’s fraud or willful\nmisconduct was a significant contributing factor to the need to issue such restatement; and (C) some or all of an award awarded\nto that individual prior to such restatement and/or shares of the Company’s common stock or mutual fund shares that were\nawarded and/ or other property earned by the individual prior to such restatement would not have been awarded and/or earned, as\napplicable, based upon the restated financial results.\nIn addition, effective for compensation awarded for periods beginning on or after October 1, 2023, the Board adopted an Executive\nCompensation Clawback Policy (“Clawback Policy”). The Clawback Policy provides for the mandatory recovery of erroneously\nawarded incentive-based compensation following accounting restatements from persons who served as an executive officer of the\nCompany at any time during the performance period for such incentive-based compensation and who received such compensation\nduring the three fiscal years preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement. The\ncompensation to be recovered is the amount in excess of what would have been paid based on the restated results. Recovery will\nbe required on a “no fault” basis, without regard to whether any misconduct occurred and without regard to whether an executive\nofficer was responsible for the erroneous financial statements.\n2024 Proxy Statement 15\nInformation About the Board\nand its Committees\nBoard Meetings and Annual Meeting of Stockholders\nDuring fiscal year 2023, the Board held six meetings (not including committee meetings).

Johnson has served as Chairman of the Board since June 2013 and Executive Chairman of the Company since\nFebruary 2020. Our CEO, Ms. Jennifer M. Johnson, serves as a director, but does not have a chair or lead director role on the\nBoard. Ms. Marianne Byerwalter was selected by the independent directors as the Lead Director. The Board believes that its\nleadership structure strengthens the Board’s ability to focus on key risk, business and strategic issues and helps the Company\noperate in the long-term interests of stockholders.\nThe duties of the Lead Director are set forth in the Lead Director Charter available on the Company’s website and include:\n• presiding at the executive sessions of the independent directors and of the non-employee directors of the Board;\n• presiding at meetings of the Board in the absence of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Board or upon the request\nof the Chairman;\n• calling meetings of the independent directors and non-employee directors of the Board, as appropriate;\n• serving as a liaison to facilitate communications between other members of the Board and the Chairman, the Vice\nChairman, the CEO and the President, without inhibiting direct communications between and among such persons;\n• advising and consulting with the Chairman on, and approving, Board and committee meeting schedules, including\nthe need for special meetings as appropriate, and Board and committee meeting agenda items, to help ensure that\nappropriate items are brought forward for Board and committee consideration and appropriate time is apportioned for\ndiscussion;\n• advising and consulting with the Chairman on the general scope and type of information to be provided in advance\nand/or to be presented at Board meetings;\n• in coordination with the Chairman, serving as a liaison to stockholders who request direct communications and\nconsultation with the Board or otherwise delegating such task to an appropriate member of the Board based on the\ncircumstances;\n• consulting with outside counsel and other advisors as he or she deems appropriate in fulfilling the Lead Director role;\n• collaborating with the Compensation Committee on the annual performance evaluation of the CEO; and\n• collaborating with the Corporate Governance Committee on matters related to Board effectiveness and independence\nincluding the performance and structure of the Board and its committees, and the performance of individual directors.\nThe Board does not have a fixed policy regarding the separation of the offices of the Chairman and CEO and the Corporate\nGovernance Committee reviews the Board’s leadership structure annually with the Board. The Board believes that the current\nstructure is appropriate because having different senior executives for each of the Company and the Board provides clear\nleadership for the strategic vision, management and operations of the Company. This structure is supported by a strong\nindependent Board led by our Lead Director, which helps to maintain effective oversight of management and the Company’s\nstrategy, risk management and operations. The Board also believes this structure allows for robust and frequent communication\nbetween the Board’s independent directors and management, enabling the Board to gain a deeper understanding of the Company\nand work with management to enhance shareholder value.\nBoard and Committee Evaluation Process\nThe Board believes that conducting an annual evaluation process is a critical component of good corporate governance and\nimproves the performance of the Board as a whole and its committees. The independent Chair of the Corporate Governance\nCommittee leads the annual performance evaluation of the Board. The Chair of each of the committees leads the review of their\nrespective committees and shares this information with the Lead Director who discusses these results with the Board as part of\nthe Board’s self-evaluation process. Each Committee holds a candid evaluation of its performance, using established guidelines\nas a resource, and the Board holds a similar evaluation of its performance.

Fees are awarded in cash, the\npayment of which may be deferred pursuant to the 2006 Directors Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Director Deferred Plan”) described below\nunder “Deferred Director Fees.” Pursuant to the Director Deferred Plan, directors may elect to defer payment of their directors’ fees and stock\nawards into hypothetical investments in common stock of the Company and/or in Company-sponsored mutual funds. If a director receives fees\nin cash or elects to defer fees (including the annual stock grant) into hypothetical units of Company-sponsored mutual funds, such amounts are\nincluded in this column. Any such director fees deferred into hypothetical shares of the Company’s common stock are included in the “Stock\nAwards” column.

Our Compensation Philosophy\nOur Compensation Committee believes that executive compensation should be strongly linked to our performance – both for\nour investors and for our clients who entrust us to manage their investments and in turn drive our success. We recognize the\nimportance of our compensation decisions to these constituencies and believe the design and implementation of our executive\ncompensation program reflects this stewardship. Accordingly, we seek to maintain an executive compensation program that is\ndesigned to attract and retain skilled executives, incentivize executives to deliver returns for our clients and thus maximize our\nfinancial performance and the creation of stockholder value, and align executives’ interests with those of our stockholders.\nWe aim to achieve these objectives by granting the significant majority of executive compensation in the form of “at-risk”\ncompensation, where the value of compensation is dependent on our performance. Our at-risk compensation is typically granted\nin the form of (i) annual incentive cash bonus awards and restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards granted under our Amended\nand Restated Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the “AIP”) that are earned based on certain annual performance objectives\nand (ii) performance-based RSU awards that are earned and vest based on achievement of annual and three-year financial\nperformance objectives. The significant equity portion of our at-risk compensation serves to align the interests of our NEOs with\nthose of our stockholders. In addition, the Compensation Committee recognizes that NEOs implement and effect long-term\ninitiatives for the Company that often take more than one fiscal year to accomplish and, accordingly, should receive a significant\npercentage of their compensation in the form of equity that does not immediately vest.\n28 Franklin Resources\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nIn making executive compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee exercises structured judgment to evaluate each\nNEO’s performance in light of financial and non-financial performance objectives that it believes are important to the growth and\nwelfare of the Company and, for long-term value for our stockholders. These performance objectives emphasize the achievement\nof Company-wide investment and financial performance objectives as well as strategic initiatives which typically are focused on\nbusiness unit and individual performance objectives that are specific to each NEO. Below is a summary of the objectives that the\nCompensation Committee assesses when making compensation decisions.\nPerformance Objectives Primary Considerations\nInvestment Performance 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year investment management performance, assets under management,\nand investment management revenue\nFinancial Results Adjusted operating margin, adjusted operating revenue, adjusted operating income,\npre-bonus operating income, three-year stockholder return, long-term net flows and adjusted\nearnings per share\nStrategic Initiatives Optimize global growth prospects, continue building enduring relationships with clients and\nbusiness partners, augment our alternative strategies and sustainable investing offerings,\nstrengthen employee engagement and leadership development, continued expense\nmanagement, successful integration of acquired businesses and alignment of internal\nbusiness functions\nThe weighting of performance metrics used by the Compensation Committee in determining our CEO’s fiscal year 2023 annual\nincentive award is as depicted below:\n30% 25%\nInvestment Distribution\nPerformance Performance\n25% 20%\nStrategy and Financial\nLeadership Metrics\nStockholder Engagement on Compensation\nWe engage with stockholders to provide an opportunity for them to express their views so that we may consider those views as we\nevaluate our governance practices and executive compensation program. We value our stockholders’ interests and feedback and\nwe are committed to maintaining an active dialogue to ensure that we understand the priorities and concerns of our stockholders\nwith respect to best practices for governance matters and executive compensation.\nOur focus on at-risk compensation has been strongly supported by our stockholders in the past. Consistent with the vote of our\nstockholders at our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, we conduct an advisory vote on the compensation of our NEOs (a “say-\non-pay proposal”) every three years. At our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, approximately 94% of the votes cast were in\nfavor of our executive compensation policies, practices and determinations. The Compensation Committee believes that this vote\nreflects strong support for our executive compensation program and philosophy. The Compensation Committee intends to continue\nto implement executive compensation programs and decisions that it believes are the best interests of our stockholders.\nOur Board encourages an open and constructive dialogue with shareholders on compensation and other corporate governance\nmatters to ensure alignment on policies and practices. In fiscal year 2023, we contacted our top 15 institutional shareholders,\nrepresenting approximately 30% of our outstanding shares, and approximately 49% of our outstanding shares held by persons\nor entities other than Messrs. Charles B. Johnson and Rupert H. Johnson, and held meetings with the four of these shareholders\nwho requested to meet with us. Our outreach to stockholders focused on corporate governance, board composition, executive\ncompensation, and ESG matters, including diversity & inclusion initiatives, and the content of our most recently published CSR\nreport. No concerns regarding executive compensation were raised from our engagements.\n2024 Proxy Statement 29\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\n2. Compensation Overview\nOur executive compensation program consists primarily of three elements: (1) base salary, (2) short-term incentive compensation\nbased on company-wide investment and financial performance objectives and NEO-specific strategic initiatives, and which is paid\nin a combination of cash and time-based incentive RSU awards, and (3) RSU awards subject to long-term performance-based\nvesting conditions.\nCompensation Element Designed To Reward Relationship To The Objectives\nBase Salary • Experience, knowledge of the • Provides a minimum, fixed level of\nindustry, duties and scope of cash compensation to attract and\nresponsibility retain talented executives to the\nCompany who can continue to improve\nthe Company’s overall performance\nAnnual Incentive Compensation • Success in achieving objectives • Motivates executives to achieve\n• Incentive cash awards specific financial and non-financial\n• Incentive RSU awards Company-wide, business unit and\nindividual performance objectives\n• Provides competitive compensation to\nattract and retain talented executives\n• Links annual incentive to value\ncreation for stockholders with a mix of\ncash and equity\n• Induces retention of key executives\nwith the Company with incentive RSU\nawards awarded based on annual\nperformance and vesting subject\nto continued service in order to\nencourage retention\nLong-term Incentive Compensation • Continued excellence and • Motivates executives to achieve\n• Performance RSU awards achievement of objectives over time specific Company-wide financial\n• Success in long-term growth and objectives over a three-year\ndevelopment performance period\n• Aligns the executives’ interests with\nlong-term stockholder interests with\nperformance RSU awards earned\nbased on achievement of financial\nperformance objectives\n• Provides competitive compensation to\nattract and retain talented executives\n• Induces retention of key executives\nwith the Company with performance\nRSU awards subject to performance\nbased vesting conditions over a\nthree-year period\n30 Franklin Resources\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nBase Salary\nThe Compensation Committee believes that base salaries for our NEOs should be limited to a reasonable base compensation for\nthe day-to-day performance of the NEOs’ job responsibilities and that the majority of their pay should be in at-risk compensation\ntied to performance. Base salaries are evaluated by the Compensation Committee annually for all NEOs and in general do not\nchange significantly year-to-year unless the NEO is promoted or the Compensation Committee determines that an adjustment is\nnecessary due to compensation or economic trends in the industry.\nAnnual Incentive Compensation\nAnnual incentive compensation in the form of incentive cash awards and incentive RSU awards granted to our NEOs are funded\nfrom an award pool (the “Award Pool”) that is established annually under the AIP. The incentive RSU awards are granted under the\n2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the “USIP”), based on prior year performance and vest in equal installments\nover three years subject to continued service with the Company. The incentive RSU awards are granted shortly following the end\nof the fiscal year to which the award relates, with the number of RSU awards determined by dividing the dollar value of the equity\nportion of the award by the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. NEOs receive dividends on unvested incentive\nRSU awards as and when dividends are paid to stockholders.\nTargets under the AIP are based on a combination of Company-wide, business unit and individualized performance objectives.\nThe Compensation Committee recognizes that the Company-wide measures may not fully reflect the individual performance and\ncontributions made by our separate business units and their respective leaders, and therefore has incorporated objectives relating\nto achievement of strategic initiatives into the AIP. These objectives are specifically tailored to each business unit and include, but\nare not limited to, a mix of investment performance, sales, financial, customer service, technology and human resources objectives.\nThe size of the Award Pool is approved by the Compensation Committee and is fixed at a percentage of our pre-bonus net\noperating income (for fiscal year 2023 not to exceed 23%), exclusive of passive income and calculated before non-operating\ninterest, taxes, extraordinary items, and any special items such as special compensation payouts on account of an acquisition\n(“PBOI”). The specific size of the Award Pool is determined at the start of the fiscal year but may be revised by the Compensation\nCommittee at any point during or after the fiscal year.\nThe annual incentive compensation paid and granted in November 2023, the specific strategic objectives considered by the\nCompensation Committee for each NEO in fiscal year 2023, and the Compensation Committee’s determination of the Award Pool\nfor fiscal year 2023 are summarized in “4. Fiscal Year 2023 Executive Compensation Decisions” below.\nLong-Term Incentive Compensation\nOur long-term incentive compensation consists of annual grants of performance RSU awards (“Performance Awards”) under the\nUSIP that vest over a three-year period based on the achievement of specified financial performance goals as described below.\nOne-half of the Performance Awards granted in fiscal year 2023 will be earned and vested based on our Adjusted Operating Margin\n(as defined below) and one-half of the Performance Awards will be based on our relative total shareholder return over a three-year\nperiod (as described below). The Performance Award component that is based on Adjusted Operating Margin is earned based on\nour fiscal year performance, with performance vesting occurring in equal increments in each year over a three-year period, while\nthe Performance Award component that is based on relative total shareholder return is earned and vests based on a three-year\nperformance period.\nThe amount of these Performance Awards granted to each NEO for fiscal year 2023 was determined by the Compensation\nCommittee based on a general target of providing 20-25% of the NEO’s total incentive compensation in the form of Performance\nAwards, as adjusted to reflect the specific performance of the NEO during the fiscal year.\nIn the event a performance measure is not achieved at or above a specified threshold level, the portion of an award tied to such\nperformance measure is forfeited. The Compensation Committee selects performance-based vesting targets that it believes are\nsufficient to motivate NEOs by being challenging, but achievable. The specific performance-based vesting conditions applicable to\nawards granted in November 2023 and those completing their vesting in November 2023 are summarized in “4. Fiscal Year 2023\nExecutive Compensation Decisions — Types of Compensation — Long-term Incentive Compensation” below.\n2024 Proxy Statement 31\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nCompensation Mix for Our NEOs\nThe following chart shows the breakdown of the types of compensation paid or granted to our NEOs for fiscal year 2023, which\nillustrates the Compensation Committee’s emphasis on at-risk, equity-based and performance-based components of our executive\ncompensation program.\nCOMPENSATION MIX\nCEO\n5% 20%\nBase 24% 51% Performance-Based\nSalary Annual Cash Incentive Annual Incentive RSUs Long-Term RSUs\n95% Total Performance-Based\nAverage Senior Executive Pay\n8% 21%\nBase 48% 23% Performance-Based\nSalary Annual Cash Incentive Annual Incentive RSUs Long-Term RSUs\n92% Total Performance-Based\n3.

In addition, we continued to invest in opportunities\nthat will support our strategy, including augmentation of our alternative investment strategies and ESG offerings.\nThe Compensation Committee evaluated fiscal year 2023 performance in light of its philosophy that a significant portion of\nexecutive compensation should be at-risk and tied to the Company’s performance.\nThe chart below compares the results of our key financial performance measures for the current fiscal year against last fiscal year:\nKey Financial Performance Measures (as of and for fiscal years ended Percentage Change\nSeptember 30) 2023 2022 2023 vs. 2022\nAssets Under Management ($ billions) $1,374.2 $1,297.4 5.9%\nAdjusted Operating Revenue ($ millions)(1) $6,104.1 $6,473.7 (5.7%)\nAdjusted Operating Income ($ millions)(1) $1,823.8 $2,323.5 (21.5%)\nAdjusted Net Income ($ millions)(1) $1,332.2 $1,855.6 (28.2%)\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share(1) $ 2.60 $ 3.63 (28.4%)\nAdjusted Operating Margin(1) 29.9% 35.9%\nThree-Year Stockholder Return 11.2% (5.2)%\n(1) See discussion of supplemental non-GAAP financial measures in Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended September 30, 2023.\n32 Franklin Resources\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nFiscal Year 2023 Investment Management Performance\nWe are committed to delivering strong investment performance for our clients, offering a broad range of strategies and drawing\non our diverse experiences and perspectives gained through our long history in the investment management business. We know\nthat success demands smart and effective business innovation, solutions and technologies, and we remain focused on investment\nexcellence, innovating to meet evolving client goals, and building strong partnerships by delivering superior client service. We continue\nto focus on the long-term investment performance of our investment products and on providing high quality service to our clients.\nA key driver of our overall success is the long-term investment performance of our investment products. A measure of the performance\nof these products is the percentage of AUM exceeding peer group medians and benchmarks. We compare the relative performance of\nour mutual funds against peers, and of our strategy composites against benchmarks.\nThe performance of our mutual fund products against peer group medians and of our strategy composites against benchmarks is\npresented in the table below.

The benchmark comparisons are based on\neach account’s/composite’s (strategy composites may include retail separately managed accounts and mutual fund assets managed as part of\nthe same strategy) return as compared to a market index that has been selected to be generally consistent with the asset class of the account/\ncomposite.

Our Compensation Decision-Making Process\nCompensation decisions are made by our Compensation Committee, considering input from its independent compensation\nconsultant Exequity LLP (“Exequity”), our human resources group, our CEO (with respect to the compensation of other NEOs), and\nour stockholders.\nRole of CEO and Human Resources Group\nThe Compensation Committee works with members of management, including our CEO, to seek input regarding our executive\ncompensation. Twice a year the CEO evaluates each other NEO and his or her respective business unit’s progress in achieving\nits goals. In addition, the CEO works with our human resources group to determine the appropriate award amount to recommend\nfor each such NEO based upon such performance. As part of this process, the human resources group conducts and reviews\nan analysis of competitive compensation by peer companies (those listed below under “Compensation Peer Group”), compares\nprevious year-over-year performance and compensation paid to the NEO, which is compiled into tally sheets reflecting amounts\npaid in prior years (including a sensitivity analysis with respect to prior equity awards) and analysis of the upcoming realizable\ncompensation to be paid, considers internal pay equity issues and reviews third-party executive compensation surveys related\ngenerally to the financial services industry and specifically to the asset management industry. Upon completion of this review\nprocess, management presents performance evaluations to the Compensation Committee and the CEO, and the CEO makes a\nrecommendation to the Compensation Committee regarding the appropriate level of incentive compensation to be award to each\nother NEO.\nThe Company’s management has engaged McLagan Data & Analytics, an Aon plc company (“McLagan”), a financial services\nindustry compensation consultant, to provide information on peer company compensation and pay trends. The Compensation\nCommittee uses McLagan’s proprietary surveys and market data to analyze the competitiveness of the Company’s executive\ncompensation program and to understand compensation forecasts and trends in the industry.\nRole of Exequity\nThe Compensation Committee is empowered with the sole authority to retain and terminate any compensation consulting firm\ndirectly assisting it in the evaluation of director or executive compensation. The Compensation Committee also has the sole\nauthority to approve fees and other retention terms for its consultant.\nThe Compensation Committee recognizes that it is essential to receive objective advice from compensation consultants and has\nselected Exequity, and expects to continue to select any compensation consultants, on the basis of all factors relevant to the\nconsultant’s independence including:\n• the provision of other services to the Company by the consultant’s firm;\n• the aggregate fees paid by the Company and fees as a percentage of the total revenue of the consultant’s firm;\n• the policies and procedures of the consultant’s firm designed to prevent conflicts of interest;\n• any business or personal relationships between the consultant, the consultant’s firm and any Compensation Committee member\nor executive officer of the Company; and\n• whether the consultant holds shares of the Company’s stock.\nExequity’s role is managed by the Compensation Committee. Throughout the year, the Compensation Committee may ask\nExequity to review and comment objectively on management proposals and presentations to the Compensation Committee\ncovering all elements of compensation paid to the NEOs. Exequity also counsels on general market trends and technical\ndevelopments and the amount and structure of pay for the non-employee directors of the Board. Under the terms of its\nengagement, Exequity is required to obtain the prior written approval of the Compensation Committee before Exequity or any of\nits affiliates performs any non-executive compensation related services for the Company or its subsidiaries. Exequity is required to\nreport to the Compensation Committee any such services and fees annually and upon the reasonable request of the Compensation\nCommittee. There were no such services during fiscal year 2023.\nDuring fiscal year 2023, the Company paid Exequity $8,000.00 in consulting fees directly related to services performed for the\nCompensation Committee.\n2024 Proxy Statement 41\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nCompensation Timeline\nThe following illustrates the indicative timeline by which the Compensation Committee determines pay.\nFIRST QUARTER SECOND QUARTER\n• Discuss established Company-wide priorities and key • Review individual strategic initiatives and key\nperformance targets performance targets\n• Evaluate individual annual bonus award • Review quarterly financial performance,\nobjectives linked to the growth and focusing on year-over-year results with regard\ndevelopment of respective business units ST R to Company-wide performance measures\n• Analyze industry trends in\nFI QR\nUA\nRTE\nQ U\nAS E\nC O • Assess progress toward corporate\ncompensation RN priorities and analyze potential impact to\nT ED\nDecision R executive compensation\nMaking\nProcess\nR\nFOURTH QUARTER H TET R U Q THIRD QUARTER\nRA A\n• Review of fiscal year performance,\nU\nO\nFU\nQ R\nETR\nD\nRIHT\n• Complete review of prior-year peer\nincluding achievement of Company- compensation and financial results provided\nwide priorities and key performance by McLagan\ntargets • Human Resources group meet with the\n• Evaluate fiscal year-to-date performance versus peers CEO to discuss competitive compensation, retention,\n• Determination of the percentage of pre-bonus funding requirements and other significant compensation\noperating income that will go into the Award Pool, with issues for other NEOs\nrecommendation developed by the human resources • Review quarterly financial performance, focusing on\ngroup and reviewed and endorsed by the CEO prior to year-over-year results with regard to Company-wide\nCompensation Committee review performance measures\n• Review of NEO performance, with input from • Consider stockholder feedback received during the fiscal\nindependent compensation consultant and CEO year\n(for other NEOs) • Assess progress toward corporate priorities and analyze\n• Finalize and approve proposed award amounts potential impact to executive compensation\nCompensation Peer Group\nFor fiscal year 2023, the compensation peer group approved by the Compensation Committee is the following:\nAllianceBernstein Holding L.P.

Other Compensation Matters\nSummary of Compensation Practices\nOur executive compensation program reflects our commitment to responsible financial and risk management and is exemplified by\nthe following policies and practices:\nWhat We Do What We Don’t Do\n% Align pay with performance: a significant portion of total X Provide excessive severance benefits\ncompensation for all NEOs is performance-based\nX Enter into change in control agreements with NEOs\n% Grant long-term awards based on meaningful\nX Provide excise tax gross-ups\nperformance measures\nX Reprice underwater stock options\n% Maintain clawback policies\nX Permit hedging of Company stock\n% Require significant stock ownership\nX Allow pledging of Company stock received\n% Limit perquisites\nas compensation\n% Retain an independent consultant to the Compensation\nX Offer executive-specific retirement plans\nCommittee\nX Pay dividends or dividend equivalents to NEOs on\n% Regularly review incentive compensation plans and\nunvested performance shares\ncompensation practices\n% Engage with stockholders regarding compensation\npractices\nBenefits and Perquisites\nAs a general practice, we do not provide material personal benefits and provide only limited perquisites to the NEOs that are not\nprovided to other employees. All executive officers are eligible to receive medical, life and disability insurance coverage, participate in\nthe Company’s 401(k) plan and receive other corporate benefits available to most of the Company’s employees, consistent with the\nterms of the applicable plans and policies. In addition, certain of our NEOs may use the Company’s aircraft for personal reasons.\nTermination/Change in Control Matters\nOur NEOs are employed on an “at will” basis. We do not have a severance policy as a general rule and do not enter into\nchange of control agreements. However, from time to time we may consider severance in special situations. Except as needed\nin special circumstances such as during periods of transition, we generally do not have any commitments to provide our NEOs\nwith post-employment termination benefits. We have not entered into any agreement with any NEO that provides for additional\npayments or benefits solely on account of a change in control of the Company. Our only change in control provisions are included\nin existing compensation plans that apply to all participants in those plans.\nStock Ownership Policy\nThe Company believes that a significant ownership interest by certain senior officers tends to align the interests of members of\nmanagement of the Company with the Company’s stockholders and strengthens the link between long-term Company performance\nand executive compensation. The following senior officers of the Company are expected to own shares of common stock of the\n2024 Proxy Statement 43\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nCompany with a value equal to a specific multiple of such senior officer’s base salary, as indicated in the table below, by five years\nfrom when he or she first assumed the particular senior officer position for which stock ownership is expected:\nTitle Market Value of Shares Owned as a Multiple of Base Salary\nExecutive Chairman 5X\nVice Chairman 5X\nChief Executive Officer 5X\nPresident 4X\nExecutive Vice President 4X\nSenior Vice President 3X\nChief Accounting Officer 3X\nBoth direct and certain indirect forms of ownership are recognized in achieving these guidelines, including shares owned outright,\nrestricted stock, restricted stock units, 401(k) funds invested in shares of the Company’s common stock, and funds deemed\ninvested in shares of the Company’s common stock under a deferred compensation plan. Shares of the Company’s common stock\nheld by immediate family members (which includes an executive officer’s spouse, children and parents) or entities controlled by an\nexecutive officer may be considered holdings of the executive officer for purposes of the guidelines only and not as an admission of\nbeneficial ownership for any other purpose. As of December 21, 2023, all officers were in compliance with these guidelines.\nClawback Practices\nThe Company’s general employee compensation clawback practices provide for recovery of compensation amounts (i) in\nconnection with fraud or a breach of securities law by an executive officer or (ii) when (A) the Company issues a restatement of\nfinancial results to correct a material error; (B) the Compensation Committee determines, in good faith, that a Participant’s fraud\nor willful misconduct was a significant contributing factor to the need to issue such restatement; and (C) some or all of an award\nawarded to that executive officer prior to such restatement and/or shares of the Company’s common stock or mutual fund shares\nthat were awarded and/ or other property earned by the Participant prior to such restatement would not have been awarded and/or\nearned, as applicable, based upon the restated financial results.\nIn addition, effective for compensation awarded for periods beginning on or after October 1, 2023, the Board adopted an Executive\nCompensation Clawback Policy (“Clawback Policy”). The Clawback Policy provides for the mandatory recovery of erroneously\nawarded incentive-based compensation following accounting restatements from persons who served as an executive officer of the\nCompany at any time during the performance period for such incentive-based compensation and who received such compensation\nduring the three fiscal years preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement. The\ncompensation to be recovered is the amount in excess of what would have been paid based on the restated results. Recovery will\nbe required on a “no fault” basis, without regard to whether any misconduct occurred and without regard to whether an executive\nofficer was responsible for the erroneous financial statements.\nProhibition Against Certain Hedging Transactions\nPursuant to the Company’s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, which is applicable to all employees, temporary employees,\ndirectors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates, short sales of securities, including “short sales against the\nbox” (i.e., a short sale by the holder of a long position in the same stock) of securities issued by the Company, and securities issued\nby any closed-end fund sponsored or advised by the Company, are prohibited. This prohibition also applies to effecting economically\nequivalent transactions, including, but not limited to, purchasing and selling call or put options and swap transactions or other\nderivatives that would result in a net short exposure to the Company or any closed-end fund sponsored or advised by the Company.\nProhibition Against Pledging\nPursuant to the Company’s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, unless otherwise previously approved by the Compensation\nCommittee, directors and executive officers are prohibited from directly or indirectly pledging, hypothecating or otherwise encumbering\nsecurities issued to them by the Company as collateral for indebtedness. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, holding such\nsecurities in a margin account that could cause securities issued by the Company to be subject to a margin call or serve as collateral\nfor a margin loan. Securities issued by the Company that were not received as compensation are not subject to the prohibition as\nlong as the holder of such securities remains in compliance with applicable Stock Ownership Guidelines. If any person has subject\nsecurities issued by the Company pledged as collateral or held in a margin account when such person becomes a director or executive\nofficer of the Company, the pledge must be released within one year from the date the person became a director or executive officer.\n44 Franklin Resources\nCompensation Committee Report\nThe Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included\nin this Proxy Statement. Based on this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board that\nthe Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference into our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\nRespectfully Submitted:\nCOMPENSATION COMMITTEE\nJohn Y.

For awards with performance conditions, the value at the grant\ndate is reported based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions. Fiscal year 2023 Stock Awards value reflects the grant value\nfor relative operating margin awards and the outcome of the Monte Carlo valuation for total shareholder return awards, which is based on\ncorrelation of stock returns and stock return volatility of the Company and peer companies. Assuming the maximum level of performance is\nachieved under the applicable performance goals for performance-based long-term incentive awards granted in fiscal year 2023 to each of\nthe NEOs, the grant date fair value of such awards is $4,062,500 for Ms. Johnson, $3,750,000 for Mr. Nicholls, $625,000 for Mr. G. Johnson,\nand $1,500,000 for Mr. Spector. Mr. Murphy was not granted performance-based long-term incentive awards in fiscal year 2023. Additional\ninformation is set forth in the “Grants of Plan-Based Awards for Fiscal Year 2023” table below. See “Note 16—Stock-Based Compensation” in\nthe Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2023 filed with the SEC on November 14, 2023, for further details.\n(2) Represents the cash portion of awards earned under the AIP for fiscal year 2023. See “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Fiscal Year\n2023 Executive Compensation Decisions—Fiscal Year 2023 Base Salary and Annual Incentive Awards” above for more details.\n(3) For each of the NEOs, amounts include (a) matching contributions made by the Company under its tax-qualified defined contribution\n401(k) plan in fiscal year 2023 in the following amounts: $25,500, $25,500, $10,200, $25,500 and $22,950 for Ms. J. Johnson, Mr. Nicholls,\nMr. G. Johnson, Mr. Murphy, and Mr. Spector, respectively, (b) $12,500 from the ClearBridge profit sharing plan for Mr. Murphy and (c) the dollar\nvalue of life insurance premiums paid by the Company in fiscal year 2023.\nOur investment offerings may be provided to NEOs without charging management or performance fees consistent with the terms offered to\nother employees who meet the applicable requirements. As of September 30, 2023, Ms. J. Johnson had investments of $1,009,082 in these\nfunds, Mr. Nicholls had investments of $392,165 in these funds, Mr. G. Johnson had investments of $500,000 in these funds and Mr. Spector\nhad investments of $1,936,170 in these funds.\nAmounts for Ms. J. Johnson and Mr. G. Johnson include $164,848 and $114,318, respectively, for personal use of the Company’s aircraft in\nfiscal year 2023. The aggregate incremental cost of personal use of Company aircraft by NEOs (including by any family or guests) is calculated\nby using the rate per nautical mile, as published by Conklin & de Decker Associates, Inc. (“Conklin”) in its Aircraft Cost Evaluator for each type\nof Company aircraft. Such amount is based on the published current monthly rate in effect at the time of the personal flight use. The Conklin\nrates are used by a variety of corporate aviation operators for cost and budget estimation purposes. The Conklin rates utilized include the\nestimated variable cost per nautical mile of operating aircraft, including fuel and additives, labor and parts for most scheduled maintenance,\nengine, propeller and auxiliary power unit overhaul cost and parts repair and replacement costs, landing fees and expenses, supplies and\ncatering and crew costs excluding salaries, benefits and fixed costs. The Conklin rates do not include the cost of periodic aircraft refurbishment\nor upgrades, hangar costs, dues, subscriptions, weather and navigation and data services or the cost of insurance and administrative services.\n46 Franklin Resources\nExecutive Compensation\nThe Conklin rates also do not include depreciation or any tax benefit reductions due to personal use. The personal use amount includes all\nnautical miles flown for positioning flights necessary to undertake a personal flight and to return the aircraft to its next scheduled location. In\naddition, from time to time, family and guests of an NEO may accompany the NEO on business travel on Company aircraft. For those flights,\nwe allocate incremental costs of the total catering costs incurred on the flights, which are included in the reported amounts above.\nAmount for Mr. Nicholls includes $65,654 for moving expenses.\n(4) Mr. Murphy was not an NEO in fiscal year 2021 or 2022.

Please refer to the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” above for additional information.\n(3) Represents the equity portion of awards of restricted stock units granted for fiscal year 2022 performance; these awards were granted in fiscal\nyear 2023. Grants of restricted stock are subject to service-based vesting; one-third of the award vested on August 31, 2023, and the remaining\ntwo-thirds of the award will vest in two substantially equal installments on August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2025.\n(4) LTA awards granted are subject to service – based vesting; one-fourth of the award vested on August 31, 2023, and the remaining three fourths\nof the award will vest in three substantially equal installments on August 31, 2024, August 31, 2025 and end on August 31, 2026 in each case,\nsubject to the NEO’s continuous employment with the Company on the applicable vesting date.

Deferred Compensation Fund Plan\nThe Franklin Templeton, Inc. Deferred Compensation fund plan was effective November 16, 2021. Under the terms of the plan,\nparticipants are entitled to elect up to $500,000 in annual salary and certain bonuses and commissions on a pre-tax basis. Amounts\ndeferred under the plan are deemed invested in “phantom” shares of historic Franklin Templeton a sponsored mutual funds\n(“Franklin Funds”) or specified Index Funds currently offered in the Franklin Templeton 401(k) Plan. Earnings are accrued as they\nwould be if investing directly in the Franklin and/or Index Funds and include market appreciation and dividends. Amounts deferred\nunder our Deferred Compensation Fund Plan, including any earnings on those contributions, are fully vested at all times and are\nnot subject to forfeiture. Participants must elect, at the time they decide to defer compensation, whether: (1) to take an in service\ndistribution or distribution upon termination; (2) to receive their future distributions from the plan in (a) a single lump sum or (b) five\nequal annual installments (available only if the total account balance is greater than $17,500); and (3) to have the distributions\nbegin immediately after termination or one year from the date of termination. Participants will receive distributions in cash, except\nfor in-service elections, which distributions may be made, in Franklin Templeton’s sole discretion, in shares of Franklin funds, Index\nfunds or cash. In addition, Franklin Templeton will distribute account balances to participants in connection with a change of control\nif the plan and all substantially similar agreements are terminated with respect to the participants affected by the change of control.\nFor purposes of our Deferred Compensation Fund Plan, a “change in control event” will occur upon a change in (1) ownership\nwithin the meaning of §1.409A-3(i)(5) (v) of regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, (2) effective control\nwithin the meaning of §1.409A-3(i)(5)(vi) of the regulations, or (3) ownership of assets within the meaning of §1.409A-3(i)(5)(vii) of\nthe regulations.\nThe Legg Mason, Inc. Deferred Compensation Fund Plan, a legacy deferred compensation plan acquired by Franklin Templeton\non August 1, 2020, in connection with its acquisition of Legg Mason, Inc., is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan. As of\nJanuary 1, 2021 deferrals were no longer accepted into the plan. This plan was available only to a select group of employees\nbased on responsibilities and compensation levels. Under the terms of the plan, participants were entitled to elect up to $500,000\nin annual salary and certain bonuses and commissions on a pre-tax basis. Amounts deferred under the plan are deemed invested\nin “phantom” shares of historic Legg Mason sponsored mutual funds (“Legg Mason Funds”). Earnings are accrued as they would\nbe if investing directly in the Legg Mason Funds and include market appreciation and dividends. Amounts deferred under our\nDeferred Compensation Fund Plan, including any earnings on those contributions, are fully vested at all times and are not subject\nto forfeiture. Participants must elect, at the time they decide to defer compensation, whether: (1) to take an in service distribution or\ndistribution upon termination; (2) to receive their future distributions from the plan in (a) a single lump sum or (b) three equal annual\ninstallments (available only if the total account balance is greater than $17,500); and (3) to have the distributions begin immediately\nafter termination or one year from the date of termination. Participants will receive distributions in cash, except for in-service\nelections, which distributions may be made, in Franklin Templeton’s sole discretion, in shares of Legg Mason Funds or cash. In\naddition, Franklin Templeton will distribute account balances to participants in connection with a change of control if the plan and all\nsubstantially similar agreements are terminated with respect to the participants affected by the change of control. For purposes of\n50 Franklin Resources\nExecutive Compensation\nour Deferred Compensation Fund Plan, a “change in control event” will occur upon a change in (1) ownership within the meaning\nof §1.409A-3(i)(5) (v) of regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, (2) effective control within the meaning of\n§1.409A-3(i)(5)(vi) of the regulations, or (3) ownership of assets within the meaning of §1.409A-3(i)(5)(vii) of the regulations.

Distributions from the Deferred\nCompensation Fund Plan are made in either cash or shares of Franklin Templeton proprietary funds.\nPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control\nExcept as needed in special circumstances, such as during periods of transition or when we hire new executive officers, we\ngenerally do not provide our NEOs with agreements providing for severance benefits after their employment with us has ended or\nin connection with a change in control.\nAs described under “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” above, the NEOs have typically received incentive awards payable\nin the form of cash and grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units. In addition, the NEOs have typically received\nperformance-based long-term incentive awards. Except as set forth below or as otherwise determined by the Compensation\nCommittee, unvested awards granted to an NEO under such plans are forfeited upon voluntary or involuntary termination of an NEO’s\nemployment with us.\nAmended and Restated Annual Incentive Compensation Plan\nCurrently, the AIP generally provides that a participant must be employed on the payment date of cash and grant date of equity\nawards to receive any amounts awarded under the AIP unless expressly set forth in the participant’s award agreement. In the event\nthe employment of a participant who received a performance award under the AIP terminates for any reason, the Compensation\nCommittee or management, as applicable, may, in its discretion, determine to pay the participant a prorated award under the plan\nbased upon performance for the time served during the relevant performance period, the full amount of any award that would have\nbeen paid had the participant remained employed through the entire performance period or any other amount. Certain equity award\nagreements evidencing restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards granted as part of an incentive award under the AIP provide\nthat if a participant dies or terminates employment with us due to disability, the unvested portion of the equity award will become\nfully vested as of the date of death or termination due to disability.\nThe AIP does not expressly provide for any change in control payments.\n2014 Key Executive Incentive Compensation Plan\nUntil the end of fiscal year 2019, the Company made certain long-term incentive and retention awards to executive officers under\nthe KEIP, a sub-plan under the AIP. Consequently, the provisions described above regarding the AIP apply to grants previously\nmade under the KEIP. In addition, the KEIP includes separate terms regarding termination payments which remain applicable for\nawards outstanding under the KEIP. The termination provisions are summarized below.\n2024 Proxy Statement 51\nExecutive Compensation\nIf the employment of a participant in the KEIP terminates prior to the end of the applicable measurement period due to death,\ndisability or retirement, such participant is generally entitled to receive payment under the plan with respect to the fiscal year\nof such termination. In addition, if a participant terminates employment with the Company prior to the end of the applicable\nmeasurement period for any reason other than death, disability or retirement, any award under the plan with respect to the fiscal\nyear of such termination generally will be reduced proportionately based on the date of termination. In all events, the Compensation\nCommittee, in its sole discretion, may eliminate or reduce any such awards under the KEIP, including if a participant terminates\nemployment as described above.\nThe KEIP does not expressly provide for any change in control payments.\n2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan\nLong-term performance-based and other incentive awards are granted to all eligible employees, including our NEOs, under the\nUSIP. The award agreements for NEOs generally provide that if an NEO’s employment with the Company terminates for any\nreason prior to the applicable vesting date, the NEO will forfeit the unvested portion of the award. However, as described above,\ncertain equity award agreements evidencing restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards granted as part of an incentive award\nunder the AIP provide that if a participant dies or terminates employment with us due to disability, the unvested portion of the equity\naward will become fully vested as of the date of death or termination due to disability. Certain other equity award agreements\nprovide that vesting may be accelerated as determined by an executive officer, in his or her sole discretion, in accordance with\nCompany policies, in whole or in part, if a participant dies or terminates employment with us due to disability.\nThe USIP provides that in the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company or of a merger or corporate\ncombination (a “change in control transaction”) in which the successor corporation does not agree to assume outstanding\nawards or substitute equivalent awards, the Compensation Committee will make a determination as to the equitable treatment of\noutstanding awards under the USIP and must notify participants of such treatment no later than 10 days prior to the closing of such\nproposed change in control transaction. Outstanding option awards, to the extent not previously exercised, and other stock-based\nawards (restricted stock and RSUs) that are not assumed or substituted in any change in control transaction will terminate\nimmediately prior to the consummation of such proposed change in control transaction.\nCompensation Committee Policy & Practice\nNotwithstanding the discussion above, pursuant to the terms of the applicable plans, the Compensation Committee, in its sole\ndiscretion, generally may eliminate or reduce any unvested awards otherwise payable to a participant following termination of\nemployment. In addition, the Compensation Committee has the authority to pay the full award amount to a participant whose award\nwould have otherwise been reduced or forfeited following termination of employment or a change in control. The Compensation\nCommittee also has the discretion to determine the terms, conditions, performance criteria, restrictions, and other provisions\nof awards.\nAs a general policy matter, the Compensation Committee has limited the payment of unvested awards following a participant’s\ntermination of employment. We expect the Compensation Committee would act similarly upon a change in control transaction.\nThe treatment of unvested awards, if any, held by the NEOs upon their termination of employment or upon a change in control\ntransaction would be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Compensation Committee.\nEstimated Potential Payments Upon Termination\nBecause of the Compensation Committee’s general policy of limiting payments to the NEOs following termination of employment\nand its authority to reduce or increase the payments otherwise available under awards, the amounts payable to the NEOs following\ntermination of employment are not determinable. The following table sets forth information regarding payments to each of our\nNEOs in the event of a termination of employment on September 30, 2023. The amounts in the table below are based on the\nclosing price of the Company’s common stock on the NYSE on September 30, 2023, the last trading day of our fiscal year 2023, as\nwell as the assumptions set forth in the footnotes to the table.\n52 Franklin Resources\nExecutive Compensation\nEstimated Potential Payments Upon a Change in Control\nThere are no agreements with NEOs that provide for payments upon a change in control of the Company. Under the USIP,\nhowever, the Compensation Committee has the discretion to make a determination as to the equitable treatment of awards upon\na change in control transaction (as defined above). The Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, make a determination\nas to the treatment of cash awards, awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units in connection with a change in control\ntransaction. The following table sets forth an estimate of the potential payments that could have been payable to our NEOs\nupon a change in control transaction of the Company assuming such a transaction occurred on September 30, 2023. The\namounts in the table below reflect a range of estimated potential payments based on the NEO’s compensation and service\nlevels as of September 30, 2023, and if applicable, based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the NYSE on\nSeptember 30, 2023, the last trading day of fiscal year 2023, as well as the assumptions set forth in the footnotes to the table.\nEstimated Potential Payments Upon Termination\nInvoluntary\nTermination Other\nDeath or other than for Voluntary Change in\nDisability(1) Retirement(2) Cause(3) Termination(4) Control(5)\nName ($) ($) ($) ($) ($)\nJennifer M.

The minimum reflects the value of unvested AIP and/or KEIP equity awards held by the NEO as of September 29, 2023 (calculated\nbased on the value of the NEO’s unvested stock awards, excluding Equity Incentive Plan Awards, as set forth in the “Outstanding Equity\nAwards at 2023 Fiscal Year-End” table above). For all NEOs, the illustrative maximum reflects the value of unvested AIP and/or KEIP equity\nawards held by the NEO as of September 29, 2023 plus the value of the cash portion of the incentive award under the KEIP and/or AIP in\nrespect of fiscal year 2023 (calculated, for this purpose, based on the value of the fiscal year 2022 cash incentive that was paid to the NEO in\nfiscal year 2023). The Compensation Committee has discretion to determine the amount, if any, to be paid and the actual payment approved by\nthe Compensation Committee potentially could exceed the amount set forth in this table.\n(2) For all NEOs, amounts included in this column range from $0 to a maximum payment, as determined in the discretion of the Compensation\nCommittee. The illustrative maximum reflects the value of the cash portion of the incentive award under the AIP in respect of fiscal year 2023.\nAs discussed above, the Compensation Committee may exercise its discretion to pay, reduce, or eliminate any amounts under the KEP,\nincluding if a participant retires. The Compensation Committee has discretion to determine the amount, if any, to be paid and the actual\npayment approved by the Compensation Committee potentially could exceed the amount set forth in this table.\n(3) For purposes of this table only, an “Involuntary Termination other than for Cause” generally means an involuntary termination of the NEO by\nthe Company for reasons other than cause, death or disability. Amounts included in this column range from $0 to a maximum payment, as\ndetermined in the discretion of the Compensation Committee, with the illustrative maximum based on the assumptions set forth in footnote 2\nabove. The Compensation Committee has discretion to determine the amount, if any, to be paid and the actual payment approved by the\nCompensation Committee potentially could exceed the amount set forth in this table.\n(4) For purposes of this table, an “Other Voluntary Termination” means a resignation of employment other than due to death, disability or\nretirement. Amounts included in this column range from $0 to a maximum payment, based on the assumptions set forth in footnote 2\nabove. The Compensation Committee has discretion to determine the amount, if any, to be paid and the actual payment approved by the\nCompensation Committee potentially could exceed the amount set forth in this table.\n(5) Amounts included in this column range from $0 to a maximum payment, as determined in the discretion of the Compensation Committee. The\nillustrative maximum reflects the value of the cash portion of the incentive award under the AIP in respect of fiscal year 2023 plus the value of\nthe NEO’s outstanding equity awards (calculated, for this purpose, based on the value of the NEO’s unvested stock awards as set forth in the\n“Outstanding Equity Awards at 2023 Fiscal Year-End” table above). The Compensation Committee has discretion to determine the amount, if\nany, to be paid and the actual payment approved by the Compensation Committee potentially could exceed the amount set forth in this table.\n2024 Proxy Statement 53\nExecutive Compensation\nPay Ratio\nOur CEO pay ratio is calculated in accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K and provides a reasonable estimate of the ratio\nof our CEO’s annual total compensation to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of Franklin Templeton,\nother than the CEO.\nMs. Johnson had annual total compensation of $15,676,792 as reflected in the fiscal year 2023 Summary Compensation Table.\nOur median employee’s annual total compensation was $138,378. The resulting ratio of our CEO’s annual total compensation to\nthe annual total compensation of our median employee for fiscal year 2023 was approximately 113 to 1.\nTo establish the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees, and to determine the annual total compensation\nof Franklin Templeton’s “median employee,” we used the methodology, assumptions and estimates described below.\nWe identified the median employee by reviewing the last full fiscal year annualized salary (or wages plus overtime, as applicable)\nand actual annual bonus paid to all employees of Franklin Templeton and its subsidiaries worldwide, excluding our CEO, who were\nemployed on August 31, 2023. We included employees working on a full-time, part-time, or interim basis. In order to facilitate an\nassessment of all employee compensation in U.S. dollars, we applied to the compensation paid to our non-U.S. employees a local\ncurrency-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate equal to the month end rate as of August 31, 2023. Once we identified the median employee,\nwe calculated annual total compensation for that employee using the same methodology we use for our NEOs as shown in the\nSummary Compensation Table.\nOur CEO pay ratio is disclosed to comply with rules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection\nAct and is not intended as a measure of comparison with any other company.\nPay Versus Performance\nThe following table provides information regarding the relationship between executive “compensation actually paid” (as defined by\nSEC rules) to our principal executive officer (“PEO”) and average compensation paid to our other NEOs (“Non-PEO NEOs”) and\ncertain aspects of our financial performance for each of the last three completed fiscal years. In determining the “compensation\nactually paid” to our NEOs, SEC rules require us to include various adjustments to amounts that have been reported in the\nSummary Compensation Table for each applicable year, and therefore reported amounts differ from those required in the Summary\nCompensation Table. Fair value amounts below are computed in a manner consistent with the fair value methodology used to\naccount for share-based payments in our financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles. For any awards that\nare subject to performance conditions, the change in fair value is calculated based upon the probable outcome of such conditions\nas of the last day of the applicable year. The changes in fair value in the tables below compare the fair value at the end of the\napplicable year with the prior year-end fair value.

These charts reflect “compensation actually paid” for our PEO and average “compensation actually\npaid” for our non-PEO NEOs for each of the 2023, 2022, and 2021 fiscal years as defined by SEC rules. In determining the\n“compensation actually paid” to our NEOs, we are required by SEC rules to include various adjustments to amounts that have\nbeen reported in the Summary Compensation Table for the applicable fiscal year, as the SEC’s valuation methods for this\nsection differ from those required in the Summary Compensation Table. These amounts do not reflect the year-end executive\npay decisions made by the Compensation Committee.

We believe Adjusted Operating Revenue is the most significant financial\nperformance measure in determining the compensation of our NEOs.

As of December 1, 2023, under the USIP there were:\nno shares of common stock subject to outstanding options; an aggregate of 13,557,789 shares of restricted stock or underlying\nrestricted stock unit awards outstanding but not yet vested, based on the passage of time; and 1,544,335 shares underlying\nrestricted stock unit awards outstanding but not yet vested, based on the achievement of predetermined performance goals\n(assuming delivery at maximum level). Shares deliverable under the USIP may be authorized, but unissued shares, or reacquired\nshares.\nAny shares covered by an award under the USIP that are not delivered because the award is forfeited or canceled, or the shares\nare not delivered because the award is settled in cash will not be deemed to have been delivered for purposes of determining\nthe maximum number of shares available for delivery under the USIP. However, all shares covered by the portion of any stock\nappreciation right that is exercised (whether or not shares are actually issued to the holder upon exercise of the right) are\nconsidered issued pursuant to the USIP. If shares of common stock are surrendered or withheld as payment of either the exercise\nprice of an option and/or withholding taxes in respect of such option, such shares will not be returned to the USIP and will not be\navailable for future awards under the USIP.\nThe Compensation Committee may grant awards under the USIP to a person who becomes a participant of the USIP by reason\nof the acquisition of another entity, in substitution for awards previously granted by such entity to such person. The terms and\nconditions of the substitute awards may vary from the terms and conditions that would otherwise be required by the USIP solely\nto the extent the Compensation Committee deems necessary. Any such substitute awards shall not reduce the Share Reserve;\nprovided, however, that such treatment is permitted by applicable law and the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange\nor other exchange or securities market on which the Company’s common stock is listed.\nEligibility and Participation\nUnder the terms of the USIP, any executive, employee, director (including any non-employee director) and, if this proposal is\napproved individual consultant, of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is eligible to participate. The basis for participation in the\nplan is selection for participation by the Compensation Committee in its discretion. As of November 30, 2023, approximately\n9,196 employees (including eight executives), eight non-executive directors and no consultants were eligible to participate in the\nUSIP.\nTypes of Awards\nStock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights. A stock option is the right to purchase a specified number of shares of common stock\nin the future at a specified exercise price in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the applicable award agreement\nand the USIP. An option may be either an incentive stock option or an option that is not intended to qualify as an incentive stock\noption (see “Certain Significant Federal Income Tax Consequences” below). The Compensation Committee will, with regard to\neach stock option, determine and set forth in the applicable award agreement: (a) the number of shares subject to the option, (b)\nthe manner and time of the option’s exercise and vesting, (c) the exercise price per share of stock subject to the option, and (d) the\nmethods by which the exercise price may be paid. A stock appreciation right is a grant of rights to receive, in cash or common stock\n(as determined by the Compensation Committee), value equal to (or otherwise based on) the excess of: (1) the Fair Market Value\n(as defined in the USIP) of a specified number of shares of common stock at the time of exercise, over (2) a base appreciation\namount established by the Compensation Committee. The exercise price for a stock option and the base appreciation amount of\na stock appreciation right is determined by the Compensation Committee but may not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value\nper share of the common stock on the date the award is granted (or 110%, in the case of an incentive stock option granted to any\nemployee who owns stock representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of the Company or any parent or subsidiary\nof the Company).\n2024 Proxy Statement 67\nProposal No. 3: Approval of an Amendment and Restatement of the Company’s 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan\nRestricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Unit Awards, Stock Awards and Stock-Based Awards. A restricted stock award is a\ngrant of shares of common stock, and a restricted stock unit award is a grant of a right to receive shares of common stock or\ncash (as determined by the Compensation Committee) in the future that, in each case, are subject to a risk of forfeiture or other\nrestrictions that will lapse upon the achievement of one or more goals relating to continued service of the holder or achievement of\nperformance or other objectives, as determined by the Compensation Committee. A stock award is a grant of shares of common\nstock that is not subject to forfeiture or other restrictions. A stock-based award is an award that is valued or based on the Fair\nMarket Value of shares of common stock, other than the foregoing awards. The terms and conditions of each such award are\ndetermined by the Compensation Committee and set forth in the applicable award agreement.\nDividends or Dividend Equivalents. An award under the USIP may provide the holder with the right to receive dividend or dividend\nequivalent payments with respect to common stock subject to the award, whether or not the common stock subject to the award\nis earned, vested, or acquired. Dividend equivalents may be either paid currently or credited to an account for the holder and may\nbe settled in cash or common stock as determined by the Compensation Committee, in each case subject to such conditions,\nrestrictions and contingencies as the Compensation Committee shall establish.\nTerm of Awards\nThe term of all awards are determined by the Compensation Committee and set forth in the applicable award agreement, provided\nthat the term of any award may not be for more than 10 years (or five years in the case of an incentive stock option granted to any\nparticipant who owns stock representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of the Company or any parent or subsidiary\nof the Company), subject to earlier termination in connection with a termination of the holder’s service with the Company and its\nsubsidiaries or other forfeiture events.\nForfeiture Events\nThe Compensation Committee may specify in an award agreement that a participant’s rights, payments and benefits with respect\nto an award are subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain events, which may\ninclude, for example, termination of a participant’s service with the Company or any of its subsidiaries for “cause” (as defined in the\naward agreement), a participant’s violation of applicable laws or policies of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, a participant’s\nbreach of restrictive covenants, or other conduct detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company.\nTransferability\nUnless specifically provided by the Compensation Committee in an award agreement, a participant’s rights under the USIP may\nnot be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. An award\nagreement (other than with respect to an incentive stock option) may permit the award to be transferred to family members, family\ntrusts, family controlled entities, charitable organizations, and/or pursuant to domestic relations orders or agreements, in all cases\nwithout payment for such transfers to the participant.\nMinimum Vesting\nNo options or stock appreciation rights granted under the USIP may vest prior to the first anniversary of the applicable date of\ngrant, except for options or stock appreciation rights that vest as a result of a participant’s death or Disability or the occurrence of a\nTransaction (each as defined in the USIP).\nIndividual Limits\nUnder the USIP, (a) the maximum number of shares with respect to which options and stock appreciation rights may be granted\nto an individual participant during a calendar year is 1.2 million shares, (b) the maximum number of shares with respect to which\nrestricted stock, restricted stock unit, stock-based and stock awards may be granted to an individual participant during a calendar\nyear is 3 million shares (regardless of when such shares are deliverable to the participant), and (c) the maximum number of shares\nsubject to awards that may be granted to any non-employee member of the Board during the fiscal year, taken together with\nany cash fees paid to such non-employee member of the Board during the fiscal year, shall not exceed $1 million in total value\n(calculating the value of any stock-based award based on the grant date fair value of such award for financial reporting purposes),\nin each case, subject to adjustment as described under “Changes in Capitalization” below.\n68 Franklin Resources\nProposal No. 3: Approval of an Amendment and Restatement of the Company’s 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan\nPerformance Based Compensation\nWhen establishing performance goals applicable to any restricted stock, restricted stock unit, stock award or stock-based\naward under the USIP, the Compensation Committee may use one or more business criteria, including, without limitation,\n(a) annual revenue, (b) budget comparisons, (c) controllable profits, (d) Company earnings per share, (e) expense management,\n(f) improvements in capital structure, (g) net income, (h) net or gross sales, (i) operating income (pre- or post-tax), (j) profit margins,\n(k) operating or gross margin, (l) profitability of an identifiable business unit or product, (m) return on investments, (n) return on\nsales, (o) return on stockholders’ equity, (p) total return to stockholders, (q) assets under management, (r) investment management\nperformance, (s) mutual and other investment fund performance, (t) institutional account performance, (u) high net worth and\nother separate account performance, (v) cash flow, operating cash flow, or cash flow or operating cash flow per share (before or\nafter dividends), (w) price of the shares or any other publicly traded securities of the Company, (x) reduction in costs, (y) return on\ncapital, including return on total capital or return on invested capital, (z) improvement in or attainment of expense levels or working\ncapital levels, and (aa) performance of the Company relative to a peer group of companies and/or relevant indexes on any of the\nforegoing measures.\nThese performance goals may be applicable to the Company and/or any of its individual business units and may differ from\nparticipant to participant. In addition, these performance measures may be calculated in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles but excluding the effect (whether positive or negative) of any change in accounting standards and any\nextraordinary, unusual or nonrecurring item, as determined by the Compensation Committee, occurring after the establishment of\nthe performance goals and may be otherwise adjusted as determined by the Compensation Committee.\nChanges in Capitalization; Corporate Transactions\nIn the event of any change with respect to the outstanding shares of common stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock\nsplit, stock dividend, extraordinary cash dividend, merger or corporate combination, combination or reclassification of the shares\nof common stock or any other similar transaction, the Compensation Committee may proportionately adjust any of the following,\nsubject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company: (a) the number and/or kind of securities covered by each\noutstanding award, (b) the price per share covered by each such outstanding award, (c) the number and/or kind of securities which\nhave been authorized for issuance under the USIP but as to which no awards have yet been granted or which have been returned\nto the USIP upon cancellation or expiration of an award, (d) the maximum number of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted\nstock awards, restricted stock unit awards, stock awards and stock-based awards which may be granted to any participant in any\none-calendar-year period, (e) any other value determinations applicable to the USIP and/or outstanding awards, and (f) any other\nterms of an award that are affected by the event. Any adjustments, determinations or interpretations made by the Compensation\nCommittee shall be final, binding and conclusive.\nIn the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company or a merger or corporate combination in which the successor\ncorporation does not agree to assume awards under the USIP or substitute equivalent awards, the Compensation Committee will\nmake a determination (subject to the requirements of the USIP, as described under “Amendment and Termination” below) as to the\nequitable treatment of outstanding awards under the USIP.\nAmendment and Termination\nThe USIP has no pre-determined termination date. The Board may at any time amend or terminate the USIP. However, no such\namendment or termination may materially and adversely affect the rights of any holder of an award previously granted under the\nUSIP without written consent of the holder. In addition, no such amendment or termination will be made without the approval of the\nCompany’s stockholders to the extent such approval is required by applicable corporate, securities or tax laws, the requirements\nof any applicable stock exchange or if the amendment would lessen the stockholder approval requirements described in this\nparagraph or under “Stockholder Approval Required for Repricings” below. Notwithstanding that, the Board may, however, amend\nthe USIP in such manner as it deems necessary to cause an award to comply with the requirements of the Code or any other\napplicable law, to avoid adverse tax consequences, or for changes in new accounting standards.\nStockholder Approval Required for Repricings\nReducing the exercise price of an option or the base appreciation amount of a stock appreciation right, or cancelling an underwater\noption or stock appreciation right in exchange for an equity award with a lower exercise price, purchase price, or base appreciation\namount (as applicable), may not be done under the USIP without stockholder approval.\n2024 Proxy Statement 69\nProposal No. 3: Approval of an Amendment and Restatement of the Company’s 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan\nCertain Significant Federal Income Tax Consequences\nThe following discussion briefly describes certain significant U.S. federal income tax consequences of the USIP for participants and\ncertain tax effects to the Company. The statements in the following paragraphs concerning certain significant U.S. federal income\ntax consequences of benefits under the USIP are based on the Code, and judicial and administrative interpretations, as of the date\nof this Proxy Statement, which are subject to change at any time (possibly with retroactive effect). No attempt has been made to\ndiscuss any potential foreign, state or local tax consequences. The U.S. tax law is technical and complex, and the discussion below\nrepresents only a general summary. The tax treatment of a participant in the USIP may vary depending on his or her particular\nsituation and may, therefore, be subject to special rules not discussed below. Accordingly, participants in the USIP should consult\nwith their own tax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences (including state and local taxes) to them. Nothing in this\nProposal No. 3 guarantees any particular tax treatment.\nIncentive Stock Options. Incentive stock options (“ISOs”) granted under the USIP are intended to meet the definitional\nrequirements of Section 422(b) of the Code for “incentive stock options.” An employee who receives an ISO does not recognize\nany taxable income upon the grant of such ISO. Similarly, the exercise of an ISO generally does not give rise to federal income tax\nto the employee, provided that (i) the federal “alternative minimum tax,” which depends on the employee’s particular tax situation,\ndoes not apply and (ii) the employee is employed by the Company or its subsidiaries from the date of the grant of the ISO until\nthree months prior to the exercise thereof, except where such employment terminates by reason of disability (where the three\nmonth period is extended to one year) or death (where this requirement does not apply). If any employee exercises an ISO after\nthe requisite periods referred to in clause (ii) above, the ISO will be treated as an NSO (as defined below) and will be subject to the\nrules set forth below under the caption “Non-Qualified Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.” Further, if after exercising an\nISO, an employee disposes of the common stock so acquired more than two years from the date of grant and more than one year\nfrom the date of transfer of the common stock pursuant to the exercise of such ISO (the “applicable holding period”), the employee\nwill generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount received for the shares and the\nexercise price.\nIf, however, any employee does not hold the shares so acquired for the applicable holding period, thereby making a “disqualifying\ndisposition,” the employee would recognize ordinary income equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the\ntime the ISO was exercised over the exercise price and the balance, if any, would generally be treated as capital gain. If the\ndisqualifying disposition is a sale or exchange that would permit a loss to be recognized under the Code (were a loss in fact to be\nrealized), and the sales proceeds are less than the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise, the employee’s ordinary\nincome would be limited to the gain (if any) realized on the sale. If the exercise price exceeds the amount realized upon the\ndisqualifying disposition, the difference would be a capital loss.\nThe Company will not be allowed a federal income tax deduction upon the grant or exercise of an ISO or the disposition, after\nthe applicable holding period, of the common stock acquired upon exercise of an ISO. However, in the event of a disqualifying\ndisposition, the Company generally will be entitled to a deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income included by the\nemployee, provided that such amount constitutes an ordinary and necessary business expense to the Company and is reasonable.\nNon-Qualified Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights. Non-qualified stock options (“NSO”) granted under the USIP are\noptions that do not qualify as ISOs. An individual who receives an NSO or Stock Appreciation Right (“stock appreciation right”) will\nnot recognize any taxable income upon the grant of such NSO or stock appreciation right. However, the individual generally will\nrecognize ordinary income upon exercise of an NSO in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares of\ncommon stock underlying such NSO at the time of exercise over the aggregate exercise price of such shares subject to the NSO.\nSimilarly, upon the receipt of cash or shares pursuant to the exercise of a stock appreciation right, the individual generally will\nrecognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the sum of the cash and the fair market value of the shares received upon such\nexercise.\nIndividuals will recognize gain upon the disposition of any shares received upon exercise of an NSO or stock appreciation right\nequal to the excess of (i) the amount realized on such disposition over (ii) the ordinary income recognized with respect to such\nshares under the principles set forth above, plus, in the case of an NSO, the exercise price previously paid for such shares. That\ngain will be taxable as long- or short-term capital gain depending on whether the shares were held for more than one year.\nA federal income tax deduction generally will be allowed to the Company in an amount equal to the ordinary income included by\nthe individual with respect to the exercise of his or her NSO or stock appreciation right, provided that such amount constitutes an\nordinary and necessary business expense to the Company and is reasonable.\n70 Franklin Resources\nProposal No. 3: Approval of an Amendment and Restatement of the Company’s 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan\nRestricted Stock and Stock Awards. Restricted stock awards granted by the Company fall within the Code’s guidelines for awards\nthat are restricted as to transferability and subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. Absent a written election under Section 83(b) of\nthe Code filed with the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days after the date of transfer of such shares pursuant to the restricted\nstock award (a “Section 83(b) election”), an individual will recognize ordinary income at the earlier of the time at which (i) the\nshares become transferable or (ii) the restrictions that impose a substantial risk of forfeiture of such shares lapse, in an amount\nequal to the excess of the fair market value (on such date) of such shares over the price paid for the award, if any. With respect to\nstock awards, an individual will recognize ordinary income upon receipt.\nAn individual will recognize ordinary income as of the date the common stock is transferred to the individual (and for restricted\nstock awards, only if a Section 83(b) election is properly made), in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the\ncommon stock as of that date over the amount paid for such stock, if any.\nThe Company generally will be allowed a deduction for federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the ordinary income\nrecognized by the individual, provided that such amount constitutes an ordinary and necessary business expense and is\nreasonable.\nIndividuals will recognize gain upon the disposition of any shares received equal to the excess of (i) the amount realized on such\ndisposition over (ii) the sum of the amount paid, if any, for such shares plus the ordinary income recognized with respect to such\nshares under the principles set forth above. That gain will be taxable as long- or short-term capital gain depending on whether the\nshares were held for more than one year.\nRestricted Stock Unit and Stock-Based Awards. Recipients of restricted stock unit and stock-based awards generally should not\nrecognize taxable income until such awards are settled into cash or shares of common stock (as applicable). Upon settlement, the\nindividual will normally recognize ordinary income equal to the amount of cash and fair market value of the shares, if any, received\nupon such conversion. The Company generally will be allowed a deduction for federal income tax purposes in an amount equal\nto the ordinary income recognized by the recipient, provided that such amount constitutes an ordinary and necessary business\nexpense and is reasonable.\nIndividuals will recognize gain upon the disposition of any shares received upon conversion of the restricted stock unit or stock-\nbased awards equal to the excess of (i) the amount realized on such disposition over (ii) the ordinary income recognized with\nrespect to such shares under the principles set forth above. That gain will be taxable as long- or short-term capital gain depending\non whether the shares were held for more than one year.\nSection 409A. Section 409A of the Code imposes certain requirements on nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements.\nThese include requirements with respect to an individual’s election to defer compensation and the individual’s selection of the\ntiming and form of distribution of the deferred compensation. Section 409A also generally provides that distributions may be made\nonly on specified dates or on or following the occurrence of certain events (e.g., the individual’s separation from service or the\nindividual’s death). Section 409A imposes restrictions on an individual’s ability to change his or her distribution timing or form\nafter the compensation has been deferred. For certain officers and other individuals, Section 409A requires that such individual’s\ndistributions of non-qualified deferred compensation in connection with a separation from service commence no earlier than six\nmonths after such individual’s separation from service.\nAwards granted under the USIP with a deferral feature will generally be subject to the requirements of Section 409A. If an award\nis subject to and fails to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, the recipient of that award will recognize ordinary income on the\namounts deferred under the award, to the extent vested, which may be prior to when the compensation is actually or constructively\nreceived. Also, if an award that is subject to Section 409A fails to comply with Section 409A’s provisions, Section 409A imposes\nan additional 20% federal income tax on compensation recognized as ordinary income, as well as possible interest-like charges\nand penalties. Certain states have enacted laws similar to Section 409A, which impose additional taxes, interest and penalties on\nnon-qualified deferred compensation arrangements.\nSection 280G. Under certain circumstances, accelerated vesting, exercise or payment of awards under the USIP in connection\nwith a “change in control” of the Company might be deemed an “excess parachute payment” for purposes of the golden parachute\npayment provisions of Code Section 280G. To the extent it is so considered, the participant holding the award would be subject to\nan excise tax equal to 20% of the amount of the excess parachute payment, and the Company would be denied a tax deduction for\nthe excess parachute payment.\n2024 Proxy Statement 71\nProposal No. 3: Approval of an Amendment and Restatement of the Company’s 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan\nNew Plan Benefits\nBecause grants under the USIP are subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee, it is not possible to determine the\nbenefits that will be received by executive officers, other employees and directors if the amendment and restatement to the USIP is\napproved by the stockholders.\nHowever, it is anticipated that, among others, all of our current executive officers, including our named executive officers, and our\nnon-employee directors will receive awards under the USIP.\nOther Information\nThe closing price of a share of common stock on December 11, 2023 was $25.49 per share. If stockholders do not approve this\nProposal, the requested increase in the number of authorized shares available for delivery under the USIP and certain other\nchanges cannot be implemented, and the Company will consider its alternatives.\nThe table below shows the number of shares of common stock underlying outstanding restricted stock unit awards as of\nDecember 1, 2023 that have been granted to certain individuals or groups of individuals under the USIP since its inception in\nOctober 2002.

Awards may be granted as alternatives to or replacement of\nawards outstanding under the 2002 Stock Plan, or any other plan or arrangement of the Company or a Subsidiary (including a\nplan or arrangement of a business or entity, all or a portion of which is acquired by the Company or a Subsidiary).

The Shares may be authorized but unissued, or reacquired Common Stock.\n(a) Except as set forth in Section 1.4(b) and (c), to the extent any Shares covered by an Award are not delivered to a\nParticipant or beneficiary because the Award is forfeited or canceled, or the Shares are not delivered because the\nAward is settled in cash, such Shares shall not be deemed to have been delivered for purposes of determining the\nmaximum number of Shares available for delivery pursuant to Awards granted under the 2002 Stock Plan.\n(b) All Shares covered by the portion of a SAR that is exercised (whether or not Shares are actually issued to the\nParticipant upon exercise of the SAR) shall be considered issued pursuant to the 2002 Stock Plan.\n(c) If Shares are surrendered or withheld as payment of either the exercise price of an Option granted hereunder and/or\nwithholding taxes in respect of such an Option (including, without limitation, by attestation), such Shares shall not be\nreturned to the 2002 Stock Plan and shall not be available for future awards under the 2002 Stock Plan.\n(d) Subject to adjustment under Section 6.1 and after giving effect to the 2013 stock split, (i) the maximum number of\nshares that may be granted to any one individual Participant pursuant to Section 2 (relating to Options and SARs)\nshall be 1,200,000 Shares during any one-calendar-year period and (ii) the maximum number of Shares that may be\ngranted to any one individual Participant subject to Section 3 (relating to Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock\nUnit Awards, Stock Awards and Stock-Based Awards) shall be 3,000,000 Shares during any one-calendar-year period\n(regardless of when such Shares are deliverable).\nA-1 Franklin Resources\nAppendix A: Franklin Resources, Inc. 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan\n(e) Subject to adjustment under Section 6.1, the maximum number of Shares subject to Awards granted during a single fiscal\nyear of the Company to any non-employee member of the Board, taken together with any cash fees paid to such non-\nemployee member of the Board during the fiscal year, shall not, in each case, exceed $1,000,000 in total value (calculating\nthe value of any stock-based Award based on the grant date fair value of such Award for financial reporting purposes).\n2. Options and SARs\n2.1. Options.\n(a) An Option is a grant of a right to purchase Shares at an exercise price established by the Compensation Committee,\nsubject to Section 2.3. Options granted under this Section 2 may be either Incentive Stock Options (“ISO”) or\nNonstatutory Stock Options (“NSO”), as determined in the discretion of the Compensation Committee.\n(b) Each Option shall be designated in the written option agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a\nNonstatutory Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designations, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market\nValue of the Shares with respect to which Options designated as Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the\nfirst time by any Optionee during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary)\nexceeds $100,000, such excess Options shall be automatically treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes\nof this paragraph 2.1(b), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted,\nand the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares shall be determined as of the original date on which the Option\nis granted. In the event that the Code or the regulations promulgated thereunder are amended after the date the\n2002 Stock Plan becomes effective to provide for a different limit on the Fair Market Value of Shares permitted to be\nsubject to Incentive Stock Options, then such different limit will be automatically incorporated herein and will apply to\nany Options granted after the effective date of such amendment.\n(c) The term of each Option shall be the term stated in the Award Agreement; provided, however, that in the case of any\nIncentive Stock Option, the term shall be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant thereof or such shorter\nterm as may be provided in the Award Agreement. However, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to\nan Optionee who, at the time the Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the\nvoting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Option shall be five\n(5) years from the date of grant thereof or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement.\n(d) The date of grant of an Option shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the Compensation Committee makes the\ndetermination granting such Option, or such other future date as is determined by the Compensation Committee.\nNotice of the determination shall be given to each Participant to whom an Option is so granted within a reasonable\ntime after the date of such grant.\n2.2. Stock Appreciation Rights. A Stock Appreciation Right (“SAR”) is a grant of rights to receive, in cash or Stock (as\ndetermined by the Compensation Committee), value equal to (or otherwise based on) the excess of: (a) the Fair Market\nValue of a specified number of Shares at the time of exercise; over (b) a base appreciation amount established by the\nCompensation Committee, subject to Section 2.3.\n2.3. Exercise Price. The exercise price or base appreciation amount (as applicable) of each Option and SAR shall be\nestablished by the Compensation Committee or shall be determined by a method established by the Compensation\nCommittee at the time the Option or SAR is granted; provided, that:\n(a) In the case of an ISO,\n(i) granted to an employee who, at the time of the grant of such Incentive Stock Option, owns stock representing more\nthan ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the\nper Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant;\n(ii) granted to any other employee, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value\nper Share on the date of grant.\n(b) In the case of a NSO, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on\nthe date of grant.\n(c) In the case of a SAR, the base appreciation amount shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share\non the date of grant.\n2024 Proxy Statement A-2\nAppendix A: Franklin Resources, Inc. 2002 Universal Stock Incentive Plan\n2.4.

To the extent that Optionee was not entitled to exercise the Option at the date of such termination,\nor if Optionee does not exercise such Option to the extent so entitled within the time specified herein, the Option shall\nterminate.\n(b) Disability of Optionee. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2.4(a) above, in the event of termination of an\nOptionee’s Service as a result of Optionee’s Disability, Optionee (or Optionee’s legal representative) may, but only\nwithin six (6) months from the date of such termination (unless such other period is set out by a Committee in the\nAward Agreement, which period shall control, but in no event later than the expiration date of the term of such Option\nas set forth in the Award Agreement), exercise the Option to the extent otherwise entitled to exercise it at the date of\nsuch termination.

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2.4(a) above, in the event of the death of an\nOptionee, the Option may be exercised, at any time within twelve (12) months following the date of death (unless\nsuch other period is set out by a Committee in the Award Agreement, which period shall control, but in no event later\nthan the expiration date of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement), by the Optionee’s estate\nor by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent the\nOptionee was entitled to exercise the Option at the date of death.

Tax Withholding. All distributions under the 2002 Stock Plan are subject to withholding of all applicable taxes, and a\nCommittee may condition the delivery of any Shares or other benefits under the 2002 Stock Plan on satisfaction of the\napplicable withholding obligations. A Committee, in its discretion, and subject to such requirements as such Committee\nmay impose prior to the occurrence of such withholding, may permit such withholding obligations to be satisfied through\n(i) cash payment by the Participant, (ii) the surrender of Shares which the Participant already owns (which have been\nheld by the Participant and vested for at least six (6) months or such other period as established from time to time by\nthe Committee in order to avoid an adverse accounting treatment under applicable accounting standards), or (iii) the\nsurrender of Shares to which the Participant is otherwise entitled under the 2002 Stock Plan, provided, however, that\nonly the number of Shares sufficient to satisfy the Company’s minimum statutorily required tax withholding obligations\nshall be surrendered to the Company.

Any such settlements, and any such crediting of dividends or dividend equivalents or reinvestment in\nShares, may be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as a Committee shall establish, including the\nreinvestment of such credited amounts in Stock equivalents.\n4.7. Payments. Awards may be settled through cash payments, the delivery of Shares, the granting of replacement Awards\n(subject to Section 5.2(e)), or combination thereof as a Committee shall determine.

Any attempt to sell, assign, convey, hypothecate, encumber, anticipate, transfer, or\notherwise dispose of any Award under the 2002 Stock Plan in violation of this Section 4.8 shall be void, and no Shares or\ncash subject to any Award shall, prior to receipt thereof by a Participant, be in any manner subject to the debts, contracts,\nliabilities, engagements, or torts of such Participant.\n4.9. Agreement With Company. An Award under the 2002 Stock Plan shall be subject to such terms and conditions, not\ninconsistent with the 2002 Stock Plan, as a Committee shall, in its sole discretion, prescribe. The terms and conditions\nof any Award to any Participant shall be reflected in an Award Agreement, a copy of which shall be provided to the\nParticipant, and a Committee may, but need not require that the Participant shall sign a copy of such Award Agreement.\n4.10.

Such statements are provided under the “safe harbor” protection of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts and generally can be identified by words or phrases written in the future tense and/or preceded by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “depends,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “likely,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “preliminary,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would,” or other - similar words or variations thereof, or the negative thereof, but these terms are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. \n\nForward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including market and volatility risks, investment performance and reputational risks, global operational risks, competition and distribution risks, third-party risks, technology and security risks, human capital risks, cash management risks, and legal and regulatory risks.

Against this backdrop, we reached record AUM of $1.68 trillion and saw a 25% increase from the prior year in long-term inflows to $319 billion. Long-term net outflows were $32.6 billion, including $20.7 billion of reinvested distributions. Excluding Western Asset Management, our long-term net inflows were $16.0 billion. \n\n“During the fiscal year, we continued to increase our presence in our key focus areas which reflect areas of long-term client demand. Client interest in alternative and multi-asset investment strategies generated positive flows for the year. Private markets fundraising totaled $14.8 billion with flagship funds in secondary private equity and alternative credit exceeding fund targets. We saw strong growth across a broad range of investment vehicles with retail SMA, ETF and Canvas ® AUM increasing by 29%, 89% and 94% year-over-year, respectively – all to record highs. From a regional perspective, our international business continued to be a strength of the firm and experienced positive long-term net flows for the year, culminating in over $500 billion in AUM. \n\n“Our acquisition of Putnam Investments has exceeded our expectations. Since closing on January 1, Putnam’s AUM has grown 21% to $180 billion and Franklin Templeton has generated positive net flows of approximately $11 billion in Putnam strategies, benefiting from our global distribution platform. The transaction has also exceeded our annual run-rate cost savings target of $150 million. We have returned $946 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. \n\n“We remain committed to our vision of building innovative and collaborative relationships with our clients and look forward to unlocking new opportunities that reflect the high standards that have defined Franklin Templeton as a trusted partner over 75 years. I would like to thank our employees around the world for their dedication and commitment to always putting our clients first.” \n\n**Quarter Ended** |  **% Change** |  **Quarter Ended** |  **% Change** |  **Fiscal Year Ended September 30,**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**30-Sep-24** |  **30-Jun-24** |  **Qtr. vs. Qtr.** |  **30-Sep-23** |  **Year vs. Year** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **% Change**  \n**Financial Results**  \n_(in millions, except per share data)_  \nOperating revenues  |  $  |  2,211.2  |  $  |  2,122.9  |  4  |  %  |  $  |  1,986.1  |  11  |  %  |  $  |  8,478.0  |  $  |  7,849.4  |  8  |  %   \nOperating income (loss)  |  (150.7  |  )  |  222.5  |  NM  |  338.3  |  NM  |  407.6  |  1,102.3  |  (63  |  %)   \nOperating margin  |  (6.8  |  %)  |  10.5  |  %  |  17.0  |  %  |  4.8  |  %  |  14.0  |  %   \nNet income (loss)¹  |  $  |  (84.7  |  )  |  $  |  174.0  |  NM  |  $  |  295.5  |  NM  |  $  |  464.8  |  $  |  882.8  |  (47  |  %)   \nDiluted earnings (loss) per share  |  (0.19  |  )  |  0.32  |  NM  |  0.58  |  NM  |  0.85  |  1.72  |  (51  |  %)   \nAs adjusted (non-GAAP): 2  \nAdjusted operating income  |  $  |  451.6  |  $  |  424.9  |  6  |  %  |  $  |  511.7  |  (12  |  %)  |  $  |  1,713.1  |  $  |  1,823.8  |  (6  |  %)   \nAdjusted operating margin  |  26.3  |  %  |  25.7  |  %  |  32.4  |  %  |  26.1  |  %  |  29.9  |  %   \nAdjusted net income  |  $  |  315.2  |  $  |  326.4  |  (3  |  %)  |  $  |  427.0  |  (26  |  %)  |  $  |  1,276.7  |  $  |  1,332.2  |  (4  |  %)   \nAdjusted diluted earnings per share  |  0.59  |  0.60  |  (2  |  %)  |  0.84  |  (30  |  %)  |  2.39  |  2.60  |  (8  |  %)   \n**Assets Under Management**  \n_(in billions)_  \nEnding  |  $  |  1,678.6  |  $  |  1,646.6  |  2  |  %  |  $  |  1,374.2  |  22  |  %  |  $  |  1,678.6  |  $  |  1,374.2  |  22  |  %   \nAverage 3 |  1,667.5  |  1,632.6  |  2  |  %  |  1,419.1  |  18  |  %  |  1,565.8  |  1,400.4  |  12  |  %   \nLong-term net flows  |  (31.3  |  )  |  (3.2  |  )  |  (6.9  |  )  |  (32.6  |  )  |  (21.3  |  )   \n  \nTotal assets under management (“AUM”) were $1,678.6 billion at September 30, 2024, up $32.0 billion or 2% during the quarter due to the positive impact of $63.5 billion of net market change, distributions, and other, partially offset by $31.3 billion of long-term net outflows, inclusive of $37.0 billion of long-term net outflows at Western Asset Management, and $0.2 billion of cash management net outflows.

Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful indicators of our financial performance and may be helpful to investors in evaluating our relative performance against industry peers. \n\n“Adjusted operating income,” “adjusted operating margin,” “adjusted net income” and “adjusted diluted earnings per share” are defined below, followed by reconciliations of operating income (loss), operating margin, net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. and diluted earnings per share on a U.S. GAAP basis to these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, any financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these non-GAAP measures if deemed appropriate. \n\n**_Adjusted Operating Income_ **\n\nWe define adjusted operating income as operating income (loss) adjusted to exclude the following: \n\n  * Elimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products. \n  * Acquisition-related items: \n    * Acquisition-related retention compensation. \n    * Other acquisition-related expenses including professional fees, technology costs and fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration assets and liabilities. \n    * Amortization of intangible assets. \n    * Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, if any. \n  * Special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to past acquisitions and certain initiatives undertaken by the Company. \n  * Impact on compensation and benefits expense from gains and losses on investments related to deferred compensation plans, which is offset in investment and other income (losses), net. \n  * Impact on compensation and benefits expense related to minority interests in certain subsidiaries, which is offset in net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests. \n\n\n\n**_Adjusted Operating Margin_ **\n\nWe calculate adjusted operating margin as adjusted operating income divided by adjusted operating revenues. We define adjusted operating revenues as operating revenues adjusted to exclude the following: \n\n  * Elimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products. \n  * Acquisition-related performance-based investment management fees which are passed through as compensation and benefits expense. \n  * Sales and distribution fees and a portion of investment management fees allocated to cover sales, distribution and marketing expenses paid to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our funds on our behalf. \n\n\n\n**_Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share_ **\n\nWe define adjusted net income as net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. adjusted to exclude the following: \n\n  * Activities of CIPs. \n  * Acquisition-related items: \n    * Acquisition-related retention compensation. \n    * Other acquisition-related expenses including professional fees, technology costs and fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration assets and liabilities. \n    * Amortization of intangible assets. \n    * Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, if any. \n    * Write off of noncontrolling interests related to the wind down of an acquired business. \n    * Interest expense for amortization of Legg Mason debt premium from acquisition-date fair value adjustment. \n  * Special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to past acquisitions and certain initiatives undertaken by the Company. \n  * Net gains or losses on investments related to deferred compensation plans which are not offset by compensation and benefits expense. \n  * Net compensation and benefits expense related to minority interests in certain subsidiaries not offset by net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests. \n  * Unrealized investment gains and losses. \n  * Net income tax expense of the above adjustments based on the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. \n\n\n\nWe define adjusted diluted earnings per share as diluted earnings per share adjusted to exclude the per share impacts of the adjustments applied to net income in calculating adjusted net income. \n\nIn calculating our non-GAAP measures, we adjust for the impact of CIPs because it is not considered reflective of our underlying results of operations. Acquisition-related items and special termination benefits are excluded to facilitate comparability to other asset management firms. We adjust for compensation and benefits expense related to funded deferred compensation plans because it is partially offset in other income (expense), net. We adjust for compensation and benefits expense and net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests to reflect the economics of certain profits interest arrangements. Sales and distribution fees and a portion of investment management fees generally cover sales, distribution and marketing expenses and, therefore, are excluded from adjusted operating revenues. In addition, when calculating adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share we exclude unrealized investment gains and losses included in investment and other income (losses) because the related investments are generally expected to be held long term. \n\nThe calculations of adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are as follows: \n\n_(in millions)_ |  **Three Months Ended** |  **Twelve Months Ended**  \n---|---|---  \n**30-Sep-24** |  **30-Jun-24** |  **30-Sep-23** |  **30-Sep-24** |  **30-Sep-23**

Net income (loss) represents net income (loss) attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. \n  2. “Adjusted net income,” “adjusted diluted earnings per share,” “adjusted operating income” and “adjusted operating margin” are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles. See “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for definitions and reconciliations of these measures. \n  3. Average AUM represents monthly average AUM. \n  4. Includes our direct investments in CIPs of $1.1 billion, approximately $355 million of employee-owned and other third-party investments made through partnerships, approximately $289 million of investments that are subject to long-term repurchase agreements and other net financing arrangements, and approximately $441 million of cash and investments related to deferred compensation plans. \n  5. During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company identified that it did not eliminate the investment income from certain consolidated limited partnerships for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, resulting in offsetting adjustments to investment and other income, net and net income attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interest. For comparability, the Company has revised the comparative prior period amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Income. There was no impact to operating income, net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. or earnings per share. \n  6. Net market change, distributions and other includes appreciation (depreciation), distributions to investors that represent return on investments and return of capital, and foreign exchange revaluation. \n  7. India region is included in Europe, Middle East and Africa. \n\n\n\nFranklin Resources, Inc.

Such statements are provided under the “safe harbor” protection of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts and generally can be identified by words or phrases written in the future tense and/or preceded by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “depends,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “likely,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would,” or other similar words or variations thereof, or the negative thereof, but these terms are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. \n\nForward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including market and volatility risks, investment performance and reputational risks, global operational risks, competition and distribution risks, third-party risks, technology and security risks, human capital risks, cash management risks, and legal and regulatory risks. While forward-looking statements are our best prediction at the time that they are made, you should not rely on them and are cautioned against doing so. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other possible future conditions.

Stephan will partner with the firm's distribution leaders around the world to help drive the overall distribution strategy in addition to advisor education for the alternative investments business in the private wealth channel. \n\nFranklin Templeton is now one of the largest managers in alternative assets globally, amounting to approximately 16% (US$264 billion) of the firm’s $1.65 trillion in assets under management as of June 30, 2024. Its specialist investment managers, each with deep domain expertise, provide a diverse range of alternative asset capabilities including private credit and real estate debt from Benefit Street Partners-Alcentra, real estate equity from Clarion Partners, secondary private equity and co-investments from Lexington Partners, hedged strategies from Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions and pre-IPO growth equity investments from Franklin Venture Partners. \n\n“With more than 40 years of experience in alternatives and 382 alternative investment professionals around the world, we have been deliberate about building our capabilities in multiple ways – through acquisitions of specialists like Benefit Street Partners, Lexington and Clarion and by onboarding our offerings to key advisor platforms to make them more accessible to investors,” Spector said. “The result is that Franklin Templeton is one of the few traditional asset managers to build a successful alternatives business spread across a broad range of strategies and geographies.” \n\nStephan previously spent five years at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR), as the Head of Strategy and Business Development for the firm’s Global Client Solutions business. Before that, he was Chief Operating Officer and Head of Investor Relations for KKR’s Global Wealth Solutions business in the Americas. Prior to joining KKR, Stephan spent nine years at Morgan Stanley’s wealth management division. \n\nStephan holds a B.S. in finance and an MBA from Wagner College.
