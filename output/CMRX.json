This analysis demonstrates an overall response rate of 28.0%, a median time to response of 4.6 months plus a median duration of response of 10.4 months,” said Allen Melemed, MD, Chief Medical Officer at Chimerix. We expect to include the updated RANO 2.0 results in our planned upcoming New Drug Application to Australian regulators.”\n\n“RANO 2.0 is a recently established response assessment criteria for gliomas that supersedes prior versions such as RANO-HGG and RANO-LGG. RANO 2.0 incorporates an integrated quantitative assessment of both enhancing and non-enhancing disease that were not adequately assessed by prior criteria. In addition, it includes minor responses, which in certain regions of the brain, such as midline structures, have disproportionate clinical benefit. This benefit often includes meaningful improvement in neurological symptoms and quality of life outcomes,” said Patrick Y. Wen, MD, Director of the Center for Neuro-Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.\n\nDetails for the RANO 2.0 presentation as well as other pipeline presentations at SNO are as follows:\n\n**Title** : Response by RANO 2.0 criteria in ONC201 (dordaviprone)-treated patients with recurrent H3 K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma**Abstract Code** : CTNI-54**Session Date and Time** : Friday, November 22, 2024, from 7:30-9:30 PM**Location** : The George R.

Additionally, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has granted orphan drug designation to dordaviprone, and we have alignment to file a New Drug Application (NDA) for Provisional Approval in Australia which we expect to occur in the coming months,” said Mike Andriole, Chief Executive Officer of Chimerix. “As we complete the dordaviprone NDA and look toward the balance of the year, we also expect to complete enrollment in a Phase 1 dose escalation study of ONC206 as we consider future development scenarios for this program.”\n\n“In addition, we were delighted to announce the promotion of Dr. Josh Allen to the role of Chief Scientific Officer this quarter. Josh has been instrumental in the discovery and development of the imipridone class of compounds and expect his broad expertise in cancer biology and strong business acumen will underpin Chimerix early phase development for years to come,” added Mr. Andriole.\n\n**Dordaviprone (ONC201)**\n\nDordaviprone, a first-in-class imipridone, has the potential to be the first treatment approved for H3 K27M-mutant diffuse glioma. It is an oral small molecule that crosses the blood-brain barrier and selectively binds to the mitochondrial protease ClpP and the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2). Dordaviprone's unique mechanism of action includes alterations of key epigenetic modifications such as reversal of H3 K27me3-loss which is the hallmark of H3 K27M-mutant gliomas.\n\nDordaviprone is being evaluated in the Phase 3 ACTION trial that is currently enrolling H3 K27M-mutant diffuse glioma patients at over 145 sites in 15 countries. Chimerix expects interim OS data in the third quarter of 2025. For more information on the ACTION trial, please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov\n\nEarlier this year, Chimerix initiated the evaluation process for dordaviprone to be considered for Provisional Registration in Australia. The Provisional Registration process is a three-step process which begins with a Pre-Submission Meeting evaluating current data, as well as other program features, including the status of pivotal studies. The second step, the Provisional Determination Application, was approved during the third quarter 2024, as was the application for Orphan Drug Designation in Australia. The final step is the NDA submission for Provisional Registration which is expected to occur in the coming months with potential commercial availability as soon as year-end 2025.\n\n**ONC206**\n\nThe imipridone ONC206 is a second generation ClpP agonist and DRD2 antagonist which also crosses the blood-brain barrier and is 10x more potent in vitro than dordaviprone. It has demonstrated monotherapy anti-cancer activity in vivo in central nervous system (CNS) tumor models, as well as in vivo solid tumors models outside of the CNS. The two Phase 1 dose escalation trials conducted in partnership with the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have enrolled over 80 pediatric and adult patients with unselected CNS tumors, with no dose limiting toxicity observed to date.\n\nThe safety profile of ONC206 has been consistent across both pediatric and adult populations, with the majority of treatment-related adverse events being mild to moderate, including fatigue, lymphocyte count decrease and vomiting. No significant change in the overall safety profile has been reported to date as dosing has escalated and intensified in frequency from once per week to twice per day on three consecutive days per week. Completion of enrollment in the remaining dose escalation cohorts is expected to occur in 2024.\n\nAssessment of objective responses in patients where a monotherapy treatment effect can be reliably evaluated is ongoing in dose cohorts at or above target exposure thresholds. The company expects to assess any objective responses in the first half of 2025, allowing sufficient time for response onset and confirmation in current and future dose cohorts.\n\nAdditionally, ONC206 nonclinical studies remain ongoing to identify candidate oncology indications and biomarkers to inform future development plans.\n\n**Corporate**\n\nIn September 2024, Chimerix promoted Joshua E. Allen, PhD, to the role of Chief Scientific Officer after previously serving as Chief Technology Officer. Dr. Allen co-discovered the anti-cancer activity of ONC201 and co-invented the imipridone class of compounds. He has continuously advanced the research and development of dordaviprone from academic discovery to its registration program, along with the creation and clinical introduction of biologically distinct derivatives. He received his Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics from the University of Pennsylvania. Several research publications, patents, grants, and awards reflect his scientific and entrepreneurial efforts in oncology, including recognition on the Forbes 30 under 30 list. Prior to joining Chimerix, Dr. Allen served as Chief Scientific Officer at Oncoceutics.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nChimerix reported a net loss of $22.9 million, or $0.26 per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024. During the same period in 2023, Chimerix recorded a net loss of $24.0 million, or $0.27 per basic and diluted share.\n\nResearch and development expenses increased to $19.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $17.4 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased to $5.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $9.3 million for the same period in 2023. This decrease is due to a one-time non-cash expense related to historical equity grants recognized during the 2023 period.\n\nChimerix’s balance sheet at September 30, 2024 included $152.4 million of capital available to fund operations, approximately 89.9 million outstanding shares of common stock and no outstanding debt.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nChimerix will host a conference call and live audio webcast to discuss third quarter 2024 financial results and provide a business update today at 8:30 a.m. ET.
