These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for commissions and fees, net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Baldwin, diluted earnings (loss) per share, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies in our industry may define or calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, and accordingly, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. \n\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, change in fair value of contingent consideration and certain items of income and expense, including share-based compensation expense, transaction-related Partnership and integration expenses, severance, and certain non-recurring items, including those related to raising capital. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of income and expenses that do not relate to business performance, and that the presentation of this measure enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin is a key metric used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance. We believe that adjusted EBITDA margin is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of income and expenses that do not relate to business performance, and that the presentation of this measure enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance. We believe that adjusted EBITDA margin is helpful in measuring profitability of operations on a consolidated level. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin have important limitations as analytical tools. For example, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin: \n\n  * do not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; \n\n\n  * do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n\n\n  * do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; \n\n\n  * do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; \n\n\n  * do not reflect share-based compensation expense and other non-cash charges; and \n\n\n  * exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us. \n\n\n\nWe calculate organic revenue based on commissions and fees for the relevant period by excluding (i) the first twelve months of commissions and fees generated from new Partners and (ii) commissions and fees from divestitures. Organic revenue growth is the change in organic revenue period-to-period, with prior period results adjusted to (i) include commissions and fees that were excluded from organic revenue in the prior period because the relevant Partners had not yet reached the twelve-month owned mark, but which have reached the twelve-month owned mark in the current period, and (ii) exclude commissions and fees related to divestitures from organic revenue. For example, commissions and fees from a Partner acquired on June 1, 2023 are excluded from organic revenue for 2023. However, after June 1, 2024, results from June 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 for such Partners are compared to results from June 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 for purposes of calculating organic revenue growth in 2024. Organic revenue growth is a key metric used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance. We believe that organic revenue and organic revenue growth are appropriate measures of operating performance as they allow investors to measure, analyze and compare growth in a meaningful and consistent manner. \n\nWe define adjusted net income as net income (loss) attributable to Baldwin adjusted for depreciation, amortization, change in fair value of contingent consideration and certain items of income and expense, including share-based compensation expense, transaction-related Partnership and integration expenses, severance, and certain non-recurring costs that, in the opinion of management, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results, and the related tax effect of those adjustments. We believe that adjusted net income is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of income and expenses that do not relate to business performance. \n\nAdjusted diluted EPS measures our per share earnings excluding certain expenses as discussed above for adjusted net income and assuming all shares of Class B common stock were exchanged for Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated as adjusted net income divided by adjusted diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. We believe adjusted diluted EPS is useful to investors because it enables them to better evaluate per share operating performance across reporting periods. \n\nThe pro forma information presented herein removes the effects of 2024 divestitures for all periods in 2024 and 2023 as if the divestitures had occurred on January 1, 2024 and January 1, 2023, respectively. Pro forma revenue reflects GAAP revenues less revenue derived from business divestitures that occurred during 2024. \n\nPro forma net income (loss) reflects GAAP net income (loss) less net income derived from business divestitures that occurred during 2024, including the gain on divestitures. We define Pro forma adjusted EBITDA as pro forma net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, change in fair value of contingent consideration and certain items of income and expense, including share-based compensation expense, transaction-related Partnership and integration expenses, severance, and certain non-recurring costs, including those related to raising capital, after removing the effect of divestitures that occurred during 2024. We believe that pro forma adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of income and expenses that do not relate to ongoing business performance, and that the presentation of this measure enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance. \n\nPro forma adjusted EBITDA margin is pro forma adjusted EBITDA divided by pro forma revenue. Pro forma adjusted EBITDA margin is a key metric used by management and our board of directors to assess our ongoing business financial performance. We believe that pro forma adjusted EBITDA margin is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of expenses that do not relate to ongoing business performance, and that the presentation of this measure enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance. We believe that pro forma adjusted EBITDA margin is helpful in measuring profitability of operations on a consolidated level. \n\nWe calculate adjusted free cash flow because we hold fiduciary cash designated for our Insurance Company Partners on behalf of our Clients and incur substantial earnout liabilities in conjunction with our Partnership strategy. Adjusted free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities excluding the impact of: (i) the change in premiums, commissions and fees receivable, net; (ii) the change in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities; and (iii) the payment of contingent earnout consideration in excess of purchase price accrual. We believe that adjusted free cash flow is an important financial measure for use in evaluating financial performance because it measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations. \n\nReconciliation of guidance regarding adjusted EBITDA, organic revenue growth, adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted free cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity, and low visibility with respect to commissions and fees, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company is currently unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the type and extent of items that would be expected to impact these GAAP financial measures for these periods. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the non-GAAP measures. \n\n**Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin**\n\nThe following table reconciles adjusted EBITDA and adjusted
