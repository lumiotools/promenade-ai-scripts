Growth was driven by increased volume, higher average selling price and increased used vehicle sales versus a year ago.\n  * Gross profit increased significantly to $2.2 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $1.2 million in the same year-ago quarter\n  * Gross margin was essentially flat at 31.8% in the second quarter of 2024, compared to 31.8% in the same year-ago quarter\n  * Net loss was ($0.9) million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to net income of $36,000 in same year-ago quarter\n  * Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) improved $0.4 million to $0.4 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $9,000 in the same year-ago quarter\n  * Subsequent to quarter end, classic Toyota FJs were added to the Company's product lineup through a licensing agreement with Black Dog Trading.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n\"ECD continues to see strong growth as we push through with our ambitious plans to be the preferred partner in the classic luxury automotive market. Progress along our growth plan was evidenced by our 129% increase in revenues to a record $8.9 million and strong gross margins of 31.8% during the second quarter, which is among industry leaders like Ferrari and other luxury auto brands,\" stated Scott Wallace, CEO & Founder of ECD. Mr. Wallace continued, \"As we move ahead, we will continue scaling our existing footprint to maximize the business model, while also looking at growth opportunities in the larger classic car ecosystem. In 2024, we have expanded our classic car product line through the acquisition of assets of 'Brand New Muscle Car', adding classic Mustangs, and a licensing agreement with 'Black Dog Trading', which added classic Toyota FJs. We also continue to enhance our brand through strategic partnerships like our new collaboration with Turtleback Trailers. Not only are these opportunities important to our growth plans, but they provide us the ability to maximize our existing footprint and scale in a capital efficient manner.\"\n\n**Full Year 2024 Guidance**\n\nThe Company is reaffirming their guidance and expects 2024 revenue to be $33.0 million, representing an increase of approximately 108% when compared to revenue of $15.1 million in 2023.\n\n**Financial Results**\n\nRevenue increased 129% to a record $8.9 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $3.9 million in the second quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due increased volume, higher average selling price and increased used vehicle sales versus a year ago.\n\nSecond quarter 2024 gross profit increased significantly to $2.8 million, or 31.8% of revenue, compared to $1.2 million, or 31.8% or revenue in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nOperating expenses were $2.7 million in the second quarter 2024, compared to $1.2 million in the second quarter 2023. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses related to the ongoing costs of being a public company.\n\nOperating Income improved to $0.1 million, compared to an operating loss of ($19,000) in the second quarter of 2023. The improvement was primarily due to a higher average selling price per vehicle and efficiencies in the build process.\n\nNet loss for the second quarter 2024 was ($0.9 million), or $(0.03) per diluted share, compared to net income of $36,000, or $(0.00) per diluted share in the second quarter of 2023. The change in net loss was primarily the result of interest expense affiliated with a convertible note.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA improved $0.4 million to $0.4 million in the second quarter 2024, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $0.0 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nCash and equivalents on June 30, 2024 were $5.6 million, as compared to $8.1 million on December 31, 2023.\n\n**Earnings Call and Webcast**\n\nManagement will host the conference call, followed by a question and answer session.\n\nDate: Monday, August 19, 2024Time: 4:30 PM Eastern Time (1:30 PM Pacific Time)U.S. dial-in number: 877-270-2148International number: 412-902-6510Webcast: [2Q24 Webcast Link](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tvIh29lzWJin39m6TOR6wbCBDTeEmIWlaFOkiV7ADcse91OXw0XfTAjBp-iW5MaXtdwKu8Xbt6NH_zWVbVc3DGwrzE6NZrxIl5sI-2XYBIV8uJABBPt7OZS-RyAYl5nTJk6MgnMGiERgiq3ceqIJ8_jqwPWnNxSP_B6U_kK2HLs=)\n\nThe Company will also provide a link at [https://ecdautodesign.com/ecd-investors/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Bp8XJdG-6G2LYrki8PHgof6oEZu6osVuarr_e9Dr0cqLCUAgXx-yZJ6wgKxqo8ju3WpfoRkKmMa0g-mexrFNaIwQMfn74pI-YsEaUceYLxYogvzRv96gaiZm7N8hPmpZhmvBB20GBcJlAtc1fJvuwA==) for those who wish to stream the call via webcast.

Currently, ECD restores Land Rovers Defenders, Land Rover Series IIA, the Range Rover Classic, the Jaguar E-Type and we have recently added Ford Mustang and Toyota FJ. Historically, each vehicle produced by ECD was fully bespoke, a one-off that is designed by the client through an immersive luxury design experience and hand-built from the ground up in 2,200 hours by master-certified Automotive Service Excellence (\"ASE\") craftsmen. The company was founded in 2013 by three British \"gear heads\" whose passion for classic vehicles is the driving force behind exceptionally high standards for quality, custom luxury vehicles. ECD's global headquarters, known as the \"Rover Dome,\" is a 100,000-square-foot facility located in Kissimmee, Florida that is home to 90 talented craftsmen and technicians, who hold a combined 61 ASE and five master level certifications. ECD has an affiliated logistics center in the U.K. where its seven employees work to source and transport 25-year-old work vehicles back to the U.S. for restoration.

In accordance with SEC Regulation G, the non-GAAP measurements in this press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measurement, which can be viewed under the heading \"Reconciliation of Net Income (loss) from Operations to EBITDA\" in the financial tables included in this press release.\n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release includes express or implied statements that are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act.

Progress along our growth plan was evidenced by our 129% increase in revenues to a record $8.9 million and strong gross margins of 31.8% during the second quarter, which is among industry leaders like Ferrari and other luxury auto brands,\" stated Scott Wallace, CEO & Founder of ECD. Mr. Wallace continued, \"As we move ahead, we will continue scaling our existing footprint to maximize the business model, while also looking at growth opportunities in the larger classic car ecosystem. In 2024, we have expanded our classic car product line through the acquisition of assets of 'Brand New Muscle Car', adding classic Mustangs, and a licensing agreement with 'Black Dog Trading', which added classic Toyota FJs. We also continue to enhance our brand through strategic partnerships like our new collaboration with Turtleback Trailers. Not only are these opportunities important to our growth plans, but they provide us the ability to maximize our existing footprint and scale in a capital efficient manner.\"\n\n**Full Year 2024 Guidance**\n\nThe Company is reaffirming their guidance and expects 2024 revenue to be $33.0 million, representing an increase of approximately 108% when compared to revenue of $15.1 million in 2023.\n\n**Financial Results**\n\nRevenue increased 129% to a record $8.9 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $3.9 million in the second quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due increased volume, higher average selling price and increased used vehicle sales versus a year ago.\n\nSecond quarter 2024 gross profit increased significantly to $2.8 million, or 31.8% of revenue, compared to $1.2 million, or 31.8% or revenue in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nOperating expenses were $2.7 million in the second quarter 2024, compared to $1.2 million in the second quarter 2023. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses related to the ongoing costs of being a public company.\n\nOperating Income improved to $0.1 million, compared to an operating loss of ($19,000) in the second quarter of 2023. The improvement was primarily due to a higher average selling price per vehicle and efficiencies in the build process.\n\nNet loss for the second quarter 2024 was ($0.9 million), or $(0.03) per diluted share, compared to net income of $36,000, or $(0.00) per diluted share in the second quarter of 2023. The change in net loss was primarily the result of interest expense affiliated with a convertible note.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA improved $0.4 million to $0.4 million in the second quarter 2024, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $0.0 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nCash and equivalents on June 30, 2024 were $5.6 million, as compared to $8.1 million on December 31, 2023.\n\n**Earnings Call and Webcast**\n\nManagement will host the conference call, followed by a question and answer session.\n\nDate: Monday, August 19, 2024Time: 4:30 PM Eastern Time (1:30 PM Pacific Time)U.S. dial-in number: 877-270-2148International number: 412-902-6510Webcast: [2Q24 Webcast Link](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tvIh29lzWJin39m6TOR6wbCBDTeEmIWlaFOkiV7ADcse91OXw0XfTAjBp-iW5MaXtdwKu8Xbt6NH_zWVbVc3DGwrzE6NZrxIl5sI-2XYBIV8uJABBPt7OZS-RyAYl5nTJk6MgnMGiERgiq3ceqIJ8_jqwPWnNxSP_B6U_kK2HLs=)\n\nThe Company will also provide a link at [https://ecdautodesign.com/ecd-investors/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Bp8XJdG-6G2LYrki8PHgof6oEZu6osVuarr_e9Dr0cqLCUAgXx-yZJ6wgKxqo8ju3WpfoRkKmMa0g-mexrFNaIwQMfn74pI-YsEaUceYLxYogvzRv96gaiZm7N8hPmpZhmvBB20GBcJlAtc1fJvuwA==) for those who wish to stream the call via webcast.

In accordance with SEC Regulation G, the non-GAAP measurements in this press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measurement, which can be viewed under the heading \"Reconciliation of Net Income (loss) from Operations to EBITDA\" in the financial tables included in this press release.\n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release includes express or implied statements that are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act.

Progress along our growth plan was evidenced by our 129% increase in revenues to a record $8.9 million and strong gross margins of 31.8% during the second quarter, which is among industry leaders like Ferrari and other luxury auto brands,\" stated Scott Wallace, CEO & Founder of ECD. Mr. Wallace continued, \"As we move ahead, we will continue scaling our existing footprint to maximize the business model, while also looking at growth opportunities in the larger classic car ecosystem. In 2024, we have expanded our classic car product line through the acquisition of assets of 'Brand New Muscle Car', adding classic Mustangs, and a licensing agreement with 'Black Dog Trading', which added classic Toyota FJs. We also continue to enhance our brand through strategic partnerships like our new collaboration with Turtleback Trailers. Not only are these opportunities important to our growth plans, but they provide us the ability to maximize our existing footprint and scale in a capital efficient manner.\"\n\n**Full Year 2024 Guidance**\n\nThe Company is reaffirming their guidance and expects 2024 revenue to be $33.0 million, representing an increase of approximately 108% when compared to revenue of $15.1 million in 2023.\n\n**Financial Results**\n\nRevenue increased 129% to a record $8.9 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $3.9 million in the second quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due increased volume, higher average selling price and increased used vehicle sales versus a year ago.\n\nSecond quarter 2024 gross profit increased significantly to $2.8 million, or 31.8% of revenue, compared to $1.2 million, or 31.8% or revenue in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nOperating expenses were $2.7 million in the second quarter 2024, compared to $1.2 million in the second quarter 2023. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses related to the ongoing costs of being a public company.\n\nOperating Income improved to $0.1 million, compared to an operating loss of ($19,000) in the second quarter of 2023. The improvement was primarily due to a higher average selling price per vehicle and efficiencies in the build process.\n\nNet loss for the second quarter 2024 was ($0.9 million), or $(0.03) per diluted share, compared to net income of $36,000, or $(0.00) per diluted share in the second quarter of 2023. The change in net loss was primarily the result of interest expense affiliated with a convertible note.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA improved $0.4 million to $0.4 million in the second quarter 2024, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $0.0 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nCash and equivalents on June 30, 2024 were $5.6 million, as compared to $8.1 million on December 31, 2023.\n\n**Earnings Call and Webcast**\n\nManagement will host the conference call, followed by a question and answer session.\n\nDate: Monday, August 19, 2024Time: 4:30 PM Eastern Time (1:30 PM Pacific Time)U.S. dial-in number: 877-270-2148International number: 412-902-6510Webcast: [2Q24 Webcast Link](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tvIh29lzWJin39m6TOR6wbCBDTeEmIWlaFOkiV7ADcse91OXw0XfTAjBp-iW5MaXtdwKu8Xbt6NH_zWVbVc3DGwrzE6NZrxIl5sI-2XYBIV8uJABBPt7OZS-RyAYl5nTJk6MgnMGiERgiq3ceqIJ8_jqwPWnNxSP_B6U_kK2HLs=)\n\nThe Company will also provide a link at [https://ecdautodesign.com/ecd-investors/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Bp8XJdG-6G2LYrki8PHgof6oEZu6osVuarr_e9Dr0cqLCUAgXx-yZJ6wgKxqo8ju3WpfoRkKmMa0g-mexrFNaIwQMfn74pI-YsEaUceYLxYogvzRv96gaiZm7N8hPmpZhmvBB20GBcJlAtc1fJvuwA==) for those who wish to stream the call via webcast.

reveal a new product targeted for the coastal and beach luxury lifestyle enthusiast._\n\nKISSIMMEE, Fla., Feb. 13, 2024 -- _[ECD Auto Design](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4089205-1&h=1194758025&u=https%3A%2F%2Fecdautodesign.com%2F&a=ECD+Auto+Design)_ (NASDAQ: ECDA), the world's largest Land Rover and Jaguar restoration company known for its custom luxury builds, including bespoke Defenders, Range Rovers and E-Types, today announces an upcoming exciting new LIFESTYLE product launch MEDIA EVENT to be held exclusively at the ECD Auto Design House in West Palm Beach, Florida. The event will be held from March 20 - 22, 2024 in parallel to the Palm Beach International Boat & Super Yacht show in Palm Beach, Florida. This is an ideal opportunity for luxury and automotive media outlets to test drive the new product as well as one-of-a-kind vehicles and meet the company owners. Due to the limited number of test drives available, please contact us if you would like to attend the event as soon as possible. Contact Mike Whittaker, ECD Public Relations Manager directly at [[email protected]. ](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5c31353f343d39302b1c393f383d29283338392f353b32723f333172)\n\n[ ![](https://cdn-bgncm.nitrocdn.com/RPZWrKUVUrzeBJKECFBqARdcrbBRhdqG/assets/images/optimized/rev-1e9bd66/mma.prnewswire.com/media/2326321/ECD_Auto_Black_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2326321/ECD_Auto_Black_Logo.html)\n\n\"The new vehicle is an exciting new launch for us\", said Scott Wallace, CEO of ECD Automotive Design. \"It will offer so much flexibility and cater to so many activities and we know that it will be a hit for luxury clients looking for weekend coastal retreats\".\n\nIt will be a very exciting new concept for ECD Auto Design for several reasons including its versatility features and the fact that it will be our first semi-volume build. This means that, as all of our other vehicles are bespoke, one-of-a-kind, this vehicle will be added to a steady production line, and we will have inventory. Semi-volume means that the client may either purchase the vehicle from inventory or choose to customize certain parts within the production process for a wait time.\n\nWe will be hosting the event in West Palm Beach, FL, offering test drives, access to our company owners and a full media kit at the event. We have intentionally scheduled this at the start of the International Boat and Mega Yacht show as well as Art Festival for those that want to cover that event as well.\n\n**About ECD Auto Design** ECD, a public company trading under ECDA on the Nasdaq, is a creator of restored luxury vehicles that combines classic English beauty with modern performance. Currently, ECD restores Land Rovers Defenders, Land Rover Series IIA, the Range Rover Classic and the Jaguar E-Type. Each vehicle produced by ECD is fully bespoke, a one-off that is designed by the client through an immersive luxury design experience and hand-built from the ground up in 2,200 hours by master-certified Automotive Service Excellence (\"ASE\") craftsmen. The company was founded in 2013 by three British \"gear heads' whose passion for classic vehicles is the driving force behind exceptionally high standards for quality, custom luxury vehicles. ECD's global headquarters, known as the \"Rover Dome,\" is a 100,000-square-foot facility located in Kissimmee, Florida that is home to 90 talented craftsmen and technicians, who hold a combined 61 ASE and five master level certifications. ECD has an affiliated logistics center in the U.K. where its seven employees work to source and transport 25-year-old work vehicles back to the U.S. for restoration.
