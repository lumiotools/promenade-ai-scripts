(Nasdaq: RIGL), a commercial stage biotechnology company focused on hematologic disorders and cancer, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, including sales of TAVALISSE® (fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate) for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP); REZLIDHIA® (olutasidenib) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory (R/R) mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (m _IDH1_) acute myeloid leukemia (AML); and GAVRETO® (pralsetinib) for the treatment of metastatic rearranged during transfection (RET) fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer, and recent business progress.\n\n\"2024 has been a significant year for Rigel, marked by the acquisition of GAVRETO, our third commercial product, strong revenue growth across our commercial portfolio, and the advancement of our development pipeline,\" said Raul Rodriguez, Rigel's president and CEO. \"This great progress is underpinned by our focus on financial discipline, resulting in positive third-quarter and year-to-date net income. As we close out the year, we will continue driving momentum in our commercial portfolio and hematology and oncology development pipeline.\"\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024_**** _Business Update_**\n\n**Commercial Update**\n\n  * Commercial strength continues for all products with record bottles shipped to patients and clinics and total bottles sold.\n  * GAVRETO became commercially available from Rigel in June 2024. Third-quarter results reflect the successful transition of existing patients on therapy to Rigel's product. For the fourth quarter, the focus will be on continuing to transition patients.\n  * The following table summarizes total bottles shipped for the third quarter: \n\n\n\n**_TAVALISSE_** |  **_REZLIDHIA_** |  **_GAVRETO *_**  \n---|---|---  \n**Bottles shipped to patients and clinics** |  2,797 |  444 |  717  \n**Change in bottles remaining in distribution channel** |  (4) |  (15) |  35  \n**Total bottles shipped** |  2,793 |  429 |  752  \n*GAVRETO bottle count represents 60-count bottle equivalent  \n  \n  * In September, Rigel [entered](https://www.rigel.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/395/rigel-expands-relationship-with-kissei-to-include) into an exclusive license and supply agreement with Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (\"Kissei\") to develop and commercialize REZLIDHIA in all potential indications in Japan, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan. Under the terms of the agreement, Rigel received an upfront cash payment of $10.0 million from Kissei, with the potential for up to an additional $152.5 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments.\n  * In late October, Rigel issued a Dear Health Care Provider (DHCP) letter related to a new safety signal for GAVRETO after consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The DHCP letter has been posted to the GAVRETO Healthcare Provider website at [www.gavreto-hcp.com](https://gavreto-hcp.com/).\n\n\n\n**Clinical and Development Update**\n\n  * Rigel continues to advance its Phase 1b clinical study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of R2891, a novel and selective dual IRAK1/4 inhibitor, in patients with R/R lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (LR-MDS). Enrollment in the fifth dose level (500mg / 250mg split dose) is underway.\n  * In early November, Rigel [announced](https://www.rigel.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/400/rigel-announces-six-poster-presentations-at-the-66th) six poster presentations highlighting data from the company's commercial and clinical-stage hematology and oncology portfolio at the upcoming 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition. Initial data from the ongoing Phase 1b study evaluating R289 in patients with R/R LR-MDS indicate that R289 was generally well tolerated in a heavily pretreated LR-MDS patient population, the majority of whom were high transfusion burden at study entry. As of the data cutoff, 14 of 19 patients were evaluable for efficacy and per International Working Group (IWG) 2018, RBC-transfusion independence (RBC-TI)/hematologic improvement (HI-E) occurred in 36% of patients receiving R289 doses ≥500 mg QD, with a median duration of RBC-TI of 29 weeks. RBC-TI >24 weeks was achieved in 2 high transfusion burden patients following 3 and 5 prior therapies, including a hypomethylating agent. The company will also present additional data for olutasidenib in patients with R/R m _IDH1_ AML and MDS.\n  * In September, Rigel [announced](https://www.rigel.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/396/rigel-announces-first-patient-enrolled-in-phase-1b2) the first patient was enrolled in a Phase 1b/2 triplet therapy trial of decitabine and venetoclax in combination with REZLIDHIA in patients with m _IDH1_ AML, which is being sponsored and conducted by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson). This is the first trial in Rigel's multi-year strategic development alliance with MD Anderson.\n  * A paper detailing the differences in molecular structure, binding characteristics and clinical outcomes between olutasidenib and ivosidenib, including response rates in patients previously treated with ivosidenib or venetoclax, was published by Dr. Justin M. Watts, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Chief, Leukemia Section at the University of Miami Health System, in _[Current Treatment Options in Oncology](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11864-024-01264-7)_ in October 2024.\n\n\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 and Year-To-Date Financial Update_** For the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, total revenues were $55.3 million, consisting of $26.3 million in TAVALISSE net product sales, $5.5 million in REZLIDHIA net product sales, $7.1 million in GAVRETO net product sales, and $16.4 million in contract revenue from collaborations. TAVALISSE net product sales grew 8% compared to $24.5 million in the same period of 2023. REZLIDHIA net product sales grew 107% compared to $2.7 million in the same period of 2023. GAVRETO became commercially available from Rigel in June 2024. Contract revenue from collaborations consisted of $13.0 million from Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Kissei) related to an upfront fee from sublicensing olutasidenib and delivery of drug supplies, as well as $3.3 million from Grifols S.A. (Grifols) and $0.1 million from Medison Pharma Trading AG (Medison) related to delivery of drug supplies and earned royalties.\n\nTotal costs and expenses were $41.3 million compared to $32.6 million for the same period of 2023. The increase in costs and expenses was mainly due to higher cost of product sales, driven primarily by increased products sales, a sublicensing revenue fee to Forma, increased royalties and amortization of intangible assets. In addition, there were increases in personnel-related costs and commercial-related expenses.\n\nRigel reported net income of $12.4 million, or $0.71 basic and $0.70 diluted per share, compared to a net loss of $5.7 million, or $0.33 basic and diluted per share, for the same period of 2023. The basic and diluted share and per share amounts for the prior period have been restated to reflect the 1-for-10 reverse stock split effected on June 27, 2024 on a retroactive basis.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total revenues were $121.7 million, consisting of $73.8 million in TAVALISSE net product sales, $15.6 million in REZLIDHIA net product sales, $9.0 million in GAVRETO net product sales, and $23.3 million in contract revenue from collaborations. TAVALISSE net product sales grew 8% compared to $68.1 million in the same period of 2023. REZLIDHIA net product sales grew 133% compared to $6.7 million in the same period of 2023. As mentioned above, GAVRETO became commercially available from Rigel in June 2024. Contract revenue from collaborations consisted of $17.5 million from Kissei related to an upfront fee from sublicensing olutasidenib and delivery of drug supplies, as well as $5.5 million from Grifols and $0.2 million from Medison related to delivery of drug supplies and earned royalties.\n\nTotal costs and expenses were $114.1 million compared to $103.5 million for the same period of 2023. The increase in costs and expenses was mainly due to higher cost of product sales driven primarily by increased products sales, a sublicensing revenue fee to Forma, increased royalties and amortization of intangible assets. In addition, there were increases in personnel-related costs, stock-based compensation expense and commercial-related expenses. These increases were partially offset by decreased research and development costs due to the timing of clinical trial activities related to R289, the company's dual IRAK 1/4 inhibitor program, as well as reduced trial activities related to the completed Phase 3 clinical trials of fostamatinib in patients with COVID-19 and in patients with warm antibody hemolytic anemia (wAIHA).\n\nRigel reported net income of $3.1 million, or $0.18 basic and diluted per share, compared to a net loss of $25.8 million, or $1.49 basic and diluted per share, for the same period of 2023.

The webcast will be archived and available for replay after the call via the Rigel website.\n\n**_About ITP_** In patients with ITP (immune thrombocytopenia), the immune system attacks and destroys the body's own blood platelets, which play an active role in blood clotting and healing. Common symptoms of ITP are excessive bruising and bleeding. People suffering with chronic ITP may live with an increased risk of severe bleeding events that can result in serious medical complications or even death. Current therapies for ITP include steroids, blood platelet production boosters (TPO-RAs), and splenectomy. However, not all patients respond to existing therapies. As a result, there remains a significant medical need for additional treatment options for patients with ITP.\n\n**_About AML_** Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rapidly progressing cancer of the blood and bone marrow that affects myeloid cells, which normally develop into various types of mature blood cells. AML occurs primarily in adults and accounts for about 1 percent of all adult cancers. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be about 20,800 new cases in the United States, most in adults, in 2024.2\n\nRelapsed AML affects about half of all patients who, following treatment and remission, experience a return of leukemia cells in the bone marrow.3 Refractory AML, which affects between 10 and 40 percent of newly diagnosed patients, occurs when a patient fails to achieve remission even after intensive treatment.4 Quality of life declines for patients with each successive line of treatment for AML, and well-tolerated treatments in relapsed or refractory disease remain an unmet need.\n\n**_About NSCLC_** It is estimated that over 230,000 adults in the U.S. will be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2024. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the U.S, with NSCLC being the most common type accounting for 80-85% of all lung cancer diagnoses.5 RET fusions are implicated in approximately 1-2% of patients with NSCLC.6\n\n**_About TAVALISSE ®_**TAVALISSE (fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate) tablets is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment.\n\n**Please click****[here](http://www.tavalisseuspi.com/)****for Important Safety Information and Full Prescribing Information for TAVALISSE.**\n\n**_About REZLIDHIA ®_**REZLIDHIA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a susceptible isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (_IDH1_) mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test.\n\n**Please click _[here](https://www.rezlidhia.com/downloads/pdf/REZLIDHIA-Full-Prescribing-Information.pdf)_ for Important Safety Information and Full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNING, for REZLIDHIA.**\n\n**_About GAVRETO ®_**GAVRETO is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic rearranged during transfection (RET) fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as detected by an FDA-approved test and adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory (if radioactive iodine is appropriate).*\n\n*Thyroid indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and duration of response.

(Nasdaq: RIGL), a commercial stage biotechnology company focused on hematologic disorders and cancer, today announced upcoming presentations of six posters highlighting data from their commercial and clinical-stage hematology-oncology portfolio at the 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition being held December 7-10, 2024, in San Diego, California and virtually.\n\nRigel's presentations will include data from the ongoing Phase 1b dose escalation/expansion study evaluating R2891, a potent and selective dual inhibitor of IRAK1 and IRAK4, in patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (LR-MDS) who are relapsed or refractory (R/R) to prior therapies; REZLIDHIA® (olutasidenib) for the treatment of R/R mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (m _IDH1_) acute myeloid leukemia (AML); and TAVALISSE® (fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate) for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).\n\n\"We look forward to the presentation of posters at ASH from across our product portfolio. We are very encouraged by the preliminary safety and efficacy data from our ongoing Phase 1b study of R289 in lower risk MDS. R289 was generally well tolerated and demonstrated responses in heavily pretreated LR-MDS patients, a population with a critical unmet need,\" said Raul Rodriguez, Rigel's president and CEO. \"In addition, data from olutasidenib will be presented that adds to the growing body of evidence showing the benefits of its use in patients with m _IDH1_ AML.\" \n\nASH Annual Meeting abstracts may be accessed online at [www.hematology.org](http://www.hematology.org/). Details of the poster presentations and publications, which will be available in the poster hall and via the virtual event platform, are as follows:\n\n**Abstract #:** 4595**Title:** R289, a Dual IRAK 1/4 Inhibitor, in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) Lower-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (LR-MDS): Initial Results from a Phase 1b Study**Presenter:** Guillermo Garcia-Manero, M.D.**Time:** Monday, December 9, 2024, 6:00pm to 8:00pm PT\n\n  * Initial data from the dose escalation phase using a July 15, 2024 data cutoff date indicate that R289 was generally well tolerated in a heavily pretreated LR-MDS patient population (median number of prior therapies was 4; 79% had received an hypomethylating agent), the majority of whom were high transfusion burden (received ≥8 units red blood cells in 16 weeks prior to enrollment) at study entry.\n  * Fourteen of 19 patients were evaluable for efficacy (received ≥1 dose of study drug with ≥1 efficacy assessment). Per International Working Group (IWG) 2018, RBC-transfusion independence (RBC-TI)/hematologic improvement (HI-E) occurred in 36% of patients receiving R289 doses ≥500 mg QD, with a median duration of RBC-TI of 29 weeks (range 12.4-35.9 weeks). RBC-TI >24 weeks was achieved in 2 high transfusion burden patients following 3 and 5 prior therapies, including a hypomethylating agent.\n  * Updated data as of October 25, 2024 data cutoff will be presented during the poster session.\n\n\n\n**Abstract #:** 1514**Title:** Time to Response and Overall Survival in Patients with m _IDH1_ Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treated with Olutasidenib**Presenter:** Stéphane de Botton, M.D., Ph.D.**Time:** Saturday, December 7, 2024, 5:30pm to 7:30pm PT\n\n  * Results show that while some patients with m _IDH1_ R/R AML achieve response to olutasidenib very quickly, within 1-2 months of treatment, other patients responded after 6 months of treatment for complete remission (CR) plus CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) and up to 10 months for overall response.\n  * These results support the prescribing information that suggests treating for at least 6 months to allow time for clinical response in patients without disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n  * A Cox regression model showed no significant association between time to response and overall survival in the overall responders and those with a CR/CRh response.\n\n\n\n**Abstract #:** 2886**Title:** Combination of Olutasidenib and Azacitidine Induces Durable Complete Remissions in m _IDH1_ Acute Myeloid Leukemia: A Multicohort Open-Label Phase 1/2 Trial**Presenter:** Jorge E. Cortes, M.D.**Time:** Sunday, December 8, 2024, 6:00pm to 8:00pm PT\n\n  * Olutasidenib plus azacitidine induced high response rates and durable remissions with a tolerable side effect profile in patients with R/R m _IDH1_ AML, in the first reported analysis of a combination therapy with an mIDH1 inhibitor and a hypomethylating agent focused on the R/R AML setting.\n  * CR/CRh was achieved in 31% (21/67) of patients and median duration of CR/CRh was 15 months.\n\n\n\n**Abstract #:** 4600**Title:** Olutasidenib Alone or in Combination with Azacitidine in Patients with m _IDH1_ Myelodysplastic Syndromes/Neoplasms: Final 5-Year Data**Presenter:** Jorge E. Cortes, M.D.**Time** : Monday, December 9, 2024, 6:00pm to 8:00pm PT\n\n  * Olutasidenib demonstrated encouraging response rates with durable remissions and an acceptable and manageable safety profile in patients with intermediate to very high-risk m _IDH1_ MDS treated with olutasidenib monotherapy or in combination with azacitidine.\n  * In a sub analysis of the 19 efficacy evaluable patients, 79% (11/14) of patients responded to combination therapy and 40% (2/5) responded to monotherapy, which included both patients (2/2) using the approved dose of 150 mg BID olutasidenib.\n\n\n\n**Abstract #:** 1525**Title:** Effectiveness of Olutasidenib Versus Ivosidenib in Patients with Mutated Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 Acute Myeloid Leukemia Who Are Relapsed or Refractory to Venetoclax: The 2102-HEM-101 Trial Versus a US Electronic Health Record-Based External Control Arm**Presenter:** Catherine E. Lai, M.D.**Time:** Sunday, December 8, 2024, 6:00pm to 8:00pm PT\n\n  * This study provides the first evidence suggesting favorable effectiveness of olutasidenib versus ivosidenib in patients with m _IDH1_ AML who were R/R to a venetoclax-based regimen.\n  * As with any real-world experience study, limitations include risk of unmeasured confounding and differential outcome reporting.\n\n\n\n**Abstract #:** 5080**Title:** Real-World Experience with Combination Therapy of Fostamatinib and Thrombopoetin Receptor Agonists (TPO-RAs) for Treatment of Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP): Patient-Reported Outcomes**Presenter:** Elizabeth Bowhay-Carnes, M.D.**Time:** Monday, December 9, 2024, 6:00pm to 8:00pm PT\n\n  * This real-world study treating patients with fostamatinib and a thrombopoetin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) demonstrated that the combination led to a clinically meaningful response in a majority of patients with ITP.\n\n\n\n**_ASH Publication_**\n\n**Abstract #:** 7908 **Title:** Treatment Patterns and Outcomes of Olutasidenib in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) mutated _IDH1_ Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in the Real World**Authors:** Aaron Sheppard, Ph.D.; Lixia Wang, Ph.D.; Ravi Potluri, MBA; Eros Papademetriou, MA\n\n**_About R289_** R289 is a prodrug of R835, an IRAK1/4 dual inhibitor, which has been shown in preclinical studies to block inflammatory cytokine production in response to toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) family signaling. TLRs and IL-1Rs play a critical role in the innate immune response and dysregulation of these pathways can lead to various inflammatory conditions. Chronic stimulation of both these receptor systems is thought to cause the pro-inflammatory environment in the bone marrow responsible for persistent cytopenias in lower-risk MDS patients.2\n\n**_About AML_** Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rapidly progressing cancer of the blood and bone marrow that affects myeloid cells, which normally develop into various types of mature blood cells. AML occurs primarily in adults and accounts for about 1 percent of all adult cancers. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be about 20,800 new cases in the United States, most in adults, in 2024.3\n\nRelapsed AML affects about half of all patients who, following treatment and remission, experience a return of leukemia cells in the bone marrow.4 Refractory AML, which affects between 10 and 40 percent of newly diagnosed patients, occurs when a patient fails to achieve remission even after intensive treatment.5 Quality of life declines for patients with each successive line of treatment for AML, and well-tolerated treatments in relapsed or refractory disease remain an unmet need.\n\n**_About ITP_** In patients with ITP (immune thrombocytopenia), the immune system attacks and destroys the body's own blood platelets, which play an active role in blood clotting and healing. Common symptoms of ITP are excessive bruising and bleeding. People suffering with chronic ITP may live with an increased risk of severe bleeding events that can result in serious medical complications or even death. Current therapies for ITP include steroids, blood platelet production boosters (TPO-RAs), and splenectomy. However, not all patients respond to existing therapies. As a result, there remains a significant medical need for additional treatment options for patients with ITP.\n\n**_About REZLIDHIA ®_**\n\n**INDICATION** REZLIDHIA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a susceptible isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test.\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**WARNING: DIFFERENTIATION SYNDROME** **Differentiation syndrome, which can be fatal, can occur with REZLIDHIA treatment. Symptoms may include dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates/pleuropericardial effusion, kidney injury, hypotension, fever, and weight gain. If differentiation syndrome is suspected, withhold REZLIDHIA and initiate treatment with corticosteroids and hemodynamic monitoring until symptom resolution.**  \n---  \n  \n**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS**\n\n**Differentiation Syndrome** REZLIDHIA can cause differentiation syndrome. In the clinical trial of REZLIDHIA in patients with relapsed or refractory AML, differentiation syndrome occurred in 16% of patients, with grade 3 or 4 differentiation syndrome occurring in 8% of patients treated, and fatalities in 1% of patients. Differentiation syndrome is associated with rapid proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells and may be life-threatening or fatal. Symptoms of differentiation syndrome in patients treated with REZLIDHIA included leukocytosis, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates/pleuropericardial effusion, kidney injury, fever, edema, pyrexia, and weight gain. Of the 25 patients who experienced differentiation syndrome, 19 (76%) recovered after treatment or after dose interruption of REZLIDHIA. Differentiation syndrome occurred as early as 1 day and up to 18 months after REZLIDHIA initiation and has been observed with or without concomitant leukocytosis.\n\nIf differentiation syndrome is suspected, temporarily withhold REZLIDHIA and initiate systemic corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 10 mg IV every 12 hours) for a minimum of 3 days and until resolution of signs and symptoms. If concomitant leukocytosis is observed, initiate treatment with hydroxyurea, as clinically indicated. Taper corticosteroids and hydroxyurea after resolution of symptoms. Differentiation syndrome may recur with premature discontinuation of corticosteroids and/or hydroxyurea treatment. Institute supportive measures and hemodynamic monitoring until improvement; withhold dose of REZLIDHIA and consider dose reduction based on recurrence.\n\n**Hepatotoxicity** REZLIDHIA can cause hepatotoxicity, presenting as increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), increased blood alkaline phosphatase, and/or elevated bilirubin. Of 153 patients with relapsed or refractory AML who received REZLIDHIA, hepatotoxicity occurred in 23% of patients; 13% experienced grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity. One patient treated with REZLIDHIA in combination with azacitidine in the clinical trial, a combination for which REZLIDHIA is not indicated, died from complications of drug-induced liver injury. The median time to onset of hepatotoxicity in patients with relapsed or refractory AML treated with REZLIDHIA was 1.2 months (range: 1 day to 17.5 months) after REZLIDHIA initiation, and the median time to resolution was 12 days (range: 1 day to 17 months). The most common hepatotoxicities were elevations of ALT, AST, blood alkaline phosphatase, and blood bilirubin.\n\nMonitor patients frequently for clinical symptoms of hepatic dysfunction such as fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. Obtain baseline liver function tests prior to initiation of REZLIDHIA, at least once weekly for the first two months, once every other week for the third month, once in the fourth month, and once every other month for the duration of therapy. If hepatic dysfunction occurs, withhold, reduce, or permanently discontinue REZLIDHIA based on recurrence/severity.\n\n**ADVERSE REACTIONS** The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were aspartate aminotransferase increased, alanine aminotransferase increased, potassium decreased, sodium decreased, alkaline phosphatase increased, nausea, creatinine increased, fatigue/malaise, arthralgia, constipation, lymphocytes increased, bilirubin increased, leukocytosis, uric acid increased, dyspnea, pyrexia, rash, lipase increased, mucositis, diarrhea and transaminitis.\n\n**DRUG INTERACTIONS**\n\n  * Avoid concomitant use of REZLIDHIA with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers.\n  * Avoid concomitant use of REZLIDHIA with sensitive CYP3A substrates unless otherwise instructed in the substrates prescribing information. If concomitant use is unavoidable, monitor patients for loss of therapeutic effect of these drugs.\n\n\n\n**LACTATION** Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with REZLIDHIA and for 2 weeks after the last dose.\n\n**GERIATRIC USE** No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years and older and younger patients. Compared to patients younger than 65 years of age, an increase in incidence of hepatotoxicity and hypertension was observed in patients ≥65 years of age.\n\n**HEPATIC IMPAIRMENT** In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, closely monitor for increased probability of differentiation syndrome.\n\n[Click here](https://www.rezlidhia.com/downloads/pdf/REZLIDHIA-Full-Prescribing-Information.pdf)**for Full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNING.**\n\n**To report side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA, visit[www.fda.gov/medwatch](https://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch-fda-safety-information-and-adverse-event-reporting-program) or call 1-800-FDA-1088 (800-332-1088).**\n\n**_About TAVALISSE ®_****Indication** TAVALISSE (fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate) tablets is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment.\n\n**Important Safety Information****Warnings and Precautions**\n\n  * Hypertension can occur with TAVALISSE treatment. Patients with pre-existing hypertension may be more susceptible to the hypertensive effects. Monitor blood pressure every 2 weeks until stable, then monthly, and adjust or initiate antihypertensive therapy for blood pressure control maintenance during therapy. If increased blood pressure persists, TAVALISSE interruption, reduction, or discontinuation may be required.\n  * Elevated liver function tests (LFTs), mainly ALT and AST, can occur with TAVALISSE. Monitor LFTs monthly during treatment. If ALT or AST increase to ≥3 x upper limit of normal, manage hepatotoxicity using TAVALISSE interruption, reduction, or discontinuation.\n  * Diarrhea occurred in 31% of patients and severe diarrhea occurred in 1% of patients treated with TAVALISSE. Monitor patients for the development of diarrhea and manage using supportive care measures early after the onset of symptoms. If diarrhea becomes severe (≥Grade 3), interrupt, reduce dose or discontinue TAVALISSE.\n  * Neutropenia occurred in 6% of patients treated with TAVALISSE; febrile neutropenia occurred in 1% of patients. Monitor the ANC monthly and for infection during treatment. Manage toxicity with TAVALISSE interruption, reduction, or discontinuation.\n  * TAVALISSE can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Advise pregnant women the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose. Verify pregnancy status prior to initiating TAVALISSE. It is unknown if TAVALISSE or its metabolite is present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during TAVALISSE treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose.\n\n\n\n**Drug Interactions**\n\n  * Concomitant use of TAVALISSE with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increases exposure to the major active metabolite of TAVALISSE (R406), which may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Monitor for toxicities that may require a reduction in TAVALISSE dose.\n  * It is not recommended to use TAVALISSE with strong CYP3A4 inducers, as concomitant use reduces exposure to R406.\n  * Concomitant use of TAVALISSE may increase concentrations of some CYP3A4 substrate drugs and may require a dose reduction of the CYP3A4 substrate drug.\n  * Concomitant use of TAVALISSE may increase concentrations of BCRP substrate drugs (eg, rosuvastatin) and P-Glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate drugs (eg, digoxin), which may require a dose reduction of the BCRP and P-gp substrate drug.\n\n\n\n**Adverse Reactions**\n\n  * Serious adverse drug reactions in the ITP double-blind studies were febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, pneumonia, and hypertensive crisis, which occurred in 1% of TAVALISSE patients. In addition, severe adverse reactions occurred including dyspnea and hypertension (both 2%), neutropenia, arthralgia, chest pain, diarrhea, dizziness, nephrolithiasis, pain in extremity, toothache, syncope, and hypoxia (all 1%).\n  * Common adverse reactions (≥5% and more common than placebo) from FIT-1 and FIT-2 included: diarrhea, hypertension, nausea, dizziness, ALT and AST increased, respiratory infection, rash, abdominal pain, fatigue, chest pain, and neutropenia.\n\n\n\n**Please see[www.TAVALISSEUSPI.com](http://www.tavalisseuspi.com/) for Full Prescribing Information.**\n\n**To report side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA, visit[www.fda.gov/medwatch](http://www.fda.gov/medwatch) or call 1-800-FDA-1088 (800-332-1088).**\n\nREZLIDHIA and TAVALISSE are registered trademarks of Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\n**_About Rigel_** Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

(Nasdaq: RIGL), a commercial stage biotechnology company focused on hematologic disorders and cancer, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, including sales of TAVALISSE® (fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate) for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP); REZLIDHIA® (olutasidenib) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory (R/R) mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (m _IDH1_) acute myeloid leukemia (AML); and GAVRETO® (pralsetinib) for the treatment of metastatic rearranged during transfection (RET) fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer, and recent business progress.\n\n\"2024 has been a significant year for Rigel, marked by the acquisition of GAVRETO, our third commercial product, strong revenue growth across our commercial portfolio, and the advancement of our development pipeline,\" said Raul Rodriguez, Rigel's president and CEO. \"This great progress is underpinned by our focus on financial discipline, resulting in positive third-quarter and year-to-date net income. As we close out the year, we will continue driving momentum in our commercial portfolio and hematology and oncology development pipeline.\"\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024_**** _Business Update_**\n\n**Commercial Update**\n\n  * Commercial strength continues for all products with record bottles shipped to patients and clinics and total bottles sold.\n  * GAVRETO became commercially available from Rigel in June 2024. Third-quarter results reflect the successful transition of existing patients on therapy to Rigel's product. For the fourth quarter, the focus will be on continuing to transition patients.\n  * The following table summarizes total bottles shipped for the third quarter: \n\n\n\n**_TAVALISSE_** |  **_REZLIDHIA_** |  **_GAVRETO *_**  \n---|---|---  \n**Bottles shipped to patients and clinics** |  2,797 |  444 |  717  \n**Change in bottles remaining in distribution channel** |  (4) |  (15) |  35  \n**Total bottles shipped** |  2,793 |  429 |  752  \n*GAVRETO bottle count represents 60-count bottle equivalent  \n  \n  * In September, Rigel [entered](https://www.rigel.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/395/rigel-expands-relationship-with-kissei-to-include) into an exclusive license and supply agreement with Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (\"Kissei\") to develop and commercialize REZLIDHIA in all potential indications in Japan, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan. Under the terms of the agreement, Rigel received an upfront cash payment of $10.0 million from Kissei, with the potential for up to an additional $152.5 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments.\n  * In late October, Rigel issued a Dear Health Care Provider (DHCP) letter related to a new safety signal for GAVRETO after consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The DHCP letter has been posted to the GAVRETO Healthcare Provider website at [www.gavreto-hcp.com](https://gavreto-hcp.com/).\n\n\n\n**Clinical and Development Update**\n\n  * Rigel continues to advance its Phase 1b clinical study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of R2891, a novel and selective dual IRAK1/4 inhibitor, in patients with R/R lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (LR-MDS). Enrollment in the fifth dose level (500mg / 250mg split dose) is underway.\n  * In early November, Rigel [announced](https://www.rigel.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/400/rigel-announces-six-poster-presentations-at-the-66th) six poster presentations highlighting data from the company's commercial and clinical-stage hematology and oncology portfolio at the upcoming 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition. Initial data from the ongoing Phase 1b study evaluating R289 in patients with R/R LR-MDS indicate that R289 was generally well tolerated in a heavily pretreated LR-MDS patient population, the majority of whom were high transfusion burden at study entry. As of the data cutoff, 14 of 19 patients were evaluable for efficacy and per International Working Group (IWG) 2018, RBC-transfusion independence (RBC-TI)/hematologic improvement (HI-E) occurred in 36% of patients receiving R289 doses ≥500 mg QD, with a median duration of RBC-TI of 29 weeks. RBC-TI >24 weeks was achieved in 2 high transfusion burden patients following 3 and 5 prior therapies, including a hypomethylating agent. The company will also present additional data for olutasidenib in patients with R/R m _IDH1_ AML and MDS.\n  * In September, Rigel [announced](https://www.rigel.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/396/rigel-announces-first-patient-enrolled-in-phase-1b2) the first patient was enrolled in a Phase 1b/2 triplet therapy trial of decitabine and venetoclax in combination with REZLIDHIA in patients with m _IDH1_ AML, which is being sponsored and conducted by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson). This is the first trial in Rigel's multi-year strategic development alliance with MD Anderson.\n  * A paper detailing the differences in molecular structure, binding characteristics and clinical outcomes between olutasidenib and ivosidenib, including response rates in patients previously treated with ivosidenib or venetoclax, was published by Dr. Justin M. Watts, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Chief, Leukemia Section at the University of Miami Health System, in _[Current Treatment Options in Oncology](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11864-024-01264-7)_ in October 2024.\n\n\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 and Year-To-Date Financial Update_** For the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, total revenues were $55.3 million, consisting of $26.3 million in TAVALISSE net product sales, $5.5 million in REZLIDHIA net product sales, $7.1 million in GAVRETO net product sales, and $16.4 million in contract revenue from collaborations. TAVALISSE net product sales grew 8% compared to $24.5 million in the same period of 2023. REZLIDHIA net product sales grew 107% compared to $2.7 million in the same period of 2023. GAVRETO became commercially available from Rigel in June 2024. Contract revenue from collaborations consisted of $13.0 million from Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Kissei) related to an upfront fee from sublicensing olutasidenib and delivery of drug supplies, as well as $3.3 million from Grifols S.A. (Grifols) and $0.1 million from Medison Pharma Trading AG (Medison) related to delivery of drug supplies and earned royalties.\n\nTotal costs and expenses were $41.3 million compared to $32.6 million for the same period of 2023. The increase in costs and expenses was mainly due to higher cost of product sales, driven primarily by increased products sales, a sublicensing revenue fee to Forma, increased royalties and amortization of intangible assets. In addition, there were increases in personnel-related costs and commercial-related expenses.\n\nRigel reported net income of $12.4 million, or $0.71 basic and $0.70 diluted per share, compared to a net loss of $5.7 million, or $0.33 basic and diluted per share, for the same period of 2023. The basic and diluted share and per share amounts for the prior period have been restated to reflect the 1-for-10 reverse stock split effected on June 27, 2024 on a retroactive basis.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total revenues were $121.7 million, consisting of $73.8 million in TAVALISSE net product sales, $15.6 million in REZLIDHIA net product sales, $9.0 million in GAVRETO net product sales, and $23.3 million in contract revenue from collaborations. TAVALISSE net product sales grew 8% compared to $68.1 million in the same period of 2023. REZLIDHIA net product sales grew 133% compared to $6.7 million in the same period of 2023. As mentioned above, GAVRETO became commercially available from Rigel in June 2024. Contract revenue from collaborations consisted of $17.5 million from Kissei related to an upfront fee from sublicensing olutasidenib and delivery of drug supplies, as well as $5.5 million from Grifols and $0.2 million from Medison related to delivery of drug supplies and earned royalties.\n\nTotal costs and expenses were $114.1 million compared to $103.5 million for the same period of 2023. The increase in costs and expenses was mainly due to higher cost of product sales driven primarily by increased products sales, a sublicensing revenue fee to Forma, increased royalties and amortization of intangible assets. In addition, there were increases in personnel-related costs, stock-based compensation expense and commercial-related expenses. These increases were partially offset by decreased research and development costs due to the timing of clinical trial activities related to R289, the company's dual IRAK 1/4 inhibitor program, as well as reduced trial activities related to the completed Phase 3 clinical trials of fostamatinib in patients with COVID-19 and in patients with warm antibody hemolytic anemia (wAIHA).\n\nRigel reported net income of $3.1 million, or $0.18 basic and diluted per share, compared to a net loss of $25.8 million, or $1.49 basic and diluted per share, for the same period of 2023. As discussed above, the share and per share amounts for the prior period have been restated to reflect the 1-for-10 reverse stock split on a retroactive basis for the periods presented.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024 was $61.1 million, compared to $49.1 million as of June 30, 2024, and $56.9 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**_Conference Call and Webcast with Slides Today at 4:30pm Eastern Time_** Rigel will hold a live conference call and webcast today at 4:30pm Eastern Time (1:30pm Pacific Time).\n\nParticipants can access the live conference call by dialing (877) 407-3088 (domestic) or (201) 389-0927 (international). The conference call will also be webcast live and can be accessed from the Investor Relations section of the company's website at [www.rigel.com](https://www.rigel.com/). The webcast will be archived and available for replay after the call via the Rigel website.\n\n**_About ITP_** In patients with ITP (immune thrombocytopenia), the immune system attacks and destroys the body's own blood platelets, which play an active role in blood clotting and healing. Common symptoms of ITP are excessive bruising and bleeding. People suffering with chronic ITP may live with an increased risk of severe bleeding events that can result in serious medical complications or even death. Current therapies for ITP include steroids, blood platelet production boosters (TPO-RAs), and splenectomy. However, not all patients respond to existing therapies. As a result, there remains a significant medical need for additional treatment options for patients with ITP.\n\n**_About AML_** Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rapidly progressing cancer of the blood and bone marrow that affects myeloid cells, which normally develop into various types of mature blood cells. AML occurs primarily in adults and accounts for about 1 percent of all adult cancers. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be about 20,800 new cases in the United States, most in adults, in 2024.2\n\nRelapsed AML affects about half of all patients who, following treatment and remission, experience a return of leukemia cells in the bone marrow.3 Refractory AML, which affects between 10 and 40 percent of newly diagnosed patients, occurs when a patient fails to achieve remission even after intensive treatment.4 Quality of life declines for patients with each successive line of treatment for AML, and well-tolerated treatments in relapsed or refractory disease remain an unmet need.\n\n**_About NSCLC_** It is estimated that over 230,000 adults in the U.S. will be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2024. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the U.S, with NSCLC being the most common type accounting for 80-85% of all lung cancer diagnoses.5 RET fusions are implicated in approximately 1-2% of patients with NSCLC.6\n\n**_About TAVALISSE ®_**TAVALISSE (fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate) tablets is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment.\n\n**Please click****[here](http://www.tavalisseuspi.com/)****for Important Safety Information and Full Prescribing Information for TAVALISSE.**\n\n**_About REZLIDHIA ®_**REZLIDHIA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a susceptible isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (_IDH1_) mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test.\n\n**Please click _[here](https://www.rezlidhia.com/downloads/pdf/REZLIDHIA-Full-Prescribing-Information.pdf)_ for Important Safety Information and Full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNING, for REZLIDHIA.**\n\n**_About GAVRETO ®_**GAVRETO is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic rearranged during transfection (RET) fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as detected by an FDA-approved test and adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory (if radioactive iodine is appropriate).*\n\n*Thyroid indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and duration of response.

(Nasdaq: RIGL), a commercial stage biotechnology company focused on hematologic\ndisorders and cancer, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September\n30, 2024, including sales of TAVALISSE® (fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate) for the\ntreatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP); REZLIDHIA® (olutasidenib) for the\ntreatment of relapsed or refractory (R/R) mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (mIDH1) acute\nmyeloid leukemia (AML); and GAVRETO® (pralsetinib) for the treatment of metastatic\nrearranged during transfection (RET) fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and\nadvanced or metastatic thyroid cancer, and recent business progress.\n\"2024 has been a significant year for Rigel, marked by the acquisition of GAVRETO, our\nthird commercial product, strong revenue growth across our commercial portfolio, and the\nadvancement of our development pipeline,\" said Raul Rodriguez, Rigel's president and\nCEO. \"This great progress is underpinned by our focus on financial discipline, resulting in\npositive third-quarter and year-to-date net income. As we close out the year, we will continue\ndriving momentum in our commercial portfolio and hematology and oncology development\npipeline.\"\nThird Quarter 2024 Business Update\nCommercial Update\nCommercial strength continues for all products with record bottles shipped to patients\nand clinics and total bottles sold.\nGAVRETO became commercially available from Rigel in June 2024. Third-quarter\nresults reflect the successful transition of existing patients on therapy to Rigel's\nproduct. For the fourth quarter, the focus will be on continuing to transition patients.\nThe following table summarizes total bottles shipped for the third quarter:\nTAVALISSE REZLIDHIA GAVRETO*\nBottles shipped to patients and clinics 2,797 444 717\nChange in bottles remaining in distribution channel (4) (15) 35\nTotal bottles shipped 2,793 429 752\n*GAVRETO bottle count represents 60-count bottle equivalent\nIn September, Rigel entered into an exclusive license and supply agreement with\nKissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (\"Kissei\") to develop and commercialize REZLIDHIA in\nall potential indications in Japan, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan. Under the terms\nof the agreement, Rigel received an upfront cash payment of $10.0 million from Kissei,\nwith the potential for up to an additional $152.5 million in development, regulatory and\ncommercial milestone payments.\nIn late October, Rigel issued a Dear Health Care Provider (DHCP) letter related to a\nnew safety signal for GAVRETO after consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA). The DHCP letter has been posted to the GAVRETO Healthcare\nProvider website at www.gavreto-hcp.com.\nClinical and Development Update\nRigel continues to advance its Phase 1b clinical study evaluating the safety, tolerability,\npharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of R2891, a novel and selective dual\nIRAK1/4 inhibitor, in patients with R/R lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (LR-MDS).\nEnrollment in the fifth dose level (500mg / 250mg split dose) is underway.\nIn early November, Rigel announced six poster presentations highlighting data from the\ncompany's commercial and clinical-stage hematology and oncology portfolio at the\nupcoming 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and\nExposition. Initial data from the ongoing Phase 1b study evaluating R289 in patients\nwith R/R LR-MDS indicate that R289 was generally well tolerated in a heavily\npretreated LR-MDS patient population, the majority of whom were high transfusion\nburden at study entry. As of the data cutoff, 14 of 19 patients were evaluable for\nefficacy and per International Working Group (IWG) 2018, RBC-transfusion\nindependence (RBC-TI)/hematologic improvement (HI-E) occurred in 36% of patients\nreceiving R289 doses ≥500 mg QD, with a median duration of RBC-TI of 29 weeks.\nRBC-TI >24 weeks was achieved in 2 high transfusion burden patients following 3 and\n5 prior therapies, including a hypomethylating agent. The company will also present\nadditional data for olutasidenib in patients with R/R mIDH1 AML and MDS.\nIn September, Rigel announced the first patient was enrolled in a Phase 1b/2 triplet\ntherapy trial of decitabine and venetoclax in combination with REZLIDHIA in patients\nwith mIDH1 AML, which is being sponsored and conducted by The University of Texas\nMD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson). This is the first trial in Rigel's multi-year\nstrategic development alliance with MD Anderson.\nA paper detailing the differences in molecular structure, binding characteristics and\nclinical outcomes between olutasidenib and ivosidenib, including response rates in\npatients previously treated with ivosidenib or venetoclax, was published by Dr. Justin\nM. Watts, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Chief, Leukemia\nSection at the University of Miami Health System, in Current Treatment Options in\nOncology in October 2024.\nThird Quarter 2024 and Year-To-Date Financial Update\nFor the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, total revenues were $55.3 million,\nconsisting of $26.3 million in TAVALISSE net product sales, $5.5 million in REZLIDHIA net\nproduct sales, $7.1 million in GAVRETO net product sales, and $16.4 million in contract\nrevenue from collaborations. TAVALISSE net product sales grew 8% compared to $24.5\nmillion in the same period of 2023. REZLIDHIA net product sales grew 107% compared to\n$2.7 million in the same period of 2023. GAVRETO became commercially available from\nRigel in June 2024. Contract revenue from collaborations consisted of $13.0 million from\nKissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Kissei) related to an upfront fee from sublicensing\nolutasidenib and delivery of drug supplies, as well as $3.3 million from Grifols S.A. (Grifols)\nand $0.1 million from Medison Pharma Trading AG (Medison) related to delivery of drug\nsupplies and earned royalties.\nTotal costs and expenses were $41.3 million compared to $32.6 million for the same period\nof 2023. The increase in costs and expenses was mainly due to higher cost of product sales,\ndriven primarily by increased products sales, a sublicensing revenue fee to Forma,\nincreased royalties and amortization of intangible assets. In addition, there were increases in\npersonnel-related costs and commercial-related expenses.\nRigel reported net income of $12.4 million, or $0.71 basic and $0.70 diluted per share,\ncompared to a net loss of $5.7 million, or $0.33 basic and diluted per share, for the same\nperiod of 2023. The basic and diluted share and per share amounts for the prior period have\nbeen restated to reflect the 1-for-10 reverse stock split effected on June 27, 2024 on a\nretroactive basis.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total revenues were $121.7 million,\nconsisting of $73.8 million in TAVALISSE net product sales, $15.6 million in REZLIDHIA net\nproduct sales, $9.0 million in GAVRETO net product sales, and $23.3 million in contract\nrevenue from collaborations. TAVALISSE net product sales grew 8% compared to $68.1\nmillion in the same period of 2023. REZLIDHIA net product sales grew 133% compared to\n$6.7 million in the same period of 2023. As mentioned above, GAVRETO became\ncommercially available from Rigel in June 2024. Contract revenue from collaborations\nconsisted of $17.5 million from Kissei related to an upfront fee from sublicensing olutasidenib\nand delivery of drug supplies, as well as $5.5 million from Grifols and $0.2 million from\nMedison related to delivery of drug supplies and earned royalties.\nTotal costs and expenses were $114.1 million compared to $103.5 million for the same\nperiod of 2023. The increase in costs and expenses was mainly due to higher cost of\nproduct sales driven primarily by increased products sales, a sublicensing revenue fee to\nForma, increased royalties and amortization of intangible assets. In addition, there were\nincreases in personnel-related costs, stock-based compensation expense and commercial-\nrelated expenses. These increases were partially offset by decreased research and\ndevelopment costs due to the timing of clinical trial activities related to R289, the company's\ndual IRAK 1/4 inhibitor program, as well as reduced trial activities related to the completed\nPhase 3 clinical trials of fostamatinib in patients with COVID-19 and in patients with warm\nantibody hemolytic anemia (wAIHA).\nRigel reported net income of $3.1 million, or $0.18 basic and diluted per share, compared to\na net loss of $25.8 million, or $1.49 basic and diluted per share, for the same period of 2023.\nAs discussed above, the share and per share amounts for the prior period have been\nrestated to reflect the 1-for-10 reverse stock split on a retroactive basis for the periods\npresented.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024 was $61.1\nmillion, compared to $49.1 million as of June 30, 2024, and $56.9 million as of December 31,\n2023.\nConference Call and Webcast with Slides Today at 4:30pm Eastern Time\nRigel will hold a live conference call and webcast today at 4:30pm Eastern Time (1:30pm\nPacific Time).\nParticipants can access the live conference call by dialing (877) 407-3088 (domestic) or\n(201) 389-0927 (international). The conference call will also be webcast live and can be\naccessed from the Investor Relations section of the company's website at www.rigel.com.\nThe webcast will be archived and available for replay after the call via the Rigel website.\nAbout ITP\nIn patients with ITP (immune thrombocytopenia), the immune system attacks and destroys\nthe body's own blood platelets, which play an active role in blood clotting and healing.\nCommon symptoms of ITP are excessive bruising and bleeding. People suffering with\nchronic ITP may live with an increased risk of severe bleeding events that can result in\nserious medical complications or even death. Current therapies for ITP include steroids,\nblood platelet production boosters (TPO-RAs), and splenectomy. However, not all patients\nrespond to existing therapies. As a result, there remains a significant medical need for\nadditional treatment options for patients with ITP.\nAbout AML\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rapidly progressing cancer of the blood and bone marrow\nthat affects myeloid cells, which normally develop into various types of mature blood cells.\nAML occurs primarily in adults and accounts for about 1 percent of all adult cancers. The\nAmerican Cancer Society estimates that there will be about 20,800 new cases in the United\nStates, most in adults, in 2024.2\nRelapsed AML affects about half of all patients who, following treatment and remission,\nexperience a return of leukemia cells in the bone marrow.3 Refractory AML, which affects\nbetween 10 and 40 percent of newly diagnosed patients, occurs when a patient fails to\nachieve remission even after intensive treatment.4 Quality of life declines for patients with\neach successive line of treatment for AML, and well-tolerated treatments in relapsed or\nrefractory disease remain an unmet need.\nAbout NSCLC\nIt is estimated that over 230,000 adults in the U.S. will be diagnosed with lung cancer in\n2024. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the U.S, with NSCLC being the\nmost common type accounting for 80-85% of all lung cancer diagnoses.5 RET fusions are\nimplicated in approximately 1-2% of patients with NSCLC.6\nAbout TAVALISSE®\nTAVALISSE (fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate) tablets is indicated for the treatment of\nthrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have\nhad an insufficient response to a previous treatment.\nPlease click here for Important Safety Information and Full Prescribing Information for\nTAVALISSE.\nAbout REZLIDHIA®\nREZLIDHIA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute\nmyeloid leukemia (AML) with a susceptible isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutation as\ndetected by an FDA-approved test.\nPlease click here for Important Safety Information and Full Prescribing Information,\nincluding Boxed WARNING, for REZLIDHIA.\nAbout GAVRETO®\nGAVRETO is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic rearranged during\ntransfection (RET) fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as detected by an\nFDA-approved test and adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with advanced\nor metastatic RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy and who are\nradioactive iodine-refractory (if radioactive iodine is appropriate).*\n*Thyroid indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate\nand duration of response.

Symptoms may include dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates/pleuropericardial effusion,\nkidney injury, hypotension, fever, and weight gain. If differentiation syndrome is suspected, withhold REZLIDHIA and initiate treatment with corticosteroids and\nhemodynamicmonitoring until symptom resolution.\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\nDifferentiation Syndrome\nREZLIDHIA can cause differentiation syndrome. In the clinical trial of REZLIDHIA in patients with relapsed or refractory AML, differentiation syndrome occurred in 16% of patients, with\ngrade 3 or 4 differentiation syndrome occurring in 8% of patients treated, and fatalities in 1% of patients. Differentiation syndrome is associated with rapid proliferation and differentiation\nof myeloid cells and may be life-threatening or fatal. Symptoms of differentiation syndrome in patients treated with REZLIDHIA included leukocytosis, dyspnea, pulmonary\ninfiltrates/pleuropericardial effusion, kidney injury, fever, edema, pyrexia, and weight gain. Of the 25 patients who experienced differentiation syndrome, 19 (76%) recovered after\ntreatment or after dose interruption of REZLIDHIA. Differentiation syndrome occurred as early as 1 day and up to 18 months after REZLIDHIA initiation and has been observed with or\nwithout concomitant leukocytosis.\nIf differentiation syndrome is suspected, temporarily withhold REZLIDHIA and initiate systemic corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 10 mg IV every 12 hours) for a minimum\nof 3 days and until resolution of signs and symptoms. If concomitant leukocytosis is observed, initiate treatment with hydroxyurea, as clinically indicated. Taper corticosteroids and\nhydroxyurea after resolution of symptoms. Differentiation syndrome may recur with premature discontinuation of corticosteroids and/or hydroxyurea treatment. Institute supportive\nmeasures and hemodynamic monitoring until improvement; withhold dose of REZLIDHIA and consider dose reduction based on recurrence.\nHepatotoxicity\nREZLIDHIA can cause hepatotoxicity, presenting as increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), increased blood alkaline phosphatase,\nand/or elevated bilirubin. Of 153 patients with relapsed or refractory AML who received REZLIDHIA, hepatotoxicity occurred in 23% of patients; 13% experienced grade 3 or 4\nhepatotoxicity. One patient treated with REZLIDHIA in combination with azacitidine in the clinical trial, a combination for which REZLIDHIA is not indicated, died from complications of\ndrug-induced liver injury. The median time to onset of hepatotoxicity in patients with relapsed or refractory AML treated with REZLIDHIA was 1.2 months (range: 1 day to 17.5 months)\nafter REZLIDHIA initiation, and the median time to resolution was 12 days (range: 1 day to 17 months). The most common hepatotoxicities were elevations of ALT, AST, blood alkaline\nphosphatase, and blood bilirubin\n33\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION (Cont.)\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\nHepatotoxicity\nMonitor patients frequently for clinical symptoms of hepatic dysfunction such as fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. Obtain baseline liver\nfunction tests prior to initiation of REZLIDHIA, at least once weekly for the first two months, once every other week for the third month, once in the fourth month, and once every other\nmonth for the duration of therapy. If hepatic dysfunction occurs, withhold, reduce, or permanently discontinue REZLIDHIA based on recurrence/severity.\nADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were aspartate aminotransferase increased, alanine aminotransferase increased, potassium\ndecreased, sodium decreased, alkaline phosphatase increased, nausea, creatinine increased, fatigue/malaise, arthralgia, constipation, lymphocytes increased, bilirubin increased,\nleukocytosis, uric acid increased, dyspnea, pyrexia, rash, lipase increased, mucositis, diarrhea and transaminitis.\nDRUG INTERACTIONS\n• Avoid concomitant use of REZLIDHIA with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers.\n• Avoid concomitant use of REZLIDHIA with sensitive CYP3A substrates unless otherwise instructed in the substrates prescribing information. If concomitant use is unavoidable, monitor\npatients for loss of therapeutic effect of these drugs.\nLACTATION\nAdvise women not to breastfeed during treatment with REZLIDHIA and for 2 weeks after the last dose.\nGERIATRIC USE\nNo overall differences in effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years and older and younger patients. Compared to patients younger than 65 years of age, an increase in\nincidence of hepatotoxicity and hypertension was observed in patients ≥65 years of age.\nHEPATIC IMPAIRMENT\nIn patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, closely monitor for increased probability of differentiation syndrome.\nYou may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.\nPlease see https://www.REZLIDHIA.com/ for full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNING.\n34\nAbout GAVRETO® (pralsetinib)\nINDICATIONS\nGAVRETO (pralsetinib) is indicated for the treatment of:\n• Adult patients with metastatic rearranged during transfection (RET) fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as detected by an FDA-approved test\n• Adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy and who are radioactive\niodine-refractory (if radioactive iodine is appropriate)*\n*This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon\nverification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n• Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis: Severe, life-threatening, and fatal ILD/pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with GAVRETO. Pneumonitis occurred in 12% of\npatients who received GAVRETO, including 3.3% with Grade 3-4, and 0.2% with fatal reactions. Monitor for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Withhold\nGAVRETO and promptly investigate for ILD in any patient who presents with acute or worsening of respiratory symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, cough, and fever). Withhold, reduce\ndose or permanently discontinue GAVRETO based on severity of confirmed ILD.\n• Hypertension: Occurred in 35% of patients, including Grade 3 hypertension in 18% of patients. Overall, 8% had their dose interrupted and 4.8% had their dose reduced for\nhypertension. Treatment-emergent hypertension was most commonly managed with anti-hypertension medications. Do not initiate GAVRETO in patients with uncontrolled\nhypertension. Optimize blood pressure prior to initiating GAVRETO. Monitor blood pressure after 1 week, at least monthly thereafter and as clinically indicated. Initiate or adjust\nanti-hypertensive therapy as appropriate. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue GAVRETO based on the severity.\n• Hepatotoxicity: Serious hepatic adverse reactions occurred in 1.5% of patients treated with GAVRETO. Increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) occurred in 49% of patients,\nincluding Grade 3 or 4 in 7% and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) occurred in 37% of patients, including Grade 3 or 4 in 4.8%. The median time to first onset for\nincreased AST was 15 days (range: 5 days to 2.5 years) and increased ALT was 24 days (range: 7 days to 3.7 years). Monitor AST and ALT prior to initiating GAVRETO, every 2\nweeks during the first 3 months, then monthly thereafter and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose or permanently discontinue GAVRETO based on severity.\n• Hemorrhagic Events: Serious, including fatal, hemorrhagic events can occur with GAVRETO. Grade ≥3 events occurred in 4.1% of patients treated with GAVRETO including one\npatient with a fatal hemorrhagic event. Permanently discontinue GAVRETO in patients with severe or life-threatening hemorrhage.\n• Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): Cases of TLS have been reported in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma receiving GAVRETO. Patients may be at risk of TLS if they have\nrapidly growing tumors, a high tumor burden, renal dysfunction, or dehydration. Closely monitor patients at risk, consider appropriate prophylaxis including hydration, and treat\nas clinically indicated.\n35\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION (Cont.)\n• Risk of Impaired Wound Healing: Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling\npathway. Therefore, GAVRETO has the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Withhold GAVRETO for at least 5 days prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at\nleast 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of GAVRETO after resolution of wound healing complications has not been\nestablished.\n• Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, GAVRETO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise\npregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with GAVRETO and\nfor 2 weeks after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with GAVRETO and for 1 week\nafter the last dose.\n• Common adverse reactions (≥25%) were musculoskeletal pain, constipation, hypertension, diarrhea, fatigue, edema, pyrexia, and cough. Common Grade 3/4 laboratory\nabnormalities (≥2%) were decreased lymphocytes, decreased neutrophils, decreased hemoglobin, decreased phosphate, decreased leukocytes, decreased sodium,\nincreased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), decreased calcium (corrected), decreased platelets, increased alkaline phosphatase,\nincreased potassium, decreased potassium, and increased bilirubin.\n• Avoid coadministration of GAVRETO with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors, P-gp inhibitors, or combined P-gp and strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. If coadministration\ncannot be avoided, reduce the GAVRETO dose. Avoid coadministration of GAVRETO with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers. If coadministration cannot be avoided,\nincrease the GAVRETO dose.\n• Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with GAVRETO and for 1 week after the last dose.\n• Pediatric Use: Monitor open growth plates in adolescent patients. Consider interrupting or discontinuing GAVRETO if abnormalities occur.\nYou may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.\nPlease see https://www.GAVRETO.com/ for full Prescribing Information.\n36 RIGL_FRN-24057\nThank You\nwww.rigel.com\n37"
