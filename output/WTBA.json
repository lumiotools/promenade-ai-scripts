Our incredible team of dedicated West Bankers positions us\nwell to face today’s challenges and to capitalize on opportunities. We believe those\nopportunities will continue to grow as we have completed the construction of\npermanent offices in both St. Cloud and Mankato, Minnesota, and look forward to\nthe completion of our new corporate headquarters in West Des Moines, Iowa, and a\npermanent office in Owatonna, Minnesota, later this year.\nLike others in our industry, our company experienced some significant margin\nchallenges during 2023. The interest rate environment, including dramatic\nincreases in short-term rates, an ongoing inverted yield curve, and aggressive\ndeposit competition, all significantly impacted our cost of funds and net interest\nmargin. We understand the forces challenging our industry, and we have a clear\nvision of our path forward to more normalized margins.\nDespite the challenges of this environment, our credit quality remains pristine. We\nhold no loans greater than 30 days past due and essentially no problem loans as of\nDecember 31, 2023. We continue to closely monitor and manage our credit quality\nas the economy changes and our customers respond to the higher interest rate environment.\nWest Bank is 131 years old and is the oldest business of any type to be founded and remain\nheadquartered in West Des Moines, Iowa. The development of our new headquarters has been many\nyears in the making as part of our strategic plan. We have been a tenant in our current building for\n52 years and planned for the creation of a new bank-owned headquarters to coincide with the\nexpiration of our lease in 2024. Because of our steadfast commitment to invest in our community,\nwe chose to construct the building on a site badly in need of revitalization. Redevelopment—versus\nbuilding on clean ground—added complexity to our project, but we believe this step to help our\ncommunity provides both strong leadership and an investment model for other businesses to follow.\nOur newest facilities serve as a point of pride in which our teams will work, collaborate, and continue\nto provide excellent service to our customers for decades to come. They also serve as venues for\nbusiness development events and provide opportunities to cultivate new and existing customer\nrelationships, which are central to our business model.\nWe appreciate and thank you for your continued support and interest in our company.\nSincerely,\nDavid D.

Kay is a highly experienced banking\nprofessional with an impressive 51-year career at West Bank. She has held many leadership positions within\nthe bank, ranging from financial and accounting to heading up the customer service department, ensuring that\nWest Bank’s customers received top-notch service.\nKay joined the company in 1972 as a teller shortly after graduating from Grandview College. Kay was hired\nwhen West Bank was adding additional staff in anticipation of opening the brand new “Main” Bank at 1601\n22nd Street in West Des Moines. Throughout her time at West Bank, Kay has demonstrated her versatility and\nexpertise by taking on various customer-facing roles. However, her passion for the intricacies of banking led\nher to transition to a back-office role in the bookkeeping department, where she developed a keen attention to\ndetail and meticulousness, which became the foundation of her successful banking career.\nThroughout her impressive tenure at West Bank, Kay has continued to learn and grow, making valuable\ncontributions along the way. Her remarkable dedication to banking and commitment to learning serve as an\ninspiration to her colleagues and peers.\nMILESTONE\nANNIVERSARIES:\n≥ AL PETERSEN\n20 Years\n≥ MARK MOORE\n20 Years\n≥ GEOFF GADE\n30 Years\n≥ BARRY CROPP\n30 Years\n≥ RICHARD MOCKOBEE\n35 Years\nThe Iowa Bankers Association presented West Bank Chair and CEO Dave Nelson with the James A. Leach Leadership\nAward in 2023, during the Iowa Bankers Association (IBA) Annual Convention at Veterans Memorial Auditorium. The IBA\ncreated the Leach Award in 2000 in honor of Congressman James A. Leach, a previous chairman of the U.S. House Banking\nCommittee. This annual award honors an Iowa banker who, like Leach, has worked to support and uplift Iowa banking and\nIowa communities.\nDave began his 39-year career in community banking in 1984, becoming a bank president in Rochester, Minnesota, in\n1995. He served in that capacity until joining West Bank as CEO in 2010. He is an approachable leader who is personally\ncommitted to and invested in the success of not just his West Bank team and customers, but also the bank’s communities.\nDuring his time at West Bank, Dave has made significant contributions both to the success of West Bank and to community\nbanking in Iowa. Under his leadership, West Bank has been repeatedly recognized as one of the best-performing banks in\nAmerica by numerous national publications; in many of those instances, West Bank was one of very few in the Midwest to\nbe recognized.\nAs an advocate for community banking, Dave served as chairman of the Iowa Bankers Association from 2016-2017. He now\nserves on the board of directors for the American Bankers Association (ABA). He regularly travels to Washington, D.C., to\ntalk to representatives in Congress and keeps in regular contact with our elected representatives to consult with them on\nmatters impacting community banks.\nDAVE NELSON\nIOWA BANKERS ASSOCIATION JAMES A.

Our incredible team of dedicated West Bankers positions us\nwell to face today’s challenges and to capitalize on opportunities. We believe those\nopportunities will continue to grow as we have completed the construction of\npermanent offices in both St. Cloud and Mankato, Minnesota, and look forward to\nthe completion of our new corporate headquarters in West Des Moines, Iowa, and a\npermanent office in Owatonna, Minnesota, later this year.\nLike others in our industry, our company experienced some significant margin\nchallenges during 2023. The interest rate environment, including dramatic\nincreases in short-term rates, an ongoing inverted yield curve, and aggressive\ndeposit competition, all significantly impacted our cost of funds and net interest\nmargin. We understand the forces challenging our industry, and we have a clear\nvision of our path forward to more normalized margins.\nDespite the challenges of this environment, our credit quality remains pristine. We\nhold no loans greater than 30 days past due and essentially no problem loans as of\nDecember 31, 2023. We continue to closely monitor and manage our credit quality\nas the economy changes and our customers respond to the higher interest rate environment.\nWest Bank is 131 years old and is the oldest business of any type to be founded and remain\nheadquartered in West Des Moines, Iowa. The development of our new headquarters has been many\nyears in the making as part of our strategic plan. We have been a tenant in our current building for\n52 years and planned for the creation of a new bank-owned headquarters to coincide with the\nexpiration of our lease in 2024. Because of our steadfast commitment to invest in our community,\nwe chose to construct the building on a site badly in need of revitalization. Redevelopment—versus\nbuilding on clean ground—added complexity to our project, but we believe this step to help our\ncommunity provides both strong leadership and an investment model for other businesses to follow.\nOur newest facilities serve as a point of pride in which our teams will work, collaborate, and continue\nto provide excellent service to our customers for decades to come. They also serve as venues for\nbusiness development events and provide opportunities to cultivate new and existing customer\nrelationships, which are central to our business model.\nWe appreciate and thank you for your continued support and interest in our company.\nSincerely,\nDavid D.

Kay is a highly experienced banking\nprofessional with an impressive 51-year career at West Bank. She has held many leadership positions within\nthe bank, ranging from financial and accounting to heading up the customer service department, ensuring that\nWest Bank’s customers received top-notch service.\nKay joined the company in 1972 as a teller shortly after graduating from Grandview College. Kay was hired\nwhen West Bank was adding additional staff in anticipation of opening the brand new “Main” Bank at 1601\n22nd Street in West Des Moines. Throughout her time at West Bank, Kay has demonstrated her versatility and\nexpertise by taking on various customer-facing roles. However, her passion for the intricacies of banking led\nher to transition to a back-office role in the bookkeeping department, where she developed a keen attention to\ndetail and meticulousness, which became the foundation of her successful banking career.\nThroughout her impressive tenure at West Bank, Kay has continued to learn and grow, making valuable\ncontributions along the way. Her remarkable dedication to banking and commitment to learning serve as an\ninspiration to her colleagues and peers.\nMILESTONE\nANNIVERSARIES:\n≥ AL PETERSEN\n20 Years\n≥ MARK MOORE\n20 Years\n≥ GEOFF GADE\n30 Years\n≥ BARRY CROPP\n30 Years\n≥ RICHARD MOCKOBEE\n35 Years\nThe Iowa Bankers Association presented West Bank Chair and CEO Dave Nelson with the James A. Leach Leadership\nAward in 2023, during the Iowa Bankers Association (IBA) Annual Convention at Veterans Memorial Auditorium. The IBA\ncreated the Leach Award in 2000 in honor of Congressman James A. Leach, a previous chairman of the U.S. House Banking\nCommittee. This annual award honors an Iowa banker who, like Leach, has worked to support and uplift Iowa banking and\nIowa communities.\nDave began his 39-year career in community banking in 1984, becoming a bank president in Rochester, Minnesota, in\n1995. He served in that capacity until joining West Bank as CEO in 2010. He is an approachable leader who is personally\ncommitted to and invested in the success of not just his West Bank team and customers, but also the bank’s communities.\nDuring his time at West Bank, Dave has made significant contributions both to the success of West Bank and to community\nbanking in Iowa. Under his leadership, West Bank has been repeatedly recognized as one of the best-performing banks in\nAmerica by numerous national publications; in many of those instances, West Bank was one of very few in the Midwest to\nbe recognized.\nAs an advocate for community banking, Dave served as chairman of the Iowa Bankers Association from 2016-2017. He now\nserves on the board of directors for the American Bankers Association (ABA). He regularly travels to Washington, D.C., to\ntalk to representatives in Congress and keeps in regular contact with our elected representatives to consult with them on\nmatters impacting community banks.\nDAVE NELSON\nIOWA BANKERS ASSOCIATION JAMES A.

BUSINESS\n\nGeneral Development of Business\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. (the Company or West Bancorporation) is an Iowa corporation and a financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHCA). The Company was formed in 1984 to own West Bank, an Iowa-chartered bank headquartered in West Des Moines, Iowa. West Bank is a business-focused community bank that was organized in 1893. The Company’s primary activity during 2023 was the ownership of West Bank. The Company’s and West Bank’s only business is banking, and therefore, no segment information is presented in this report.\n\nAs a financial holding company, the Company has additional flexibility to engage in a broader range of financial activities through affiliates than are permissible for bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. While the Company does not currently have a plan to engage in any new activities, as a financial holding company, it has the ability to respond more quickly to market developments and opportunities. \n\nThe Company currently operates in the following markets: central Iowa, which is generally the greater Des Moines metropolitan area; eastern Iowa, which includes the area surrounding Iowa City and Coralville; and southern Minnesota, which includes the cities of Rochester, Owatonna, Mankato and St. Cloud. \n\n5\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nDuring 2023, the Company received a number of financial performance recognitions, including the following:\n\n•West Bancorporation received national recognition from investment bank and research firm Raymond James in the annual Raymond James Community Bankers Cup, which identifies America’s top performing publicly traded community banks with assets between $500 million and $10 billion. The Raymond James Community Bankers Cup recognizes the top 10 percent of exchange-traded community banks based on various profitability, operational efficiency, and balance sheet metrics. Raymond James ranked West Bancorporation number 13 in the nation for 2022. West Bancorporation has been recognized for this award nine out of the last ten years. \n\n•S&P Global Market Intelligence ranked West Bancorporation as the 17th best-performing large community bank for 2022 among banks with assets between $3 billion and $10 billion. The rankings were based on various measures related to profitability, growth and asset quality. This was the third consecutive year that West Bancorporation was recognized on this list.\n\n•West Bancorporation was recognized as one of the nation’s top 200 banks with assets between $2 billion and $10 billion by American Banker, based on three-year average return on equity as of December 31, 2022. West Bank ranked 18th overall on American Banker’s list and was the top ranked bank of the three Iowa and Minnesota banks on the list.\n\nThe Company continues to grow, as loans outstanding at the end of 2023 totaled $2.9 billion compared to $2.7 billion at the end of 2022, an increase of 6.7 percent. Total deposits increased 3.2 percent as of December 31, 2023 from the balances as of December 31, 2022. The Company continues to focus on expanding existing and entering into new customer relationships while maintaining strong credit quality. We anticipate that the current monetary policies of the Federal Reserve will continue to affect customer deposit activity and loan demand in 2024.\n\nThe Company declared and paid cash dividends on its common stock totaling $1.00 per share in 2023 and declared a $0.25 quarterly dividend on January 24, 2024, payable on February 21, 2024, to stockholders of record on February 7, 2024. The Company expects to continue paying regular quarterly dividends in the future. In the opinion of management, the capital position of the Company is strong. At December 31, 2023, the Company’s tangible common equity ratio was 5.88 percent compared to 5.84 percent at December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no intangible assets or preferred stock outstanding. Additional information on capital can be found in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\nDescription of the Company’s Business\n\nWest Bank provides full-service community banking and trust services to customers located primarily in the following metropolitan areas: Des Moines, Coralville and Iowa City, Iowa, and Rochester, Owatonna, Mankato and St. Cloud, Minnesota. West Bank has six offices in the Des Moines area, one office in Coralville, Iowa and one office in each of our four Minnesota markets. In 2023, West Bank completed construction of a permanent branch office in Mankato, Minnesota. Additionally, construction continued for the new headquarters building in West Des Moines, Iowa and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2024. West Bank offers many types of credit to its customers, including commercial, real estate and consumer loans. West Bank offers trust services, including the administration of estates, conservatorships, personal trusts and agency accounts. \n\nWest Bank offers a full range of deposit services, including checking, savings and money market accounts and time certificates of deposit. West Bank also offers online banking, mobile banking and treasury management services, which help to meet the banking needs of its customers. Treasury management services offered to business customers include cash management, client-generated automated clearing house transactions, remote deposit and fraud protection services. Also offered are merchant credit card processing and corporate credit cards. \n\nWest Bank’s business strategy emphasizes strong business and personal relationships between West Bank and its customers and the delivery of products and services that meet the individualized needs of those customers. West Bank also emphasizes strong cost controls, while striving to achieve an above average return on equity. To accomplish these goals, West Bank focuses on small- to medium-sized businesses in its local markets that traditionally wish to develop an exclusive relationship with a single bank. West Bank has the size to provide the personal attention required by local business owners and the financial expertise and entrepreneurial attitude to help businesses meet their financial service needs. \n\n6\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we conducted banking operations through 11 locations in central and eastern Iowa and southern Minnesota. The economies in our market areas are well diversified. We believe that an important factor contributing to our historical performance and our ability to execute our strategic priorities is the vibrancy of our markets. Our markets are home to major financial services companies, healthcare systems, educational institutions, technology and agribusiness companies, and state and local governments. Our markets host major employers such as Principal Financial Group, Wells Fargo, Hy-Vee, John Deere, Mayo Clinic, University of Iowa, University of Iowa Health Care, MercyOne, UnityPoint Health, CentraCare Health Systems and IBM. \n\nThe markets in which we operate have generally experienced stable population growth over the past five years. Des Moines-West Des Moines is the largest metropolitan statistical area (MSA) in Iowa, while Iowa City and Coralville make up the fourth largest MSA in Iowa. Rochester and St. Cloud are the third and fourth largest MSAs in Minnesota. We believe our markets are stable and have weathered the economic challenges of the last few years relatively well. Unemployment rates in all our markets are below the national unemployment rate of 3.7 percent as of December 31, 2023, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \n\nThe market areas served by West Bank are highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits. West Bank competes with other commercial banks, credit unions, mortgage companies and other financial service providers, including financial technology (FinTech) companies. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) Summary of Deposits as of June 30, 2023, West Bank ranked eighth in the state of Iowa in terms of deposit share. Some of West Bank’s competitors are locally controlled, while others are regional, national or international companies. The larger, international, national or regional banks have certain competitive advantages due to their ability to undertake substantial advertising campaigns and allocate their investment assets to out-of-market geographic regions with potentially higher returns. Such banks also offer certain services, such as international and conduit financing transactions, which are not offered directly by West Bank. These larger banking organizations also have much higher legal lending limits than West Bank, and therefore, may be better able to service large regional, national and global commercial customers. The financial services industry has become even more competitive as a result of recent Federal Reserve rate increases and legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks, such as FinTech companies, to offer deposit and loan products and services traditionally provided by banks.\n\nIn order to compete to the fullest extent possible with the other financial institutions in its primary market areas, West Bank uses the flexibility and knowledge of its local management, Board of Directors and community advisors. West Bank has a group of community advisors in each of its markets who provide insight to management on current business activity levels and trends. West Bank seeks to capitalize on customers who desire to do business with a local institution. This includes emphasizing specialized services, local promotional activities, and personal contacts by West Bank’s officers, directors and employees. In particular, West Bank competes for loans primarily by offering competitive interest rates, experienced lending personnel with local decision-making authority, flexible loan arrangements, quality products and services, and proactive relationship management. West Bank competes for deposits principally by offering depositors a variety of straight-forward deposit products along with electronic access and other personalized services. \n\nWest Bank also competes with the general financial markets for funds. Yields on corporate and government debt securities and commercial paper affect West Bank’s ability to attract and hold deposits. West Bank also competes for funds with money market accounts and similar investment vehicles offered by brokerage firms, mutual fund companies, internet banks and others. The competition for these funds is based almost exclusively on yields to customers.\n\nHuman Capital Management\n\nWe believe that the success of our business is largely due to the quality of our employees, the development of each employee's full potential and the Company's ability to provide timely and satisfying rewards. We encourage and support the development of our employees and, whenever possible, strive to fill vacancies with internal candidates. We invest in education and development programs, including tuition reimbursement for courses and degree programs and fees paid for certifications. We encourage employees to seek educational opportunities for both industry knowledge and professional development. \n\nWe believe that diversity encourages innovation and inclusion, and our team’s differences give us a competitive advantage. Our goal is to foster a culture in which those differences are valued and respected. Our team is made up of 181 full-time employees and 9 part-time employees. We are proud of our culturally and gender diverse workforce, with approximately 14 percent identifying as persons of color and approximately 59 percent as female. \n\n7\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nWe continue to invest in initiatives aimed at the growth and readiness of our workforce, including our West Bank Women’s Impact Network (WIN). Since 2014, WIN connects and expands relationships among women at West Bank with women in our communities and our customers. The network builds a system of sponsors and mentors to provide more opportunities for women in leadership at West Bank and furthers our impact on the community through support and sponsorship of women’s leadership initiatives. 20 percent of West Bank’s current executive management team and 48 percent of officers and department managers are women. Currently, women comprise 25 percent of the directors on our Board of Directors. \n\nAs part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive compensation and benefit programs for our employees in order to attract and retain talent. The goal of our compensation program is to create superior long-term value for our stockholders by attracting, motivating and retaining outstanding employees who serve our customers while generating financial performance that is consistently better than our peers. Our business model allows us to operate with fewer employees than the typical commercial bank of our size because we emphasize teamwork, sound practices and a focus on business banking. Because we have fewer people, we need to have the right people and ensure that we offer what we consider to be above average pay in exchange for above average performance. Our employees are provided a formal performance evaluation annually that includes discussion of the opportunity for advancement and career development. \n\nIn addition to competitive base wages, additional programs include annual bonus opportunities, Company-matched 401(k) and discretionary 401(k) contributions, stock award opportunities, educational expense reimbursement, insurance benefits, paid time off, family leave and employee assistance programs. Our best-in-class health care plans, including medical, dental, vision, short-term and long-term disability and life insurance, reflect a sincere investment in our colleagues’ physical, emotional and financial well-being. Offering premium coverage through our health insurance provider, our employees are afforded a large network of doctors and the Company pays 75 percent of monthly medical premiums for employees enrolled.\n\nOur approach also promotes longevity in our workforce. The average tenure of our employees is over eight years. Approximately 19 percent have been with West Bank for 10-15 years and approximately 21 percent have been with West Bank for over 15 years. Non-teller turnover was approximately 10 percent in 2023, compared to 11 percent in 2022. We conduct periodic company-wide employee engagement surveys to assess employee satisfaction and engagement. \n\nSuccession planning and talent development are important at all levels within our organization. The Board oversees executive management’s succession plan for our named executive officers. The Board’s succession planning activities are ongoing and strategic. In addition, the CEO annually provides the Board with his assessment of senior leaders and their potential to succeed at key senior management positions. \n\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) & Corporate Responsibility\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. strives to be a good corporate citizen by operating as an employer that is committed to our vibrant and diverse workforce and by conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner. The Board carefully considers corporate social responsibility when it works with management to determine the Company’s strategic priorities and plans to achieve such priorities. Learn more about our ESG practices on the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.westbankstrong.com under Investor Relations/Overview/Governance documents.\n\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\n\nGeneral \n\nFDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and their affiliates are extensively regulated under federal and state law. As a result, our growth and earnings performance may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the Iowa Division of Banking, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the FDIC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Furthermore, taxation laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), securities laws administered by the SEC and state securities authorities, and anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) have an impact on our business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and accounting rules are significant to our operations and results.\n\n8\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nFederal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of FDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and affiliates that is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC-insured deposits and depositors of banks, rather than stockholders. These federal and state laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of our business; the kinds and amounts of investments we may make; required capital levels relative to our assets; the nature and amount of collateral for loans; the establishment of branches; our ability to merge, consolidate and acquire; dealings with our insiders and affiliates; and our payment of dividends. In reaction to the global financial crisis and particularly following passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act), we experienced heightened regulatory requirements and scrutiny. Although the reforms primarily targeted systemically important financial service providers, their influence filtered down in varying degrees to community banks over time and caused our compliance and risk management processes, and the costs thereof, to increase. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (Regulatory Relief Act) eliminated questions about the applicability of certain Dodd-Frank Act reforms to community bank systems, including relieving us of any requirement to engage in mandatory stress tests, maintain a risk committee or comply with the Volcker Rule’s complicated prohibitions on proprietary trading and ownership of private funds. We believe these reforms have been favorable to our operations.\n\nThe supervisory framework for U.S. banking organizations subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that are not publicly available and that can impact the conduct and growth of their business. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations.\n\nThe following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to the Company and West Bank. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision.\n\nSupervision and Regulation of the Company\n\nGeneral. The Company, as the sole stockholder of West Bank, is a bank holding company that has elected financial holding company status. As a bank holding company, we are registered with, and subject to regulation by, the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHCA). We are legally obligated to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to West Bank and to commit resources to support West Bank in circumstances where we might not otherwise do so. Under the BHCA, we are subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve and are required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports of our operations and such additional information regarding our operations as the Federal Reserve may require.\n\nAcquisitions and Activities/Financial Holding Company Election. The primary purpose of a bank holding company is to control and manage banks. The BHCA generally requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for any merger involving a bank holding company or any acquisition by a bank holding company of another bank or bank holding company. Subject to certain conditions (including deposit concentration limits established by the BHCA), the Federal Reserve may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the United States. In approving interstate acquisitions, the Federal Reserve is required to give effect to applicable state law limitations on the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its FDIC-insured institution affiliates in the state in which the target bank is located (provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-state institutions or their holding companies) and state laws that require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) before being acquired by an out-of-state bank holding company. Furthermore, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies must be well-capitalized and well-managed in order to effect interstate mergers or acquisitions.\n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nThe BHCA generally prohibits the Company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries. This general prohibition is subject to a number of exceptions. The principal exception allows bank holding companies to engage in, and to own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the Federal Reserve prior to November 11, 1999 to be “so closely related to banking ... as to be a proper incident thereto.” This authority would permit us to engage in a variety of banking-related businesses, including the ownership and operation of a savings association, or any entity engaged in consumer finance, equipment leasing, the operation of a computer service bureau (including software development) and mortgage banking and brokerage services. The BHCA does not place territorial restrictions on the domestic activities of nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies.\n\nAdditionally, bank holding companies that meet certain eligibility requirements prescribed by the BHCA and elect to operate as financial holding companies may engage in, or own shares in companies engaged in, a wider range of nonbanking activities, including securities and insurance underwriting and sales, merchant banking and any other activity that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines by regulation or order is financial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity or that the Federal Reserve determines by order to be complementary to any such financial activity, as long as the activity does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of FDIC-insured institutions or the financial system generally. In the third quarter of 2016, we elected to operate as a financial holding company. In order to maintain our status as a financial holding company, both the Company and West Bank must be well-capitalized, well-managed, and have at least a satisfactory CRA rating. If the Federal Reserve determines that either the Company or West Bank is not well-capitalized or well-managed, the Federal Reserve will provide a period of time in which to achieve compliance, but during the period of noncompliance, the Federal Reserve may place any limitations on us that it deems appropriate. Furthermore, if non-compliance is based on the failure of West Bank to achieve a satisfactory CRA rating, we would not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities. As of December 31, 2023, we retained our election as a financial holding company, but we have not engaged in any activity and do not own any assets for which a financial holding company designation was required. The election affords the ability to respond more quickly to market developments and opportunities.\n\nChange in Control. Federal law prohibits any person or company from acquiring “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution or its holding company without prior notice to the appropriate federal bank regulator. Control is conclusively presumed to exist upon the acquisition of 25 percent or more of the outstanding voting securities of a bank or bank holding company, but may arise under certain circumstances between 10 percent and 24.99 percent ownership.\n\nCompany Capital Requirements. The Company is subject to complex consolidated capital requirements of the Basel III rule, see “—the Basel III Rule” below.\n\nDividend Payments. Our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may be affected by both general corporate law considerations and policies of the Federal Reserve applicable to bank holding companies. As an Iowa corporation, we are subject to the limitations of Iowa law, which allows us to pay dividends unless, after such dividend, (i) we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or (ii) our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus any amount that would be needed if we were to be dissolved at the time of the dividend payment, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of stockholders whose rights are superior to the rights of the stockholders receiving the distribution.\n\nAs a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends to stockholders if: (i) the company’s net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. The Federal Reserve also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies.\n\nMonetary Policy. The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has a significant effect on the operating results of financial or bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, and this is evidenced in its increases in the targeted federal funds rate throughout 2022 and 2023. Among the tools available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market transactions in U.S. government securities and changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nFederal Securities Regulation. Our common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Consequently, we are subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act.\n\nCorporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act addressed many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. It increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a nonbinding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments, and authorizing the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate and solicit voters for their own candidates using a company’s proxy materials. The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of bank holding companies, regardless of whether such companies are publicly traded.\n\nSupervision and Regulation of West Bank\n\nGeneral. West Bank is an Iowa-chartered bank. The deposit accounts of West Bank are insured by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) to the maximum extent provided under federal law and FDIC regulations, currently $250,000 per insured depositor category. As an Iowa-chartered FDIC-insured bank, West Bank is subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the Iowa Division of Banking, the chartering authority for Iowa banks, and the FDIC, designated by federal law as the primary federal regulator of insured state banks that, like West Bank, are not members of the Federal Reserve System (nonmember banks).\n\nDeposit Insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, West Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system whereby FDIC-insured institutions pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification. For institutions, like West Bank, that are not considered large and highly complex banking organizations, assessments are now based on examination ratings and financial ratios. The total base assessment rates currently range from 2.5 basis points to 32 basis points. \n\nAt least semi-annually, the FDIC updates its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, increases or decreases the assessment rates, following notice and comment on proposed rulemaking. For this purpose, the reserve ratio is the DIF balance divided by estimated insured deposits. In response to the global financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% of estimated amount of total insured deposits. In the semiannual update in June 2022, the FDIC projected that the reserve ratio was at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum of 1.35% by September 30, 2028, the statutory deadline. Based on this update, the FDIC approved an increase in initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules by two basis points, applicable to all insured depository institutions. The increase was effective on January 1, 2023, applicable to the first quarterly assessment period of the 2023 assessment (January 1 through March 31, 2023). \n\nIn addition, because the total cost of the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank was approximately $16.3 billion, the FDIC adopted a special assessment for banks having deposits above $5 billion, at an annual rate of 13.4 basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024 (January 1 through March 31, 2024) with an invoice payment date of June 28, 2024, and will continue to collect special assessments for an anticipated total of eight quarterly assessment periods. The base for the special assessment is equal to an insured depository institution’s estimated uninsured deposits for the December 31, 2022 reporting period, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits. Because West Bank’s uninsured deposits at December 31, 2023 were less than $5 billion, this special assessment does not apply.\n\nSupervisory Assessments. All Iowa banks are required to pay supervisory assessments to the Iowa Division of Banking to fund the operations of that agency. The amount of the assessment is calculated on the basis of West Bank’s total assets.\n\nBank Capital Requirements. Regulatory capital represents the net assets of a banking organization available to absorb losses. Because of the risks attendant to their business, FDIC-insured institutions generally are required to hold more capital than other businesses, which directly affects our earnings capabilities. Although capital has historically been one of the key measures of the financial health of both bank holding companies and banks, its role became fundamentally more important in the wake of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, as the banking regulators recognized that the amount and quality of capital held by banks prior to the crisis was insufficient to absorb losses during periods of severe stress.\n\n11\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nIn July 2023, federal banking agencies proposed a revision to capital rules that would apply to all banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total assets. The rules are intended to improve consistency of risk measurement in the capital rules for large banking organizations; apply the capital standards for large banking organizations to a broader set of large banking organizations to ensure regulatory capital is calculated in a consistent manner; require all large banking organizations to meet the supplementary leverage ratio requirements. Smaller banking organizations could be subject to the newly revised market risk capital rule if its trading assets and trading liabilities are at least $5 billion or at least 10 percent of its total assets, to satisfy minimum capital requirements. If finalized, the proposal would provide transition provisions to allow banking organizations sufficient time to adjust to the proposed requirements. Specifically, the proposal would phase in the requirements over three years, such that the new provisions would be fully implemented starting in the fourth year after the effective date of the rule.\n\nCapital Levels. Banks have been required to hold minimum levels of capital based on guidelines established by the bank regulatory agencies since 1983. The minimums have been expressed in terms of ratios of “capital” divided by “total assets”. The capital guidelines for U.S. banks beginning in 1989 have been based upon international capital accords (known as “Basel” rules) adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a committee of central banks and bank supervisors that acts as the primary global standard-setter for prudential regulation, as implemented by the U.S. bank regulatory agencies on an interagency basis. The accords recognized that bank assets for the purpose of the capital ratio calculations needed to be risk weighted (the theory being that riskier assets should require more capital) and that off-balance sheet exposures needed to be factored in the calculations. Following the global financial crisis, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced agreement on a strengthened set of capital requirements for banking organizations around the world, known as Basel III, to address deficiencies recognized in connection with the global financial crisis.\n\nBasel III Rule.The United States bank regulatory agencies adopted the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, and, at the same time, effected changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act, in regulations that were effective (with certain phase-ins) in 2015 (Basel III Rule). Basel III established capital standards for banks and bank holding companies that are meaningfully more stringent than those in place previously: it increased the required quantity and quality of capital; and it required a more complex, detailed and calibrated assessment of risk in the calculation of risk weightings. The Basel III Rule is applicable to all banking organizations that are subject to minimum capital requirements, including federal and state banks and savings and loan associations, as well as to most bank and savings and loan holding companies. Thus, West Bank is subject to the Basel III Rule as described below.\n\nNot only did the Basel III Rule increase most of the required minimum capital ratios in effect prior to January 1, 2015, but, in requiring that forms of capital be of higher quality to absorb loss, it introduced the concept of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, which consists primarily of common stock, related surplus (net of Treasury stock), retained earnings, and Common Equity Tier 1 minority interests subject to certain regulatory adjustments. The Basel III Rule also changed the definition of capital by establishing more stringent criteria that instruments must meet to be considered Additional Tier 1 Capital (primarily non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock that meets certain requirements) and Tier 2 Capital (primarily other types of preferred stock and subordinated debt, subject to limitations). The Basel III Rule also constrained the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, and deferred tax assets in capital and required deductions from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital if such assets exceeded a percentage of a banking institution’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.\n\nThe Basel III Rule required minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015, as follows: \n\n•A ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets;\n\n•A ratio of Tier 1 Capital equal to 6% of risk-weighted assets; \n\n•A continuation of the minimum required amount of Total Capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) at 8% of risk-weighted assets; and\n\n•A leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total quarterly average assets equal to 4% in all circumstances.\n\nIn addition, institutions that seek the freedom to make capital distributions (including for dividends and repurchases of stock) and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction must also maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to a capital conservation buffer. The purpose of the conservation buffer is to ensure that banking institutions maintain a buffer of capital that can be used to absorb losses during periods of financial and economic stress. Factoring in the conservation buffer increases the minimum ratios depicted above to 7% for Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, 8.5% for Tier 1 Capital and 10.5% for Total Capital.\n\n12\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nWell-Capitalized Requirements.The ratios described above are minimum standards in order for banking organizations to be considered “adequately capitalized.” Bank regulatory agencies uniformly encourage banks to hold more capital and be “well-capitalized” and, to that end, federal law and regulations provide various incentives for banking organizations to maintain regulatory capital at levels in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. For example, a banking organization that is well-capitalized may: (i) qualify for exemptions from prior notice or application requirements otherwise applicable to certain types of activities; (ii) qualify for expedited processing of other required notices or applications; and (iii) accept, roll-over or renew brokered deposits. Higher capital levels could also be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banking organizations. For example, the Federal Reserve’s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk, or the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities. Further, any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions (i.e., Tier 1 Capital less all intangible assets), well above the minimum levels.\n\nUnder the capital regulations of the FDIC, in order to be well‑capitalized, West Bank must maintain:\n\n•A Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio to risk-weighted assets of 6.5% or more; \n\n•A ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8% or more; \n\n•A ratio of Total Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 10% or more; and \n\n•A leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total adjusted average quarterly assets of 5% or greater.\n\nIt is possible under the Basel III Rule to be well-capitalized while remaining out of compliance with the capital conservation buffer discussed above.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023: (i) West Bank was not subject to a directive from Iowa Division of Banking or the FDIC to increase its capital and (ii) West Bank was well-capitalized, as defined by FDIC regulations. West Bank also was in compliance with the capital conservation buffer. \n\nPrompt Corrective Action.The concept of an institution being “well-capitalized” is part of a regulatory enforcement regime that provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take “prompt corrective action” to resolve the problems of depository institutions based on the capital level of each particular institution.The extent of the regulators’ powers depends on whether the institution in question is “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized,” in each case as defined by regulation. Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators’ corrective powers include: (i) requiring the institution to submit a capital restoration plan; (ii) limiting the institution’s asset growth and restricting its activities; (iii) requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to sell itself; (iv) restricting transactions between the institution and its affiliates; (v) restricting the interest rate that the institution may pay on deposits; (vi) ordering a new election of directors of the institution; (vii) requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; (viii) prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; (ix) requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; (x) prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and (xi) ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution.\n\nCommunity Bank Capital Simplification.Community banks have long raised concerns with bank regulators about the regulatory burden, complexity, and costs associated with certain provisions of the Basel III Rule. In response, Congress provided an “off-ramp” for institutions, like us, with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. Section 201 of the Regulatory Relief Act instructed the federal banking regulators to establish a single “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” (CBLR) of between 8 and 10%. Under the final rule, a community banking organization is eligible to elect the new framework if it has: less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited amounts of certain assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and a CBLR greater than 9%. West Bank has not elected to use the CBLR framework at this time.\n\nLiquidity Requirements. Liquidity is a measure of the ability and ease with which bank assets may be converted to meet financial obligations such as deposits or other funding sources. Banks are required to implement liquidity risk management frameworks that ensure they maintain sufficient liquidity, including a cushion of unencumbered, high quality liquid assets, to withstand a range of stress events. The level and speed of deposit outflows contributing to the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank in the first half of 2023 was unprecedented and contributed to acute liquidity and funding strain. These events have further underscored the importance of liquidity risk management and contingency funding planning by insured depository institutions like West Bank.\n\n13\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nThe primary role of liquidity risk management is to: (i) prospectively assess the need for funds to meet financial obligations; and (ii) ensure the availability of cash or collateral to fulfill those needs at the appropriate time by coordinating the various sources of funds available to the institution under normal and stressed conditions. Basel III includes a liquidity framework that requires the largest insured institutions to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests. One test, referred to as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, or LCR, is designed to ensure that the banking entity has an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets that can be converted easily and immediately in private markets into cash to meet liquidity needs for a 30-calendar day liquidity stress scenario. The other test, known as the Net Stable Funding Ratio, or NSFR, is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of FDIC-insured institutions over a one-year horizon. These tests provide an incentive for banks and holding companies to increase their holdings in Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets, increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source and rely on stable funding like core deposits (in lieu of brokered deposits).\n\nAlthough these tests do not, and will not, apply to West Bank, we continue to review our liquidity risk management policies in light of regulatory requirements and industry developments.\n\nDividend Payments. The primary source of funds for the Company is dividends from West Bank. Under the Iowa Banking Act, Iowa-chartered banks generally may pay dividends only out of undivided profits. The Iowa Division of Banking may restrict the declaration or payment of a dividend by an Iowa-chartered bank, such as West Bank. The payment of dividends by any FDIC-insured institution is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and an FDIC-insured institution generally is prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the institution would be undercapitalized. As described above, West Bank exceeded its capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of December 31, 2023. Notwithstanding the availability of funds for dividends, however, the FDIC and the Iowa Division of Banking may prohibit the payment of dividends by West Bank if either or both determine such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that want to pay dividends will have to maintain 2.5 percent in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to the capital conservation buffer. See “—Bank Capital Requirements” above.\n\nState Bank Investments and Activities. West Bank is permitted to make investments and engage in activities directly or through subsidiaries as authorized by Iowa law. However, under federal law and FDIC regulations, FDIC-insured state banks are prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from making or retaining equity investments of a type, or in an amount, that are not permissible for a national bank. Federal law and FDIC regulations also prohibit FDIC-insured state banks and their subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, from engaging as principal in any activity that is not permitted for a national bank unless West Bank meets, and continues to meet, its minimum regulatory capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity would not pose a significant risk to the DIF. These restrictions have not had, and are not currently expected to have, a material impact on the operations of West Bank.\n\nInsider Transactions. West Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on “covered transactions” between West Bank and its “affiliates.” The Company is an affiliate of West Bank for purposes of these restrictions, and covered transactions subject to the restrictions include extensions of credit to the Company, investments in the stock or other securities of the Company, and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of the Company as collateral for loans made by West Bank. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained.\n\nCertain limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by West Bank to its directors and officers, to directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries, to principal stockholders of the Company and to “related interests” of such directors, officers and principal stockholders. In addition, federal law and regulations may affect the terms on which any person who is a director or officer of the Company or West Bank, or a principal stockholder of the Company, may obtain credit from banks with which West Bank maintains a correspondent relationship.\n\nSafety and Soundness Standards/Risk Management. FDIC-insured institutions are expected to operate in a safe and sound manner. The federal banking agencies have adopted operational and managerial standards to promote the safety and soundness of such institutions that address internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings.\n\n14\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nIn general, the safety and soundness standards prescribe the goals to be achieved in each area, and each institution is responsible for establishing its own procedures to achieve those goals. If an institution fails to operate in a safe and sound manner, the FDIC-insured institution’s primary federal regulator may require the institution to submit a plan for achieving and maintaining compliance. If an FDIC-insured institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan that has been accepted by its primary federal regulator, the regulator is required to issue an order directing the institution to cure the deficiency. Until the deficiency cited in the regulator’s order is cured, the regulator may restrict the FDIC-insured institution’s rate of growth, require the FDIC-insured institution to increase its capital, restrict the rates that the institution pays on deposits or require the institution to take any action that the regulator deems appropriate under the circumstances. Operating in an unsafe or unsound manner will also constitute grounds for other enforcement action by the federal bank regulatory agencies, including cease and desist orders and civil money penalty assessments.\n\nDuring the past decade, the bank regulatory agencies have increasingly emphasized the importance of sound risk management processes and strong internal controls when evaluating the activities of the FDIC-insured institutions that they supervise. Properly managing risks has been identified as critical to the conduct of safe and sound banking activities and has become even more important as new technologies, product innovation, and the size and speed of financial transactions have changed the nature of banking markets. The agencies have identified a spectrum of risks facing a banking institution including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal and reputational risk. The key risk themes identified for 2023 are discussed under Risk Factors. West Bank is expected to have active board and senior management oversight; adequate policies, procedures and limits; adequate risk measurement, monitoring and management information systems; and comprehensive internal controls.\n\nPrivacy and Cybersecurity. West Bank is subject to many U.S. federal and state laws and regulations governing requirements for maintaining policies and procedures to protect non-public confidential information of their customers. These laws require West Bank to periodically disclose its privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and permit consumers to opt out of their ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. They also impact West Bank’s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. In addition, as a part of its operational risk mitigation, West Bank is required to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information and to require the same of its service providers. These security and privacy policies and procedures are in effect across all business lines and geographic locations.\n\nBranching Authority. Iowa banks, such as West Bank, have the authority under Iowa law to establish branches anywhere in the State of Iowa, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. The Dodd-Frank Act permits well-capitalized and well-managed banks to establish new interstate branches or the acquisition of individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) without impediments. Federal law permits state and national banks to merge with banks in other states subject to: (i) regulatory approval; (ii) federal and state deposit concentration limits; and (iii) state law limitations requiring the merging bank to have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) prior to the merger.\n\nCommunity Reinvestment Act Requirements. The CRA requires West Bank to have a continuing and affirmative obligation in a safe and sound manner to help meet the credit needs of the entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Federal regulators regularly assess West Bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of its communities. Applications for acquisitions would be affected by the evaluation of West Bank’s effectiveness in meeting its CRA requirements.\n\nOn October 24, 2023, the bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to strengthen and modernize the CRA regulations (the CRA Rule), some of which is effective on April 1, 2024. The CRA Rule is designed to update how CRA activities qualify for consideration, where CRA activities are considered, and how CRA activities are evaluated. More specifically, the bank regulatory agencies described the goals of the CRA Rule as follows: (i) to expand access to credit, investment, and basic banking services in low and moderate income communities; (ii) to adapt to changes in the banking industry, including mobile and internet banking by modernizing assessment areas while maintaining a focus on branch based areas; (iii) to provide greater clarity, consistency, and transparency in the application of the regulations through the use of standardized metrics as part of CRA evaluation and clarifying eligible CRA activities focused on low and moderate income communities and underserved rural communities; (iv) to tailor CRA rules and data collection to bank size and business model; and (v) to maintain a unified approach among the regulators. Management of West Bank is assessing the impact of the CRA Rule on its CRA lending and investment activities in its markets.\n\n15\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nAnti-Money Laundering. The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) is the common name for a series of laws and regulations enacted in the United States to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism. They are designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the U.S. financial system and have significant implications for FDIC-insured institutions and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The so-called Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime under the BSA provides a foundation to promote financial transparency and deter and detect those who seek to misuse the U.S. financial system to launder criminal proceeds, finance terrorist acts, or move funds for other illicit purposes. \n\nThe laws mandate financial services companies to have policies and procedures with respect to measures designed to address: (i) customer identification programs; (ii) money laundering; (iii) terrorist financing; (iv) identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions; (v) currency crimes; and (vi) cooperation between FDIC-insured institutions and law enforcement authorities.\n\nConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate. Concentration risk exists when FDIC-insured institutions deploy too many assets to any one industry or segment. A concentration in commercial real estate (CRE) is one example of regulatory concern. The interagency Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices guidance (CRE Guidance) provides supervisory criteria, including the following numerical indicators, to assist bank examiners in identifying banks with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) CRE loans exceeding 300 percent of capital and increasing 50 percent or more in the preceding three years; or (ii) construction and land development loans exceeding 100 percent of capital. The CRE Guidance does not limit banks’ levels of CRE lending activities, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations. On December 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies issued a statement to reinforce prudent risk-management practices related to CRE lending, having observed substantial growth in many CRE asset and lending markets, increased competitive pressures, rising CRE concentrations in banks, and an easing of CRE underwriting standards. The federal bank agencies reminded FDIC-insured institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise prudent risk-management practices to identify, measure, monitor and manage the risks arising from CRE lending. In addition, FDIC-insured institutions must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentration risk.\n\nWest Bank has historically exceeded, and continues to exceed, the 300 percent guideline for commercial real estate loans. Additional monitoring processes have been implemented to manage this increased risk.\n\nConsumer Financial Services. The historical structure of federal consumer protection regulation applicable to all providers of consumer financial products and services changed significantly on July 21, 2011, when the CFPB commenced operations to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all providers of consumer products and services, including West Bank, as well as the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over providers with more than $10 billion in assets. FDIC-insured institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, like West Bank, continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators.\n\nBecause abuses in connection with residential mortgages were a significant factor contributing to the global financial crisis, many new rules issued by the CFPB, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, addressed mortgage and mortgage-related products, their underwriting, origination, servicing and sales. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded underwriting requirements applicable to loans secured by 1-4 family residential real property and augmented federal law combating predatory lending practices. In addition to numerous disclosure requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act and the CFPB’s enabling rules imposed new standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders, including banks and savings associations, in an effort to strongly encourage lenders to verify a borrower’s ability to repay, while also establishing a presumption of compliance for certain “qualified mortgages.” The CFPB has from time to time released additional rules as to qualified mortgages and the borrower’s ability to repay. The CFPB’s rules have not had a significant impact on West Bank’s operations, except for higher compliance costs.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nThe principal executive offices of the Company are located at 1601 22nd Street, West Des Moines, Iowa 50266.

RISK FACTORS\n\nWest Bancorporation’s business is conducted almost exclusively through West Bank. West Bancorporation and West Bank are subject to many of the common risks that challenge publicly traded, regulated financial institutions. An investment in West Bancorporation’s common stock is also subject to the following specific risks. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nRisks Related to Credit Quality\n\nWe must effectively manage the credit risks of our loan portfolio.\n\nThe largest component of West Bank’s income is interest received on loans. Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. There are risks inherent in making loans, including risks of nonpayment, risks resulting from uncertainties of the future value of collateral, and risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions. We attempt to reduce our credit risk through prudent loan application, underwriting and approval procedures, including internal loan reviews before and after proceeds have been disbursed, careful monitoring of the concentration of our loans within specific industries, and collateral and guarantee requirements. These procedures cannot, however, be expected to completely eliminate our credit risks, and we can make no guarantees concerning the strength of our loan portfolio.\n\nThe information that we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete, which may result in an increased risk of default and otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect, such as fraud, or such as catastrophic events affecting certain industries. Moreover, such circumstances, including fraud, may become more likely to occur or be detected in periods of general economic uncertainty. We may also fail to receive full information with respect to the risks of a counterparty. In addition, in cases where we have extended credit against collateral, we may find that we are under-secured, for example, as a result of sudden declines in market values that reduce the value of collateral or due to fraud with respect to such collateral. If such events or circumstances were to occur, it could result in potential loss of revenue and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nOur loan portfolio includes commercial loans, which involve risks specific to commercial borrowers.\n\nWest Bank’s loan portfolio includes a significant amount of commercial real estate loans, construction and land development loans, commercial lines of credit and commercial term loans. West Bank’s typical commercial borrower is a small- or medium-sized, privately owned Iowa or Minnesota business entity. Commercial loans often have large balances, and repayment usually depends on the borrowers’ successful business operations. Commercial loans also are generally not fully repaid over the loan period and thus may require refinancing or a large payoff at maturity. If the general economy turns downward, commercial borrowers may not be able to repay their loans, and the value of their assets, which are usually pledged as collateral, may decrease rapidly and significantly. Also, when credit markets tighten due to adverse developments in specific markets or the general economy, opportunities for refinancing may become more expensive or unavailable, resulting in loan defaults.\n\nOur loan portfolio includes commercial real estate loans, which involve risks specific to real estate values.\n\nCommercial real estate loans were a significant portion of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2023. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located. Adverse developments affecting real estate values in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio. Additionally, commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and repayment of the loans is generally dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic events, including decreases in office occupancy following the COVID-19 pandemic, or governmental regulations outside of the control of the borrower or lender could negatively impact the future cash flows and market values of the affected properties.\n\n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nIf the loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time of originating the loans, which could cause us to charge off all or a portion of the loans. This could lead to an increased provision for credit losses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\n\nThe level of our commercial real estate loan portfolio may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny.\n\nThe federal banking regulators have promulgated joint guidance on sound risk management practices for financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Under the CRE Guidance, a financial institution that, like West Bank, is actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk assessment to identify concentrations. A financial institution may have a concentration in commercial real estate lending if, among other factors (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100 percent or more of total risk-based capital, or (ii) total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm non-residential properties, loans for construction, land development and other land, and loans otherwise sensitive to the general commercial real estate market, including loans to commercial real estate related entities, represent 300 percent or more of total risk-based capital. Based on these criteria, West Bank had concentrations of 90 percent and 417 percent, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. The purpose of the CRE Guidance is to assist banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of commercial real estate concentrations. The CRE Guidance states that management should employ heightened risk management practices, including board and management oversight, strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, and risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing. West Bank believes that its current risk management processes adequately address the regulatory guidance; however, there can be no guarantee of the effectiveness of the risk management processes on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with real estate collateral securing our loans.\n\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. Under certain circumstances, we may take title to the real property collateral through foreclosure or other means. As the titleholder of the property, we may be responsible for environmental risks, such as hazardous materials, which attach to the property. For these reasons, prior to extending credit, we have an environmental risk assessment program to identify any known environmental risks associated with the real property that will secure our loans. In addition, we routinely inspect properties following the taking of title. When environmental risks are found, environmental laws and regulations may prescribe our approach to remediation. As a result, while we have ownership of a property, we may incur substantial expense and bear potential liability for any damages caused. The environmental risks may also materially reduce the property’s value or limit our ability to use or sell the property. We also cannot guarantee that our environmental risk assessment will detect all environmental issues relating to a property, which could subject us to additional liability.\n\nRisks Related to Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nOur allowance for credit losses may be insufficient to absorb potential losses in our loan portfolio.\n\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses at a level we believe adequate to absorb current expected credit losses based on an analysis of the loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management’s estimate of current expected losses in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is based on a cash flow-based model that considers available relevant information about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. \n\nDetermination of the allowance is inherently subjective as it requires significant estimates and management’s judgment of credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for credit losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of management. Also, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for credit losses, we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance. Any increases in provisions will result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n18\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nOur accounting policies and methods are the basis for how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and they may require management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\n\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods in order to ensure they comply with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and reflect management’s judgment as to the most appropriate manner in which to record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances. The application of that chosen accounting policy or method might result in us reporting different amounts than would have been reported under a different alternative. If management’s estimates or assumptions are incorrect, the Company may experience a material loss.\n\nFrom time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIf a significant portion of any unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities were to incur credit losses, we would recognize a material charge to our earnings, and our capital ratios would be adversely impacted.\n\nFactors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of investment securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of those securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities, and instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could result in realized losses in future periods.\n\nWe analyze our investment securities quarterly to determine whether, in the opinion of management, any of the securities have credit losses. To the extent that any portion of the unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities is determined to have credit losses, we will recognize a charge to our earnings in the quarter during which such determination is made, and our capital ratios will be adversely impacted. If the Company intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, then the security is written down to fair value through income.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, we had $121,787 of net unrealized losses in our securities portfolio. If we are forced to liquidate any of those investments prior to maturity, including because of a lack of liquidity, we would recognize as a charge to earnings the losses attributable to those securities. Our securities portfolio has an average duration of 6.2 years, so we expect an increase in unrealized losses in rising interest rate environments.\n\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results and could increase the risk of fraud.\n\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. Management believes that our internal controls over financial reporting are currently effective. While management will continue to assess our controls and procedures and take immediate action to remediate any future perceived issues, there can be no guarantee of the effectiveness of these controls and procedures on an ongoing basis. Any failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and an adverse impact on our business operations and stock price.\n\nRisks Related to Information Security and Business Interruption\n\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of our information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nAs a bank, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us, our third-party partners or our clients, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our customers, disclosure or misuse of our information or our client information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our customers, litigation or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us, our customers or third-party vendors, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware or other cyber attacks. \n\n19\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nThere continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber-criminals targeting commercial bank accounts, and as a result of increasingly sophisticated methods of conducting cyber attacks, including those employing artificial intelligence. Moreover, in recent periods, several large corporations, including financial institutions, third party partners specializing in providing services to financial institutions, and retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their customers and employees and subjecting them to potential fraudulent activity. Some of our customers may have been affected by these breaches, which could increase their risks of identity theft and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us.\n\nInformation pertaining to us and our customers is maintained, and transactions are executed, on networks and systems maintained by us and certain third-party partners, such as our online banking, mobile banking and core deposit and loan recordkeeping systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our customers against fraud and security breaches and to maintain the confidence of our customers. Breaches of information security also may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to our systems or the confidential information of our customers, including employees. In addition, increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third-party technologies (including browsers and operating systems), or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our customers and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by our customers to access our systems. Our third-party partners’ inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in a number of negative events, including losses to us or our customers, loss of business or customers, damage to our reputation, the incurrence of additional expenses, disruption to our business, additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties, or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nFurthermore, there has been heightened legislative and regulatory focus on privacy, data protection and information security. New or revised laws and regulations, including with respect to the use of artificial intelligence by financial institutions and service providers, may significantly impact our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, the collection, use, retention and safeguarding of customer and employee information, and current or planned business activities. Compliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nIssues with the use of artificial intelligence in our marketplace may result in reputational harm or liability, or could otherwise adversely affect our business. \n\nArtificial intelligence, including generative artificial intelligence, is or may be enabled by or integrated into our products or those developed by our third-party partners. As with many developing technologies, artificial intelligence presents risks and challenges that could affect its further development, adoption, and use, and therefore our business. Artificial intelligence algorithms may be flawed, for example datasets may contain biased information or otherwise be insufficient; and inappropriate or controversial data practices could impair the acceptance of artificial intelligence solutions and result in burdensome new regulations. If the analyses that products incorporating artificial intelligence assist in producing for us or our third-party partners are deficient, biased or inaccurate, we could be subject to competitive harm, potential legal liability and brand or reputational harm. The use of artificial intelligence may also present ethical issues. If we or our third-party partners offer artificial intelligence enabled products that are controversial because of their purported or real impact on human rights, privacy, or other issues, we may experience competitive harm, potential legal liability and brand or reputational harm. In addition, we expect that governments will continue to assess and implement new laws and regulations concerning the use of artificial intelligence, which may affect or impair the usability or efficiency of our products and services and those developed by our third-party partners.\n\n20\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nWe depend on information technology and telecommunications systems of third parties, and any systems failures, interruptions or data breaches involving these systems could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\n\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems, third-party servicers, accounting systems, mobile and online banking platforms and financial intermediaries. We outsource to third parties many of our major systems, such as data processing and mobile and online banking. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. A system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process loans or gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, result in potential noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, failures of third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or fraud or misconduct on the part of employees of any of these third parties, could disrupt our operations or adversely affect our reputation.\n\nIt may be difficult for us to replace some of our third-party vendors, particularly vendors providing our core banking and information services, in a timely manner if they are unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future for any reason, and even if we are able to replace them, it might be at higher cost or result in the loss of customers. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \n\nOur operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of information and the monitoring of a large number of transactions on a minute-by-minute basis, and even a short interruption in service could have significant consequences. We also interact with and rely on retailers, for whom we process transactions, as well as financial counterparties and regulators. Each of these third parties may be targets of the same types of fraudulent activity, computer break-ins and other cybersecurity breaches described above, and the cybersecurity measures that they maintain to mitigate the risk of such activity may be different than our own and may be inadequate.\n\nAs a result of financial entities and technology systems becoming more interdependent and complex, a cyber incident, information breach or loss, or technology failure that compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including ourselves. As a result of the foregoing, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact. \n\nOther Risks Related to West Bank’s Operations\n\nWe are subject to liquidity risks.\n\nWest Bank maintains liquidity primarily through customer deposits and other short-term funding sources, including advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve discount window, brokered deposits and purchased federal funds. Additionally, the Federal Reserve established the Bank Term Funding Program, or BTFP, on March 12, 2023, offering qualifying banks loans of up to one year in length collateralized by qualifying assets, including U.S. securities valued at par, to serve as a source of additional liquidity against high-quality securities and reducing an institution’s need to quickly sell high-quality securities to meet liquidity needs. The Federal Reserve has announced that it is ending the BTFP and will cease making new loans under this program on March 11, 2024.\n\nIf economic influences change so that we do not have access to short-term credit, or our depositors withdraw a substantial amount of their funds for other uses, West Bank might experience liquidity issues. Our efforts to monitor and manage liquidity risk may not be successful or sufficient to deal with dramatic or unanticipated reductions in our liquidity. If this were to occur and additional short-term borrowings or debt is needed for liquidity purposes in the future, there can be no assurance that such borrowings or debt would be available or, if available, would be on favorable terms. If we increase our short-term borrowings or debt, our cost of funds will increase, thereby reducing our net interest income, or we may need to sell a portion of our investment portfolio, which, depending upon market conditions, could result in the Company or West Bank realizing losses. At December 31, 2023, our borrowed funds increased to $592.6 million, compared to $485.9 million at December 31, 2022. The increase included $140.0 million in FHLB advances associated with long-term interest rate swaps and $20.0 million in FHLB advances with a fixed interest rate, partially offset by a decrease of $49.7 million in federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings. As a result, our cost of funds has increased and caused a decline in our net interest income and net interest margin in 2023, as compared to 2022. Although we believe West Bank’s current sources of funds are adequate for its liquidity needs, there can be no assurance in this regard for the future. \n\n21\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nThe competition for banking and financial services in our market areas is high, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and face strong competition in originating loans, seeking deposits and offering our other services. We compete in making loans, attracting deposits, and recruiting and retaining talented employees. The Des Moines metropolitan market area, in particular, has attracted many new financial institutions within the last two decades. We also compete with nonbank financial service providers, such as FinTech companies, many of which are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions that we are and may be able to compete more effectively as a result.\n\nCustomer loyalty can be influenced by a competitor’s new products, especially if those offerings are priced lower than our products. Some of our competitors may also be better able to attract customers because they provide products and services over a larger geographic area than we serve. This competitive climate can make it more difficult to establish and maintain relationships with new and existing customers, can lower the rate that we are able to charge on loans, and can affect our charges for other services. Our growth and profitability depend on our continued ability to compete effectively within our markets, and our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nLoss of customer deposits due to increased competition could increase our funding costs.\n\nWe rely on customer deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding. We compete with banks and other financial services companies, including digital asset service providers, for deposits. If our competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits, our funding costs may increase, either because we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we lose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Higher funding costs could reduce our net interest margin and net interest income and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nDamage to our reputation could adversely affect our business.\n\nOur business depends upon earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers, stockholders and employees. Damage to our reputation could cause significant harm to our business. Harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources, including employee misconduct, vendor nonperformance, cybersecurity breaches, compliance failures, litigation or governmental investigations, among other things. In addition, a failure to deliver appropriate standards of service, or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly, can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to our reputation. Adverse publicity about West Bank, whether or not true, may also result in harm to our business. Should any events or circumstances that could undermine our reputation occur, there can be no assurance that any lost revenue from customers opting to move their business to another institution and the additional costs and expenses that we may incur in addressing such issues would not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to various legal claims and litigation.\n\nWe are periodically involved in routine litigation incidental to our business. Regardless of whether these claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded, if such legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the Company’s reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by these legal claims could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\n\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings. Additionally, we may be negatively affected by brand or reputational harm to other community banks or to the community banking industry.\n\n22\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nWe may experience difficulties in managing our growth.\n\nIn the future, we may decide to expand into additional communities or attempt to strengthen our position in our current markets through opportunistic acquisitions of all or part of other financial institutions or related businesses or through the hiring of teams of bankers from other financial institutions that we believe provide a strategic fit with our business, or by opening new locations. To the extent that we undertake acquisitions or new office openings, we are likely to experience the effects of higher operating expense relative to operating income from the new operations, which may have an adverse effect on our overall levels of reported net income, return on average equity and return on average assets. To the extent we hire teams of bankers from other financial institutions, our salaries and employee benefits expense will likely increase, which may have an adverse effect on our net income, without any guarantee that the new banking team will be successful in generating new business. Other effects of engaging in such growth strategies may include potential diversion of our management’s time and attention and general disruption to our business.\n\nTo the extent that we grow through acquisitions or office openings, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to adequately or profitably manage such growth. Acquiring other banks and businesses will involve risks similar to those commonly associated with new office openings, but may also involve additional risks. These additional risks include potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of banks and businesses we acquire, exposure to potential asset quality issues of the acquired bank or related business, difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of banks and businesses we acquire, and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the banks and businesses we acquire.\n\nMaintaining or increasing our market share may depend on lowering prices and the adoption of new products and services.\n\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and customer needs. There may be increased pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. Lower prices can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services. Also, these and other capital investments in our business may not produce expected growth in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure. We may not be successful in introducing new products and services, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, or developing and maintaining loyal customers.\n\nThe loss of the services of any of our senior executive officers or key personnel could cause our business to suffer.\n\nMuch of our success is due to our ability to attract and retain senior management and key personnel experienced in banking and financial services who are very involved in the communities we currently serve. Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the continued services of relatively few individuals. In addition, our success depends in significant part upon our senior management’s ability to develop and implement our business strategies. The loss of services of a few of our senior executive officers or key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, at least in the short term.\n\nLabor shortages and a failure to attract and retain qualified employees could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nA number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs, including high employment levels and decreased labor force size and participation rates. Although we have not experienced any material labor shortage to date, we have recently observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive local labor market. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base could lead to increased costs, such as increased compensation expense to attract and retain employees.\n\nIn addition, if we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high-level, or if mitigation measures we take to respond to a decrease in labor availability have unintended negative effects, our business could be adversely affected. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation, caused by general macroeconomic factors, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nChanges in interest rates could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nEarnings in the banking industry, particularly the community bank segment, are substantially dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets (securities and loans) and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (deposits and borrowings). Interest rates are sensitive to many factors, including government monetary and fiscal policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and competition. If interest rates continue to increase, banks will experience competitive pressures to further increase rates paid on deposits. If the Federal Reserve Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) further increases the targeted federal funds rates, overall interest rates likely will rise, which may negatively impact the entire national economy. In addition, our net interest income could be adversely affected if the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings increase more rapidly than the rates we earn on loans and other assets. Rising interest rates also may reduce the demand for loans and the value of fixed-rate securities. These effects from interest rate changes or from other sustained economic stress or a recession, among other matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\n\nA large percentage of our securities have fixed interest rates and are classified as available for sale. As is the case with many financial institutions, our emphasis on increasing the development of core deposits, those with no stated maturity date, has resulted in our interest-bearing liabilities having a shorter duration than our interest-earning assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because interest rates change over time. As interest rates have increased, our cost of funds has increased more rapidly than the yields on a substantial portion of our interest-earning assets. In addition, the market value of our securities portfolio has declined in recent periods. At December 31, 2023, we had $121,787 of net unrealized losses in the securities portfolio. In line with the foregoing, we have experienced and may continue to experience an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, primarily due to raising the rates we pay on some of our deposit products to stay competitive within our market, and an increase in borrowing costs from increases in the federal funds rate. Community banks, such as West Bank, rely more heavily than larger institutions on net interest income as a revenue source. Larger institutions generally have more diversified sources of noninterest income. \n\nOur business is subject to domestic and, to a lesser extent, international economic conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control and could materially and adversely affect us.\n\nOur financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of customers to pay interest on and repay principal on outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer, is highly dependent upon the business environment, not only in the markets where we operate, but also in the states of Iowa and Minnesota, generally, in the United States as a whole, and internationally. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity, or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; uncertainty in U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs; natural disasters; acts of war or terrorism; widespread disease or pandemics; or a combination of these or other factors. Such unfavorable conditions could materially and adversely affect us.\n\nThe financial markets and the global economy may also be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including the current conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Palestine, which are increasing volatility in commodity and energy prices, creating supply chain issues and causing instability in financial markets and political systems. Sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries in response to such conflicts could further adversely impact the financial markets and the global economy, and any economic countermeasures by the affected countries or others could exacerbate market and economic instability. The specific consequences of the conflicts on our business are difficult to predict at this time, but in addition to inflationary pressures affecting our operations and those of our customers and borrowers, we may also experience an increase in cyberattacks against us, our customers and borrowers, service providers and other third parties. \n\n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nContinued elevated levels of inflation could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe United States has recently experienced elevated levels of inflation, with the consumer price index climbing significantly in 2022. Inflationary pressures reduced in 2023 but remained elevated. Future inflation metrics are uncertain for 2024 and onward. Continued levels of inflation could have complex effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition, some of which could be materially adverse. For example, while we generally expect any inflation-related increases in our interest expense to be offset by increases in our interest revenue, inflation-driven increases in our levels of noninterest expense could negatively impact our results of operations. Continued elevated levels of inflation could also cause increased volatility and uncertainty in the business environment, which could adversely affect loan demand and our clients’ ability to repay indebtedness. It is also possible that governmental responses to the current inflation environment could adversely affect our business, such as changes to monetary and fiscal policy that are too strict, or the imposition or threatened imposition of price controls. The duration and severity of the current inflationary period cannot be estimated with precision.\n\nWe are required to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to an inability to raise capital, operational losses, or otherwise, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain regulatory compliance, could be adversely affected.\n\nThe Company and West Bank are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support their operations. The ability to raise additional capital, when and if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions, and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry and market conditions, and governmental activities, many of which are outside of our control, as well as on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital, if needed, or on terms acceptable to us. Failure to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements could affect customer confidence, our ability to grow, the costs of funds, FDIC insurance costs, the ability to pay dividends on common stock and to make distributions on the junior subordinated debentures, the ability to make acquisitions, the ability to make certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, and the results of operations and financial condition.\n\nRisks Related to the Supervision and Regulation of the Banking Industry and Government Policies\n\nWe may be materially and adversely affected by the highly regulated environment in which we operate.\n\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, supervision and examination. A more detailed description of the primary federal and state banking laws and regulations that affect us is contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-K in the section captioned “Supervision and Regulation.” Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, FDIC funds, customers and the banking system as a whole, rather than our stockholders. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things.\n\nAs a financial holding company, we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision and undergo periodic examinations by our regulators, who have extensive discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks and financial holding companies. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil monetary penalties and/or damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Although we have policies and procedures designed to mitigate the risk of any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur.\n\nCurrent or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry may impact the profitability of our business activities and may change certain of our business practices, including our ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. In addition, political developments, including possible changes in law introduced by the Biden administration or the appointment of new personnel in regulatory agencies, add uncertainty to the implementation, scope and timing of regulatory reforms. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply and could therefore materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n25\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the options available to the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate, and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These monetary policy options are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\n\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The specific effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\n\nOther Risks Related to the Banking Industry in General\n\nTechnology is changing rapidly and may put us at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nThe banking industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables banks to better serve customers. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability and the ability of our third-party partners to effectively implement new technology. The widespread adoption of new technologies, including mobile banking services, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies and payment systems, could require us in the future to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services as we grow and develop new products to satisfy our customers’ expectations and comply with regulatory guidance. Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources than we do to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer, or more quickly offer, additional or superior products that could put West Bank at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods. For example, consumers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. \n\nWhile we do not offer products relating to digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and other similar assets, there has been a significant increase in digital asset adoption globally over the past several years. Certain characteristics of digital asset transactions, such as the speed with which such transactions can be conducted, the ability to transact without the involvement of regulated intermediaries, the ability to engage in transactions across multiple jurisdictions, and the anonymous nature of the transactions, are appealing to certain consumers notwithstanding the various risks posed by such transactions. Accordingly, digital asset service providers which, at present are not subject to the same degree of scrutiny and oversight as banking organizations and other financial institutions, are becoming active competitors to more traditional financial institutions.\n\nThe process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as “disintermediation”, could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Potential partnerships with digital asset companies, moreover, could also entail significant investment.\n\n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nClimate change could adversely affect our business, affect client activity levels and damage our reputation.\n\nConcerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. New governmental regulations or guidance relating to climate change, as well as changes in consumers’ and businesses’ behaviors and business preferences, may affect whether and on what terms and conditions we will engage in certain activities or offer certain products or services. The governmental and supervisory focus on climate change could also result in our becoming subject to new or heightened regulatory requirements, such as requirements relating to operational resiliency or stress testing for various climate stress scenarios. Any such new or heightened requirements could result in increased regulatory, compliance or other costs or higher capital requirements. In connection with the transition to a low carbon economy, legislative or public policy changes and changes in consumer sentiment could negatively impact the businesses and financial condition of our clients, which may decrease revenues from those clients and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients. Our business, reputation and ability to attract and retain employees may also be harmed if our response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient. \n\nFurthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change could have a negative impact on our customers and their businesses, as well as the stability of our deposit base. Physical risks include extreme storms that damage or destroy property and inventory securing loans we make, or may interrupt our customers’ business operations, putting them in financial difficulty, and increasing the risk of default. Our customers are also facing changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate change, as well as new regulatory requirements resulting in increased operational costs.\n\nRisks Related to West Bancorporation’s Common Stock\n\nOur stock is relatively thinly traded.\n\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the average daily trading volume of our common stock is relatively small compared to many public companies. The desired market characteristics of depth, liquidity, and orderliness require the substantial presence of willing buyers and sellers in the marketplace at any given time. In our case, this presence depends on the individual decisions of a relatively small number of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Due to the relatively small trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause the stock price to fall more than would be justified by the inherent worth of the Company. Conversely, attempts to purchase a significant amount of our stock could cause the market price to rise above the reasonable inherent worth of the Company.\n\nThe stock market can be volatile, and fluctuations in our operating results and other factors could cause our stock price to decline.\n\nThe stock market has experienced, and may continue to experience, fluctuations that significantly impact the market prices of securities issued by many companies. Market fluctuations could adversely affect our stock price. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, systemic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, loss of investor confidence, interest rate changes, government shutdowns, presidential elections, international trade wars or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Moreover, our operating results may fluctuate and vary from period to period due to the risk factors set forth herein. As a result, period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our stock price could fluctuate significantly in response to the impact of these risk factors. \n\nThere is uncertainty surrounding potential legal, regulatory and policy changes by new presidential administrations in the United States that may directly affect financial institutions and the global economy.\n\n2024 is a presidential election year. Changes in federal policy and at regulatory agencies occur over time through policy and personnel changes following elections, which lead to changes involving the level of oversight and focus on the financial services industry. The nature, timing and economic and political effects of potential changes to the current legal and regulatory framework affecting financial institutions remain highly uncertain. Uncertainty surrounding future changes may adversely affect our operating environment and therefore our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nIssuing additional common or preferred stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and capital may not be available when needed.\n\nThe Company may issue additional shares of common or preferred stock in order to raise capital at some date in the future to support continued growth, either internally generated or through acquisitions. Common shares have been and will be issued through the Company’s 2017 Equity Incentive Plan and the Company’s 2021 Equity Incentive Plan as grants of restricted stock units vest. As additional shares of common or preferred stock are issued, the ownership interests of our existing stockholders may be diluted. The market price of our common stock might decline or fail to increase in response to issuing additional common or preferred stock. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control. Accordingly, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital, if needed, on acceptable terms. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nThe holders of our 5.25% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due in 2032 and the holders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our common stockholders.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $20.6 million in junior subordinated debentures outstanding that were issued to the Company’s subsidiary trust, West Bancorporation Capital Trust I, and $60.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Company’s 5.25% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2032 (the “Notes”). The junior subordinated debentures and the Notes are senior to the Company’s shares of common stock. As a result, the Company must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities (TPS)) and the Notes before any dividends can be paid on its common stock, and in the event of the Company’s bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the debentures and the Notes must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of the common stock. The Company has the right to defer distributions on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related TPS) for up to five years during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of the Company’s common stock. The Company’s ability to pay future distributions depends upon the earnings of West Bank and the issuance of dividends from West Bank to the Company, which may be inadequate to service the obligations. Interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures underlying the TPS are classified as a “dividend” by the Federal Reserve supervisory policies and therefore are subject to applicable restrictions and approvals imposed by the Federal Reserve Board.\n\nThere can be no assurances concerning continuing dividend payments.\n\nOur common stockholders are only entitled to receive the dividends declared by our Board of Directors (the Board). Although we have historically paid quarterly dividends on our common stock, there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends or that any dividends we do declare will be in any particular amount. The primary source of money to pay our dividends comes from dividends paid to the Company by West Bank. West Bank’s ability to pay dividends to the Company is subject to, among other things, its earnings, financial condition and applicable regulations, which in some instances limit the amount that may be paid as dividends.\n\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nThere are no unresolved comments from the SEC staff.\n\n28\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\n\nWe rely extensively on various information systems and other electronic resources to operate our business. In addition, nearly all of our customers, service providers and other business partners on whom we depend, including the providers of our online banking, mobile banking and accounting systems, use their own electronic information systems. Any of these systems can be compromised, including by employees, customers and other individuals who are authorized to use them, and bad actors using sophisticated and a constantly evolving set of software, tools and strategies to do so. The nature of our business, as a financial-services provider, and our relative size, make us and our business partners high-value targets for these bad actors to pursue. See “Risks Related to Information Security and Business Interruption” section of the Risk Factors included in Item 1A of this Form 10-K for additional information. \n\nAccordingly, we have devoted significant resources to assessing, identifying and managing risks associated with cybersecurity threats, including:\n\n•Implementing an Information Security Program that establishes policies and procedures for security operations and governance;\n\n•Establishing an Information Security Committee that is responsible for security administration, including conducting regular assessments of our information systems, existing controls, vulnerabilities and potential improvements;\n\n•Implementing layers of controls and not allowing excessive reliance on any single control;\n\n•Employing a variety of preventative and detective tools designed to monitor, block and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity;\n\n•Continuously evaluating tools that can detect and help respond to cybersecurity threats in real-time;\n\n•Leveraging people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls;\n\n•Maintaining a third party risk management program designed to identify, assess and manage risks associated with external service providers;\n\n•Performing due diligence with respect to our third-party service providers, including their cybersecurity practices;\n\n•Engaging third-party cybersecurity consultants, who conduct periodic penetration testing, vulnerability assessments and other procedures to identify potential weaknesses in our systems and processes; and\n\n•Conducting periodic cybersecurity training for our employees and the Company’s Board. \n\nThe Information Security Program is a key part of our overall risk management system, which is administered by our Information Security Committee. The program includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards to help protect the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. \n\nFrom time-to-time, we have identified cybersecurity threats that require us to make changes to our processes and to implement additional safeguards. While none of these identified threats or incidents have materially affected us, it is possible that threats and incidents we identify in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business strategy, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company’s management team is responsible for the day-to-day management of cybersecurity risks we face and oversees the Information Security Committee. The Information Security Committee manages the oversight of the information security assessment, development of policies, standards and procedures, testing, training and security report processes for West Bank. The Information Security Committee is comprised of officers with the appropriate expertise and authority to oversee the Information Security Program. \n\nIn addition, the Company’s Board, both as a whole and through its Risk and Information Technology Committee (Risk Committee) is responsible for the oversight of risk management, including cybersecurity risks. In that role, the Company’s Board and the Risk Committee, with support from the Company’s management and third party cybersecurity advisors, are responsible for ensuring that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed. The Board reviews and approves an information security program, vendor management policy (including third-party service providers), acceptable use policy, incident response policy and business continuity planning policy on an annual basis. All the aforementioned policies are developed and implemented by management of the Company. To carry out their duties, the Board receives updates from the Risk Committee regarding cybersecurity risks and the Company’s efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate and remediate any cybersecurity incidents on at least a quarterly basis.\n\n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\n\nThe corporate office of the Company is located in the main office building of West Bank, at 1601 22nd Street in West Des Moines, Iowa, 50266. West Bank leases its main banking office, along with additional office space for operational departments. West Bank operates ten branch offices in addition to its main office. Four branch offices in the Des Moines, Iowa, metropolitan area are leased. Three of these branch offices are full-service locations, while one is a drive-up only, express location. West Bank also leases one full-service branch office in Owatonna, Minnesota. West Bank owns five full-service branch offices in Coralville and Waukee, Iowa, and Rochester, St. Cloud and Mankato, Minnesota. We believe each of our facilities is adequate to meet our needs.\n\nIn November 2023, the Company completed construction of a new office for its Mankato, Minnesota branch. At that time, the previously leased location was vacated. \n\nWest Bank is constructing a new corporate headquarters which is scheduled to open on April 15, 2024, at its new address of 3330 Westown Parkway, West Des Moines, Iowa 50266. Upon moving to the new corporate headquarters, our current headquarters will be vacated, which will coincide with its lease expiration. \n\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nNeither the Company nor West Bank is party to any material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary litigation incidental to West Bank’s business, and no property of these entities is the subject of any such proceeding. The Company does not know of any proceedings contemplated by a governmental authority against the Company or West Bank.\n\nITEM 4.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\n\nWest Bancorporation common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “WTBA”. There were 149 holders of record of the Company’s common stock as of February 16, 2024, and an estimated 4,000 additional beneficial holders whose stock was held in street name by brokerages or fiduciaries. The closing price of the Company’s common stock was $17.63 on February 16, 2024.\n\nTotal cash dividends paid to common stockholders in both 2023 and 2022 were $1.00 per common share. Dividend declarations are evaluated and determined by the Board on a quarterly basis, and the dividends are paid quarterly. The Company intends to continue its policy of paying quarterly dividends; however, the ability of the Company to pay dividends in the future will depend primarily upon the earnings of West Bank and its ability to pay dividends to the Company, as well as regulatory requirements of the Federal Reserve relating to the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. The ability of West Bank to pay dividends is governed by various statutes. These statutes provide that a bank may pay dividends only out of undivided profits. In addition, applicable bank regulatory authorities have the power to require any bank to suspend the payment of dividends until the bank complies with all requirements that may be imposed by such authorities.\n\n31\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nThe following performance graph provides information regarding the cumulative, five-year return on an indexed basis of the common stock of the Company as compared with the Nasdaq Composite Index and the S&P U.S. BMI Banks - Midwest Region Index prepared by S&P Global Market Intelligence.

For further information, refer to the section \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" of this item.\n\n33\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\n\nThe Company’s 2023 net income was $24,137, compared to $46,399 in 2022. Basic and diluted earnings per common share for 2023 were $1.44 and $1.44, respectively, compared to $2.79 and $2.76, respectively, in 2022. During 2023, we paid our common stockholders $16,704 ($1.00 per common share) in dividends compared to $16,619 ($1.00 per common share) in 2022. The dividend declared and paid in the first quarter of 2024 was $0.25 per common share.\n\nTotal assets were $3,825,758 at December 31, 2023, compared to $3,613,218 at December 31, 2022, a 5.9 percent increase. Our loan portfolio grew to $2,927,535 as of December 31, 2023, from $2,742,836 as of December 31, 2022. Deposits increased to $2,973,779 as of December 31, 2023, from $2,880,408 as of December 31, 2022. \n\nThe Company compares three key performance metrics to those of an identified peer group for evaluating its results. The peer group for 2023 consists of 22 Midwestern, publicly traded financial institutions including Bank First Corporation, Bridgewater Bancshares, Inc., ChoiceOne Financial Services, Inc., Civista Bancshares, Inc., CrossFirst Bankshares, Inc., Equity Bancshares, Inc., Farmers National Banc Corp., Farmers & Merchants Bancorp., First Business Financial Services, Inc., First Financial Corp., First Mid Bancshares, Inc., German American Bancorp, Inc., HBT Financial, Inc., Hills Bancorporation, Isabella Bank Corporation, LCNB Corp., Macatawa Bank Corporation, Mercantile Bank Corporation, MidWestOne Financial Group, Inc., Nicolet Bankshares, Inc., Peoples Bancorp, Inc., and Southern Missouri Bancorp, Inc. The Company is in the middle of the group in terms of asset size. The Company's goal is to perform at or near the top of this peer group relative to what we consider to be three key metrics: return on average equity, efficiency ratio and nonperforming assets to total assets. We believe these measures encompass the factors that define the performance of a community bank. Company and peer results for the key financial performance measures are summarized below.\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc.| Peer Group Range  \n---|---  \nAs of and for the year ended December 31, 2023| As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023  \nReturn on average equity| 11.42%| 1.85%-17.24%  \nEfficiency ratio(1)| 60.73%| 45.85%-70.02%  \nNonperforming assets to total assets| 0.01%| 0.00%-0.73%  \n  \n(1) The efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this report.\n\nThe following discussion describes the consolidated operations and financial condition of the Company, including its subsidiary West Bank and West Bank’s special purpose subsidiaries. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 are compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the consolidated financial condition of the Company as of December 31, 2023 is compared to December 31, 2022. Results of operations and financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 can be found in Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company’s 2022 annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 23, 2023. \n\n34\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nThis report is based on the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP established by the FASB. The preparation of the Company’s financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective estimates and judgments, management has identified its most critical accounting policies to be those related to the fair value of financial instruments and the allowance for credit losses.\n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts business. A framework has been established for measuring the fair value of financial instruments that considers the attributes specific to particular assets or liabilities and includes a three-level hierarchy for determining fair value based on the transparency of inputs to each valuation as of the measurement date. The Company estimates the fair value of financial instruments using a variety of valuation methods. When financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value and are classified as Level 1. When financial instruments, such as securities and derivatives, are not actively traded, the Company determines fair value based on various sources and may apply matrix pricing with observable prices for similar instruments where a price for the identical instrument is not observable. The fair values of these financial instruments, which are classified as Level 2, are determined by pricing models that consider observable market data such as interest rate volatilities, yield curves, credit spreads, prices from external market data providers and/or nonbinding broker-dealer quotations. When observable inputs do not exist, the Company estimates fair value based on available market data, and these values are classified as Level 3. Imprecision in estimating fair values can impact the carrying value of assets and the amount of revenue or loss recorded. \n\nExpected credit losses are reflected in the allowance for credit losses (ACL) through a charge to credit loss expense. When the Company deems all or a portion of a loan to be uncollectible, the appropriate amount is written off and the ACL is reduced by the same amount. The Company applies judgment to determine when a loan is deemed uncollectible; however, generally speaking, a loan will be considered uncollectible no later than when all efforts at collection have been exhausted. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the ACL when received. \n\nThe Company measures expected credit losses of loans on a collective (pool) basis when the loans share similar risk characteristics and uses a cash flow based method to estimate expected credit losses for each of these pools. The Company’s methodology for estimating the ACL considers available relevant information about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The methodologies apply historical loss information, adjusted for asset-specific characteristics, economic conditions at the measurement date, and forecasts about economic conditions expected to exist through the contractual lives of the financial assets that are reasonable and supportable, to the identified pools of financial assets with similar risk characteristics for which the historical experience was observed. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. \n\nThe Company uses a cash flow based model to estimate expected credit losses for all loan segments. For each of the loan segments, the Company calculates a cash flow projection using contractual terms, estimated prepayment speeds, estimated curtailment rates, and other relevant data. The Company uses regression analysis that links historical losses of the Company and a peer group to two economic metrics: national unemployment rate and 10-year treasury rate over 2-year treasury rate spread to establish the loss rates applied to the projected cash flows. For all loan segments, the Company uses a forecast period of four quarters and reverts to a historical rate after four quarters. When estimating prepayment speed and curtailment rates, the modeling is based on historical internal data. In addition to the historical loss information, the Company utilizes qualitative factors to adjust the ACL as appropriate. Qualitative factors are based on management’s judgment of the changes in underlying loan composition of specific portfolios, trends relating to credit quality and collateral values, company-specific data, or effects of other factors such as market competition or legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023 was $28,342, or 0.97 percent of outstanding loans, compared to $25,473, or 0.93 percent of outstanding loans as of December 31, 2022. The allowance for credit losses for 2023 was measured under the current expected credit losses, or CECL, model, while the allowance for credit losses for 2022 was measured under the previous incurred loss model.\n\n35\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nThis report contains references to financial measures that are not defined in GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures include the Company’s presentation of net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis, and the presentation of the efficiency ratio on an adjusted and FTE basis, excluding certain income and expenses. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors to analyze and evaluate the Company’s financial performance. These measures are considered standard measures of comparison within the banking industry. Additionally, management believes providing measures on an FTE basis enhances the comparability of income arising from taxable and nontaxable sources. Limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures include the risks that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items included in these measures and that different companies might calculate these measures differently. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be considered an alternative to the Company’s GAAP results. The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis and efficiency ratio on an adjusted and FTE basis, to their most directly comparable measures under GAAP.\n\nAs and for the Years Ended December 31  \n---  \n2023| 2022| 2021  \nReconciliation of net interest income and net interest margin on an FTE basis to GAAP:  \nNet interest income (GAAP)| $| 69,031| $| 91,740| $| 95,059  \nTax-equivalent adjustment(1)| 491| 1,122| 1,202  \nNet interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP)| 69,522| 92,862| 96,261  \nAverage interest-earning assets| 3,465,964| 3,361,091| 3,152,138  \nNet interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP)| 2.01| %| 2.76 | %| 3.05 | %  \nReconciliation of efficiency ratio on an FTE basis to GAAP:  \nNet interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP)| $| 69,522| $| 92,862 | $| 96,261   \nNoninterest income| 10,066| 10,208 | 9,729   \nAdjustment for realized securities (gains) losses, net| 431| — | (51)  \nAdjustment for losses on disposal of premises and  equipment, net| 29| 29 | 84   \nAdjusted income| 80,048| 103,099 | 106,023   \nNoninterest expense| 48,611| 45,051 | 43,380   \nEfficiency ratio on an adjusted and FTE basis (non-GAAP)(2)| 60.73| %| 43.70 | %| 40.91 | %  \n  \n(1) Computed on a tax-equivalent basis using a federal income tax rate of 21 percent, adjusted to reflect the effect of the nondeductible interest expense associated with owning tax-exempt securities and loans. Management believes the presentation of this non-GAAP measure provides supplemental useful information for proper understanding of the financial results, as it enhances the comparability of income arising from taxable and nontaxable sources.\n\n(2) The efficiency ratio expresses noninterest expense as a percent of fully taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income, excluding specific noninterest income and expenses. Management believes the presentation of this non-GAAP measure provides supplemental useful information for proper understanding of the Company’s financial performance. It is a standard measure of comparison within the banking industry. A lower ratio is more desirable.\n\n36\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2023 COMPARED TO 2022\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $24,137, compared to $46,399 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Basic and diluted earnings per common share for 2023 were $1.44 and $1.44, respectively, and were $2.79 and $2.76, respectively for 2022. \n\nThe decrease in net income in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to the decrease in net interest income. Net interest income declined $22,709, or 24.7 percent, in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease in net interest income was due to an increase in interest expense on deposits and borrowings that exceeded an increase in interest income on loans and securities, primarily due to rapidly rising short-term interest rates, an inverted yield curve and changes in funding mix. \n\nThe Company recorded a credit loss expense of $700 in 2023 compared to a credit loss expense of negative $2,500 in 2022. The credit loss expense recorded in 2023 was primarily due to loan growth. The negative credit loss expense recorded in 2022 was due to the reversal of a specific reserve on an impaired loan and the reduction of certain qualitative factors resulting from the sustained performance of loans after the expiration of COVID-19 modifications and continued improvement in classified loans. The credit loss expense recorded in 2023 was made under the current expected credit losses, or CECL, model, while the negative credit loss expense recorded in 2022 was made under the previous incurred loss model. \n\nNoninterest income decreased $142, or 1.4 percent, in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to realized losses on the sales of securities and a decrease in loan swap fees, partially offset by a gain from bank-owned life insurance. Noninterest expense increased $3,560, or 7.9 percent, in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expense and FDIC insurance expense. \n\nThe Company’s ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets was 0.01 percent as of both December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. For more discussion on loan quality, see the “Loan Portfolio” and “Summary of the Allowance for Credit Losses” sections in this Item of this Form 10-K.\n\nNet Interest Income\n\nNet interest income decreased to $69,031 for 2023 from $91,740 for 2022, as the impact of the increase in average rates paid on and growth in average balances of interest-bearing liabilities exceeded the benefits of the growth in average balances and increase in average yields on interest-earning assets. The net interest margin for 2023 decreased 75 basis points to 2.01 percent, compared to 2.76 percent for 2022. The average yield on earning assets increased by 94 basis points, while the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 197 basis points. For additional analysis of net interest income, see the section captioned “Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity; Interest Rates; and Interest Differential” in this Item of this Form 10-K.\n\nCredit Loss Expense, Allowance for Credit Losses, and Loan Quality\n\nThe allowance for credit losses, which totaled $28,342 as of December 31, 2023, represented 0.97 percent of total loans, compared to 0.93 percent as of December 31, 2022. The allowance for credit losses for 2023 was measured under the current expected credit losses, or CECL, model, while the allowance for credit losses for 2022 was measured under the previous incurred loss model. A credit loss expense of $700 was recorded in 2023, compared to a credit loss expense of negative $2,500 in 2022. The credit loss expense recorded in 2023 included an allocation of $500 to the allowance for credit losses related to loans and $200 to the allowance for credit losses related to unfunded commitments. This credit loss expense was primarily due to growth in loans and unfunded loan commitments. The negative credit loss expense recorded in 2022 was due to the reversal of a specific reserve on an impaired loan and the reduction of certain qualitative factors resulting from the sustained performance of loans after the expiration of COVID-19 modifications and continued improvement in classified loans. Management believed the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2023 was adequate to absorb expected losses in the loan portfolio as of that date.\n\nNonperforming loans at December 31, 2023 totaled $296, or 0.01 percent of total loans, a slight decrease from $322, or 0.01 percent of total loans, at December 31, 2022. The decrease in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022, was due to scheduled payments made on the single loan included in the nonaccrual balance in both periods. Nonperforming loans include loans on nonaccrual status, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, and loans that have been considered to be loan restructurings made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company held no other real estate owned properties as of December 31, 2023 or 2022. \n\n37\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\n\nNoninterest Income\n\nThe following table shows the variance from the prior year in the noninterest income categories shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nYears ended December 31  \n---  \nNoninterest income:| 2023| 2022| Change| Change %  \nService charges on deposit accounts| $| 1,859| $| 2,194 | $| (335)| (15.3)| %  \nDebit card usage fees| 1,980| 1,969 | 11 | 0.6 | %  \nTrust services| 3,068| 2,709 | 359 | 13.3 | %  \nIncrease in cash value of bank-owned life insurance| 1,044| 964 | 80 | 8.3 | %  \nGain from bank-owned life insurance| 691| — | 691 | N/A  \nLoan swap fees| 431| 835 | (404)| (48.4)| %  \nRealized securities losses, net| (431)| — | (431)| N/A  \nOther income| 1,424| 1,537 | (113)| (7.4)| %  \nTotal noninterest income| $| 10,066| $| 10,208 | $| (142)| (1.4)| %  \n  \nThe decline in service charges on deposit accounts was primarily attributable to a higher earnings credit rate on commercial accounts. Revenue from trust services was higher in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to increases in one-time estate fees. An increase in trust assets and accounts since December 31, 2022 also contributed to the increase in trust service fees. The gain from bank-owned life insurance in 2023 was the result of a death benefit claim. Loan swap fees in 2023 and 2022 consist of fees earned in the back-to-back swap program. In 2023, the Company sold $11,285 of securities from the available for sale securities portfolio and realized a net loss of $431. The proceeds from this sale were reinvested in the loan portfolio. \n\nNoninterest Expense\n\nThe following table shows the variance from the prior year in the noninterest expense categories shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In addition, accounts within the “Other expenses” category that represent a significant portion of the total or a significant variance are shown.\n\nYears ended December 31  \n---  \nNoninterest expense:| 2023| 2022| Change| Change %  \nSalaries and employee benefits| $| 27,060| $| 25,838 | $| 1,222 | 4.7 | %  \nOccupancy and equipment| 5,507| 4,913 | 594 | 12.1 | %  \nData processing| 2,790| 2,597 | 193 | 7.4 | %  \nTechnology and software| 2,341| 2,137 | 204 | 9.5 | %  \nFDIC insurance| 1,750| 996 | 754 | 75.7 | %  \nProfessional fees| 1,026| 874 | 152 | 17.4 | %  \nDirector fees| 892| 814 | 78 | 9.6 | %  \nOther expenses:  \nBusiness development| 1,263| 1,147 | 116 | 10.1 | %  \nInsurance expense| 793| 717 | 76 | 10.6 | %  \nTrust| 622| 539 | 83 | 15.4 | %  \nConsulting fees| 257| 339 | (82)| (24.2)| %  \nCharitable contributions| 180| — | 180 | N/A  \nMarketing| 163| 246 | (83)| (33.7)| %  \nLow income housing projects amortization | 589| 540 | 49 | 9.1 | %  \nNew markets tax credit project amortization and management fees| 919| 919 | — | — | %  \nAll other| 2,459| 2,435 | 24 | 1.0 | %  \nTotal other| 7,245| 6,882 | 363 | 5.3 | %  \nTotal noninterest expense| $| 48,611| $| 45,051 | $| 3,560 | 7.9 | %  \n  \n38\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\n\nSalaries and employee benefits increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to wage increases in response to market conditions and competition in retaining and recruiting talent. Additionally, the number of full-time equivalent employees has increased with growth in our commercial banking team and information technology department. Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense related to the new bank buildings in St. Cloud and Mankato, Minnesota, along with scheduled increases in rent expense on existing leases. FDIC insurance expense increased in 2023 when compared to 2022 primarily due to the FDIC’s increase in the minimum assessment rate, which was announced in 2022 and effective as of the first quarter of 2023. Business development expenses increased in 2023 due to an increase in the size of our commercial banking team and a general increase in sponsorships and business development activity. \n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company records a provision for income tax expense currently payable, along with a provision for those taxes payable or refundable in the future (deferred taxes). Deferred taxes arise from differences in the timing of certain items for financial statement reporting compared to income tax reporting and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Federal income tax expense for 2023 and 2022 was $3,711 and $9,165, respectively, while state income tax expense was $1,938 and $3,833, respectively. The effective rate of income tax expense as a percent of income before income taxes was 18.9 percent and 21.9 percent, respectively, for 2023 and 2022. In 2022, income tax expense included a one-time increase in state income tax expense related to the June 2022 enactment of changes in the Iowa bank franchise tax rates. This legislation reduced the Iowa bank franchise tax rate applied to apportioned income for 2023 and future years. The future reduction in the state tax rate required the Company to reduce net deferred tax assets by $671 and in turn caused the one-time increase in 2022 tax expense.\n\nThe effective income tax rates differ from the federal statutory income tax rates primarily due to tax-exempt interest income, the tax-exempt increase in cash value of bank-owned life insurance, tax-exempt gain from bank-owned life insurance, disallowed interest expense, stock compensation and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for both 2023 and 2022 was also impacted by federal income tax credits, including low income housing tax credits and a new markets tax credit from West Bank’s investment in a qualified community development entity, of approximately $1,498 and $1,468, respectively.

Fluctuations in net interest income can result from the combination of changes in the balances of asset and liability categories and changes in interest rates. Interest rates earned and paid are also affected by general economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, and by competitive factors, government policies and the actions of regulatory authorities. The Federal Reserve increased the target federal funds interest rate by a total of 425 basis points in 2022 and an additional 100 basis points in 2023. The potential for additional target federal funds interest rate changes in 2024 is unknown at this time. The increases that occurred throughout 2022 and 2023 have had a significant impact on the comparability of net interest income between 2023, 2022 and 2021. \n\nNet interest margin on an FTE basis, a non-GAAP financial measure, is a measure of the net return on interest-earning assets and is computed by dividing annualized tax-equivalent net interest income by total average interest-earning assets for the period. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis was 2.01, 2.76 and 3.05 percent, respectively. Tax-equivalent net interest income decreased $23,340 in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nRate and Volume Analysis\n\nThe rate and volume analysis shown below, on a tax-equivalent basis, is used to determine how much of the change in interest income or expense is the result of a change in volume or a change in interest yield or rate. The change in interest that is due to both volume and rate has been allocated to the change due to volume and the change due to rate in proportion to the absolute value of the change in each.\n\n2023 Compared to 2022| 2022 Compared to 2021  \n---|---  \nVolume| Rate| Total| Volume| Rate| Total  \nInterest Income  \nLoans: (1)  \nCommercial| $| 1,625| $| 7,700| $| 9,325| $| (1,744)| $| 1,121 | $| (623)  \nReal estate (2)| 9,125| 16,783| 25,908| 10,877 | 1,067 | 11,944   \nConsumer and other | 230| 153| 383| 74 | 26 | 100   \nTotal loans (including fees)| 10,980| 24,636| 35,616| 9,207 | 2,214 | 11,421   \nSecurities:  \nTaxable| (1,746)| 2,918| 1,172| 2,903 | 1,079 | 3,982   \nTax-exempt (2)| (238)| (191)| (429)| 363 | 312 | 675   \nTotal securities| (1,984)| 2,727| 743| 3,266 | 1,391 | 4,657   \nInterest-bearing deposits| (366)| 332| (34)| (335)| 246 | (89)  \nTotal interest income (2)| 8,630| 27,695| 36,325| 12,138 | 3,851 | 15,989   \nInterest Expense  \nDeposits:  \nInterest-bearing demand| (202)| 4,728| 4,526| 47 | 1,642 | 1,689   \nSavings and money market| (1,092)| 28,847| 27,755| 156 | 10,017 | 10,173   \nTime| 2,677| 9,209| 11,886| 795 | 2,024 | 2,819   \nTotal deposits| 1,383| 42,784| 44,167| 998 | 13,683 | 14,681   \nBorrowed funds:  \nFederal funds purchased and  \nother short-term borrowings| 5,732| 2,036| 7,768| 591 | 1,168 | 1,759   \nSubordinated debt, net| 1,485| 90| 1,575| 1,748 | 111 | 1,859   \nFederal Home Loan Bank advances| 3,654| 1,371| 5,025| (237)| (38)| (275)  \nLong-term debt| (52)| 1,182| 1,130| 756 | 608 | 1,364   \nTotal borrowed funds| 10,819| 4,679| 15,498| 2,858 | 1,849 | 4,707   \nTotal interest expense| 12,202| 47,463| 59,665| 3,856 | 15,532 | 19,388   \nNet interest income (2) (3)| $| (3,572)| $| (19,768)| $| (23,340)| $| 8,282 | $| (11,681)| $| (3,399)  \n  \n(1)Average balances of nonaccrual loans were included for computational purposes.\n\n(2)Tax-exempt income has been converted to a tax-equivalent basis using a federal income tax rate of 21 percent and is adjusted for the effect of the nondeductible interest expense associated with owning tax-exempt securities and loans. \n\n(3)Net interest income (FTE) is a non-GAAP financial measure.

The improvement was primarily due to an increase in the average yield on loans of 90 basis points in 2023 compared to 2022. Rising market interest rates have resulted in increasing rates on variable-rate loans and higher interest rates on loan renewals and new originations compared to existing portfolio rates. Additionally, the average balance of loans increased $245,580 in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nThe Company continues to focus on expanding existing and entering into new customer relationships while maintaining strong credit quality. The yield on the Company's loan portfolio is affected by the portfolio’s loan mix, the interest rate environment, the effects of competition, the level of nonaccrual loans and reversals of previously accrued interest on charged-off loans. The yield on the loan portfolio is expected to increase in a rising rate environment as variable-rate loans reprice at higher rates and fixed rate loan renewals and new originations are priced at prevailing market rates, which exceed the average rate on existing fixed rate loans. The political and economic environments can also influence the volume of new loan originations and the mix of variable-rate versus fixed-rate loans. \n\nTax-equivalent interest income on securities increased $743 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 2022. The average balance of securities available for sale in 2023 was $85,137 lower than in 2022, primarily due to principal paydowns on securities, sales of securities, and the decline in fair value of available for sale securities during 2023 resulting from the increase in market interest rates during 2023. The yield on available for sale securities increased by 39 basis points in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nInterest expense on deposits increased $44,167 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 2022. The average balance of interest bearing deposits decreased $486 in 2023 compared to 2022. The rates paid on deposits increased 196 basis points in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in the cost of deposits was primarily due to increases in deposit rates in response to increases in the target federal funds rate and market interest rates, increased competition for deposit balances, and changes in deposit mix. The Federal Reserve increased the target federal funds rate by a total of 425 basis points in 2022 and an additional 100 basis points in 2023. These increases have had an adverse impact on the cost of deposits and have increased market competition.\n\nInterest expense on borrowed funds increased $15,498 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 2022. The average balance of borrowed funds increased $293,759 in 2023 compared to 2022. The Company issued $60,000 of subordinated debt in June 2022. Additionally, average balances of federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings increased $131,901 in 2023 compared to 2022. The average rate paid on federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings increased 209 basis points in 2023 compared to 2022. This increase in average rates paid on federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings was driven by the increases in the target federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve. The average balances of FHLB advances increased by $136,781 in 2023 compared to 2022. This increase in average balances was primarily due to increases in our rolling funding program whereby rolling one-month FHLB advances are hedged with long-term interest rate swap agreements to provide long-term fixed cost wholesale funding. The average rate paid on FHLB advances increased 83 basis points in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\nSECURITIES PORTFOLIO\n\nThe balance of securities available for sale decreased by $40,196 as of December 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to principal paydowns on securities and a sale of $11,285 of securities in the fourth quarter of 2023. The proceeds from this sale were reinvested into the loan portfolio. The Company expects the securities portfolio as a percentage of total assets to decrease over time as the proceeds from paydowns and maturities may be used for loan growth or repayment of borrowed funds. \n\nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately 61 percent of the available for sale securities portfolio consisted of government agency guaranteed collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed securities. We believe those securities have little to no credit risk and provide cash flows for liquidity and repricing opportunities. All collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed securities consist of residential and commercial mortgage pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations guaranteed by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), or the Small Business Administration (SBA). The securities issued by state and political subdivisions are diversified among municipalities in 26 states. \n\nThe following table sets forth the weighted average yield by contractual maturity by security type as of December 31, 2023. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. The collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed securities have monthly paydowns that are not reflected in the table.\n\n42\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\n\nWithin oneyear| After one yearbut within fiveyears| After five yearsbut within tenyears| After ten years| Total  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nSecurities available for sale:  \nState and political subdivisions (1)| — | %| — | %| 1.93 | %| 2.15 | %| 2.13 | %  \nCollateralized mortgage obligations| — | — | 2.38 | 1.56 | 1.56   \nMortgage-backed securities| — | 1.45 | 1.61 | 1.65 | 1.63   \nCollateralized loan obligations| — | — | 7.35 | — | 7.35   \nCorporate notes| — | — | 3.26 | — | 3.26   \n— | %| 1.45 | %| 4.07 | %| 1.77 | %| 2.07 | %  \n  \n(1) Yields on tax-exempt obligations have been computed on a tax-equivalent basis using a federal income tax rate of 21 percent and are adjusted to reflect the effect of the nondeductible interest expense associated with owning tax-exempt investment securities. \n\nTotal gross unrealized losses in the securities available for sale portfolio were $121,806 at December 31, 2023 compared to $138,736 at December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, the Company did not have the intent to sell, nor was it more likely than not that we would be required to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position prior to recovery. As of December 31, 2023, the Company also determined that no individual securities in an unrealized loss position represented credit losses that would require an allowance for credit losses. Management concluded that the unrealized losses in the portfolio are the result of increases in risk-free market interest rates since the securities were purchased and are not an indication of declining credit quality. Unrealized losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax. \n\nFor additional information regarding the Company’s securities portfolio, see Note 3 and Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \n\nLOAN PORTFOLIO\n\nThe Company seeks to create growth in commercial lending, which primarily includes commercial real estate, multi-family, and commercial and industrial lending, by offering customer-focused products and competitive pricing and by capitalizing on the positive trends in its market areas. It is the objective of the Company’s credit policies to diversify the commercial loan portfolio to limit concentrations in any single industry. As of December 31, 2023, total loans were approximately 98.4 percent of total deposits and 76.5 percent of total assets.\n\nLoans outstanding at the end of 2023 increased 6.7 percent compared to the end of 2022. Changes in the loan portfolio during 2023 included increases of $82,570 in commercial real estate loans, $50,463 in construction, land and land development loans and $31,477 in 1-4 family residential first mortgage loans. The Company continues to focus on business development efforts in all of its markets. We believe that loan growth could slow down in 2024 as a result of uncertainty and diversity in economic outlooks, labor and wage challenges and the impact of higher interest rates on overall cash flows and debt service capabilities.\n\nFor a description of the loan segments, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk and the amount and terms of the loan. Competitive pressures, the creditworthiness of the borrower, market interest rates, the availability of funds, and government regulations further influence the rate charged on a loan.\n\nThe Company follows a loan policy approved by West Bank’s Board of Directors. The loan policy is reviewed at least annually and is updated as considered necessary. The policy establishes lending limits, review criteria and other guidelines for loan administration and the allowance for credit losses, among other things. Loans are approved in accordance with the applicable guidelines and underwriting policies. Loans to any one borrower are limited by state banking laws. Loan officer lending authorities vary according to the individual loan officer’s experience and expertise.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no loans that were past due 30 days or more.\n\nNonperforming loans declined slightly to $296 at December 31, 2023, compared to $322 at December 31, 2022. The decrease was due to scheduled payments made on the one loan that was included in nonaccrual loans in both periods. \n\n43\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\n\nThe watch classification of loans decreased to $144 as of December 31, 2023 from $54,231 as of December 31, 2022. Commercial real estate loans of approximately $52,600 were upgraded and removed from the watch list during the second quarter of 2023. These loans related to one borrowing relationship that had been downgraded during the COVID-19 pandemic. The upgrade resulted from the borrowers’ ability to return to normal operations and financial performance for an extended period of time. \n\nLoans Secured by Real Estate\n\nThe commercial real estate market continues to be a significant source of business for West Bank. Management places a strong emphasis on monitoring the composition of the Company’s commercial real estate loan portfolio. The Company has an established lending policy which includes a number of underwriting factors to be considered in making a commercial real estate loan, including, but not limited to, location, loan-to-value ratio (LTV), cash flow and debt service coverage, collateral and the credit history and expertise of the borrower. The lending policy also includes guidelines for real estate appraisals and evaluations, including minimum appraisal and evaluation standards.\n\nAlthough repayment risk exists on all loans, different factors influence repayment risk for each type of loan. The primary risks associated with commercial real estate loans are the quality of the borrower’s management and the health of the national and regional economies. Underwriting on commercial properties is primarily based on the economic viability of the project with heavy consideration given to the creditworthiness and experience of the borrower. Recognizing that debt is paid via cash flow, the projected cash flows of the project are critical in underwriting because these determine the ultimate value of the property and the ability to service debt. Therefore, in most commercial real estate projects, we generally require a minimum stabilized debt service coverage ratio of 1.20 to 1.35, depending on the real estate type. Exceptions to this policy can be made for certain borrowers that exhibit other credit quality strengths. Exceptions to the policy are monitored by management. Our strategy with respect to the management of these types of risks is to consistently follow prudent loan policies and underwriting practices.\n\nThe Company recognizes that a diversified loan portfolio contributes to reducing risk. The specific loan portfolio mix is subject to change based on loan demand, the business environment and various economic factors. The Company actively monitors concentrations within the loan portfolio to ensure appropriate diversification is maintained. In addition, management tracks the level of owner occupied commercial real estate loans versus non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans. Owner occupied commercial real estate loans are generally considered to have less risk than non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans.\n\nIn accordance with regulatory guidelines, the Company exercises heightened risk management practices when non-owner occupied commercial real estate lending exceeds 300 percent of total risk-based capital or construction, land development, and other land loans exceed 100 percent of total risk-based capital. Although the Company’s loan portfolio is heavily concentrated in real estate and its real estate portfolio levels exceed these regulatory guidelines, it has established risk management policies and procedures to regularly monitor the commercial real estate portfolio.\n\nThe Bank’s Executive Loan Committee (ELC), which is made up of the Chief Executive Officer, Bank President, Chief Risk Officer, Minnesota Group President, Chief Credit Officer and Credit Department Manager, approves all commercial loan relationships in excess of $500 in total credit exposure and annually reviews all commercial loan relationships of $1,000 and greater. Credit approval authorities for individual officers are reviewed, at least annually, by the ELC and approved by the Board of Directors. \n\nExecutive management regularly reviews available market data. Commercial real estate portfolio monitoring practices include quarterly stress testing and quarterly trend analysis of underwriting exceptions, average loan-to-value and average debt service coverage for significant real estate segments.\n\nThe Company maintains an annual independent loan review program. The Company engages a third party to evaluate credit quality, assigned risk ratings, underwriting standards and collateral documentation. The review covers a significant portion of the loan portfolio and is carried out on a semi-annual basis. Findings are reported to the ELC and the Board of Directors. The Company also maintains an internal loan audit department that performs certain pre- and post-closing procedural and documentation reviews.

See Notes 1 and 4 to the Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. \n\nThe credit loss expense recorded on the income statement includes charges made to earnings to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses. The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is evaluated quarterly by management and reviewed by the Board. The allowance for credit losses is management’s estimate of expected lifetime losses in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date.\n\n46\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\n\nFactors considered by management in establishing an appropriate allowance include: the borrower’s financial condition; the value and adequacy of loan collateral; the condition of the local economy and the borrower’s specific industry; the levels and trends of loans by segment; and a review of delinquent and classified loans. The quarterly evaluation focuses on factors such as specific loan reviews, changes in the components of the loan portfolio given economic conditions, and historical loss experience. Any one of the following conditions may result in the review of a specific loan: concern about whether the borrower’s cash flow or net worth is sufficient to repay the loan; delinquency status; criticism of the loan in a regulatory examination; the suspension of interest accrual; or other factors, including whether the loan has other special or unusual characteristics that suggest special monitoring is warranted. The Company’s concentration risks include geographic concentration in central and eastern Iowa and southern Minnesota. The local economies are composed primarily of major financial services companies, healthcare providers, educational institutions, technology and agribusiness companies, and state and local governments. \n\nWest Bank has a significant portion of its loan portfolio in commercial real estate loans, commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, and construction and land development loans. West Bank’s typical commercial borrower is a small- or medium-sized, privately owned business entity. Compared to residential mortgages or consumer loans, commercial loans typically have larger balances and repayment usually depends on the borrowers’ successful business operations. Commercial loans also generally are not fully repaid over the loan period and, thus, may require refinancing or a large payoff at maturity. When the general economy turns downward, commercial borrowers may not be able to repay their loans, and the value of their assets, which are usually pledged as collateral, may decrease rapidly and significantly. \n\nWhile management uses available information to recognize credit losses, further reduction in the carrying amounts of loans may be necessary based on changes in circumstances, changes in the overall economy in the markets we currently serve, or later acquired information. Identifiable sectors within the general economy are subject to additional volatility, which at any time may have a substantial impact on the loan portfolio. In addition, regulatory agencies, as integral parts of their examination processes, periodically review the credit quality of the loan portfolio and the level of the allowance for credit losses. Such agencies may require West Bank to recognize additional charge-offs or provisions for credit losses based on such agencies’ review of information available to them at the time of their examinations. \n\nThe following table shows the ratio of net (charge-offs) recoveries to loans outstanding, broken out by loan segment, along with ratios of the allowance and nonaccrual loans to total loans at the end of the period.\n\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Credit Losses for the Years Ended December 31  \n---  \n2023| 2022| 2021  \nRatio of net (charge-offs) recoveries during the   \nperiod to average loans outstanding by segment:  \nCommercial| —| %| — | %| 0.02 | %  \nReal estate:  \nConstruction, land and land development| —| — | —   \n1-4 family residential first mortgages| —| — | —   \nHome equity| —| — | —   \nCommercial| —| (0.02)| %| —   \nConsumer and other| —| — | —   \nTotal| 0.00| %| (0.02)| %| 0.02 | %  \nRatio of allowance for credit losses to total  \nloans at the end of period| 0.97| %| 0.93 | %| 1.15 | %  \nRatio of nonaccrual loans to total loans at  \nend of period| 0.01| %| 0.01 | %| 0.36 | %  \nRatio of allowance for credit losses to total  \nnonaccrual loans at the end of period| 9,575.00| %| 7,910.87 | %| 316.99 | %  \nRatio of net (charge-offs) recoveries to total  \nloans at end of period| 0.00| %| (0.01)| %| 0.02 | %  \n  \n(1) As presented, this is a non-GAAP financial measure.

As of December 31, 2022, there were no specific reserves related to loans individually evaluated for impairment. The portion of the allowance for credit losses related to loans collectively evaluated for credit losses increased to $28,342, or 0.97 percent of outstanding loans as of December 31, 2023, compared to $25,473, or 0.93 percent of outstanding loans as of December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to the $2,458 adjustment to the allowance on January 1, 2023 related to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, also known as the current expected credit loss, or CECL, standard. Additionally, there was a credit loss expense of $500 related to loans for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was due primarily to loan growth. The provision for loan losses recorded in 2022 was negative $2,500. This negative provision in 2022 was due to the reversal of a specific reserve on an impaired loan and the reduction of certain qualitative factors resulting from the sustained performance of loans after the expiration of COVID-19 modifications and continued improvement in classified loans. Management believed the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023 was adequate to absorb the expected losses in the portfolio as of that date. \n\nDEPOSITS\n\nDeposits totaled $2,973,779 as of December 31, 2023, which was an increase of 3.2 percent compared to December 31, 2022. Deposit inflows and outflows are influenced by prevailing market interest rates, competition, local and national economic conditions, fluctuations in our business customers’ own liquidity needs and recent developments in the financial services industry. In particular, significant competition for deposits driven by high interest rate alternatives for depositors is currently impacting deposit fluctuations and increasing our cost of deposits. \n\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had $305,411 in brokered deposits, compared to $272,691 at December 31, 2022. Brokered deposits included fixed-rate time deposits with maturities through December 2025 and variable-rate deposits with terms through February 2025. Brokered deposits are utilized, along with other wholesale funding sources, to fund loan growth and offset core deposit outflows. \n\n48\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\n\nThe following table sets forth the average balances for each major category of deposits and the weighted average interest rate paid for those deposits during the years indicated.\n\nYears ended December 31  \n---  \n2023| 2022| 2021  \nAverage| Average| Average| Average| Average| Average  \nBalance| Rate| Balance| Rate| Balance| Rate  \nNoninterest-bearing demand| $| 586,903| —| %| $| 708,667 | — | %| $| 709,009 | — | %  \nInterest-bearing demand:  \nInsured cash sweep| 137,027| 2.48| 139,807 | 0.80 | 125,402 | 0.34   \nOther interest-bearing demand| 330,147| 1.09| 366,082 | 0.37 | 352,586 | 0.10   \nMoney market:  \nInsured cash sweep| 249,574| 3.58| 323,970 | 1.01 | 308,136 | 0.36   \nOther money market| 973,853| 3.47| 967,953 | 1.26 | 959,314 | 0.45   \nSavings| 134,248| 0.61| 160,111 | 0.24 | 146,428 | 0.14   \nTime| 424,320| 3.83| 291,732 | 1.49 | 208,164 | 0.74   \n$| 2,836,072| $| 2,958,322 | $| 2,809,039   \n  \nManagement believes interest rates on deposits could continue to increase in 2024 in response to ongoing competition for deposit balances and high short-term market rates. To limit the Company’s exposure to market interest rate changes, interest rate swaps are in place on $110,000 of deposit balances that effectively convert certain customer deposits with variable rates to fixed-rate instruments. \n\nApproximately 93 percent of the total time deposits issued by West Bank mature in the next year, including brokered time deposits. It is anticipated that a significant portion of the core time deposits will be renewed. In the event a substantial volume of core time deposits are not renewed, management believes the Company has sufficient liquid assets and funding sources to offset the potential runoff.\n\nThe following table shows the amounts and remaining maturities of time deposits with balances of $100 or more as of December 31, 2023.\n\n3 months or less| $| 231,110   \n---|---|---  \nOver 3 through 6 months| 123,674   \nOver 6 through 12 months| 91,151   \nOver 12 months| 28,283   \n$| 474,218   \n  \nWest Bank participates in the IntraFi® ICS and CDARS reciprocal deposit network, which enables depositors to receive FDIC insurance coverage on deposits otherwise exceeding the maximum insurable amount. We consider these reciprocal deposits to be in-market deposits as distinguished from traditional out-of-market brokered deposits. Time deposits as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, included $152,160 and $122,915, respectively, of reciprocal deposits. Included in total deposits as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, were $165,858 and $155,888, respectively, of reciprocal interest-bearing checking and $254,504 and $186,160, respectively, of reciprocal money market deposits. \n\nTotal estimated uninsured deposits were $1,435,406, $1,412,955 and $1,312,933 as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings decreased from $200,000 as of December 31, 2022 to $150,270 as of December 31, 2023. \n\nThe Company had $315,000 of FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2023, compared to $155,000 at December 31, 2022. During 2023, the Company increased its rolling funding program by entering into seven long-term interest rate swap agreements hedging interest payments of one-month rolling funding with a total notional amount of $140,000. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s rolling funding program, funded with short-term FHLB advances and hedged with long-term interest rate swaps, totaled $295,000. These interest rate swaps have maturity dates ranging from August 2024 through June 2029 and fixed rates ranging from 1.69 percent to 4.65 percent. This strategy of hedging short-term rolling funding effectively provides fixed cost wholesale funding through the maturity dates of the various interest rate swaps.\n\nIn December 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement with an unaffiliated commercial bank and borrowed $40,000. This credit agreement replaced a prior credit agreement with the same commercial bank that had a remaining balance of $5,500. The additional borrowing was used to make a capital injection into the Company’s subsidiary, West Bank. Interest is payable quarterly. Required quarterly principal payments began in May 2023. The Company may make additional principal payments without penalty. The interest rate is variable at the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate minus 1.00 percent, which was 7.50 percent as of December 31, 2023. During 2023, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract that effectively converts $20,000 of this borrowing to a fixed rate of 6.40 percent through its maturity date. As of December 31, 2023, this borrowing had a balance of $36,250.\n\nIn June 2022, the Company issued $60,000 of subordinated notes (Notes). The Notes initially bear interest at 5.25 percent per annum, with interest payable semi-annually for the first five years of the Notes. Beginning June 15, 2027, the interest rate will reset quarterly to a floating rate per annum that is expected to be three-month term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 2.41 percent, with payments due quarterly. The Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, on and after June 15, 2027 at a price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Notes will mature on June 15, 2032 if they are not earlier redeemed. Proceeds from this debt issuance were used to make a $58,650 capital injection into West Bank, the Company’s subsidiary.\n\nThe Company has an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $20,000 which converts variable-rate subordinated debentures to fixed-rate debt. The interest rate is a variable rate based on the 3-month term SOFR plus 0.26161 percent tenor spread adjustment plus 3.05 percent. This interest rate swap has a fixed rate of 4.81 percent and matures in September 2026.\n\nWest Bank’s new markets tax credit special purpose subsidiary has a credit agreement for $11,486. Interest is payable monthly over the term of the agreement with an interest rate of 1.00 percent. Monthly principal payments begin in January 2026, and the agreement matures in December 2048. \n\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\n\nIn the normal course of business, West Bank commits to extend credit in the form of loan commitments and standby letters of credit in order to meet the financing needs of its customers. These commitments expose West Bank to varying degrees of credit and market risks in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and are subject to the same credit policies as are the loans recorded on the balance sheets.\n\nWest Bank’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. West Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Commitments to lend are subject to borrowers’ continuing compliance with existing credit agreements. Off-balance sheet commitments are more fully discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\n50\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses related to off-balance sheet unfunded commitments was $2,544. Upon the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, the Company recorded an allowance for credit losses associated with unfunded commitments of $2,344. In 2023, the Company recorded a credit loss expense of $200 for unfunded commitments. The allowance for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures is presented in the “Accrued expenses and other liabilities” line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nThe objectives of liquidity management are to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to meet all financial commitments and to capitalize on opportunities for profitable business expansion. The Company’s principal source of funds is deposits. Other sources include loan principal repayments, proceeds from the maturity and sale of securities, principal payments on amortizing securities, federal funds purchased, advances from the FHLB, other wholesale funding and funds provided by operations. Liquidity management is conducted on both a daily and a long-term basis. Investments in liquid assets are adjusted based on expected loan demand, projected loan and securities maturities and payments, expected deposit flows and the objectives set by West Bank’s asset-liability management policy. The Company had liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents) of $65,357 as of December 31, 2023 compared with $26,539 as of December 31, 2022. \n\nOur deposit growth strategy emphasizes core deposit growth. Deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing market interest rates, competition, local and national economic conditions, fluctuations in our corporate customers’ and municipal customers’ own liquidity needs and recent developments in the financial services industry. The Company utilizes brokered deposits and other wholesale funding to supplement core deposit fluctuations and loan growth. Brokered deposits are obtained through various programs administered by IntraFi® and through other third party brokers. At December 31, 2023, the Company had $305,411 in brokered deposits, which included fixed-rate time deposits with maturities through December 2025 and variable-rate deposits with terms through February 2025.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, West Bank had additional borrowing capacity available from the FHLB of approximately $528,000, as well as approximately $2,282 through the Federal Reserve discount window, $35,000 through unsecured federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks and $89,000 through the BTFP. The BTFP was established by the Federal Reserve in March 2023 to provide an additional source of liquidity against high-quality securities. As of December 31, 2023, West Bank had pledged approximately $89,000 in eligible securities to facilitate participation in the program. No funds were borrowed from the Federal Reserve discount window or BTFP as of December 31, 2023. The Federal Reserve has announced that it is ending the BTFP and will cease making new loans under this program on March 11, 2024. Net cash from continuing operating activities contributed $25,249, $59,439 and $57,878 to liquidity for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Management believed that the combination of high levels of potentially liquid assets, unencumbered securities, cash flows from operations and additional borrowing capacity provided the Company with sufficient liquidity as of December 31, 2023.\n\nWest Bank has entered into a construction contract for the construction of a new headquarters building in West Des Moines, Iowa. West Bank will pay the contractor a contract price consisting of the cost of work plus a fee, with anticipated construction completed in 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had a remaining commitment of $13,019 under this contract. \n\nThe Company’s total stockholders’ equity increased to $225,043 as of December 31, 2023 from $211,112 as of December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to net income less dividends paid and the decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss. At December 31, 2023, tangible common equity as a percent of tangible assets was 5.88 percent compared to 5.84 percent as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss was driven by the decrease in the net unrealized losses on available for sale securities between December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023. While accumulated other comprehensive losses reduce tangible common equity, they have no impact on regulatory capital. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no intangible assets. \n\nThe Company and West Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies. Capital requirements are more fully discussed under the heading “Supervision and Regulation” included in Item 1 and in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2023, the Company and West Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject, and the Company’s and West Bank’s capital ratios were in excess of the requirements to be well-capitalized under capital regulations. Also, as of December 31, 2023, the ratios for the Company and West Bank were sufficient to meet the capital conservation buffer.\n\n51\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\n\nEFFECTS OF NEW STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\n\nA discussion of the effects of new financial accounting standards and developments as they relate to the Company is located in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nThe Company’s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk arising from its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking. Interest rate risk refers to the exposure arising from changes in interest rates. Fluctuations in interest rates have a significant impact not only upon net income, but also upon the cash flows and market values of assets and liabilities. Our results of operations, like those of other financial institutions, are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Management continually develops and applies strategies to mitigate this risk. \n\nThe Company’s objectives are to manage interest rate risk to foster consistent growth of earnings and capital. It is our policy to maintain an acceptable level of interest rate risk over a range of possible changes in interest rates while remaining responsive to market demand for loan and deposit products. To measure that risk, the Company uses an earnings simulation approach. \n\nThe Company has an Asset Liability Committee which meets quarterly, or more often when deemed necessary, to review the interest rate sensitivity position and to review and develop various strategies for managing interest rate risk. Measuring and maintaining interest rate risk is a dynamic process that management performs with the objective of maximizing net interest margin while maintaining interest rate risk within acceptable tolerances. This process relies primarily on the simulation of net interest income over multiple interest rate scenarios. The Company engages a third party that utilizes a modeling program to measure the Company’s exposure to potential interest rate changes. For various assumed hypothetical changes in market interest rates, this analysis measures the estimated change in net interest income. The simulations allow for ongoing assessment of interest rate sensitivity and can include the impact of potential new business strategies. The modeled scenarios begin with a base case in which rates are unchanged and can include parallel and nonparallel rate shocks. The results of these shocks are measured in two forms: first, the impact on the net interest margin and earnings over one and two year time frames; and second, the impact on the market value of equity. The results of the simulation are compared against approved policy limits. \n\nThe following table presents the estimated change in net interest income for one year under several scenarios of assumed interest rate changes for the rate shock levels shown. The change in each interest rate scenario represents the difference between estimated net interest income in the unchanged interest rate scenario, or the base case, and the estimated net interest income in each of the alternative interest rate scenarios. The net interest income in each scenario is based on immediate parallel yield curve changes in the interest rates applied to a static balance sheet. These do not reflect the earnings expectations of management.\n\nNet Interest Income at  \n---  \nDecember 31, 2023  \nChange in Interest Rates| $ Change| % Change  \n300 basis points rising| $| (11,456)| (14.73)| %  \n200 basis points rising| (7,187)| (9.24)  \n100 basis points rising| (3,559)| (4.58)  \n100 basis points falling| 2,461 | 3.16   \n200 basis points falling| 4,786 | 6.16   \n  \nComputations of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions. The assumptions used in our interest rate sensitivity simulation discussed above are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the simulations cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ from those projections set forth above due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and customer behavior. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions the Company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates. \n\n52\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of West Bancorporation, Inc.\n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of West Bancorporation, Inc. and its subsidiary (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated February 21, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nAdoption of New Accounting Standard\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for credit losses on financial instruments in 2023 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Credit Losses). \n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses for Loans\n\nAs described in Note 1 and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s allowance for credit losses for loans (allowance) totaled $28.3 million at December 31, 2023. On January 1, 2023 the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The allowance is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount of loans expected to be collected. The Company’s allowance reflects losses expected over the remaining contractual life of the loans. The Company’s allowance is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis at the balance sheet date. At December 31, 2023 the reserve on loans collectively evaluated totaled $28.3 million and there was no reserve on loans individually evaluated. \n\n53\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nThe measurement of the reserve is based on relevant information about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The methodologies apply historical loss information, adjusted for asset-specific characteristics, economic conditions at the measurement date, and forecasts about the future economic conditions expected to exist through the contractual lives of the financial assets that are reasonable and supportable, to the identified pools of financial assets with similar risk characteristics for which the historical experience was observed. The Company uses a cash flow-based model to estimate expected credit losses for all loan segments. For each of the loan segments, the Company calculates a cash flow projection using contractual terms, estimated prepayment speeds, estimated curtailment rates and other relevant data. The Company uses a regression analysis that links historical losses of the Company and its peer group to two economic metrics: national unemployment rate and 10-year treasury rate over 2-year treasury rate spread to establish the loss rates applied to the projected cash flows. For all loan segments, the Company uses a forecast period of four quarters and reverts to a historical rate after four quarters. Qualitative factors are based on management’s judgment of the changes in underlying loan composition of specific portfolio, trends relating to credit quality and collateral values, company-specific data, or effects of other factors such as market competition or legal and regulatory requirements. The evaluation of these qualitative factors and forecasts requires that management make significant judgments and includes significant estimation uncertainty.\n\nWe identified the qualitative factors applied to the allowance as a critical audit matter as auditing management’s determination of the qualitative factors and forecasts required significant auditor judgment as the estimate is highly sensitive to changes in significant assumptions.\n\nOur audit procedures related to the Company’s qualitative factors and forecasts in the allowance included the following, among others:\n\n•We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to management’s evaluation and establishment of the qualitative factors and forecasts of the allowance and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness, including controls relating to management’s review and approval of the qualitative factors and forecasts and the underlying data used in determining those factors.\n\n•We tested management’s process and evaluated the reasonableness of their judgements and assumptions to develop the qualitative factors and forecasts, which included: \n\n◦Testing the relevancy and consistency of the data inputs used by management as a basis for the adjustment for qualitative factors and forecasts by comparing to internal and external source data, including data related to current and forecasted periods.\n\n◦Evaluating whether management’s conclusions were consistent with Company provided internal data and external independently sourced data and agreeing the impact to the allowance calculation. \n\n/s/ RSM US LLP\n\nDes Moines, Iowa\n\nFebruary 21, 2024 \n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1998.\n\n54\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of West Bancorporation, Inc.\n\nOpinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited West Bancorporation, Inc.’s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Managements’ Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ RSM US LLP\n\nDes Moines, Iowa\n\nFebruary 21, 2024 \n\n55\n\n[Table of

Organization and Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nOrganization and nature of business: West Bancorporation, Inc. operates in the commercial banking industry through its wholly-owned subsidiary, West Bank. West Bank is a state chartered bank and has its main office in West Des Moines, Iowa, with five additional offices located in the Des Moines, Iowa, metropolitan area, one office located in Coralville, Iowa, and four offices located in Minnesota, in the cities of Rochester, Owatonna, Mankato and St. Cloud. As used herein, the term “Company” refers to West Bancorporation, Inc., or if the context dictates, West Bancorporation, Inc. and its subsidiary.\n\nSignificant accounting policies:\n\nAccounting estimates and assumptions: The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). References to GAAP issued by the FASB in these footnotes are to the FASB Accounting Standards CodificationTM, sometimes referred to as the Codification or ASC. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term are the fair value of financial instruments and the allowance for credit losses.\n\nConsolidation policy: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, West Bank and West Bank’s special purpose subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. In addition, the Company owns an unconsolidated subsidiary, West Bancorporation Capital Trust I (the Trust), which was formed for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities. In accordance with GAAP, the results of the Trust are recorded on the books of the Company using the equity method of accounting and are not consolidated.\n\nSegment information: An operating segment is generally defined as a component of a business for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision-maker. As a community-oriented financial institution, substantially all of West Bank’s operations involve the delivery of loan and deposit products to customers. Management makes operating decisions and assesses performance based on an ongoing review of the community banking activities, which constitutes the Company’s only operating segment for financial reporting purposes. \n\nComprehensive income: Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income (OCI). OCI consists of the net change in unrealized gains and losses on the Company’s securities available for sale and the change in fair value of derivative instruments designated as hedges. \n\nCash and cash equivalents and cash flows: For statement of cash flow purposes, the Company considers cash, due from banks and interest-bearing deposits to be cash and cash equivalents. Cash inflows and outflows from loans, deposits, federal funds purchased and short-term borrowings and FHLB advances are reported on a net basis.\n\nSecurities Available for Sale: Securities that may be sold for general liquidity needs, in response to market interest rate fluctuations, implementation of asset-liability management strategies, funding loan demand, changes in securities prepayment risk or other similar factors are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of deferred income taxes. Realized gains and losses on sales of securities are computed on a specific identification basis based on amortized cost.\n\nThe amortized cost of securities available for sale is adjusted for accretion of discounts to maturity and amortization of premiums over the estimated life of each security or, in the case of callable securities, through the first call date, using the effective yield method. Such amortization and accretion is included in interest income. Interest income on securities is recognized using the interest method according to the terms of the security.\n\n61\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nThe Company evaluates each of its securities whose value has declined below amortized cost to determine if any of the decline is due to a credit loss. If the Company intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, then the security is written down to fair value through income. Subsequent to this evaluation, the Company evaluates whether any individual securities in an unrealized loss position represent credit losses that require an allowance for credit loss. Decreases in fair value attributable to credit losses would be recorded to earnings as a credit loss expense with a corresponding allowance for credit losses, limited by the amount the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. If the credit quality subsequently improves, the allowance would be reversed, up to a maximum of the previously recorded credit loss. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. \n\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock: West Bank, as a member of the FHLB system, is required to maintain an investment in capital stock of the FHLB in an amount equal to 0.06 percent of total assets plus 4.50 percent of outstanding advances from the FHLB and the outstanding principal balance of loans previously issued through the Mortgage Partnership Finance Program (MPF). No ready market exists for the FHLB stock, and it has no quoted market value. The Company evaluates this asset for impairment on a quarterly basis and determined there was no impairment as of December 31, 2023. All shares of FHLB stock are issued and redeemed at par value.\n\nLoans: Loans are stated at the principal amounts outstanding, net of unamortized loan fees and costs, with interest income recognized on the interest method based upon the terms of the loan. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of the related loan yield using the interest method. Loans are reported by the portfolio segments identified and are analyzed by management on this basis. All loan policies identified below apply to all segments of the loan portfolio.\n\nDelinquencies are determined based on the payment terms of the individual loan agreements. The accrual of interest on past due and other impaired loans is generally discontinued at 90 days past due or when, in the opinion of management, the borrower may be unable to make all payments pursuant to contractual terms. Unless considered collectible, all interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged off is reversed against interest income, if accrued in the current year, or charged to the allowance for credit losses, if accrued in a prior year. Generally, all payments received while a loan is on nonaccrual status are applied to the principal balance of the loan. Loans are returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. \n\nBased upon its ongoing assessment of credit quality within the loan portfolio, the Company maintains a Watch List, which includes loans classified as Doubtful, Substandard and Watch according to the Company’s classification criteria. These loans involve the anticipated potential for payment defaults or collateral inadequacies. If it is determined that a loan on the Watch List no longer shares risk characteristics with the pooled loans, it will be individually evaluated for credit losses. For collateral dependent loans where the Company has determined that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company expects repayment of the loans to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the ACL is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. The ACL may be zero if the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date exceeds the amortized cost basis of the loan.\n\nAllowance for credit losses: The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account estimated at each balance sheet date and deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. The Company estimates the ACL based on the underlying loans’ amortized cost basis, which is the amount at which the loan is originated or acquired, adjusted for collection of cash and charge-offs, as well as applicable accretion or amortization of premiums, discounts, and net deferred fees or costs. The Company’s estimate of the ACL reflects losses expected over the remaining contractual life of the assets. When the Company deems all or a portion of a loan to be uncollectible, the appropriate amount is written off and the ACL is reduced by the same amount. The Company applies judgment to determine when a loan is deemed uncollectible; however, generally speaking, a loan will be considered uncollectible no later than when all efforts at collection have been exhausted. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the ACL when received. \n\n62\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nThe Company measures the ACL of loans on a collective (pool) basis when the loans share similar risk characteristics and uses a cash flow-based method to estimate expected credit losses for each of these pools. The Company’s methodology for estimating the ACL considers available relevant information about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The methodologies apply historical loss information, adjusted for asset-specific characteristics, economic conditions at the measurement date, and forecasts about future economic conditions expected to exist through the contractual lives of the financial assets that are reasonable and supportable, to the identified pools of financial assets with similar risk characteristics for which the historical experience was observed. In addition to the historical loss information, the Company utilizes qualitative factors to adjust the ACL as appropriate. Qualitative factors are based on management’s judgment of the changes in underlying loan composition of specific portfolios, trends relating to credit quality and collateral values, company-specific data, or effects of other factors such as market competition or legal and regulatory requirements. Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the pooled loans are evaluated for credit losses on an individual basis. In addition, regulatory agencies, as integral parts of their examination processes, periodically review the Company’s allowance for credit losses, and may require the Company to make additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations.\n\nPremises and equipment: Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The straight-line method of depreciation and amortization is used for calculating expense. The estimated useful lives of premises and equipment range up to 40 years for buildings, up to 10 years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of the estimated useful life or lease term for leasehold improvements.\n\nThe Company reviews its property and equipment whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded when the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset group. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value.\n\nOther real estate owned: Real estate properties acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling cost at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Fair value is determined by management by obtaining appraisals or other market value information at the time of foreclosure. Any write-downs in value at the date of acquisition are charged to the allowance for credit losses. After foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management by obtaining updated appraisals or other market value information at least annually. Any subsequent write-downs are recorded as a charge to operations, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of a property to the updated fair value less estimated selling cost. Net costs related to the holding of properties are included in noninterest expense. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no other real estate owned. \n\nTrust assets: Assets held by West Bank in fiduciary or agency capacities, other than trust cash on deposit at West Bank, are not included in the consolidated balance sheets of the Company, as such assets are not assets of West Bank. The Company managed or administered accounts with assets totaling $612,190 and $550,994 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nBank-owned life insurance: The carrying amount of bank-owned life insurance consists of the initial premium paid, plus increases in cash value, less the carrying amount associated with any death benefit received. Death benefits paid in excess of the applicable carrying amount are recognized as income. Increases in cash value and the portion of death benefits recognized as income are exempt from income taxes.\n\n63\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nDerivatives: The Company uses derivative financial instruments, which consist of interest rate swaps, to assist in its interest rate risk management. All derivatives are measured and reported at fair value on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as other assets or other liabilities. The Company records cash flow hedges at the inception of the derivative contract based on the Company’s intentions and belief as to likely effectiveness as a hedge. The Company documents the strategy for entering into the transactions and the method of assessing ongoing effectiveness. Cash flow hedges represent a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability. For a cash flow hedge that is effective, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported in other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings in the same periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not highly effective in hedging the changes in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately in current earnings. All of the Company’s cash flow hedges qualify for hedge accounting and are considered highly effective.\n\nNet cash settlements on derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in interest income or interest expense, based on the item being hedged. Cash flows on hedges are classified in the cash flow statement the same as the cash flows of the items being hedged. To determine fair value, the Company uses third-party pricing models that incorporate assumptions about market conditions and risks that are current at the reporting date. The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nThe Company formally assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative instruments that are used are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. The Company discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative is settled or terminates, a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable, a hedged firm commitment is no longer firm, or treatment of the derivative as a hedge is no longer appropriate or intended.When hedge accounting is discontinued, subsequent changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded as noninterest income. When a cash flow hedge is discontinued but the hedged cash flows or forecasted transactions are still expected to occur, gains or losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income are amortized into earnings over the same periods in which the hedged transactions will affect earnings.\n\nTo accommodate customer needs, the Company on occasion offers loan level interest rate swaps to its customers and offsets its exposure from such contracts by entering into mirror image swaps with a swap counterparty (back-to-back swap program). The interest rate swaps are free-standing derivatives and are recorded at fair value. The customer accommodations and any offsetting swaps are treated as non-hedging derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting.\n\nStock-based compensation: Compensation expense for stock-based awards is recorded over the vesting period, or until the participant reaches full retirement age if less than the vesting period, at the fair value of the award at the time of grant. Certain grants of restricted stock units (RSUs) are subject to performance-based vesting and cliff vest based on those conditions. Compensation expense is recognized over the service period to the extent restricted stock awards are expected to vest. The fair value of RSUs granted under the Company’s incentive plans is equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date, adjusted for dividends and required post vesting holding periods where applicable. The Company has elected to record forfeitures as they occur. See Note 13 Stock Compensation Plans for further information.\n\nDeferred compensation: The West Bancorporation, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the Deferred Compensation Plan) provides certain individuals with additional deferral opportunities in planning for retirement. Eligible participants, including directors and key officers of the Company, may choose to voluntarily defer receipt of a portion of their respective cash compensation. The Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan intended to conform to the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Liabilities accrued under the Deferred Compensation Plan totaled $1,021 and $648 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n64\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nIncome taxes: The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return. Income tax expense is generally allocated as if the Company and its subsidiary file separate income tax returns. Deferred taxes are provided on an asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, capital losses and net operating losses, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. \n\nWhen tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some tax positions taken will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the positions taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. The evaluation of a tax position taken is considered by itself and is not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. Management does not believe the Company has any material uncertain tax positions to disclose.\n\nInterest and penalties, if any, related to income taxes are recorded as other noninterest expense in the consolidated income statements in the year assessed.\n\nRevenue recognition: Revenue from deposit account-related fees, including general service fees charged for deposit account maintenance and activity and transaction-based fees charged for certain services, such as debit card, wire transfer or overdraft activities, is recognized when the performance obligation is completed, which is generally after a transaction is completed or monthly for account maintenance services. Trust services, which include periodic fees earned from trusts and investment management agency accounts, estate administration, custody accounts, individual retirement accounts, and other related services, are charged based on standard agreements or by statute and are recognized over the period of time the Company provides the contracted services. \n\nEarnings per common share: Basic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if the Company’s outstanding RSUs were vested. The dilutive effect is computed using the treasury stock method, which assumes all stock-based awards were exercised and the hypothetical proceeds from exercise were used by the Company to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. \n\nCurrent accounting developments: In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326). The amendments in this update require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial assets. Under the update, the income statement will reflect the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount of financial assets. An entity must use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances. The allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination that are measured at amortized cost basis is determined in a similar manner to other financial assets measured at amortized cost basis; however, the initial allowance for credit losses is added to the purchase price rather than being reported as a credit loss expense. Only subsequent changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as a credit loss expense for these assets. Off-balance-sheet arrangements such as commitments to extend credit, guarantees, and standby letters of credit that are not considered derivatives under ASC 815 and are not unconditionally cancellable are also within the scope of this update. Credit losses relating to available for sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. \n\n65\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326). This update amended the effective date of ASU No. 2016-13 for certain entities, including smaller reporting companies, until fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal periods. The one-time determination date for identifying as a smaller reporting company was November 15, 2019. The Company met the definition of a smaller reporting company as of that date and was not required to adopt the standard until January 1, 2023. \n\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. The amendments in this ASU improve the usefulness of information provided to investors about certain loan refinancings, restructurings, and write-offs. The amendments eliminate the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) by creditors that have adopted ASU No. 2016-13. It also enhances disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Lastly, the amendments require that a public business entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investment in leases.\n\nThe Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13 using the modified retrospective method for financial assets measured at amortized cost and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Results for the periods beginning after January 1, 2023 are presented under ASU No. 2016-13, while prior period amounts are reported in accordance with the previously applicable accounting standards. The Company recorded a reduction to retained earnings of $3,626 upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-13. The transition adjustment included an increase to the allowance for credit losses on loans of $2,458 and established an allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures of $2,344. There was no allowance for credit losses recorded for available-for-sale debt securities. The transition adjustment included corresponding increases in deferred tax assets of $1,176. \n\nThe following table illustrates the impact of ASC 326 adoption.\n\nJanuary 1, 2023  \n---  \nPre-ASC 326 Adoption| Impact of ASC 326 Adoption| As Reported Under ASC 326  \nAssets:  \nCommercial| $| 4,804| $| 677| $| 5,481  \nReal estate:  \nConstruction, land and land development| 3,548| (234)| 3,314  \n1-4 family residential first mortgages| 357| 121| 478  \nHome equity| 101| (8)| 93  \nCommercial| 16,575| 1,911| 18,486  \nConsumer and other| 88| (9)| 79  \nAllowance for credit losses on loans| $| 25,473| $| 2,458| $| 27,931  \nLiabilities:  \nLiability for off-balance sheet credit exposures| $| —| $| 2,344| $| 2,344  \n  \n66\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The amendments in this update provide optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. They provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments in this update were effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope. The amendments in this update refined the scope for certain optional expedients and exceptions for contract modifications and hedge accounting to apply to derivative contracts and certain hedging relationships affected by the discounting transition. The amendments in this update were effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848. The amendment in this update extends the period of time preparers can utilize reference rate reform relief guidance in Topic 848, discussed above. ASU No. 2022-06 defers the sunset date from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The Company does not expect the updates within Topic 848 to have a material impact on our financial statements. \n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using Proportional Amortization Method. The ASU is intended to improve the accounting and disclosures for investments in tax credit structures. It allows reporting entities to elect to adopt for qualifying tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method, regardless of the program giving rise to the related income tax credits. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the ASU to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. The ASU incorporates certain SEC disclosure requirements into the FASB Accounting Standards CodificationTM.. The amendments in the ASU are expected to clarify or improve disclosure presentation requirements of a variety of Codification Topics, allow users to more easily compare entities subject to the SEC’s existing disclosures with those entities that were not previously subject to the requirements, and align the requirements in the Codification with the SEC’s regulations. For entities subject to the SEC’s existing disclosure requirements and for entities required to file or furnish financial statements with or to the SEC in preparation for the sale of or for purposes of issuing securities that are not subject to contractual restrictions on transfer, the effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC removes that related disclosure from its rules. For all other entities, the amendments will be effective two years later. However, if by June 30, 2027, the SEC has not removed the related disclosure from its regulations, the amendments will be removed from the Codification and not become effective for any entity. These amendments have not had an impact to the Company as of December 31, 2023. \n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The ASU is intended to improve the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation table and income taxes paid to be disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. \n\n67\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nNote 2.

If the Company intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, then the security is written down to fair value through income. As of December 31, 2023, the Company did not have the intent to sell, nor was it more likely than not that we would be required to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position prior to recovery. As of December 31, 2023, the Company also determined that no individual securities in an unrealized loss position represented credit losses that would require an allowance for credit losses. The Company concluded that the unrealized losses were primarily attributable to increases in market interest rates since these securities were purchased and other market conditions. Accrued interest receivable is not included in available-for-sale security balances and is presented in the “Accrued interest receivable” line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest receivable on securities was $3,271 as of December 31, 2023, and was excluded from the estimate of credit losses. \n\n70\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company believed the unrealized losses on securities available for sale were due to market conditions rather than reduced estimated cash flows. At December 31, 2022, the Company did not intend to sell the securities, did not anticipate these securities will be required to be sold before anticipated recovery, and expected full principal and interest to be collected. Therefore, under the accounting principles effective at December 31, 2022, the Company did not consider these securities to have other than temporary impairment as of December 31, 2022. \n\nNote 4.

None of these loans are past due, on nonaccrual status or restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower.

The Company estimates the ACL based on the underlying loans' amortized cost basis, which is the amount at which the loan is originated or acquired, adjusted for collection of cash and charge-offs, as well as applicable accretion or amortization of premiums, discounts, and net deferred fees or costs. The Company's estimate of the ACL reflects losses expected over the remaining contractual life of the assets. The contractual term does not consider extensions, renewals or modifications unless the Company has identified an expected restructuring. In the event that collection of principal becomes uncertain, the Company has policies in place to reverse accrued interest in a timely manner. Therefore, the Company has made a policy election to exclude accrued interest from the measurement of the ACL. \n\nAccrued interest on loans of $10,292 and $8,665 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, was included in accrued interest receivable on the balance sheet and was excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\n\nExpected credit losses are reflected in the allowance for credit losses through a charge to credit loss expense. When the Company deems all or a portion of a loan to be uncollectible, the appropriate amount is written off and the ACL is reduced by the same amount. The Company applies judgment to determine when a loan is deemed uncollectible; however, generally speaking, a loan will be considered uncollectible no later than when all efforts at collection have been exhausted. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the ACL when received.\n\nThe Company measures expected credit losses of loans on a collective (pool) basis when the loans share similar risk characteristics and uses a cash flow-based method to estimate expected credit losses for each of these pools. The Company's methodology for estimating the ACL considers available relevant information about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The methodologies apply historical loss information, adjusted for asset-specific characteristics, economic conditions at the measurement date, and forecasts about future economic conditions expected to exist through the contractual lives of the financial assets that are reasonable and supportable, to the identified pools of financial assets with similar risk characteristics for which the historical experience was observed. In addition to the historical loss information, the Company utilizes qualitative factors to adjust the ACL as appropriate. Qualitative factors are based on management’s judgment of the changes in underlying loan composition of specific portfolios, trends relating to credit quality and collateral values, company-specific data, or effects of other factors such as market competition or legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Company uses a cash flow-based model to estimate expected credit losses for all loan segments. For each of the loan segments, the Company calculates a cash flow projection using contractual terms, estimated prepayment speeds, estimated curtailment rates, and other relevant data. The Company uses regression analysis that links historical losses of the Company and a peer group to two economic metrics: national unemployment rate and 10-year treasury rate over 2-year treasury rate spread to establish the loss rates applied to the projected cash flows. For all loan segments, the Company uses a forecast period of four quarters and reverts to a historical rate after four quarters. When estimating prepayment speed and curtailment rates, the modeling is based on historical internal data. \n\n74\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nNonaccrual Loans and Delinquency Status\n\nDelinquencies are determined based on the payment terms of the individual loan agreements. The accrual of interest on past due and other individually evaluated loans is generally discontinued at 90 days past due or when, in the opinion of management, the borrower may be unable to make all payments pursuant to contractual terms. Unless considered collectible, all interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged off is reversed against interest income. Generally, all payments received while a loan is on nonaccrual status are applied to the principal balance of the loan. Loans are returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. \n\nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis of loans on nonaccrual status, loans on nonaccrual status with no allowance for credit losses recorded, and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing by loan segment.\n\nTotal Nonaccrual| Nonaccrual with no Allowance for Credit Losses| 90 Days or More Past Due and Accruing  \n---|---|---  \nDecember 31, 2023| December 31, 2022| December 31, 2023| December 31, 2022| December 31, 2023| December 31, 2022  \nCommercial| $| —| $| — | $| —| $| — | $| —| $| —   \nReal estate:  \nConstruction, land and land  \ndevelopment| —| — | —| — | —| —   \n1-4 family residential first  \nmortgages| 296| 322 | 296| 322 | —| —   \nHome equity| —| — | —| — | —| —   \nCommercial| —| — | —| — | —| —   \nConsumer and other| —| — | —| — | —| —   \nTotal| $| 296| $| 322 | $| 296| $| 322 | $| —| $| —   \n  \nThere was no interest income recognized on loans that were on nonaccrual for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nInterest income forgone on nonaccrual loans was $15, $144 and $534, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. \n\n75\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nThe following tables provide an analysis of the delinquency status of the amortized cost of loans as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. \n\nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \n30-59Days PastDue| 60-89 Days Past Due| 90 Days or More Past Due| TotalPast Due| Current| Total Loans  \nCommercial| $| —| $| —| $| —| $| —| $| 531,594| $| 531,594  \nReal estate:  \nConstruction, land and  \nland development| —| —| —| —| 413,477| 413,477  \n1-4 family residential  \nfirst mortgages| —| —| —| —| 106,688| 106,688  \nHome equity| —| —| —| —| 14,618| 14,618  \nCommercial| —| —| —| —| 1,854,510| 1,854,510  \nConsumer and other| —| —| —| —| 10,930| 10,930  \nTotal| $| —| $| —| $| —| $| —| $| 2,931,817| $| 2,931,817  \n  \nDecember 31, 2022  \n---  \n30-59Days PastDue| 60-89 Days Past Due| 90 Days or More Past Due| TotalPast Due| Current| Total Loans  \nCommercial| $| — | $| — | $| — | $| — | $| 519,196 | $| 519,196   \nReal estate:  \nConstruction, land and  \nland development| — | — | — | — | 363,014 | 363,014   \n1-4 family residential  \nfirst mortgages| — | — | — | — | 75,211 | 75,211   \nHome equity| — | — | — | — | 10,322 | 10,322   \nCommercial| — | — | — | — | 1,771,940 | 1,771,940   \nConsumer and other| — | — | — | — | 7,292 | 7,292   \nTotal| $| — | $| — | $| — | $| — | $| 2,746,975 | $| 2,746,975   \n  \nLoan Restructurings Made to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no loan restructurings made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.

These loans involve the anticipated potential for payment defaults or collateral inadequacies. A loan on the Watch List is analyzed individually to categorize the loan to the appropriate credit risk category. \n\nAll loans are subject to the assessment of a credit quality indicator. Risk ratings are assigned for each loan at the time of approval, and they change as circumstances dictate during the term of the loan. The Company utilizes a 9-point risk rating scale as shown below, with ratings 1 - 5 included in the Pass column, rating 6 included in the Watch column, ratings 7 - 8 included in the Substandard column and rating 9 included in the Doubtful column. \n\nRisk rating 1: The loan is secured by cash equivalent collateral. \n\nRisk rating 2: The loan is secured by properly margined marketable securities, bonds or cash surrender value of life insurance.\n\nRisk rating 3: The borrower is in strong financial condition and has strong debt service capacity. The loan is performing as agreed, and the financial characteristics and trends of the borrower exceed industry statistics.\n\nRisk rating 4: The borrower’s financial condition is satisfactory and stable. The borrower has satisfactory debt service capacity, and the loan is well secured. The loan is performing as agreed, and the financial characteristics and trends fall in line with industry statistics.\n\nRisk rating 5: The borrower's financial condition is less than satisfactory. The loan is still generally paying as agreed, but strained cash flows may cause some slowness in payments. The collateral values adequately preclude loss on the loan. Financial characteristics and trends lag industry statistics. There may be noncompliance with loan covenants.\n\nRisk rating 6: The borrower's financial condition is deficient. Payment delinquencies may be more common. Collateral values still protect from loss, but margins are narrow. The loan may be reliant on secondary sources of repayment, including liquidation of collateral and guarantor support.\n\nRisk rating 7: The loan is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Well-defined weaknesses exist that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. The Company is inadequately protected by the valuation or paying capacity of the collateral pledged. If deficiencies are not corrected, there is a distinct possibility that a loss will be sustained.\n\nRisk rating 8: All the characteristics of rating 7 exist with the added condition that the loan is past due more than 90 days or there is reason to believe the Company will not receive its principal and interest according to the terms of the loan agreement.\n\nRisk rating 9: All the weaknesses inherent in risk ratings 7 and 8 exist with the added condition that collection or liquidation, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions and values, is highly questionable and improbable. A loan reaching this category would most likely be charged off.\n\nCredit quality indicators for all loans and the Company's risk rating process are dynamic and updated on a continuous basis. Risk ratings are updated as circumstances that could affect the repayment of an individual loan are brought to management's attention through an established monitoring process. Individual bankers initiate changes as appropriate for ratings 1 through 5, and changes for ratings 6 through 9 are initiated by management. The likelihood of loss increases as the risk rating increases and is generally preceded by a loan appearing on the Watch List, which consists of all loans with a risk rating of 6 or worse. Written action plans with firm target dates for resolution of identified problems are maintained and reviewed on a quarterly basis for all segments of loans included on the Watch List. \n\n77\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nIn addition to the Company’s internal credit monitoring practices and procedures, an outsourced independent credit review function is in place to further assess assigned internal risk classifications and monitor compliance with internal lending policies and procedures. \n\nIn all portfolio segments, the primary risks are that a borrower's income stream diminishes to the point that the borrower is not able to make scheduled principal and interest payments and any collateral securing the loan declines in value. The risk of declining collateral values is present for most types of loans.\n\nCommercial loans consist primarily of loans to businesses for various purposes, including revolving lines to finance current operations, inventory and accounts receivable, and capital expenditure loans to finance equipment and other fixed assets. These loans generally have short maturities, have either adjustable or fixed interest rates, and are either unsecured or secured by inventory, accounts receivable and/or fixed assets. For commercial loans, the primary source of repayment is from the operation of the business. \n\nReal estate loans include various types of loans for which the Company holds real property as collateral, and consist of loans on commercial properties and single and multifamily residences. Real estate loans are typically structured to mature or reprice every five to ten years with payments based on amortization periods up to 30 years. The majority of construction loans are to contractors and developers for construction of commercial buildings or residential real estate. These loans typically have maturities of up to 24 months. The Company's loan policy includes minimum appraisal and other credit guidelines.\n\nConsumer loans include loans extended to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures not secured by real estate. The majority of the Company's consumer lending is for vehicles, consolidation of personal debts and household improvements. The repayment source for consumer loans, including 1-4 family residential and home equity loans, is typically wages. \n\n78\n\n[Table of

data)\n\nCollateral Dependent Loans\n\nLoans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. For collateral dependent loans where the Company has determined that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company expects repayment of the loans to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the ACL is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. When repayment is expected to be from the operation of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the present value of expected cash flows from the operation of collateral. When repayment is expected to be from the sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated cost to sell. The ACL may be zero if the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date exceeds the amortized cost basis of the loan. \n\nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis of collateral dependent loans, by primary collateral type, which are individually evaluated to determine expected credit losses, and the related ACL allocated to these loans.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023  \n---  \nPrimary Type of Collateral  \nReal Estate| Equipment| Other | Total| ACL Allocation  \n1-4 family residential first mortgages| $| 296| $| —| $| —| $| 296| $| —  \nTotal| $| 296| $| —| $| —| $| 296| $| —  \n  \n81\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nImpaired Loans\n\nThe following table summarizes the recorded investment in impaired loans by segment, broken down by loans with no related allowance and loans with a related allowance and the amount of that allowance as of December 31, 2022, prior to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2023.\n\nDecember 31, 2022  \n---  \nRecordedInvestment| UnpaidPrincipalBalance| RelatedAllowance  \nWith no related allowance recorded:  \nCommercial| $| — | $| — | $| —   \nReal estate:  \nConstruction, land and land development| — | — | —   \n1-4 family residential first mortgages| 322 | 322 | —   \nHome equity| — | — | —   \nCommercial| — | — | —   \nConsumer and other| — | — | —   \n322 | 322 | —   \nWith an allowance recorded:  \nCommercial| — | — | —   \nReal estate:  \nConstruction, land and land development| — | — | —   \n1-4 family residential first mortgages| — | — | —   \nHome equity| — | — | —   \nCommercial| — | — | —   \nConsumer and other| — | — | —   \n— | — | —   \nTotal:  \nCommercial| — | — | —   \nReal estate:  \nConstruction, land and land development| — | — | —   \n1-4 family residential first mortgages| 322 | 322 | —   \nHome equity| — | — | —   \nCommercial| — | — | —   \nConsumer and other| — | — | —   \nTotal impaired loans| $| 322 | $| 322 | $| —   \n  \n82\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nThe following table summarizes the average recorded investment and interest income recognized on impaired loans by segment for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\nDecember 31, 2022| December 31, 2021  \n---|---  \nAverage Recorded Investment| Interest Income Recognized| Average Recorded Investment| Interest Income Recognized  \nWith no related allowance recorded:  \nCommercial| $| — | $| — | $| — | $| —   \nReal estate:  \nConstruction, land and land development| — | — | — | —   \n1-4 family residential first mortgages| 336 | — | 363 | —   \nHome equity| — | — | — | —   \nCommercial| — | — | — | —   \nConsumer and other| — | — | — | —   \n336 | — | 363 | —   \nWith an allowance recorded:  \nCommercial| — | — | — | —   \nReal estate:  \nConstruction, land and land development| — | — | — | —   \n1-4 family residential first mortgages| — | — | — | —   \nHome equity| — | — | — | —   \nCommercial| 3,915 | — | 13,002 | —   \nConsumer and other| — | — | — | —   \n3,915 | — | 13,002 | —   \nTotal:  \nCommercial| — | — | — | —   \nReal estate:  \nConstruction, land and land development| — | — | — | —   \n1-4 family residential first mortgages| 336 | — | 363 | —   \nHome equity| — | — | — | —   \nCommercial| 3,915 | — | 13,002 | —   \nConsumer and other| — | — | — | —   \nTotal impaired loans| $| 4,251 | $| — | $| 13,365 | $| —   \n  \nAllowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures\n\nThe Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life using the same models for the Company’s other loan portfolio segments described above. The Company's allowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments was $2,544 as of December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures is presented in the “Accrued expenses and other liabilities” line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the allowance for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures is reflected in the “Credit loss expense” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a credit loss expense of $200 associated with off-balance sheet credit exposures. \n\n83\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nNote 5.

Operating Leases\n\nThe Company leases real estate for its main office, five branch offices and office space for operations departments under various operating lease agreements. The lease agreements have maturity dates ranging from April 2024 to February 2033, some of which include options to renew at the Company's discretion. If at lease inception, the Company considers the exercising of a renewal option to be reasonably certain, the Company will include the extended term in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. The weighted average remaining lives of the lease terms used in the measurement of the operating lease liability were 6.7 years and 6.5 years as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \n\nThe discount rate used in determining the lease liability for each individual lease was the FHLB fixed advance rate which corresponded with the remaining lease term as of January 1, 2019 for leases that existed at adoption of this accounting standard and as of the lease commencement date for leases entered into subsequent to January 1, 2019. The weighted average discount rates used in the measurement of the operating lease liabilities were 3.42 percent and 3.32 percent as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets are included in premises and equipment. Operating lease liabilities of $3,402 and $4,681 were included in other liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Rent expense related to these leases was $1,510, $1,395 and $1,958, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nTotal estimated rental commitments for the operating leases were as follows as of December 31, 2023.\n\n2024| $| 857   \n---|---|---  \n2025| 588   \n2026| 503   \n2027| 347   \n2028| 356   \nThereafter| 1,178   \nTotal lease payments| 3,829   \nLess: present value discount| (427)  \nPresent value of lease liabilities| $| 3,402  \n  \n84\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nNote 7.

Subordinated Notes\n\nIn July 2003, the Company issued $20,619 in junior subordinated debentures to the Company’s subsidiary trust, West Bancorporation Capital Trust I. The junior subordinated debentures are senior to the Company’s common stock. As a result, the Company must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) before any dividends can be paid on its common stock, and, in the event of the Company’s bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the debentures must be satisfied before any distribution can be made to the holders of the common stock. The Company has the right to defer distributions on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of the Company’s common stock. The junior subordinated debentures have a 30-year term, do not require any principal amortization, and are callable at the issuer’s option. The interest rate is a variable rate based on the 3-month term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 0.26161 percent tenor spread adjustment plus 3.05 percent. At December 31, 2023, the interest rate was 8.64 percent. Interest is payable quarterly, unless deferred. The Company has never deferred an interest payment. The effective cost of the junior subordinated debentures at December 31, 2023, including amortization of issuance costs, was 8.71 percent. Holders of the trust preferred securities associated with the junior subordinated debentures have no voting rights, are unsecured, and rank junior in priority to all the Company’s indebtedness and senior to the Company’s common stock. The junior subordinated debentures were reported net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $127 and $141 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company has an interest rate swap contract that effectively converts $20,000 of the variable-rate junior subordinated debentures to a fixed rate of 4.81 percent. See Note 11 for additional information on the interest rate swap. In addition, the junior subordinated debentures qualify as additional Tier 1 capital of the Company for regulatory purposes. \n\nIn June 2022, the Company issued $60,000 of subordinated notes (the Notes). The Notes initially bear interest at 5.25 percent per annum, with interest payable semi-annually for the first five years of the Notes. Beginning in June 2027, the interest rate will be reset quarterly to a floating rate per annum that is expected to be three-month term SOFR plus 2.41 percent with payments due quarterly. The Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, on or after June 15, 2027 at a price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Notes will mature on June 15, 2032 if they are not earlier redeemed. Proceeds from this debt issuance were used to make a $58,650 capital injection into the Company’s subsidiary, West Bank. The Notes were reported net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $860 and $1,109 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \n\n85\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nNote 9. Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and Other Borrowings\n\nThe Company had fixed-rate FHLB advances totaling $315,000 and $155,000 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Advances with a total of $295,000 have maturities of one month and are part of a rolling funding program associated with long-term interest rate swaps related to the interest cash flows of the rolling advances. The Company also had one FHLB advance totaling $20,000 with a maturity date of November 2024 as of December 31, 2023. The weighted average contractual rates on FHLB advances were 5.54 percent and 4.47 percent as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The weighted average effective rate for these advances, which includes adjustments for the interest rate swaps, when applicable, were 3.44 percent and 2.32 percent as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 11 for additional information on interest rate swaps hedging FHLB advances.\n\nThe Company had overnight and other short-term borrowings, including FHLB advances totaling $150,270 and $200,000 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are included in federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings.\n\nThe FHLB advances are collateralized by FHLB stock and real estate loans, as required by the FHLB’s collateral policy. West Bank had additional borrowing capacity of approximately $528,000 at the FHLB as of December 31, 2023.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, West Bank had arrangements that would allow it to borrow $35,000 in unsecured federal funds lines of credit at correspondent banks that are available under the correspondent banks’ normal terms. The lines have no stated expiration dates. As of December 31, 2023, there were no amounts outstanding under these arrangements. At December 31, 2023, West Bank also had approximately $2,282 of securities pledged for available borrowings at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. There were no balances outstanding at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window at December 31, 2023. West Bank had borrowing capacity of approximately $89,000 through the BTFP. The BTFP was established by the Federal Reserve in March 2023 to provide an additional source of liquidity against high-quality securities. As of December 31, 2023, West Bank had pledged approximately $89,000 in eligible securities to facilitate participation in the program and no funds were borrowed from the BTFP. The Federal Reserve has announced that it is ending the BTFP and will cease making new loans under this program on March 11, 2024.\n\nNote 10. Long-Term Debt\n\nIn December 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a commercial bank and borrowed $40,000. The borrowing was used to make a capital injection into the Company’s subsidiary, West Bank. Interest under the term note is payable quarterly over five years. Required quarterly principal payments of $1,250 began in May 2023, with the remaining balance due February 2027. The Company may make additional principal payments without penalty. The interest rate is variable at the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate minus 1.00 percent, which totaled 7.50 percent as of December 31, 2023. The Company has an interest rate swap contract that effectively converts $20,000 of the borrowings to a fixed rate of 6.40 percent. See Note 11 for additional information on the interest rate swap. In the event of default, the unaffiliated commercial bank may accelerate payment of the loan. The outstanding balance was $36,250 and $40,000 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The note is secured by 100 percent of West Bank’s stock. \n\nWest Bank’s special purpose subsidiary has a credit agreement for $11,486. Interest is payable monthly over the term of the agreement with an interest rate of one percent. Monthly principal payments begin in January 2026 and the agreement matures in December 2048. The outstanding balance was $11,486 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nFuture required principal payments for long-term debt as of December 31, 2023 are shown in the table below.\n\n2024| $| 5,000   \n---|---|---  \n2025| 5,000   \n2026| 5,446   \n2027| 21,701   \n2028| 455   \nThereafter| 10,134   \n$| 47,736   \n  \n86\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nNote 11. Derivatives\n\nThe Company has entered into various interest rate swap agreements as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk exposure on certain loans, borrowings, and deposits due to interest rate movements. The notional amounts of the interest rate swaps do not represent amounts exchanged by the counterparties, but rather, the notional amount is used to determine, along with other terms of the derivative, the amounts to be exchanged between the counterparties.\n\nInterest Rate Swaps Designated as a Cash Flow Hedge: The Company had interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges with total notional amounts of $445,000 and $310,000 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had swaps with a total notional amount of $295,000 that hedge the interest payments of rolling fixed-rate one-month funding consisting of FHLB advances or brokered deposits. Also, as of December 31, 2023, the Company had swaps with a total notional amount of $40,000 that effectively converts variable-rate long-term debt to fixed-rate debt and swaps with a total notional amount of $110,000 that hedge the interest payments of certain deposit accounts. In March 2021, the Company terminated interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $50,000. In the second quarter of 2021, the Company repaid $50,000 of FHLB advances related to these terminated swaps as a result of excess liquidity and in response to market conditions. Pre-tax losses of $3,600 were reclassified from AOCI and recorded in noninterest income at termination. \n\nAt the inception of each hedge transaction, the Company represented that the underlying principal balance would remain outstanding throughout the hedge transaction, making it probable that sufficient interest payments would exist through the maturity date of the swaps. The cash flow hedges were determined to be fully effective during the remaining terms of the swaps. Therefore, the aggregate fair value of the swaps is recorded in other assets or other liabilities with changes in market value recorded in OCI, net of deferred taxes. See Note 18 for additional fair value information and disclosures. The amounts included in AOCI will be reclassified to interest expense should the hedge no longer be considered effective. \n\nDerivatives Not Designated as Accounting Hedges: To accommodate customer needs, the Company on occasion offers loan level interest rate swaps to its customers and offsets its exposure from such contracts by entering into mirror image swaps with a swap counterparty (back-to-back swap program). The interest rate swaps are free-standing derivatives and are recorded at fair value. The Company enters into a floating-rate loan and a fixed-rate swap with our customer. Simultaneously, the Company enters into an offsetting fixed-rate swap with a swap counterparty. In connection with each swap transaction, the Company agrees to pay interest to the customer on a notional amount at a variable interest rate and receive interest from the customer on the same notional amount at a fixed interest rate. At the same time, the Company agrees to pay a swap counterparty the same fixed interest rate on the same notional amount and receive the same variable interest rate on the same notional amount. These transactions allow the Company’s customers to effectively convert variable-rate loans to fixed-rate loans. The customer accommodations and any offsetting swaps are treated as non-hedging derivative instruments, which do not qualify for hedge accounting.\n\nThe Company entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $100,000 in January 2021 that were not accounting hedges. These swaps were terminated in March 2021, and the resulting gains of $3,781 were recorded in noninterest income.\n\n87\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nThe table below identifies the balance sheet category and fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nDecember 31, 2023| December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \nCash Flow Hedges:  \nGross notional amount| $| 445,000| $| 310,000   \nFair value in other assets| 11,313| 16,284   \nFair value in other liabilities| (988)| —   \nWeighted-average floating rate received| 5.64| %| 4.53 | %  \nWeighted-average fixed rate paid| 3.04| %| 2.25 | %  \nWeighted-average maturity in years| 2.6| 3.3  \nNon-Hedging Derivatives:  \nGross notional amount| $| 293,400| $| 254,369   \nFair value in other assets| 14,114| 15,309   \nFair value in other liabilities| (14,114)| (15,309)  \n  \nThe following table identifies the pre-tax gains or losses recognized on the Company’s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n2023| 2022| 2021  \n---|---|---  \nPre-tax gain recognized in other comprehensive income| $| 4,291| $| 23,595 | $| 8,047   \nReclassification from AOCI into income:  \nIncrease (decrease) in interest expense| $| (10,249)| $| 206 | $| 4,684   \nDecrease in noninterest income, swap termination fees| —| — | 3,600   \n  \nThe Company estimates there will be approximately $11,566 reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to reduce interest expense through December 31, 2024 related to cash flow hedges. The Company will continue to assess the effectiveness of hedges on a quarterly basis. \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by interest rate swap counterparties, which is minimized by collateral-pledging provisions in the agreements. Derivative contracts with swap counterparties are executed with a Credit Support Annex, which is a bilateral ratings-sensitive agreement that requires collateral postings at established credit threshold levels. These agreements protect the interests of the Company and its counterparties should either party suffer a credit rating deterioration. As of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company pledged $0 of collateral to the counterparties in the form of cash on deposit. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s counterparties pledged $22,340 and $31,560, respectively, of collateral to the Company in the form of cash on deposit. The interest rate swap product with the borrowers is cross-collateralized with the underlying loan and therefore there is no pledged cash collateral under swap contracts with customers. \n\n88\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nNote 12.

This legislation reduces the Iowa bank franchise tax rate applied to apportioned income for 2023 and future years. This future reduction in the state tax rate required the Company to reduce net deferred tax assets by $671 and in turn caused a one-time increase in 2022 tax expense. The effective tax rate for 2022 was 21.9 percent. Excluding this one-time state tax expense, the effective tax rate for 2022 would have been 20.8 percent. \n\n89\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nNet deferred tax assets consisted of the following components as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n2023| 2022  \n---|---  \nDeferred tax assets:  \nAllowance for credit losses| $| 7,598| $| 6,241   \nNet unrealized losses on securities available for sale| 30,081| 34,544   \nLease liabilities| 837| 1,147   \nAccrued expenses| 196| 434   \nRestricted stock unit compensation| 1,185| 1,038   \nState net operating loss carryforward| 1,763| 1,476   \nOther| 177| 156   \n41,837| 45,036   \nDeferred tax liabilities:  \nRight-of-use assets| 795| 1,099   \nDeferred loan costs| 258| 249   \nNet unrealized gains on interest rate swaps| 2,547| 4,003   \nPremises and equipment| 1,657| 1,219   \nNew markets tax credit loan| 389| 303   \nOther| 125| 78   \n5,771| 6,951   \nNet deferred tax assets before valuation allowance| 36,066| 38,085   \nValuation allowance for deferred tax assets| (1,763)| (1,476)  \nNet deferred tax assets| $| 34,303| $| 36,609   \n  \nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $44,073 of Iowa net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future Iowa taxable income. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against the tax effect of the Iowa net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes it is more likely than not that such carryforwards will expire without being utilized. Iowa net operating loss carryforwards of $723 expired in 2023 and the remainder will expire thereafter. \n\nNote 13. Stock Compensation Plans\n\nThe West Bancorporation, Inc. 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2021 Plan) was approved by the stockholders in April 2021. The 2021 Plan replaced the West Bancorporation, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan). Upon approval of the 2021 Plan, the 2017 Plan was frozen and no new grants will be made under that plan. Outstanding awards under the 2017 Plan will continue pursuant to their terms and provisions. The 2021 and 2017 Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which determines the specific individuals who will be granted awards under the 2021 Plan and the type and amount of any such awards. All employees and directors of the Company and its subsidiary are eligible to become participants in the 2021 Plan. Under the terms of the 2021 Plan, the Company may grant a total of 625,000 shares of the Company’s common stock as nonqualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights and stock awards. As of December 31, 2023, 266,963 shares of the Company’s common stock remained available for future awards under the 2021 Plan. \n\n90\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nUnder the 2021 Plan, the Company may grant RSU awards, as determined by the Compensation Committee, that vest upon the completion of future service requirements or specified performance criteria. All RSUs granted through December 31, 2023 under the 2021 and 2017 Plans were at no cost to the participants, and the participants will not be entitled to receive or accrue dividends until the RSUs have vested. Each RSU entitles the participant to receive one share of common stock on the vesting date or upon the participant’s termination due to death or disability, or upon a change in control of the Company if the RSUs are not fully assumed or if the RSUs are assumed and the participant’s employment is thereafter terminated by the Company without cause or by the participant for good reason. If a participant terminates employment prior to the end of the continuous service period other than due to death, disability or retirement, the award is forfeited. If a participant terminates service due to retirement, the RSUs will continue to vest, subject to provisions of the 2021 and 2017 Plans. RSUs granted to employees prior to 2021 vest 20 percent per year over a five year period, and RSUs granted to directors vest after one year. Beginning in 2021, the Company has granted time-based and performance-based RSU awards. The time-based RSU awards granted to employees vest 20 percent per year over a five year period and have a one to three year post-vesting holding period, applicable to 50 percent of the shares. The time-based RSU awards granted to directors vest after one year and have a one to three year post-vesting holding period, applicable to 50 percent of the shares. The performance based RSU awards granted to employees cliff vest at the end of a three year performance period based upon the Company meeting certain performance metrics and have a one to three year post-vesting holding period applicable to 50 percent of the shares.\n\nThe following table includes a summary of nonvested RSU activity for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n2023| 2022| 2021  \n---|---|---  \nWeighted| Weighted| Weighted  \nAverage| Average| Average  \nGrant Date| Grant Date| Grant Date  \nFair Value| Fair Value| Fair Value  \n(actual amounts, not in thousands)| Shares| Per Share| Shares| Per Share| Shares| Per Share  \nNonvested shares, beginning balance| 438,237| $| 20.87| 408,800 | $| 20.07 | 390,265 | $| 19.35   \nGranted| 175,680| 16.79| 169,357 | 23.26 | 156,000 | 21.61   \nVested| (134,437)| 20.96| (139,920)| 21.38 | (135,965)| 19.65   \nForfeited| —| —| — | — | (1,500)| 31.37   \nNonvested shares, ending balance| 479,480| $| 19.33| 438,237 | $| 20.87 | 408,800 | $| 20.07   \n  \nThe fair value of RSU awards that vested during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $2,509, $3,889 and $3,280, respectively. Total compensation costs, including director compensation, recorded for the RSUs were $3,111, $3,357 and $2,573 for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The tax expense related to vesting of RSUs totaled $5 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The tax benefit related to vesting of RSUs totaled $385 and $233 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, there was $3,882 of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RSUs, and the weighted average period over which these remaining costs are expected to be recognized was approximately 1.2 years.\n\nNote 14. 401(k) Retirement Plan\n\nThe Company has a defined contribution plan covering substantially all of its employees. Matching and discretionary contributions are determined annually by the Board. The Company matched 100 percent of the first six percent of employee deferrals and made an annual discretionary contribution of two percent of eligible employee compensation for the year ended December 31, 2023, and four percent of eligible employee compensation for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Total matching and discretionary contribution expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, totaled $1,207, $1,395 and $1,319, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the plan held 324,569 and 329,712 shares, respectively, of the Company’s common stock. These shares are included in the computation of earnings per share. Dividends on shares held in the plan may be reinvested in Company common stock or paid in cash to the participants, at the election of the participants.\n\n91\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nNote 15.

Regulatory Capital Requirements\n\nThe Company and West Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements (as shown in the following table) can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators which, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and West Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory requirements. The Company’s and West Bank’s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Management believed the Company and West Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject as of December 31, 2023.\n\n92\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nThe Company’s and West Bank’s capital ratios are presented in the following table as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. \n\nActual| For Capital Adequacy Purposes| For CapitalAdequacy Purposes With Capital Conservation Buffer| To Be Well-Capitalized  \n---|---|---|---  \nAmount| Ratio| Amount| Ratio| Amount| Ratio| Amount| Ratio  \nAs of December 31, 2023:  \nTotal Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)  \nConsolidated| $| 419,452| 11.88| %| $| 282,508| 8.00| %| $| 370,791| 10.50| %| $| 353,135| 10.00| %  \nWest Bank| 450,444| 12.76| %| 282,307| 8.00| %| 370,527| 10.50| %| 352,883| 10.00| %  \nTier 1 Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)  \nConsolidated| 328,566| 9.30| %| 211,881| 6.00| %| 300,164| 8.50| %| 282,508| 8.00| %  \nWest Bank| 419,558| 11.89| %| 211,730| 6.00| %| 299,951| 8.50| %| 282,307| 8.00| %  \nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)  \nConsolidated| 308,566| 8.74| %| 158,911| 4.50| %| 247,194| 7.00| %| 229,537| 6.50| %  \nWest Bank| 419,558| 11.89| %| 158,797| 4.50| %| 247,018| 7.00| %| 229,374| 6.50| %  \nTier 1 Capital (to Average Assets)  \nConsolidated| 328,566| 8.50| %| 154,628| 4.00| %| 154,628| 4.00| %| 193,285| 5.00| %  \nWest Bank| 419,558| 10.86| %| 154,571| 4.00| %| 154,571| 4.00| %| 193,213| 5.00| %  \nAs of December 31, 2022:  \nTotal Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)  \nConsolidated| $| 408,056 | 12.08 | %| $| 270,221 | 8.00 | %| $| 354,665 | 10.50 | %| $| 337,776 | 10.00 | %  \nWest Bank| 441,628 | 13.08 | %| 270,053 | 8.00 | %| 354,445 | 10.50 | %| 337,566 | 10.00 | %  \nTier 1 Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)  \nConsolidated| 322,583 | 9.55 | %| 202,666 | 6.00 | %| 287,110 | 8.50 | %| 270,221 | 8.00 | %  \nWest Bank| 416,155 | 12.33 | %| 202,540 | 6.00 | %| 286,930 | 8.50 | %| 270,053 | 8.00 | %  \nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)  \nConsolidated| 302,583 | 8.96 | %| 151,999 | 4.50 | %| 236,443 | 7.00 | %| 219,555 | 6.50 | %  \nWest Bank| 416,155 | 12.33 | %| 151,905 | 4.50 | %| 236,296 | 7.00 | %| 219,418 | 6.50 | %  \nTier 1 Capital (to Average Assets)  \nConsolidated| 322,583 | 8.81 | %| 146,439 | 4.00 | %| 146,439 | 4.00 | %| 183,049 | 5.00 | %  \nWest Bank| 416,155 | 11.37 | %| 146,367 | 4.00 | %| 146,367 | 4.00 | %| 182,958 | 5.00 | %  \n  \nThe Company and West Bank are subject to the rules of the Basel III regulatory capital framework and related Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The rules include the implementation of a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer that is added to the minimum requirements for capital adequacy purposes. A banking organization with a conservation buffer of less than the required amount will be subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. At December 31, 2023, the capital ratios for the Company and West Bank were sufficient to meet the capital conservation buffer.\n\nThe ability of the Company to pay dividends to its stockholders is dependent upon dividends paid by its subsidiary, West Bank. There are currently no additional restrictions on such dividends other than the general restrictions imposed on all Iowa state-chartered banks by applicable law.\n\n93\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nThe Company’s tangible common equity ratio was 5.88 percent and 5.84 percent at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The tangible common equity ratio is computed by dividing total equity less preferred stock and intangible assets by total assets less intangible assets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no intangible assets or preferred stock. \n\nNote 17. Commitments and Contingencies\n\nFinancial instruments with off-balance sheet risk: The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations that it uses for on-balance sheet instruments. Commitments to lend are subject to borrowers’ continuing compliance with existing credit agreements. The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13 effective January 1, 2023 which requires an allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposure. See Note 4 for additional information. The Company’s commitments consisted of the following amounts as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n2023| 2022  \n---|---  \nCommitments to fund real estate construction loans| $| 385,846| $| 336,900   \nOther commitments to extend credit| 641,554| 727,666   \nStandby letters of credit| 15,972| 20,557   \n$| 1,043,372| $| 1,085,123   \n  \nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract and generally expire within one year. Commitments to extend credit of approximately $174,298 at December 31, 2023, had terms expiring beyond one year. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained is based on management’s credit evaluation of the party. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, and residential and commercial real estate.\n\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party and generally expire within one year. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Collateral held varies as specified above and is required in instances the Company deems necessary. In the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the third-party agreement, West Bank would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments West Bank could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount for letters of credit shown in the table above. If the commitment is funded, West Bank would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, no amounts have been recorded as liabilities for West Bank’s potential obligations under these guarantees.\n\nWest Bank previously executed MPF Master Commitments (Commitments) with the FHLB of Des Moines to deliver residential mortgage loans and to guarantee the payment of any realized losses that exceed the FHLB’s first loss account for mortgages delivered under the Commitments. West Bank receives credit enhancement fees from the FHLB for providing this guarantee and continuing to assist with managing the credit risk of the MPF Program residential mortgage loans. The term of the most recent Commitment was through January 16, 2015 and was not renewed. The outstanding balance of mortgage loans sold under the MPF Program was $20,159 and $23,337 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \n\nThe Company had commitments to invest in qualified affordable housing projects totaling $1,649 and $3,431 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \n\nWest Bank entered into a construction contract for the construction of a new headquarters building in West Des Moines, Iowa in 2022. West Bank will pay the contractor a contract price consisting of the cost of work plus a fee, with anticipated construction completed in 2024. As of December 31, 2023, there was a remaining commitment of $13,019 under this contract. \n\n94\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nConcentrations of credit risk: Substantially all of the Company’s loans, commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit have been granted to customers in the Company’s market areas. The concentrations of credit by type of loan are set forth in Note 4. The distribution by type of loan of commitments to extend credit approximates the distribution by type of loan of loans outstanding. Standby letters of credit were granted primarily to commercial borrowers. \n\nContingencies: Neither the Company nor West Bank is a party, and no property of these entities is subject, to any material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to West Bank’s business. The Company does not know of any proceeding contemplated by a governmental authority against the Company or West Bank. \n\nNote 18. Fair Value Measurements\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts business. The Company’s balance sheet contains securities available for sale and derivative instruments that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value is as follows:\n\nLevel 1 uses quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 uses observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\n\nLevel 3 uses unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.\n\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize transfers between levels at the end of each reporting period, if applicable. There were no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy during 2023 or 2022.\n\nThe following is a description of valuation methodologies used for financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.\n\nSecurities available for sale: When available, quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of securities (Level 1). If quoted market prices are not available, the Company determines fair value based on various sources and may apply matrix pricing with observable prices for similar bonds where a price for the identical bond is not observable (Level 2). The fair values of these securities are determined by pricing models that consider observable market data such as interest rate volatilities, yield curves, credit spreads, prices from market makers and live trading systems. \n\nManagement obtains the fair value of securities at the end of each reporting period via a third-party pricing service. Management reviewed the valuation process used by the third party and believed the process was valid as of December 31, 2023. On a quarterly basis, management corroborates the fair values of the portfolio by obtaining pricing from an independent financial market data provider and compares the two sets of fair values. Any significant variances are reviewed and investigated. For a sample of securities, the fair values are further validated by management, by obtaining details of the inputs used by the pricing service. Those inputs were independently tested, and management concluded the fair values were consistent with GAAP requirements and the securities were properly classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nDerivative instruments: The Company’s derivative instruments consist of interest rate swaps accounted for as cash flow hedges, as well as interest rate swaps which are accounted for as non-hedging derivatives. The Company’s derivative positions are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and are valued using models generally accepted in the financial services industry and that use actively quoted or observable market input values from external market data providers and/or nonbinding broker-dealer quotations. The fair value of the derivatives are determined using discounted cash flow models. These models’ key assumptions include the contractual terms of the respective contract along with significant observable inputs, including interest rates, yield curves, nonperformance risk and volatility. \n\n95\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nThe following tables present the balances of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n2023  \n---  \nDescription| Total| Level 1| Level 2| Level 3  \nFinancial assets:  \nSecurities available for sale:  \nState and political subdivisions| $| 193,005| $| —| $| 193,005| $| —  \nCollateralized mortgage obligations| 249,933| —| 249,933| —  \nMortgage-backed securities| 131,838| —| 131,838| —  \nCollateralized loan obligations| 37,536| —| 37,536| —  \nCorporate notes| 11,607| —| 11,607| —  \nDerivative instrument, interest rate swaps| 25,427| —| 25,427| —  \nFinancial liabilities:  \nDerivative instrument, interest rate swaps| $| 15,102| $| —| $| 15,102| $| —  \n  \n2022  \n---  \nDescription| Total| Level 1| Level 2| Level 3  \nFinancial assets:  \nSecurities available for sale:  \nState and political subdivisions| $| 193,355 | $| — | $| 193,355 | $| —   \nCollateralized mortgage obligations| 281,628 | — | 281,628 | —   \nMortgage-backed securities| 140,280 | — | 140,280 | —   \nCollateralized loan obligations| 36,811 | — | 36,811 | —   \nCorporate notes| 12,041 | — | 12,041 | —   \nDerivative instrument, interest rate swaps| 31,593 | — | 31,593 | —   \nFinancial liabilities:  \nDerivative instrument, interest rate swaps| $| 15,309 | $| — | $| 15,309 | $| —   \n  \nCertain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. That is, they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). As of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no individually evaluated loans with a fair value adjustment. Individually evaluated loans are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and are evaluated and valued at the lower of cost or fair value when the loan is individually evaluated. Fair value is based on the value of the collateral securing these loans. \n\nIn determining the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral of individually evaluated loans, the Company primarily uses third-party appraisals or broker opinions which may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available and include consideration of variations in location, size, and income production capacity of the property. Additionally, the appraisals are periodically further adjusted by the Company in consideration of charges that may be incurred in the event of foreclosure and are based on management’s historical knowledge, changes in business factors and changes in market conditions. Because of the high degree of judgment required in estimating the fair value of collateral underlying individually evaluated loans and because of the relationship between fair value and general economic conditions, the Company considers the fair value of individually evaluated loans to be highly sensitive to changes in market conditions.\n\n96\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nGAAP requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, including those that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\n\nWithin the two years prior to the date of the most recent financial statements, there have been no changes in or disagreements with accountants of the Company.\n\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s current disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.\n\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). The Company’s internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\n\nInternal control over financial reporting of the Company includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the Company; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\nBecause of inherent limitations in any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected, including the possibility of the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time.\n\nManagement assessed the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework in 2013. Based on this assessment, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer assert that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on the specified criteria.\n\nThe Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 that appears in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and is incorporated into this item by reference.\n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\n\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, none of the Company’s directors or executive officers adopted or terminated any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.” \n\n100\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20231231_HTM_i1d7535173a074d59aec794bf02a0565f_4)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nITEM 9C.

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of West Bancorporation, Inc. (the “Company”) believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to adopt this Clawback Policy (the “Policy”), which provides for the recovery of certain incentive compensation in the event of an Accounting Restatement (as defined below). This Policy is designed to comply with, and shall be interpreted consistent with, Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), Rule 10D-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act (“Rule 10D-1”) and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5608 (the “Listing Standards”).\n\n2.Administration. Except as specifically set forth herein, this Policy shall be administered by the Board or, if so designated by the Board, a committee thereof (the Board or such committee charged with administration of this Policy, the “Administrator”). The Administrator is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate or advisable for the administration of this Policy. Any determinations made by the Administrator shall be final and binding on all affected individuals and need not be uniform with respect to each individual covered by the Policy. In the administration of this Policy, the Administrator is authorized and directed to consult with the full Board or such other committees of the Board, as may be necessary or appropriate as to matters within the scope of such other committee’s responsibility and authority. Subject to any limitation at applicable law, the Administrator may authorize and empower any officer or employee of the Company to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose and intent of this Policy (other than with respect to any recovery under this Policy involving such officer or employee).\n\n3.Definitions. As used in this Policy, the following definitions shall apply:\n\na.“Accounting Restatement” means an accounting restatement of the Company’s financial statements due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period.\n\nb.“Applicable Period” means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, as well as any transition period (that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years (except that a transition period that comprises a period of at least nine months shall count as a completed fiscal year). The “date on which the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement” is the earlier to occur of (a) the date the Board or Audit Committee concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement or (b) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement, in each case regardless of if or when the restated financial statements are filed.\n\nc.“Covered Executives” means the current and former executive officers of the Company and its subsidiaries, as determined by the Administrator in accordance with the definition of executive officer set forth in Rule 10D-1 and the Listing Standards.\n\nd.“Erroneously Awarded Compensation” has the meaning set forth in Section 6 of this Policy.\n\ne.A “Financial Reporting Measure” is any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and any \n\nmeasure that is derived wholly or in part from such measure. Financial Reporting Measures include but are not limited to the following (and any measures derived from the following): Company stock price; total shareholder return (“TSR”); revenues; net income; operating income; profitability of one or more reportable segments; financial ratios (e.g., accounts receivable turnover and inventory turnover rates); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations; liquidity measures (e.g., working capital, operating cash flow); return measures (e.g., return on invested capital, return on assets); earnings measures (e.g., earnings per share); sales per square foot or same store sales, where sales is subject to an Accounting Restatement; revenue per user, or average revenue per user, where revenue is subject to an Accounting Restatement; cost per employee, where cost is subject to an Accounting Restatement; any of such financial reporting measures relative to a peer group, where the Company’s financial reporting measure is subject to an Accounting Restatement; and tax basis income. A Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the Company’s financial statements or included in a filing with the Securities Exchange Commission.\n\nf.“Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure. Incentive-Based Compensation is “received” for purposes of this Policy in the Company’s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of such Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\n\n4.Covered Executives; Incentive-Based Compensation. This Policy applies to Incentive-Based Compensation received by a Covered Executive (a) after beginning services as a Covered Executive; (b) if that person served as a Covered Executive at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation; and (c) while the Company had a listed class of securities on a national securities exchange.\n\n5.Required Recoupment. In the event the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, the Company shall promptly recoup the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation received by any Covered Executive, as calculated pursuant to Section 6 hereof, during the Applicable Period.\n\n6.Erroneously Awarded Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery. The amount of “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” subject to recovery under the Policy, as determined by the Administrator, is the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received by the Covered Executive that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that would have been received by the Covered Executive had it been determined based on the restated amounts.\n\nErroneously Awarded Compensation shall be computed by the Administrator without regard to any taxes paid by the Covered Executive in respect of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation.\n\nBy way of example, with respect to any compensation plans or programs that take into account Incentive-Based Compensation, the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation subject to recovery hereunder includes, but is not limited to, the amount contributed to any notional account based on Erroneously Awarded Compensation and any earnings accrued to date on that notional amount.\n\nFor Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or TSR: (a) the Administrator shall determine the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or TSR upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received; and (b) the Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”).\n\n1.Method of Recoupment. The Administrator shall determine, in its sole discretion, the timing and method for promptly recouping Erroneously Awarded Compensation hereunder, which may include without \n\nlimitation (a) seeking reimbursement of all or part of any cash or equity-based award, (b) cancelling prior cash or equity-based awards, whether vested or unvested or paid or unpaid, (c) cancelling or offsetting against any planned future cash or equity-based awards, (d) forfeiture of deferred compensation, subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and (e) any other method authorized by applicable law or contract. Subject to compliance with any applicable law, the Administrator may affect recovery under this Policy from any amount otherwise payable to the Covered Executive, including amounts payable to such individual under any otherwise applicable Company plan or program, including base salary, bonuses or commissions and compensation previously deferred by the Covered Executive.\n\nThe Company is authorized and directed pursuant to this Policy to recoup Erroneously Awarded Compensation in compliance with this Policy unless the Compensation Committee of the Board has determined that recovery would be impracticable solely for the following limited reasons, and subject to the following procedural and disclosure requirements:\n\na.The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on expense of enforcement, the Administrator must make a reasonable attempt to recover such erroneously awarded compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover and provide that documentation to Nasdaq;\n\nb.Recovery would violate home country law of the issuer where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law of the issuer, the Administrator must satisfy the applicable opinion and disclosure requirements of Rule 10D-1 and the Listing Standards; or\n\nc.Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.\n\n2.No Indemnification of Covered Executives. Notwithstanding the terms of any indemnification or insurance policy or any contractual arrangement with any Covered Executive that may be interpreted to the contrary, the Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, including any payment or reimbursement for the cost of third-party insurance purchased by any Covered Executives to fund potential clawback obligations under this Policy.\n\n3.Indemnification of Administrator. Any members of the Administrator, and any other members of the Board who assist in the administration of this Policy, shall not be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation made with respect to this Policy and shall be fully indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent under applicable law and Company policy with respect to any such action, determination or interpretation. The foregoing sentence shall not limit any other rights to indemnification of the members of the Board under applicable law or Company policy.\n\n4.Compensation Adjustment. The Board, or the Compensation Committee or other appropriate committee thereof, shall, to the extent it determines to be appropriate and consistent with the intent of this Policy and would not otherwise result in a violation of any applicable law, rule, regulation, the Listing Standards or any rules or standards adopted by a national securities exchange on which the Company’s securities are listed, require a positive adjustment of any Incentive-Based Compensation that is received by a Covered Executive on or after the Effective Date, if and to the extent that (i) the amount of such Incentive-Based Compensation was formulaically calculated based upon a Financial Reporting Measure that was subsequently modified due to an Accounting Restatement, and (ii) such Incentive-Based Compensation actually received by the Covered Executive was less than the amount that would have been received by the Covered Executive had it been determined based on the restated amounts.\n\n5.Effective Date; Retroactive Application. This Policy shall be effective as of July 26, 2023 (the “Effective Date”). The terms of this Policy shall apply to any Incentive-Based Compensation that is received by Covered Executives on or after the Effective Date, even if such Incentive-Based Compensation was approved, awarded, granted or paid to Covered Executives prior to the Effective Date. Without limiting the generality of Section 7 hereof, and subject to applicable law, the Administrator may affect recovery under this Policy from any amount of compensation approved, awarded, granted, payable or paid to the Covered Executive prior to, on or after the Effective Date.\n\n6.Amendment; Termination. The Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to reflect final regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 10D of the Exchange Act and to comply with any rules or standards adopted by a national securities exchange on which the Company’s securities are listed. The Board may terminate this Policy at any time.\n\n7.Other Recoupment Rights. The Board intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The Board may require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement, incentive award agreement or similar agreement entered into on or after the Effective Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require a Covered Executive to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company.\n\n8.Successors. This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.\n\n9.Exhibit Filing Requirement. A copy of this Policy and any amendments thereto shall be posted on the Company’s website and filed as an exhibit to the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K.\n\n* * *\n"

Basis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared by West Bancorporation, Inc. (the Company) pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Although management believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented understandable, it is suggested that these interim consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024. In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company contain all adjustments necessary to fairly present its financial position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, net income, comprehensive income (loss) and changes in stockholders' equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The results for these interim periods may not be indicative of results for the entire year or for any other period.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). References to GAAP issued by the FASB in these footnotes are to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification™, sometimes referred to as the Codification or ASC. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term are the fair value of financial instruments and the allowance for credit losses.\n\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary West Bank and West Bank's special purpose subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. In accordance with GAAP, West Bancorporation Capital Trust I is recorded on the books of the Company using the equity method of accounting and is not consolidated.\n\nCurrent accounting developments: In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The amendments in this update provide optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. They provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments in this update were effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope. The amendments in this update refine the scope for certain optional expedients and exceptions for contract modifications and hedge accounting to apply to derivative contracts and certain hedging relationships affected by the discounting transition. The amendments in this update were effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848. The amendment in this update extends the period of time preparers can utilize reference rate reform relief guidance in Topic 848, discussed above. ASU No. 2022-06 defers the sunset date from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The Company does not expect the updates within Topic 848 to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. \n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using Proportional Amortization Method. The ASU is intended to improve the accounting and disclosures for investments in tax credit structures. It allows reporting entities to elect to adopt for qualifying tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method, regardless of the program giving rise to the related income tax credits. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The implementation of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. \n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(unaudited)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. The ASU incorporates certain SEC disclosure requirements into the FASB Accounting Standards CodificationTM.. The amendments in the ASU are expected to clarify or improve disclosure presentation requirements of a variety of Codification Topics, allow users to more easily compare entities subject to the SEC’s existing disclosures with those entities that were not previously subject to the requirements, and align the requirements in the Codification with the SEC’s regulations. For entities subject to the SEC’s existing disclosure requirements and for entities required to file or furnish financial statements with or to the SEC in preparation for the sale of or for purposes of issuing securities that are not subject to contractual restrictions on transfer, the effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC removes that related disclosure from its rules. For all other entities, the amendments will be effective two years later. However, if by June 30, 2027, the SEC has not removed the related disclosure from its regulations, the amendments will be removed from the Codification and not become effective for any entity. These amendments have not had an impact to the Company as of September 30, 2024. \n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The ASU is intended to improve the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation table and income taxes paid to be disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. \n\n2. Earnings per Common Share\n\nBasic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if the Company's outstanding restricted stock units were vested. The dilutive effect was computed using the treasury stock method, which assumes all stock-based awards were exercised and the hypothetical proceeds from exercise were used by the Company to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. The incremental shares, to the extent they would have been dilutive, were included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per common share calculation. The calculations of earnings per common share and diluted earnings per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented in the following table.\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n(in thousands, except per share data)| 2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nNet income| $| 5,952| $| 5,906 | $| 16,953| $| 19,612   \nWeighted average common shares outstanding| 16,833| 16,725 | 16,797| 16,697   \nWeighted average effect of restricted stock units outstanding| 88| 43 | 76| 45   \nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding| 16,921| 16,768 | 16,873| 16,742   \nBasic earnings per common share| $| 0.35| $| 0.35 | $| 1.01| $| 1.17   \nDiluted earnings per common share| $| 0.35| $| 0.35 | $| 1.00| $| 1.17   \nNumber of anti-dilutive common stock equivalents excluded from diluted earnings per share computation| 264| 408 | 303| 413   \n  \n11\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(unaudited)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\n3.

Certain securities have call features that allow the issuer to call the securities prior to maturity. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities for collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed securities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company also determined that no individual securities in an unrealized loss position represented credit losses that would require an allowance for credit losses. The Company concluded that the unrealized losses were primarily attributable to increases in market interest rates since these securities were purchased and other market conditions. Accrued interest receivable is not included in available-for-sale security balances and is presented in the \"Accrued interest receivable\" line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest receivable on securities was $3,291 and $3,271 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and was excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\n\n13\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(unaudited)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\n4.

Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of the related loan yield using the interest method.

the net amount expected to be collected. The Company estimates the ACL based on the underlying loans' amortized cost basis, which is the amount at which the loan is originated or acquired, adjusted for collection of cash and charge-offs, as well as applicable accretion or amortization of premiums, discounts, and net deferred fees or costs. The Company's estimate of the ACL reflects losses expected over the remaining contractual life of the assets. The contractual term does not consider extensions, renewals or modifications unless the Company has identified an expected restructuring. In the event that collection of principal becomes uncertain, the Company has policies in place to reverse accrued interest in a timely manner. Therefore, the Company has made a policy election to exclude accrued interest from the measurement of the ACL. \n\nAccrued interest on loans of $10,302 and $10,292 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, was included in the \"Accrued interest receivable\" line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and was excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\n\nExpected credit losses are reflected in the ACL through a charge to credit loss expense. When the Company deems all or a portion of a loan to be uncollectible, the appropriate amount is written off and the ACL is reduced by the same amount. The Company applies judgment to determine when a loan is deemed uncollectible; however, generally speaking, a loan will be considered uncollectible no later than when all efforts at collection have been exhausted. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the ACL when received.\n\nThe Company measures expected credit losses of loans on a collective (pool) basis when the loans share similar risk characteristics and uses a cash flow based method to estimate expected credit losses for each of these pools. The Company's methodology for estimating the ACL considers available relevant information about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The methodologies apply historical loss information, adjusted for asset-specific characteristics, economic conditions at the measurement date, and forecasts about future economic conditions expected to exist through the contractual lives of the financial assets that are reasonable and supportable, to the identified pools of financial assets with similar risk characteristics for which the historical experience was observed. \n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(unaudited)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nThe Company uses the cash flow based model to estimate expected credit losses for all loan segments. For each of the loan segments, the Company calculates a cash flow projection using contractual terms, estimated prepayment speeds, estimated curtailment rates, and other relevant data. The Company uses regression analysis that links historical losses of the Company and its peer group to two economic metrics: national unemployment rate and 10-year treasury rate over 2-year treasury rate spread to establish the loss rates applied to the projected cash flows. For all loan segments, the Company uses a forecast period of four quarters and reverts to a historical rate after four quarters. When estimating prepayment speed and curtailment rates, the modeling is based on historical internal data. \n\nNonaccrual Loans and Delinquency Status\n\nDelinquencies are determined based on the payment terms of the individual loan agreements. The accrual of interest on past due and other individually evaluated loans is generally discontinued at 90 days past due or when, in the opinion of management, the borrower may be unable to make all payments pursuant to contractual terms. Unless considered collectible, all interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged off is reversed against interest income. Generally, all payments received while a loan is on nonaccrual status are applied to the principal balance of the loan. Loans are returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. \n\nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis of loans on nonaccrual status, loans on nonaccrual status with no ACL recorded, and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing by loan segment as of the dates indicated.\n\nTotal Nonaccrual| Nonaccrual with no Allowance for Credit Losses| 90 Days or More Past Due and Accruing  \n---|---|---  \nSeptember 30, 2024| December 31, 2023| September 30, 2024| December 31, 2023| September 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \nCommercial| $| —| $| — | $| —| $| — | $| —| $| —   \nReal estate:  \nConstruction, land and land  \ndevelopment| —| — | —| — | —| —   \n1-4 family residential first  \nmortgages| 233| 296 | 233| 296 | —| —   \nHome equity| —| — | —| — | —| —   \nCommercial| —| — | —| — | —| —   \nConsumer and other| —| — | —| — | —| —   \nTotal| $| 233| $| 296 | $| 233| $| 296 | $| —| $| —   \n  \nThere was $91 and $0 of interest income recognized on loans that were on nonaccrual for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(unaudited)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nThe following tables provide an analysis of the delinquency status of the amortized cost of loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n\nSeptember 30, 2024  \n---  \n30-59Days PastDue| 60-89Days PastDue| 90 Daysor MorePast Due| TotalPast Due| Current| Total Loans  \nCommercial| $| —| $| —| $| —| $| —| $| 512,884| $| 512,884  \nReal estate:  \nConstruction, land and  \nland development| —| —| —| —| 520,516| 520,516  \n1-4 family residential  \nfirst mortgages| —| —| 96| 96| 89,653| 89,749  \nHome equity| —| —| —| —| 17,140| 17,140  \nCommercial| —| —| —| —| 1,870,132| 1,870,132  \nConsumer and other| —| —| —| —| 14,261| 14,261  \nTotal| $| —| $| —| $| 96| $| 96| $| 3,024,586| $| 3,024,682  \n  \nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \n30-59Days PastDue| 60-89Days PastDue| 90 Daysor MorePast Due| TotalPast Due| Current| TotalLoans  \nCommercial| $| — | $| — | $| — | $| — | $| 531,594 | $| 531,594   \nReal estate:  \nConstruction, land and  \nland development| — | — | — | — | 413,477 | 413,477   \n1-4 family residential  \nfirst mortgages| — | — | — | — | 106,688 | 106,688   \nHome equity| — | — | — | — | 14,618 | 14,618   \nCommercial| — | — | — | — | 1,854,510 | 1,854,510   \nConsumer and other| — | — | — | — | 10,930 | 10,930   \nTotal| $| — | $| — | $| — | $| — | $| 2,931,817 | $| 2,931,817   \n  \n18\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(unaudited)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nLoan Restructurings Made to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no loan restructurings made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. There were no loan restructurings made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for which there was a payment default within twelve months following the modification during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. A loan is considered to be in payment default once it is 30 days contractually past due under the modified terms.\n\nCredit Quality Indicators\n\nBased upon its ongoing assessment of credit quality within the loan portfolio, the Company maintains a Watch List, which includes loans classified as Doubtful, Substandard and Watch according to the Company's classification criteria. These loans involve the anticipated potential for payment defaults or collateral inadequacies. A loan on the Watch List is analyzed individually to categorize the loan to the appropriate credit risk category. \n\nAll loans are subject to the assessment of a credit quality indicator. Risk ratings are assigned for each loan at the time of approval, and they change as circumstances dictate during the term of the loan. The Company utilizes a 9-point risk rating scale as shown below, with ratings 1 - 5 included in the Pass column, rating 6 included in the Watch column, ratings 7 - 8 included in the Substandard column and rating 9 included in the Doubtful column. \n\nRisk rating 1: The loan is secured by cash equivalent collateral. \n\nRisk rating 2: The loan is secured by properly margined marketable securities, bonds or cash surrender value of life insurance.\n\nRisk rating 3: The borrower is in strong financial condition and has strong debt service capacity. The loan is performing as agreed, and the financial characteristics and trends of the borrower exceed industry statistics.\n\nRisk rating 4: The borrower's financial condition is satisfactory and stable. The borrower has satisfactory debt service capacity, and the loan is well secured. The loan is performing as agreed, and the financial characteristics and trends fall in line with industry statistics.\n\nRisk rating 5: The borrower's financial condition is less than satisfactory. The loan is still generally paying as agreed, but strained cash flows may cause some slowness in payments. The collateral values adequately preclude loss on the loan. Financial characteristics and trends lag industry statistics. There may be noncompliance with loan covenants.\n\nRisk rating 6: The borrower's financial condition is deficient. Payment delinquencies may be more common. Collateral values still protect from loss, but margins are narrow. The loan may be reliant on secondary sources of repayment, including liquidation of collateral and guarantor support.\n\nRisk rating 7: The loan is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Well-defined weaknesses exist that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. The Company is inadequately protected by the valuation or paying capacity of the collateral pledged. If deficiencies are not corrected, there is a distinct possibility that a loss will be sustained.\n\nRisk rating 8: All the characteristics of rating 7 exist with the added condition that the loan is past due more than 90 days or there is reason to believe the Company will not receive its principal and interest according to the terms of the loan agreement.\n\nRisk rating 9: All the weaknesses inherent in risk ratings 7 and 8 exist with the added condition that collection or liquidation, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions and values, is highly questionable and improbable. A loan reaching this category would most likely be charged off.\n\n19\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(unaudited)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nCredit quality indicators for all loans and the Company's risk rating process are dynamic and updated on a continuous basis. Risk ratings are updated as circumstances that could affect the repayment of an individual loan are brought to management's attention through an established monitoring process. Individual bankers initiate changes as appropriate for ratings 1 through 5, and changes for ratings 6 through 9 are initiated by management. The likelihood of loss increases as the risk rating increases and is generally preceded by a loan appearing on the Watch List, which consists of all loans with a risk rating of 6 or worse. Written action plans with firm target dates for resolution of identified problems are maintained and reviewed on a quarterly basis for all segments of loans included on the Watch List. In addition to the Company's internal credit monitoring practices and procedures, an outsourced independent credit review function is in place to further assess assigned internal risk classifications and monitor compliance with internal lending policies and procedures. \n\nIn all portfolio segments, the primary risks are that a borrower's income stream diminishes to the point that the borrower is not able to make scheduled principal and interest payments and any collateral securing the loan declines in value. The risk of declining collateral values is present for most types of loans.\n\nCommercial loans consist primarily of loans to businesses for various purposes, including revolving lines to finance current operations, inventory and accounts receivable, and capital expenditure loans to finance equipment and other fixed assets. These loans generally have short maturities, have either adjustable or fixed interest rates, and are either unsecured or secured by inventory, accounts receivable and/or fixed assets. For commercial loans, the primary source of repayment is from the operation of the business. \n\nReal estate loans include various types of loans for which the Company holds real property as collateral, and consist of loans on commercial properties and single and multifamily residences. Real estate loans are typically structured to mature or reprice every five to ten years with payments based on amortization periods up to 30 years. The majority of construction loans are to contractors and developers for construction of commercial buildings or residential real estate. These loans typically have maturities of up to 24 months. The Company's loan policy includes minimum appraisal and other credit guidelines.\n\nConsumer loans include loans extended to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures not secured by real estate. The majority of the Company's consumer lending is for vehicles, consolidation of personal debts and household improvements. The repayment source for consumer loans, including 1-4 family residential and home equity loans, is typically wages. \n\n20\n\n[Table of

in thousands, except per share data)\n\nCollateral Dependent Loans\n\nLoans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. For collateral dependent loans where the Company has determined that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company expects repayment of the loans to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the ACL is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. When repayment is expected to be from the operation of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the present value of expected cash flows from the operation of collateral. When repayment is expected to be from the sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated cost to sell. The ACL may be zero if the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date exceeds the amortized cost basis of the loan.\n\nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis of collateral dependent loans, by primary collateral type, which are individually evaluated to determine expected credit losses, and the related ACL allocated to these loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024  \n---  \nPrimary Type of Collateral  \nReal Estate| Equipment| Other | Total| ACL Allocation  \n1-4 family residential first mortgages| $| 233| $| —| $| —| $| 233| $| —  \nTotal| $| 233| $| —| $| —| $| 233| $| —  \n  \nAs of December 31, 2023  \n---  \nPrimary Type of Collateral  \nReal Estate| Equipment| Other | Total| ACL Allocation  \n1-4 family residential first mortgages| $| 296 | $| — | $| — | $| 296 | $| —   \nTotal| $| 296 | $| — | $| — | $| 296 | $| —   \n  \nAllowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures\n\nThe Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The Company's allowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments was $1,544 and $2,544 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The allowance for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures is presented in the \"Accrued expenses and other liabilities\" line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the allowance for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures is reflected in the \"Credit loss expense\" line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. There was a negative provision for credit losses of $1,000 for off-balance-sheet credit exposures during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and no provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n5. Derivatives\n\nThe Company has entered into various interest rate swap agreements as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk exposure on certain loans, borrowings and deposits due to interest rate movements. The notional amounts of the interest rate swaps do not represent amounts exchanged by the counterparties, but rather, the notional amount is used to determine, along with other terms of the derivative, the amounts to be exchanged between the counterparties. \n\n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(unaudited)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nInterest Rate Swaps Designated as a Cash Flow Hedge: The Company had interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges with total notional amounts of $465,000 and $445,000 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had swaps with a total notional amount of $295,000 that hedge the interest payments of rolling one-month funding consisting of FHLB advances or brokered deposits. An additional forward starting swap with a total notional amount of $20,000 has a starting date in November 2024, replacing a maturing swap in the rolling funding program. Also, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had swaps with a total notional amount of $40,000 that effectively convert variable-rate long-term debt to fixed-rate debt and swaps with a total notional amount of $110,000 that hedge the interest payments of certain deposit accounts. \n\nDerivatives Not Designated as Accounting Hedges: To accommodate customer needs, the Company on occasion offers loan level interest rate swaps to its customers and offsets its exposure from such contracts by entering into mirror image swaps with a swap counterparty (back-to-back swap program). The interest rate swaps are free-standing derivatives and are recorded at fair value. The Company enters into a floating-rate loan and a fixed-rate swap with our customer. Simultaneously, the Company enters into an offsetting fixed-rate swap with a swap counterparty. In connection with each swap transaction, the Company agrees to pay interest to the customer on a notional amount at a variable interest rate and receive interest from the customer on the same notional amount at a fixed interest rate. At the same time, the Company agrees to pay a swap counterparty the same fixed interest rate on the same notional amount and receive the same variable interest rate on the same notional amount. These transactions allow the Company’s customers to effectively convert variable-rate loans to fixed-rate loans. The customer accommodations and any offsetting swaps are treated as non-hedging derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting. \n\nThe table below identifies the balance sheet category and fair values of the Company's derivative instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nSeptember 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nCash Flow Hedges:  \nGross notional amount| $| 465,000| $| 445,000   \nFair value in other assets| 5,833| 11,313   \nFair value in other liabilities| (2,383)| (988)  \nWeighted-average floating rate received| 5.47| %| 5.64 | %  \nWeighted-average fixed rate paid| 3.24| %| 3.04 | %  \nWeighted-average maturity in years| 2.4| 2.6  \nNon-Hedging Derivatives:  \nGross notional amount| $| 289,009| $| 293,400   \nFair value in other assets| 11,769| 14,114   \nFair value in other liabilities| (11,769)| (14,114)  \n  \nThe following table identifies the pre-tax gains or losses recognized on the Company's derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nPre-tax gain (loss) recognized in other comprehensive  \nincome | $| (8,218)| $| 5,303 | $| 1,635| $| 11,771   \nDecrease in interest expense| (2,697)| (2,903)| (8,510)| (7,328)  \n  \n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(unaudited)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nThe Company estimates there will be approximately $9,909 reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to decrease interest expense through the 12 months ending September 30, 2025 related to cash flow hedges. \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by interest rate swap counterparties, which is minimized by collateral-pledging provisions in the agreements. Derivative contracts with swap counterparties are executed with a Credit Support Annex, which is a bilateral ratings-sensitive agreement that requires collateral postings at established credit threshold levels. These agreements protect the interests of the Company and its counterparties should either party suffer a credit rating deterioration. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company pledged $300 and $0, respectively, of collateral to the counterparties in the form of cash on deposit. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's counterparties pledged $12,290 and $22,340, respectively, of collateral to the Company in the form of cash on deposit. The interest rate swap product with the borrower is cross-collateralized with the underlying loan collateral and therefore there is no pledged cash collateral under swap contracts with customers.\n\n6. Income Taxes\n\nNet deferred tax assets consisted of the following as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nSeptember 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nDeferred tax assets:  \nAllowance for credit losses| $| 7,617| $| 7,598   \nNet unrealized losses on securities available for sale| 26,675| 30,081   \nLease liabilities| 682| 837   \nAccrued expenses| 227| 196   \nRestricted stock unit compensation| 925| 1,185   \nState net operating loss carryforward| 1,970| 1,763   \nOther | 191| 177   \n38,287| 41,837   \nDeferred tax liabilities:  \nRight-of-use assets| 645| 795   \nDeferred loan costs| 230| 258   \nNet unrealized gains on interest rate swaps| 851| 2,547   \nPremises and equipment| 3,317| 1,657   \nNew markets tax credit loan| 453| 389   \nOther| 142| 125   \n5,638| 5,771   \nNet deferred tax assets before valuation allowance| 32,649| 36,066   \nValuation allowance| (1,970)| (1,763)  \nNet deferred tax assets| $| 30,679| $| 34,303   \n  \nThe Company has recorded a valuation allowance against the tax effect of the state net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes it is more likely than not that these carryforwards will expire without being utilized.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the balances of each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\nUnrealized| Unrealized| Accumulated  \n---|---|---  \nGains| Gains| Other  \n(Losses) on| (Losses) on| Comprehensive  \nSecurities| Derivatives| Income (Loss)  \nBalance, December 31, 2023| $| (91,233)| $| 7,710| $| (83,523)  \nOther comprehensive income before reclassifications| 10,381| 1,245| 11,626  \nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss| (25)| (6,409)| (6,434)  \nNet current period other comprehensive income (loss)| 10,356| (5,164)| 5,192  \nBalance, September 30, 2024| $| (80,877)| $| 2,546| $| (78,331)  \nBalance, December 31, 2022| $| (103,680)| $| 12,209 | $| (91,471)  \nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications| (15,441)| 8,879 | (6,562)  \nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income| (20)| (5,526)| (5,546)  \nNet current period other comprehensive income (loss)| (15,461)| 3,353 | (12,108)  \nBalance, September 30, 2023| $| (119,141)| $| 15,562 | $| (103,579)  \n  \n8. Commitments and Contingencies\n\nFinancial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk: The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations that it uses for on-balance-sheet instruments. The Company's commitments consisted of the following amounts as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n\nSeptember 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nCommitments to fund real estate construction loans| $| 214,595| $| 385,846   \nOther commitments to extend credit| 510,976| 641,554   \nStandby letters of credit| 16,791| 15,972   \n$| 742,362| $| 1,043,372   \n  \nWest Bank previously executed Mortgage Partnership Finance (MPF) Master Commitments (Commitments) with the FHLB of Des Moines to deliver residential mortgage loans and to guarantee the payment of any realized losses that exceed the FHLB's first loss account for mortgages delivered under the Commitments. West Bank receives credit enhancement fees from the FHLB for providing this guarantee and continuing to assist with managing the credit risk of the MPF Program residential mortgage loans. The outstanding balance of mortgage loans sold under the MPF Program was $18,045 and $20,159 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nContractual commitments: The Company had remaining commitments to invest in qualified affordable housing projects totaling $1,253 and $1,649 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(unaudited)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nConcentrations of credit risk: Substantially all of the Company's loans, commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit have been granted to customers in the Company's market areas. The concentrations of credit by type of loan are set forth in Note 4. The distribution by type of loan of commitments to extend credit approximates the distribution by type of loan outstanding. Standby letters of credit were granted primarily to commercial borrowers.\n\nContingencies: Neither the Company nor West Bank is a party, and no property of these entities is subject, to any material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to West Bank's business. The Company does not know of any proceeding contemplated by a governmental authority against the Company or West Bank. \n\n9. Fair Value Measurements\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts business. The Company's balance sheet contains securities available for sale and derivative instruments that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value is as follows:\n\nLevel 1 uses quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 uses observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\n\nLevel 3 uses unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.\n\nThe Company's policy is to recognize transfers between levels at the end of each reporting period, if applicable. There were no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nThe following is a description of valuation methodologies used for financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.\n\nSecurities available for sale: When available, quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of securities (Level 1). If quoted market prices are not available, the Company determines fair value based on various sources and may apply matrix pricing with observable prices for similar bonds where a price for the identical bond is not observable (Level 2). The fair values of these securities are determined by pricing models that consider observable market data such as interest rate volatilities, yield curves, credit spreads, prices from market makers and live trading systems.\n\nManagement obtains the fair value of securities at the end of each reporting period via a third-party pricing service. Management reviewed the valuation process used by the third party and believed the process was valid. On a quarterly basis, management corroborates the fair values of securities by obtaining pricing from an independent financial market data vendor and comparing the two sets of fair values. Any significant variances are reviewed and investigated. For a sample of securities, prices are further validated by management by obtaining details of the inputs used by the pricing service. Those inputs were independently tested, and management concluded the fair values were consistent with GAAP requirements and the securities were properly classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(unaudited)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nDerivative instruments: The Company's derivative instruments consist of interest rate swaps accounted for as cash flow hedges, as well as interest rate swaps which are accounted for as non-hedging derivatives. The Company's derivative positions are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and are valued using models generally accepted in the financial services industry and that use actively quoted or observable market input values from external market data providers and/or non-binding broker-dealer quotations. The fair value of the derivatives is determined using discounted cash flow models. These models’ key assumptions include the contractual terms of the respective contract along with significant observable inputs, including interest rates, yield curves, nonperformance risk and volatility.\n\nThe following tables present the balances of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nSeptember 30, 2024  \n---  \nTotal| Level 1| Level 2| Level 3  \nFinancial assets:  \nSecurities available for sale:  \nState and political subdivisions| $| 193,763| $| —| $| 193,763| $| —  \nCollateralized mortgage obligations| 235,560| —| 235,560| —  \nMortgage-backed securities| 127,866| —| 127,866| —  \nCollateralized loan obligations| 28,544| —| 28,544| —  \nCorporate notes| 12,012| —| 12,012| —  \nDerivative instruments, interest rate swaps| 17,602| —| 17,602| —  \nFinancial liabilities:  \nDerivative instruments, interest rate swaps| $| 14,152| $| —| $| 14,152| $| —  \n  \nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \nTotal| Level 1| Level 2| Level 3  \nFinancial assets:  \nSecurities available for sale:  \nState and political subdivisions| $| 193,005 | $| — | $| 193,005 | $| —   \nCollateralized mortgage obligations| 249,933 | — | 249,933 | —   \nMortgage-backed securities| 131,838 | — | 131,838 | —   \nCollateralized loan obligations| 37,536 | — | 37,536 | —   \nCorporate notes| 11,607 | — | 11,607 | —   \nDerivative instruments, interest rate swaps| 25,427 | — | 25,427 | —   \nFinancial liabilities:  \nDerivative instruments, interest rate swaps| $| 15,102 | $| — | $| 15,102 | $| —   \n  \n28\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(unaudited)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nCertain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. That is, they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). Individually evaluated loans that are deemed to have impairment are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and are recorded at fair value, which is based on the value of the collateral securing these loans. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no individually evaluated loans with a fair value adjustment.\n\nIn determining the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral of individually evaluated loans, the Company primarily uses third-party appraisals or broker opinions which may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available and include consideration of variations in location, size, and income production capacity of the property. Additionally, the appraisals are periodically further adjusted by the Company in consideration of charges that may be incurred in the event of foreclosure and are based on management’s historical knowledge, changes in business factors and changes in market conditions. Because of the high degree of judgment required in estimating the fair value of collateral underlying individually evaluated loans and because of the relationship between fair value and general economic conditions, the Company considers the fair value of individually evaluated loans to be highly sensitive to changes in market conditions.\n\nGAAP requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. The following table presents the carrying amounts and approximate fair values of financial assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n\nSeptember 30, 2024  \n---  \nCarrying Amount| Approximate Fair Value| Level 1| Level 2| Level 3  \nFinancial assets:  \nCash and due from banks| $| 34,157| $| 34,157| $| 34,157| $| —| $| —  \nInterest-bearing deposits| 123,646| 123,646| 123,646| —| —  \nSecurities available for sale| 597,745| 597,745| —| 597,745| —  \nFederal Home Loan Bank stock| 17,195| 17,195| 17,195| —| —  \nLoans, net| 2,991,802| 2,953,129| —| 2,953,129| —  \nAccrued interest receivable| 13,842| 13,842| 13,842| —| —  \nInterest rate swaps| 17,602| 17,602| —| 17,602| —  \nFinancial liabilities:  \nDeposits| $| 3,278,553| $| 3,277,773| $| —| $| 3,277,773| $| —  \nSubordinated notes, net| 79,828| 64,129| —| 64,129| —  \nFederal Home Loan Bank advances| 315,000| 315,000| —| 315,000| —  \nLong-term debt| 43,986| 43,986| —| 43,986| —  \nAccrued interest payable| 10,794| 10,794| 10,794| —| —  \nInterest rate swaps| 14,152| 14,152| —| 14,152| —  \n  \n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(unaudited)\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \nCarrying Amount| Approximate Fair Value| Level 1| Level 2| Level 3  \nFinancial assets:  \nCash and due from banks| $| 33,245 | $| 33,245 | $| 33,245 | $| — | $| —   \nInterest-bearing deposits| 32,112 | 32,112 | 32,112 | — | —   \nSecurities available for sale| 623,919 | 623,919 | — | 623,919 | —   \nFederal Home Loan Bank stock| 22,957 | 22,957 | 22,957 | — | —   \nLoans, net| 2,899,193 | 2,813,188 | — | 2,813,188 | —   \nAccrued interest receivable| 13,581 | 13,581 | 13,581 | — | —   \nInterest rate swaps| 25,427 | 25,427 | — | 25,427 | —   \nFinancial liabilities:  \nDeposits| $| 2,973,779 | $| 2,971,562 | $| — | $| 2,971,562 | $| —   \nFederal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings| 150,270 | 150,270 | 150,270 | — | —   \nSubordinated notes, net| 79,631 | 65,039 | — | 65,039 | —   \nFederal Home Loan Bank advances| 315,000 | 315,000 | — | 315,000 | —   \nLong-term debt| 47,736 | 47,736 | — | 47,736 | —   \nAccrued interest payable| 6,688 | 6,688 | 6,688 | — | —   \nInterest rate swaps| 15,102 | 15,102 | — | 15,102 | —   \n  \n30\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc.\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n\nItem 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\n\"SAFE HARBOR\" CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nCertain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to the Company’s business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meanings of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report. These forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words “believes,” “expects,” “intends,” “anticipates,” “projects,” “future,” “confident,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “strategy,” “plan,” “opportunity,” “will be,” “will likely result,” “will continue” or similar references, or references to estimates, predictions or future events. Such forward-looking statements are based upon certain underlying assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Because of the possibility that the underlying assumptions are incorrect or do not materialize as expected in the future, actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that may affect future results include: interest rate risk, including the effects of changes in interest rates; fluctuations in the values of the securities held in our investment portfolio, including as a result of rising interest rates; competitive pressures, including from non-bank competitors such as credit unions, \"fintech\" companies and digital asset service providers; pricing pressures on loans and deposits; our ability to successfully manage liquidity risk; changes in credit and other risks posed by the Company’s loan portfolio, including declines in commercial or residential real estate values or changes in the allowance for credit losses dictated by new market conditions, accounting standards or regulatory requirements; the concentration of large deposits from certain clients, including those who have balances above current FDIC insurance limits; changes in local, national and international economic conditions, including the level and impact of inflation and possible recession; the effects of recent developments and events in the financial services industry, including the large-scale deposit withdrawals over a short period of time that resulted in recent bank failures; changes in legal and regulatory requirements, limitations and costs, including in response to the recent bank failures; changes in customers’ acceptance of the Company’s products and services; the occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of our or our third-party partners' information security controls or cyber-security related incidents, including as a result of sophisticated attacks using artificial intelligence and similar tools; unexpected outcomes of existing or new litigation involving the Company; the monetary, trade and other regulatory policies of the U.S. government; acts of war or terrorism, including the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, widespread disease or pandemics, or other adverse external events; risks related to climate change and the negative impact it may have on our customers and their business; changes to U.S. tax laws, regulations and guidance; potential changes in federal policy and at regulatory agencies as a result of the upcoming 2024 presidential election; talent and labor shortages; and any other risks described in the “Risk Factors” sections of this and other reports filed by the Company with the SEC. The Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update such forward-looking statements to reflect current or future events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The estimates and judgments that management believes involve the most complex and subjective estimates and judgments and have the greatest effect on the Company's reported financial position and results of operations are described as critical accounting policies in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024. There have been no significant changes in the critical accounting policies or the assumptions and judgments utilized in applying these policies since December 31, 2023. \n\n31\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc.\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nThis report contains references to financial measures that are not defined in GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures include the Company’s presentation of net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis, and the presentation of the efficiency ratio on an adjusted and FTE basis, excluding certain income and expenses. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors to analyze and evaluate the Company’s financial performance. These measures are considered standard measures of comparison within the banking industry. Additionally, management believes providing measures on a FTE basis enhances the comparability of income arising from taxable and nontaxable sources. Limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures include the risks that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items included in these measures and that different companies might calculate these measures differently. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be considered an alternative to the Company’s GAAP results for the periods indicated. \n\nThe following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income and net interest margin on a FTE basis and efficiency ratio on an adjusted and FTE basis to their most directly comparable measures under GAAP. \n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nReconciliation of net interest income and net interest margin on a FTE basis to GAAP:  \nNet interest income (GAAP)| $| 17,960| $| 16,634 | $| 51,940| $| 52,670   \nTax-equivalent adjustment (1)| 29| 113 | 166| 396   \nNet interest income on a FTE basis (non-GAAP)| 17,989| 16,747 | 52,106| 53,066   \nAverage interest-earning assets| 3,749,688| 3,478,053 | 3,692,647| 3,458,606   \nNet interest margin on a FTE basis (non-GAAP)| 1.91| %| 1.91 | %| 1.88| %| 2.05 | %  \nReconciliation of efficiency ratio on an adjusted and FTE basis to GAAP:  \nNet interest income on a FTE basis (non-GAAP)| $| 17,989| $| 16,747 | $| 52,106| $| 53,066   \nNoninterest income| 2,359| 2,822 | 7,004| 8,168   \nAdjustment for losses on disposal of premises and equipment, net| 26| 3 | 47| 5   \nAdjusted income| 20,374| 19,572 | 59,157| 61,239   \nNoninterest expense| 12,892| 11,905 | 37,954| 36,450   \nEfficiency ratio on an adjusted and FTE basis (non-GAAP)(2)| 63.28| %| 60.83 | %| 64.16| %| 59.52 | %  \n  \n(1) Computed on a tax-equivalent basis using a federal income tax rate of 21 percent, adjusted to reflect the effect of the nondeductible interest expense associated with owning tax-exempt securities and loans. Management believes the presentation of this non-GAAP measure provides supplemental useful information for proper understanding of the financial results, as it enhances the comparability of income arising from taxable and nontaxable sources. \n\n(2) The efficiency ratio expresses noninterest expense as a percent of fully taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income, excluding specific noninterest income and expenses. Management believes the presentation of this non-GAAP measure provides supplemental useful information for proper understanding of the Company's financial performance. It is a standard measure of comparison within the banking industry. A lower ratio is more desirable.\n\n32\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc.\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe following discussion describes the consolidated operations and financial condition of the Company, West Bank and West Bank's special purpose subsidiaries (which are invested in new markets tax credit activities). Results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are compared to the results for the same periods in 2023, and the consolidated financial condition of the Company as of September 30, 2024 is compared to that as of December 31, 2023. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024. \n\nThe Company conducts business from its headquarters building in West Des Moines, Iowa and through its branch offices in central Iowa, which is generally the greater Des Moines metropolitan area; eastern Iowa, which is the area including and surrounding Iowa City and Coralville; and southern Minnesota, which includes the cities of Rochester, Owatonna, Mankato and St. Cloud.\n\nNet income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $5,952, or $0.35 per diluted common share, compared to $5,906, or $0.35 per diluted common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company's annualized return on average assets and return on average equity for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.60 percent and 10.41 percent, respectively, compared to 0.64 percent and 10.89 percent, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. \n\nNet interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $1,326, or 8.0 percent, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to the increase in interest income on loans and decrease in interest expense on federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings, partially offset by the increase in interest expense on deposits. \n\nNoninterest income decreased $463 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, due to $431 in loan swap fees earned during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Noninterest expense increased $987 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases in occupancy and equipment, technology and software expense and FDIC insurance, partially offset by a decrease in business development expenses. \n\nNet income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $16,953, or $1.00 per diluted common share, compared to $19,612, or $1.17 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company's annualized return on average assets and return on average equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.59 percent and 10.18 percent, respectively, compared to 0.72 percent and 12.22 percent, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. \n\nNet interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 declined $730, or 1.4 percent, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to the increase in interest expense on deposits, resulting from rising short-term interest rates and changes in deposit mix, partially offset by an increase in interest income on loans. \n\nNoninterest income decreased $1,164 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to loan swap fees and a nonrecurring gain from bank-owned life insurance in 2023. Noninterest expense increased $1,504 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases in occupancy and equipment, technology and software expense and FDIC insurance, partially offset by a decrease in business development expenses. \n\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses on loans of $1,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $200 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses recorded in 2024 was due to changes in the forecasted loss rates, driven by increases in the forecasted unemployment rates. The Company also recorded a negative provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments of $1,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to no provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The negative provision for unfunded commitments recorded in 2024 was due to the decrease in balances of unfunded commitments resulting primarily from the funding of construction loans.\n\n33\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc.\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n\nTotal loans outstanding increased $93,686, or 3.2 percent, during the first nine months of 2024. The credit quality of the loan portfolio remained strong, as evidenced by the Company's ratio of nonperforming loans to total assets of 0.01 percent as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses was 0.97 percent of total outstanding loans. Management believed the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 was adequate to absorb expected losses in the loan portfolio as of that date.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, the Company compares three key performance metrics to those of our identified peer group. The peer group for 2024 consists of 21 Midwestern, publicly traded financial institutions, including Bank First Corporation, Bridgewater Bancshares Inc., ChoiceOne Financial Services, Inc., Civista Bancshares, Inc., CrossFirst Bankshares, Inc., Equity Bancshares, Inc., Farmers National Banc Corp., Farmers & Merchants Bancorp., First Business Financial Services, Inc., First Financial Corp., First Mid Bancshares, Inc., German American Bancorp, Inc., HBT Financial Inc., Hills Bancorporation, Isabella Bank Corporation, LCNB Corp., Mercantile Bank Corporation, MidWestOne Financial Group, Inc., Nicolet Bankshares, Inc., Peoples Bancorp, Inc., and Southern Missouri Bancorp, Inc. The Company is in the middle of the group in terms of asset size. The Company's goal is to perform at or near the top of this peer group relative to what we consider to be three key metrics: return on average equity, efficiency ratio and nonperforming assets to total assets. We believe these measures encompass the factors that define the performance of a community bank. Company and peer results for the key financial performance measures are summarized below.\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc.| Peer Group Range(2)  \n---|---  \nAs of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024| As of and for the six months ended June 30, 2024| As of and for the six months ended June 30, 2024  \nReturn on average equity| 10.18%| 10.07%| 2.37% - 15.11%  \nEfficiency ratio(1)| 64.16%| 64.62%| 47.40% - 79.76%  \nNonperforming assets to total assets| 0.01%| 0.01%| 0.01% - 0.65%  \n  \n(1) The efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Fluctuations in net interest income can result from the combination of changes in the average balances of asset and liability categories and changes in interest rates. Interest rates earned and paid are also affected by general economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, and by competitive factors, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. The Federal Reserve increased the target federal funds interest rate by a total of 425 basis points in 2022 and an additional 100 basis points in 2023. In September 2024, the Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds interest rate by 50 basis points. The timing and extent of additional interest rate reductions is not known at this time. \n\nNet interest margin on a FTE basis, a non-GAAP financial measure, is a measure of the net return on interest-earning assets and is computed by dividing annualized tax-equivalent net interest income by total average interest-earning assets for the period. The net interest margin for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 1.91 percent, while the net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 17 basis points, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Tax-equivalent net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $1,242 when compared to the same period in 2023, and decreased $960 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. \n\nTax-equivalent interest income on loans increased $5,702 and $19,585 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in interest income on loans was driven by a combination of an increase in the average balance of loans and an increase in loan yields. The average balance of loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $178,059 and $197,591, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, while loan yields increased 46 and 54 basis points, respectively, during these periods. Higher market interest rates in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 have resulted in higher rates on variable-rate loans and loan originations and renewals compared to current portfolio rates. The yield on the Company's loan portfolio is affected by the portfolio's loan mix, the interest rate environment, the effects of competition, the level of nonaccrual loans and reversals of previously accrued interest on charged-off loans. The yield on the loan portfolio is expected to increase in flat and rising rate environments as variable-rate loans reprice at higher rates and renewals and new originations are priced at prevailing market rates, which exceed the roll-off rate of principal repayments on existing loans. In a declining rate environment, the yield on variable-rate loans will decline, however as long as market rates remain higher than the yield on the fixed rate portfolio, renewals and originations will continue to increase the yield on the fixed-rate portfolio. The political and economic environments can also influence the volume of new loan originations and the mix of variable-rate versus fixed-rate loans. \n\nThe average balance of deposits increased $537,065 and $360,488 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The rate paid on deposits increased 70 and 89 basis points for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase in the cost of deposits was primarily due to increases in deposit interest rates in response to increases in the target federal funds rate that occurred in 2023, the inverted yield curve, increased competition for deposit balances, and changes in deposit mix.\n\nInterest expense on borrowed funds decreased $2,726 and $948 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of borrowed funds decreased $231,834 and $44,483 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings decreased $239,933 and $105,868 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to increases in deposits. The average rate paid on federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings increased 56 and 76 basis points in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in average rates paid on federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings was driven by the higher federal funds rate in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The average balance of FHLB advances increased by $65,989 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in average balances was primarily due to an increase in rolling one-month FHLB advances that are hedged with long-term interest rate swap agreements to provide fixed cost wholesale funding.\n\n38\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc.\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n\nCredit Loss Expense and the Related Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nThe credit loss expense recorded on the income statement represents a charge made to earnings to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses. The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is evaluated quarterly by management and reviewed by the Board of Directors. The allowance for credit losses is management's estimate of expected lifetime losses in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The Company recorded a credit loss expense for loans of $1,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a credit loss expense for loans of $200 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The credit loss expense for loans in 2024 was primarily due to the changes in the forecasted loss rates due to increases in forecasted unemployment rates. Additionally, the Company recorded a negative credit loss expense of $1,000 related to unfunded commitments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to decreases in the balance of unfunded commitments resulting primarily from the funding of construction loans. Management believed the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 was adequate to absorb expected losses in the loan portfolio as of that date. \n\nFactors management considers in establishing an appropriate allowance include: the borrower's financial condition; the value and adequacy of loan collateral; the condition of the local economy and the borrower's specific industry; the levels and trends of loans by segment; and a review of delinquent and classified loans. The quarterly evaluation of the allowance focuses on factors such as specific loan reviews, changes in the components of the loan portfolio given the current and forecasted economic conditions, and historical loss experience. Any one of the following conditions may result in the review of a specific loan: concern about whether the customer's cash flow or net worth is sufficient to repay the loan; delinquency status; criticism of the loan in a regulatory examination; the suspension of interest accrual; or other factors, including whether the loan has other special or unusual characteristics that suggest special monitoring is warranted. The Company's concentration risks include geographic concentrations in central and eastern Iowa and southern Minnesota. The local economies in those markets are composed primarily of major financial service companies, healthcare providers, educational institutions, technology and agribusiness companies, and state and local governments. \n\nWest Bank has a significant portion of its loan portfolio in commercial real estate loans, commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, and construction and land development loans. West Bank's typical commercial borrower is a small- or medium-sized, privately owned business entity. Compared to residential mortgages or consumer loans, commercial loans typically have larger balances and repayment usually depends on the borrowers' successful business operations. Commercial loans generally are not fully repaid over the loan period and may require refinancing or a large payoff at maturity. When the economy turns downward, commercial borrowers may not be able to repay their loans, and the value of their assets, which are usually pledged as collateral, may decrease rapidly and significantly. \n\nWhile management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, further reduction in the carrying amounts of loans may be necessary based on changes in circumstances, changes in the overall economy in the markets we currently serve, or later acquired information. Identifiable sectors within the general economy are subject to additional volatility, which at any time may have a substantial impact on the loan portfolio. In addition, regulatory agencies, as integral parts of their examination processes, periodically review the credit quality of the loan portfolio and the level of the allowance for credit losses. Such agencies may require West Bank to recognize additional charge-offs or provisions for credit losses based on such agencies' review of information available to them at the time of their examinations.\n\n39\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc.\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n\nWest Bank's policy is to charge off loans when, in management's opinion, a loan or a portion of a loan is deemed uncollectible. Commercially reasonable efforts are made to maximize subsequent recoveries. The following table summarizes the activity in the Company's allowance for credit losses on loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and related ratios.\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| Change| 2024| 2023| Change  \nBalance at beginning of period| $| 28,422| $| 27,938 | $| 484 | $| 28,342| $| 25,473 | $| 2,869   \nAdoption of CECL| —| — | — | —| 2,458 | (2,458)  \nCharge-offs| (16)| — | (16)| (20)| (18)| (2)  \nRecoveries| 13| 9 | 4 | 97| 34 | 63   \nNet (charge-offs) recoveries| (3)| 9 | (12)| 77| 16 | 61   \nProvision for credit losses charged  \n(credited) to operations| 1,000| 200 | 800 | 1,000| 200 | 800   \nBalance at end of period| $| 29,419| $| 28,147 | $| 1,272 | $| 29,419| $| 28,147 | $| 1,272   \nAverage loans outstanding| $| 2,991,272| $| 2,813,213 | $| 2,978,525| $| 2,780,934   \nRatio of annualized net (charge-offs)   \nrecoveries during the period to average  \nloans outstanding| 0.00| %| 0.00 | %| 0.00| %| 0.00 | %  \nRatio of allowance for credit losses for  \nloans to average loans outstanding| 0.98| %| 1.00 | %| 0.99| %| 1.01 | %  \nRatio of allowance for credit losses for  \nloans to total loans at end of period| 0.97| %| 0.99 | %| 0.97| %| 0.99 | %  \n  \n40\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc.\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n\nNoninterest Income\n\nThe following tables show the variance from the prior year in the noninterest income categories shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nThree Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \nNoninterest income:| 2024| 2023| Change| Change %  \nService charges on deposit accounts| $| 459| $| 463 | $| (4)| (0.86)| %  \nDebit card usage fees| 500| 495 | 5 | 1.01 | %  \nTrust services| 828| 831 | (3)| (0.36)| %  \nIncrease in cash value of bank-owned life insurance| 287| 262 | 25 | 9.54 | %  \nLoan swap fees| —| 431 | (431)| (100.00)| %  \nOther income| 285| 340 | (55)| (16.18)| %  \nTotal noninterest income| $| 2,359| $| 2,822 | $| (463)| (16.41)| %  \nNine Months Ended September 30,  \nNoninterest income:| 2024| 2023| Change| Change %  \nService charges on deposit accounts| $| 1,381| $| 1,383 | $| (2)| (0.14)| %  \nDebit card usage fees| 1,448| 1,492 | (44)| (2.95)| %  \nTrust services| 2,398| 2,286 | 112 | 4.90 | %  \nIncrease in cash value of bank-owned life insurance| 839| 769 | 70 | 9.10 | %  \nGain from bank-owned life insurance| —| 691 | (691)| (100.00)| %  \nLoan swap fees| —| 431 | (431)| (100.00)| %  \nOther income| 938| 1,116 | (178)| (15.95)| %  \nTotal noninterest income| $| 7,004| $| 8,168 | $| (1,164)| (14.25)| %  \n  \nRevenue from trust services was higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increases in one-time estate fees.

Technology and software expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the addition of new technology, product updates and information security solutions. FDIC insurance expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to an increase in assessment rate. \n\nIncome Tax Expense\n\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $1,475 (19.9 percent of pre-tax income) and $4,037 (19.2 percent of pre-tax income) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with $1,445 (19.7 percent of pre-tax income) and $4,576 (18.9 percent of pre-tax income) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company's consolidated income tax rate differs from the federal statutory income tax rate in each period, primarily due to tax-exempt interest income, the tax-exempt increase in cash value of bank-owned life insurance, tax-exempt gain from bank-owned life insurance, disallowed interest expense, and state income taxes. The tax rates for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were also impacted by year-to-date federal low income housing tax credits and a new markets tax credit of approximately $1,131 and $1,123, respectively.\n\n43\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc.\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\n\nThe Company had total assets of $3,988,566 as of September 30, 2024, compared to total assets of $3,825,758 as of December 31, 2023. Changes in the balance sheet included increases in interest-bearing cash deposits, loans, premises and equipment and total deposits and decreases in securities available for sale and federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings.\n\nSecurities\n\nSecurities available for sale decreased by $26,174 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was due to calls and principal paydowns on securities since December 31, 2023, partially offset by a decrease in unrealized losses on securities. Management concluded unrealized losses in the portfolio as of September 30, 2024 are the result of increases in risk-free market interest rates since the securities were purchased and are not an indication of declining credit quality. Unrealized losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax. The Company expects the securities portfolio as a percentage of total assets to decrease over time as the proceeds from paydowns and maturities may be used for loan growth or repayment of borrowed funds.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, approximately 61 percent of the available for sale securities portfolio consisted of government agency guaranteed collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed securities. Management believes these securities have little to no credit risk and provide cash flows for liquidity and repricing opportunities. \n\nLoans and Nonperforming Assets\n\nLoans outstanding increased $93,686 from $2,927,535 as of December 31, 2023 to $3,021,221 as of September 30, 2024. Changes in the loan portfolio during the first nine months of 2024 included an increase of $107,039 in construction, land and land development loans and a decrease of $18,710 in commercial loans. \n\nIn accordance with regulatory guidelines, the Company exercises heightened risk management practices when non-owner occupied commercial real estate lending exceeds 300 percent of total risk-based capital or construction, land and land development loans exceed 100 percent of total risk-based capital. Although the commercial real estate portfolio exceeded these regulatory guidelines as of September 30, 2024, they were within the Company's established policy limits and management believes that the Company has appropriate risk management policies and procedures to regularly monitor the commercial real estate portfolio. An analysis of the Company's non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio as of December 31, 2023 was presented in the Company's Form 10-K/A, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024, and the Company has not experienced any material changes to that portfolio since December 31, 2023.\n\nThe following table sets forth the amount of nonperforming assets held by the Company and common ratio measurements of those assets as of the dates shown. \n\nSeptember 30, 2024| December 31, 2023| Change  \n---|---|---  \nNonaccrual loans| $| 233| $| 296 | $| (63)  \nLoans past due 90 days and still accruing interest | —| — | —   \nLoan restructurings (1)| —| — | —   \nTotal nonperforming loans| 233| 296 | (63)  \nOther real estate owned| —| — | —   \nTotal nonperforming assets| $| 233| $| 296 | $| (63)  \nNonperforming loans to total loans| 0.01| %| 0.01 | %| — | %  \nNonperforming assets to total assets| 0.01| %| 0.01 | %| — | %  \n  \n(1)While loan restructurings made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty (loan restructurings) are commonly reported by the industry as nonperforming, those not classified in the nonaccrual category are accruing interest due to payment performance. Loan restructurings on nonaccrual status are categorized as nonaccrual. There were no loan restructurings categorized as nonaccrual as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. \n\n44\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc.\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n\nDeposits\n\nDeposits increased $304,774, or 10.2 percent, during the first nine months of 2024. Brokered deposits increased to $425,870 at September 30, 2024, from $305,411 at December 31, 2023. Excluding brokered deposits, deposits increased $184,315, or 6.9 percent, during the first nine months of 2024. Deposit growth included a mix of public funds and commercial and consumer deposits. Deposit inflows and outflows are influenced by prevailing market interest rates, competition, local and national economic conditions and fluctuations in our business customers' own liquidity needs. In particular, significant competition for deposits driven by high interest rate alternatives for depositors has impacted deposit fluctuations and increased our cost of deposits. \n\nWest Bank participates in the IntraFi® ICS and CDARS reciprocal deposit network which enables depositors to receive FDIC insurance coverage on deposits otherwise exceeding the maximum insurable amount. As of September 30, 2024, estimated uninsured deposits, which excludes deposits in the IntraFi® reciprocal network, brokered deposits and public funds protected by state programs, were approximately 27.8 percent of total deposits.\n\nBorrowed Funds\n\nFederal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings decreased from $150,270 at December 31, 2023 to $0 as of September 30, 2024. Federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings were reduced during the first nine months of 2024 as a result of the increase in deposits. \n\nThe Company had $315,000 of FHLB advances outstanding at September 30, 2024, $295,000 of which are one-month rolling advances hedged with long-term interest rate swaps. The interest rate swaps that hedge the interest rates on these FHLB advances have maturity dates ranging from November 2024 through June 2029 and fixed rates ranging from 1.69 percent to 4.42 percent. Additionally, the Company has one forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of $20,000 and a starting date in November 2024, which replaces a maturing swap. This strategy of hedging short-term rolling funding effectively provides fixed cost wholesale funding through the maturity dates of the various interest rate swaps.\n\nLiquidity\n\nThe objectives of liquidity management are to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to meet all financial commitments and to capitalize on opportunities for profitable business expansion. The Company's principal source of funds is deposits. Other sources include loan principal repayments, proceeds from the maturity and sale of securities, principal payments on amortizing securities, federal funds purchased, advances from the FHLB, other wholesale funding and funds provided by operations. Liquidity management is conducted on both a daily and a long-term basis. Investments in liquid assets are adjusted based on expected loan demand, projected loan and securities maturities and payments, expected deposit flows and the objectives set by the Company's asset-liability management policy. The Company had liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents) of $157,803 as of September 30, 2024 compared with $65,357 as of December 31, 2023.\n\nOur deposit growth strategy emphasizes core deposit growth. Deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing market interest rates, competition, local and national economic conditions and fluctuations in our business customers' own liquidity needs. The Company utilizes brokered deposits and other wholesale funding to supplement core deposit fluctuations and loan growth. Brokered deposits are obtained through various programs administered by IntraFi®, and through other third party brokers. At September 30, 2024, the Company had $425,870 in brokered deposits, which included fixed-rate deposits with terms through February 2029 and variable-rate deposits with terms through September 2025. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, West Bank had additional borrowing capacity available from the FHLB of approximately $628,000, as well as approximately $125,000 through the Federal Reserve discount window and $75,000 through unsecured federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks. Net cash from operating activities contributed $29,056 to liquidity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Management believed that the combination of high levels of potentially liquid assets, unencumbered securities, cash flows from operations, and additional borrowing capacity were sufficient to meet our liquidity needs as of September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company had remaining commitments to invest in qualified affordable housing projects totaling $1,253 and $1,649 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. \n\n45\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc.\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n\nCapital\n\nThe Company's total stockholders' equity increased to $235,353 at September 30, 2024 from $225,043 at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of retained net income and the increase in the market value of our available for sale investment portfolio. While accumulated other comprehensive losses reduce tangible common equity, they have no impact on regulatory capital. At September 30, 2024, the Company's tangible common equity as a percent of tangible assets was 5.90 percent compared to 5.88 percent as of December 31, 2023. \n\nThe Company and West Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements (as shown in the following table) can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators, which, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and West Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company's and West Bank's capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Management believed the Company and West Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject as of September 30, 2024.\n\n46\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nWest Bancorporation, Inc.\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n\nThe Company's and West Bank's capital amounts and ratios are presented in the following table.\n\nActual| For CapitalAdequacy Purposes| For CapitalAdequacy Purposes With Capital Conservation Buffer| To Be Well-Capitalized   \n---|---|---|---  \nAmount| Ratio| Amount| Ratio| Amount| Ratio| Amount| Ratio  \nAs of September 30, 2024  \nTotal Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)  \nConsolidated| $| 424,648| 11.95| %| $| 284,190| 8.00| %| $| 373,000| 10.50| %| $| 355,238| 10.00| %  \nWest Bank| 452,168| 12.73| %| 284,089| 8.00| %| 372,867| 10.50| %| 355,112| 10.00| %  \nTier 1 Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)  \nConsolidated| 333,684| 9.39| %| 213,143| 6.00| %| 301,952| 8.50| %| 284,190| 8.00| %  \nWest Bank| 421,204| 11.86| %| 213,067| 6.00| %| 301,845| 8.50| %| 284,089| 8.00| %  \nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)  \nConsolidated| 313,684| 8.83| %| 159,857| 4.50| %| 248,667| 7.00| %| 230,905| 6.50| %  \nWest Bank| 421,204| 11.86| %| 159,800| 4.50| %| 248,578| 7.00| %| 230,823| 6.50| %  \nTier 1 Capital (to Average Assets)  \nConsolidated| 333,684| 8.15| %| 163,803| 4.00| %| 163,803| 4.00| %| 204,754| 5.00| %  \nWest Bank| 421,204| 10.29| %| 163,727| 4.00| %| 163,727| 4.00| %| 204,659| 5.00| %  \nAs of December 31, 2023  \nTotal Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)  \nConsolidated| $| 419,452 | 11.88 | %| $| 282,508 | 8.00 | %| $| 370,791 | 10.50 | %| $| 353,135 | 10.00 | %  \nWest Bank| 450,444 | 12.76 | %| 282,307 | 8.00 | %| 370,527 | 10.50 | %| 352,883 | 10.00 | %  \nTier 1 Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)  \nConsolidated| 328,566 | 9.30 | %| 211,881 | 6.00 | %| 300,164 | 8.50 | %| 282,508 | 8.00 | %  \nWest Bank| 419,558 | 11.89 | %| 211,730 | 6.00 | %| 299,951 | 8.50 | %| 282,307 | 8.00 | %  \nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)  \nConsolidated| 308,566 | 8.74 | %| 158,911 | 4.50 | %| 247,194 | 7.00 | %| 229,537 | 6.50 | %  \nWest Bank| 419,558 | 11.89 | %| 158,797 | 4.50 | %| 247,018 | 7.00 | %| 229,374 | 6.50 | %  \nTier 1 Capital (to Average Assets)  \nConsolidated| 328,566 | 8.50 | %| 154,628 | 4.00 | %| 154,628 | 4.00 | %| 193,285 | 5.00 | %  \nWest Bank| 419,558 | 10.86 | %| 154,571 | 4.00 | %| 154,571 | 4.00 | %| 193,213 | 5.00 | %  \n  \nThe Company and West Bank are subject to a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer that is added to the minimum requirements for capital adequacy purposes.

At September 30, 2024, the capital ratios for the Company and West Bank were sufficient to meet the conservation buffer.\n\n47\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThe Company’s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk arising from its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking. Interest rate risk refers to the exposure arising from changes in interest rates. Fluctuations in interest rates have a significant impact not only upon net income, but also upon the cash flows and market values of assets and liabilities. Our results of operations, like those of other financial institutions, are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Management continually develops and applies strategies to mitigate this risk. \n\nThe Company’s objectives are to manage interest rate risk to foster consistent growth of earnings and capital. It is our policy to maintain an acceptable level of interest rate risk over a range of possible changes in interest rates while remaining responsive to market demand for loan and deposit products. To measure that risk, the Company uses an earnings simulation approach. \n\nThe Company has an Asset Liability Committee which meets quarterly to review the interest rate sensitivity position and to review and develop various strategies for managing interest rate risk. Measuring and maintaining interest rate risk is a dynamic process that management performs with the objective of maximizing net interest margin while maintaining interest rate risk within acceptable tolerances. This process relies primarily on the simulation of net interest income over multiple interest rate scenarios. The Company engages a third party that utilizes a modeling program to measure the Company’s exposure to potential interest rate changes. For various assumed hypothetical changes in market interest rates, this analysis measures the estimated change in net interest income. The simulations allow for ongoing assessment of interest rate sensitivity and can include the impact of potential new business strategies. The modeled scenarios begin with a base case in which rates are unchanged and include parallel and nonparallel rate shocks. The model includes deposit beta assumptions which are estimates of changes in interest-bearing deposit pricing for a given change in market interest rates. The results of the rate shocks are measured in two forms: first, the impact on the net interest margin and earnings over one and two year time frames; and second, the impact on the market value of equity. The results of the simulation are compared against approved policy limits. \n\nThe following table presents the estimated change in net interest income over a one year time horizon under several scenarios of assumed interest rate changes for the rate shock levels shown. The changes in each interest rate scenario represents the difference between estimated net interest income in the unchanged interest rate scenario, or the base case, and the estimated net interest income in each of the alternative interest rate scenarios. The net interest income in each scenario is based on immediate parallel yield curve changes in the interest rates applied to a static balance sheet. This analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results.\n\nAt September 30, 2024  \n---  \nSensitivity of Net Interest Income Over One Year Horizon  \nChange in Interest Rates| $ Change| % Change  \n300 basis points rising| $(9,941)| (11.65)%  \n200 basis points rising| (6,583)| (7.71)  \n100 basis points rising| (3,480)| (4.08)  \n100 basis points falling| 3,303| 3.87  \n200 basis points falling| 5,427| 6.36  \n300 basis points falling| 6,536| 7.66  \n  \nComputations of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions. The assumptions used in our interest rate sensitivity simulation discussed above are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the simulations cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ from those projections set forth above due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and customer behavior. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions the Company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates. \n\n48\n\n[Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240930_HTM_ie30f5232c11840399c4954e669223056_7)\n\nItem 4.

The executive compensation program principles include pay for performance, a balanced mix of fixed and at-risk compensation and market-competitive pay opportunities. The target total direct compensation mix evidences a strong pay-for-performance culture with a significant amount of named executive officer pay at-risk. \n\n2023 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS\n\nElement| Base Salary| Annual Cash Incentives| Long-Term Equity Incentives  \n---|---|---|---  \nHighlights| •Fixed compensation set to be competitive within our industry.•Adjusted annually based on numerous factors, including scope of an executive officer’s responsibilities, demonstrated performance and relevant market data.•2023 increase was 14.8 percent for the CEO and 7.1-8.3 percent for the other NEOs.

No change was made to the target amount of cash bonus for the other NEOs, which is 40 percent of base salary.| •Award of time-based and performance-based RSUs that incentivize executives to deliver long-term value, while also providing a retention vehicle for our executives. •Grants for our NEOs were 50 percent performance-based and 50 percent time-based RSUs. •Time-based RSUs vest ratably over five years. •Performance-based RSUs cliff vest at the end of three years in accordance with the award performance criteria.   \n  \nCOMPENSATION PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS\n\nü| We pay for performance.  \n---|---  \nü| We align executives’ financial interests with stockholders’ interests whenever possible.  \nü| Our programs support the Company’s and West Bank’s values, strategy and development of employees.  \nü| Our compensation practices foster a team approach among named executive officers.  \nü| Our compensation practices help us attract and retain leaders capable of delivering superior business results.  \nü| We provide competitive cash and total compensation opportunities and benefits compared to peers.  \nü| We attempt to adhere to the highest legal and ethical standards.  \nü| All of the members of the Compensation Committee are independent.   \nü| Named executive officers are subject to share ownership and retention requirements.   \n  \n2023 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS\n\n$24,137| $1.44| $1.00| 11.42%| 60.73%| 0.01%  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nNet Income (in thousands)| Diluted Earnings Per Share| Dividends Per Share| Return On Average Equity| Efficiency Ratio|  Nonperforming Assets Ratio  \n  \nLike the rest of our industry, the Company experienced some significant net interest margin challenges in 2023.

Nelson is an executive officer of the Company and is not considered “independent.” Douglas R. Gulling, as a retired executive officer of the Company, and current non-executive employee of West Bank, is also not considered “independent.”\n\nThe Board held five regularly scheduled meetingsand one organizational meeting in 2023.

The Board currently intends to maintain the leadership structure of having a non-chief executive officer as Chair. The Board and its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believe that this structure will continue to be useful in providing consistent oversight and strategic direction to the Company. The Board expects Mr. Nelson to take the lead in developing strategic plans, providing day-to-day leadership and managing the performance of the Company. The Board expects the Chair to lead the Board meetings, participate in committee meetings and advise West Bank leadership. The Board intends to periodically review its leadership structure and make changes as dictated by the circumstances and the best interests of the stockholders.\n\nCOMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nThe following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2023, the standing committees of the Board, their membership and the number of times each met during 2023.\n\nCommittee| Audit | Compensation | Nominating and Corporate Governance | Risk Management and Information Technology   \n---|---|---|---|---  \n# of Meetings| 4| 3| 3| 4  \nMembers| Steven T.

The following criteria will be considered when evaluating nominee candidates, including candidates recommended by stockholders:\n\n(a) Composition \n\nThe Board should be composed of:\n\n1.Directors chosen with a view of bringing to the Board a variety of experiences and backgrounds;\n\n2.Directors who have a high level of managerial experience or are accustomed to dealing with complex challenges; and\n\n3.Directors who will represent the best interests of the stockholders as a whole rather than special interest groups or constituencies, while also taking into consideration the assessment of the overall composition and needs of the Board.\n\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also evaluates potential nominees to determine if they have any conflicts of interest that may interfere with their ability to serve as effective Board members, to determine if they meet the Company’s age eligibility requirements (a person who has attained or will attain age 73 on or before the date of the annual stockholders’ meeting is not eligible for election to the Board) and to determine whether they are “independent” in accordance with SEC rules and Nasdaq listing requirements.

We monitor developments in ESG matters and regularly review our policies, procedures and business practices in light of such developments. \n\nThe Board is committed to overseeing ESG. While ESG matters fall under the purview of each of the Board committees as it relates to their individual oversight responsibilities, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee undertakes formal responsibility for providing oversight of the Company’s commitment to ESG matters, including providing overall strategic direction on corporate responsibility and reporting. Setting the tone at the top with our Board and executive management, our Board and its committees have a key role in the oversight of our culture by holding executive management accountable for maintaining high ethical, legal and moral standards. \n\nWe recognize that understanding our ESG practices is important to our stockholders, customers and employees and have included some highlights below to share our ongoing commitments in these areas. \n\nFINANCIAL INCLUSION\n\nWest Bank has received the highest available rating, “Outstanding,” during its most recent Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) in 2023. The regulatory examination reviews how we meet the credit needs of our communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, CRA qualified lending, corporate giving and investing and employee volunteering. West Bank’s community development lending to developers, nonprofit entities and municipalities benefits communities through services to individuals, job creation, stabilization, economic development and affordable housing.

Our goal is to foster a culture in which those differences are valued and respected. Our team is made up of 181 full-time employees and nine part-time employees. We are proud of our culturally and gender diverse workforce, with approximately 14 percent identifying as persons of color and approximately 59 percent as female. Our approach also promotes longevity in our workforce. The average tenure of our employees is over eight years. Approximately 19 percent have been with West Bank for 10-15 years and approximately 21 percent have been with West Bank for over 15 years. Non-teller turnover was approximately 10 percent in 2023, compared to 11 percent in 2022.\n\nWe conduct periodic company-wide employee engagement surveys to assess employee satisfaction and engagement. Our most recent survey was conducted in 2023, which provided us with valuable feedback regarding West Bank’s current culture and employee satisfaction and engagement. Results of the survey, including the valuable employee comments, were reviewed by the executive team and management. Strategies were developed to address topics of noted recurrence, particularly in the areas of consistent communication and management openness to staff initiatives and suggestions. Positive comments concerning relationship building, customer service, commitment to the community, and appreciation for the workplace amenities that will be available at our new headquarters building demonstrated our outstanding team members are dedicated to company values and aligned with company leadership. \n\nWe have adopted a Social Responsibility Statement that includes a written Diversity, Equity and Inclusion statement as well as a Human Rights Policy Statement that apply to all directors, officers and employees. These statements may be viewed on the Investor Relations — Overview — Corporate Governance section of the Company’s website (www.westbankstrong.com). \n\nENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nThe Board carefully considers corporate social responsibility when it works with management to determine the Company’s strategic priorities and plans to achieve such priorities. We strive to be a good corporate citizen by conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner, by operating as an employer that is committed to our vibrant and diverse workforce and by maintaining strong ties to the communities in which our customers live, work and do business. \n\nWe have adopted an Environmental Policy Statement, which may be viewed on the Investor Relations — Overview — Corporate Governance section of the Company’s website (www.westbankstrong.com). \n\nSTRENGTHENING COMMUNITIES \n\nWe serve the communities in which we operate through economic development activities, charitable giving and volunteerism by our employees.

(the “Foundation”) to more than 225 community organizations. The Foundation is the charitable foundation affiliate of the Company which awards grants to organizations focused on human services, arts and culture, and education. \n\nWe encourage and support volunteer efforts of our employees who volunteer, serve on boards and provide educational and networking opportunities. In 2023, our employees volunteered over 8,000 hours of community service. This commitment and investment in the communities we serve are foundational to our success. \n\n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 18\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nSTOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT \n\nAs part of our commitment to effective corporate governance and to help us understand the views of our investors, in 2023 as we have in the past years, we directly engaged with stockholders at our Annual Meeting, as well as with direct investor calls, quarterly earnings presentations, information posted to our website and quarterly earnings calls. \n\nWe’ve found that the feedback received during this outreach process, even if the feedback is that investors have no need to meet for further discussion, is constructive and insightful, providing us with an important perspective on our investment stewardship. In 2023, we reached out to ten of the Company’s largest institutional stockholders who collectively own or control approximately 38 percent of our outstanding shares. Six of these stockholders responded that additional targeted engagement was not needed at this time and the remainder did not respond to our invitation to meet. \n\nNOMINATING AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE REPORT\n\nDuring 2023, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviewed the composition of the existing Board, giving specific attention to the questions of the ideal size of the Board and how many insiders should be permitted on the Board. The Board has a policy that no Board member should be nominated for election to the Board who has attained or will attain the age of 73 years on or before the date of the forthcoming annual stockholders’ meeting and election of directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determined that it was in the best interests of the stockholders to continue the model of having only one current member of management, the CEO, on the Board in order to clearly differentiate the roles of the Board and management. The Board added the position of Vice-Chair in April 2023. \n\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also evaluated the qualifications and performance of each of the current members of the Board. In its evaluation, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee compared each of the current directors to the qualifications and characteristics of a director set forth in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee’s charter. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee then polled each director eligible to stand for re-election to determine his or her willingness to stand for re-election and determined that each director is willing to continue service. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee did not receive any stockholder recommendations for director nominees for the Annual Meeting. No third party was retained, in any capacity, to provide assistance in either identifying or evaluating potential director nominees for the Annual Meeting.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommended to the Board that Patrick J. Donovan, Lisa J. Elming, Steven K. Gaer, Douglas R. Gulling, Sean P. McMurray, George D. Milligan, David D. Nelson, James W. Noyce, Rosemary Parson, Steven T. Schuler, Therese M. Vaughan and Philip Jason Worth should be nominated for re-election to the Board at the Annual Meeting. The Board accepted these recommendations.\n\nDuring 2023, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviewed its charter and recommended no changes to the Board. \n\nThe undersigned members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee have submitted this report.\n\nGeorge D.

We offer competitive commercial and personal banking products and are committed to providing superior customer services. We place a high priority on community service and are actively involved with many civic and community projects in the communities where we conduct business. We operate in an intensely competitive and uncertain business environment. Not only do we compete with numerous companies in our markets for customers, but we also compete with many different types and sizes of organizations for senior leadership capable of executing our business strategies. Among other challenges, our business model requires experienced leaders with banking and operational expertise who are capable of taking on high levels of personal responsibility in an ever-evolving banking industry and economy. \n\n$24,137| $1.44| $1.00| 11.42%| 60.73%| 0.01%  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nNet Income (in thousands)| Diluted Earnings Per Share| Dividends Per Share| Return On Average Equity| Efficiency Ratio|  Nonperforming Assets Ratio  \n  \n•Net income of $24.1 million for 2023 compared to $46.4 million for 2022.\n\n•Diluted earnings per share of $1.44 for 2023 compared to $2.76 for 2022.\n\n•Dividends were $1.00 per share for both 2023 and 2022.\n\n•Return on average equity of 11.42 percent compared to 20.71 percent for 2022.\n\n•Efficiency ratio of 60.73 percent compared to 43.70 percent for 2022.\n\n•Total loans increased $184.7 million or 6.7 percent. \n\n•Nonperforming assets ratio remained stable from 2022. \n\nLike the rest of our industry, the Company experienced some significant margin challenges in 2023. The interest rate environment, including dramatic increases in short-term rates, an ongoing inverted yield curve and aggressive deposit competition had a significant impact on our cost of funds, net interest margin and overall net income. Our credit quality remains pristine. We had no loans greater than 30 days past due, and only one classified loan for $296 thousand at December 31, 2023. \n\n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 26\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nOVERVIEW AND OBJECTIVES OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS\n\nThe Company and West Bank share an executive management team. The members of the executive management team, consisting of our NEOs, are compensated by West Bank rather than the Company. Compensation of our NEOs is determined by the Company’s Compensation Committee based on their performance and roles for both the Company and West Bank.\n\nThe goal of our compensation program is to create superior long-term value for our stockholders by attracting, motivating and retaining outstanding employees who serve our customers while generating financial performance that is consistently better than that of our peers. Accordingly, our compensation program for executives is guided by our business needs and challenges in creating stockholder value. To support the achievement of our business strategies and goals, we strive to:\n\n•Pay for performance; \n\n•Align executives’ financial interests with those of our stockholders;\n\n•Support the Company’s and West Bank’s values, strategy and development of employees;\n\n•Foster a team approach among top executives;\n\n•Attract and retain leaders capable of delivering strong business results;\n\n•Provide competitive cash and total compensation opportunities and benefits;\n\n•Balance the mix of short-term and long-term incentives; and \n\n•Adhere to the highest legal and ethical standards.\n\nOur executive compensation program is designed to attract, retain and motivate qualified and talented executives to achieve our business goals and to reward them for strong short- and long-term performance. In particular, our Compensation Committee is mindful that our “pay-for-performance” philosophy must align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders in order to drive long-term, sustainable stockholder value growth. A significant amount of NEO compensation is considered at-risk, made up of annual cash and long-term equity incentive opportunities. The primary elements of our executive compensation program in 2023 consisted of base salary, annual cash incentive opportunities and long-term equity opportunities. The purpose and key features of each element are described below.\n\nAt Risk  \n---  \nElement| Base Salary| Annual Cash Incentive Opportunities| Long-Term Equity Incentive Opportunities  \nHighlights| Fixed compensation paid in cash. Adjusted annually based on position, responsibilities, demonstrated performance and relevant market data. | Annual cash bonus opportunities are based on Company financial performance. |  50 percent of RSUs awarded are subject to time-based vesting and 50 percent are subject to performance-based vesting.   \nWhy We Pay this Element| Attract and retain talented executives by providing competitive pay.| Motivate and reward executives for the achievement of certain financial goals relative to peer performance. | Incentivize executives to deliver long-term value, while also providing a retention vehicle for our executives.  \n2023 Decisions| Increases ranged from 7.1% to 14.8%| Annual bonuses were paid out at 62.9 percent of base salary for the CEO and 42.9 percent of base salary for each non-CEO NEO. | CEO was awarded 8,500 time-based RSUs and 8,500 performance-based RSUs. Non-CEO NEOs were awarded 7,500 time-based RSUs and 7,500 performance-based RSUs.   \n  \n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 27\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nBASE SALARY\n\n•Base salaries are set to be competitive within our industry and are important in attracting talented executives. \n\n•Base salaries are adjusted annually, effective January 1, but can be adjusted mid-year when there are material changes, such as a change in an executive officer’s position, responsibilities, demonstrated performance, or relevant market data.\n\n•The CEO’s base salary increased in 2023 to more closely align it with the peer group median data provided by our compensation consultants and to differentiate the CEOs compensation from that of the other NEOs.\n\n•Base salaries for our NEOs are as follows:\n\nName| Base Salary 2022| Base Salary 2023| Percent Change 2023  \n---|---|---|---  \nDavid D.

Peters| 300,000 | 325,000 | 8.3 | %  \n  \nANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES\n\n•Annual cash incentive opportunities are intended to motivate and reward executives for the achievement of certain financial goals in comparison to internal and external standards.\n\n•Annual cash incentive opportunities are based on a percentage of base salary and that percentage is based on: (1) the Company’s net profit; and (2) the Company’s performance relative to our peer group based on return on average equity, efficiency ratio and nonperforming assets ratio, equally weighted, according to the following schedules. \n\nThe performance targets, peer rankings and percent of the salary for the CEO was changed to the\n\nfollowing for 2023. Prior to 2023, the CEOs percent of salary was the same as the non-CEO \n\nNEOs. The CEO’s percent of salary increased in 2023 to more closely align total cash compensation \n\nwith the peer group median and differentiate the CEO’s compensation from that of the other NEOs.\n\nPerformance| Peer Rating| Percent of Salary  \n---|---|---  \nMaximum| At/above 75th percentile| 80%  \nTarget| 50th percentile| 60%  \nThreshold| 25th percentile| 40%  \nBelow 25th percentile| 0%  \n  \nThe performance targets, peer rankings and percent of salaries remains the same as the prior year for \n\nnon-CEO NEOs as follows:\n\nPerformance| Peer Rating| Percent of Salary  \n---|---|---  \nMaximum| At/above 75th percentile| 60%  \nTarget| 50th percentile| 40%  \nThreshold| 25th percentile| 20%  \nBelow 25th percentile| 0%  \n  \n•If our ranking in the peer group falls between threshold and maximum level performance, our NEOs will be eligible for a proportional cash bonus based upon linear interpolation.\n\n•The nonperforming assets ratio performance metric is measured by comparing the average of the four fiscal quarter-ending ratios of the Company to the average of the four fiscal quarter-ending ratios of the peer group. \n\n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 28\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nLONG-TERM EQUITY INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES\n\n•Long-term equity awards incentivize executives to deliver long-term value, while also providing a retention vehicle for our executives. \n\n•50 percent of the NEO’s restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards are subject to performance-based vesting and 50 percent are subject to time-based vesting. Following the date of vesting, 50 percent of the covered shares will be subject to a three-year holding period requirement. The Compensation Committee expects future awards to have a similar structure. \n\n•The time-based RSUs (the “Time RSUs”) vest ratably over five years. The performance-based RSUs (the “Performance RSUs”) cliff vest at the end of a three-year performance period based on the Company’s relative performance to the identified peer group with respect to its return on average equity, efficiency ratio and nonperforming assets ratio, with each equally weighted. \n\n•The total number of RSUs granted to Mr. Nelson in 2023 was 17,000, an increase from 15,000 from the prior year. 8,500 are Time RSUs and 8,500 are Performance RSUs. \n\n•The total number of RSUs granted to Messrs. Olafson, and Winterbottom in 2023 was 15,000 each, the same as the prior year. The total number of RSUs granted to Ms. Funk and Mr. Peters in 2023 was also 15,000 each, an increase from 12,000 from the prior year. In each case for 2023, 7,500 are Time RSUs and 7,500 are Performance RSUs. \n\n•RSUs granted to our NEOs do not pay or accrue dividends, or dividend equivalents, during the applicable vesting periods. \n\nTARGET PAY MIX\n\nConsistent with our philosophy of aligning executive pay with the short- and long-term performance of the Company, the elements of our executive compensation program evolve and are adjusted over time to support the business goals of the Company and West Bank, and to align the interests of executive management with the interests of our stockholders. As demonstrated in the following chart, we compensate our NEOs with a mix of fixed and variable short- and long-term pay elements, with a significant amount of performance-based and at-risk compensation. Target pay mix includes 2023 salary, 2023 annual cash incentive target, and grant date fair value of performance based equity incentive target and time based equity awards granted in 2023. \n\n![9476](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g20.jpg)\n\nOUR COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND BEST PRACTICES\n\nOur pay-for-performance philosophy and compensation practices provide an appropriate risk-managed framework in which our executives are encouraged to achieve our strategic goals without excessive risk taking in their business decisions. We adhere to several best practices for executive compensation, including:\n\nWhat We Do| What We Do Not Do  \n---|---  \nü Strong emphasis on pay for performance| ü No perquisites for executives  \nü Maintain rigorous stock ownership guidelines| ü No golden parachute tax gross-ups  \nü Engage independent compensation consultants| ü No hedging or pledging of Company stock  \nü Annual outreach with our institutional stockholders| ü No dividends paid or accumulated on unvested RSUs  \nü Annual say-on-pay voteü Clawback policy for incentive compensation| ü No single-trigger cash or equity payments in the event of a change in control  \nü 50 percent performance-based equity awards for NEOs  \nü 3-year holding period on vested RSUs  \nü Compensation Committee must be independent  \nü Deferred compensation program participation option  \n  \n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 29\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nPut simply, our human resource philosophy is to have fewer people than our peers but to pay our people well for their performance. Our business model allows us to operate with fewer employees than the typical commercial bank of our size because we emphasize teamwork and sound practices and focus on business banking. Because we have fewer people, we need to have the right people and ensure that we offer what we consider to be above average pay in exchange for above average performance. In addition to attracting and retaining what we believe is superior talent, our approach also produces longevity in our workforce. The average tenure of our employees is over eight years.\n\nThis philosophy extends throughout the Company and includes our NEOs. The Company currently has five executive officers. To succeed with an atypically small team, our CEO leads and fosters a team approach with the non-CEO members of our executive management team who bring a diverse array of experience, expertise and backgrounds. Because of this team strategy, compensation for each of our non-CEO NEOs is historically similar. This approach has consistently proven to produce a winning teamwork structure for the Company and our stockholders. Over 96 percent of our stockholder votes were in favor of our executive compensation program for 2022 at our 2023 annual meeting of our stockholders. The Compensation Committee balances stockholder feedback with the Company’s performance and recommendations from our compensation consultant and CEO when determining executive compensation decisions and policies.\n\nWe also believe in evaluating performance relative to our peer group and implementing performance considerations into our compensation decisions. Rather than setting absolute goals that can be manipulated and may lead to inappropriate risk taking, we emphasize sound behaviors that will lead to long-term success that is better than our peers. For example, we encourage growth by requiring that our bankers focus on relationship building by continuously setting appointments for sales calls and staying in regular contact with our customers. This has proven successful, and we have experienced consistent growth without engaging in business acquisitions. \n\nWe do not set absolute growth goals of attaining a certain asset size by a certain time. Instead, we focus on relative metrics such as credit quality, which we believe is more important than the growth of the loan portfolio. We also look at return on average equity and efficiency ratio metrics, each on a relative basis to those of our peer group. We believe that our emphasis on attracting, retaining and appropriately motivating a well-compensated team of superior talent, facilitating strong working relationships in that team and evaluating performance appropriately has produced our consistently strong financial results. The Compensation Committee remains committed to continuing our practice of incentivizing and encouraging the pursuit of excellence through our executive compensation program. \n\nOUR COMPENSATION REVIEW PROCESS\n\nROLE OF COMPENSATION COMMITTEE\n\nOur Compensation Committee is composed entirely of independent directors. It is fully responsible for our executive compensation program and reviews the program on at least an annual basis. The Compensation Committee has broad discretion when overseeing and reviewing each element of compensation. When reviewing compensation and making compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee considers the respective responsibilities of each NEO, their performance and experience and also competitive compensation levels based on information and data provided by our independent compensation consultant. In setting compensation levels and incentive goals, the Compensation Committee also reviews our financial results relative to our peer group, and it structures our compensation programs taking into account sound risk management and industry best practices.\n\nThe Compensation Committee’s primary considerations for executive compensation decisions are:\n\n•Key financial measurements;\n\n•Strategic initiatives related to our business; \n\n•Compensation of peer group executives; and\n\n•Proper risk management.\n\nROLE OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN COMPENSATION DECISIONS\n\nAs requested by the Compensation Committee, some members of management support the Compensation Committee’s review and consideration of executive compensation by providing information for the Compensation Committee’s review. In particular, the CEO provides recommendations with respect to the other NEOs. Such recommendations from the CEO address, among other items, financial results and analysis, performance evaluations, compensation provided to our NEOs (other than the CEO), technical and regulatory considerations and input on program design and possible modifications. \n\n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 30\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nThe Compensation Committee has final discretion over all compensation decisions regarding the CEO and each of the other NEOs. The Compensation Committee discusses the CEO’s recommendations and accepts or adjusts them based upon its own assessment of Company strategic goals, executive responsibilities, internal pay equity and its independent review of market data. The CEO is not involved in discussions or determinations relating to his own compensation, and the executive officers are not present during the Compensation Committee’s final discussion and determination of the types and amounts of compensation to be paid.\n\nROLE OF COMPENSATION CONSULTANT\n\nUnder its charter, the Compensation Committee has the sole authority to select, retain or replace compensation advisors. The Compensation Committee has historically engaged a compensation consultant to provide independent, objective analyses and professional opinions about executive and director compensation matters. The Compensation Committee believes that working with an independent compensation consultant furthers the Company’s objectives to recruit and retain qualified executives, aids the Compensation Committee in aligning executives’ interests with those of our stockholders and ensures that our executive compensation program appropriately motivates and rewards ongoing achievement of business goals. \n\nThe Compensation Committee engaged McLagan, a highly specialized, industry-focused team within Aon PLC’s Human Capital Solutions business, as its independent compensation consultant in 2023. McLagan reports directly to the Chair of the Compensation Committee. McLagan provides input on marketplace trends and best practices relating to competitive pay levels, as well as developments in regulatory and technical matters, assists the Company in preparing this proxy statement, and otherwise provides no other services to the Company.\n\nThe Compensation Committee reviewed McLagan’s independence as contemplated by the Compensation Committee’s charter and applicable Nasdaq rules and determined that there were no conflicts of interest and that McLagan is independent from the Company, the Compensation Committee members and our executive officers. McLagan was engaged to:\n\n•Provide a study of director and executive officer compensation;\n\n•Provide input on marketplace trends and best practices relating to competitive pay levels;\n\n•Provide analysis and commentary on regulatory developments; \n\n•Provide proxy statement support; and\n\n•Provide technical support with regard to calculations for RSU usage and expense considerations. \n\nUSE OF PEER GROUP\n\nMarket pay practices are one of many factors we consider in setting executive pay levels and designing compensation programs. The Compensation Committee uses our compensation peer group as one data point when setting executive pay packages. Although useful as a reference, the Compensation Committee does not target any particular percentile or range within this peer group as a specific objective. Instead, our compensation decisions are based on the full consideration of many factors, including, but not limited to, individual and Company performance, market data, internal equity, experience, strategic needs and responsibilities.\n\nFor compensation decisions for fiscal year 2023, the following 22 companies were selected as our peer group, as recommended by McLagan. The peer group was selected based on asset size ($1.75 billion to $7 billion based on 2021 fiscal year end assets), geographic considerations and business model. Three new companies were added to the peer group for 2023: HBT Financial, Inc., Bridgewater Bancshares, Inc., and ChoiceOne Financial Services, Inc. There are no changes to the peer group for compensation decisions for fiscal year 2024.\n\n2023 Peer Group  \n---  \nBank First Corporation| Farmers & Merchants Bancorp| LCNB Corp.  \nBridgewater Bancshares, Inc. | First Business Financial Services, Inc.| Macatawa Bank Corporation  \nChoiceOne Financial Services, Inc.| First Financial Corp. | Mercantile Bank Corporation  \nCivista Bancshares, Inc.| First Mid Bancshares, Inc.| MidWestOne Financial Group, Inc.  \nCrossFirst Bankshares, Inc.| German American Bancorp, Inc.| Nicolet Bankshares, Inc.  \nEquity Bancshares, Inc.| HBT Financial, Inc.| Peoples Bancorp, Inc.  \nFarmers National Banc Corp.| Hills Bancorporation| Southern Missouri Bancorp, Inc.  \nIsabella Bank Corporation  \n  \n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 31\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION\n\nOur executive compensation program consists of several elements, each with a distinct objective that helps our overall program provide an integrated and competitive total pay package. The following overview explains the structure and rationale of the elements in our executive compensation program for 2023. The principal elements consist of base salary, annual cash incentive opportunities and long-term equity incentive opportunities, each of which is provided pursuant to the terms of an employment agreement between the Company and each NEO. A discussion of the terms of these agreements is contained in this proxy statement under the heading “Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control.” \n\nBASE SALARY\n\nWe compensate our NEOs with annual base salaries to provide a reasonable level of fixed income relative to their respective levels of responsibility. We want our base salaries to be competitive and commensurate with each NEO’s experience and knowledge. As provided in our employment agreements with the NEOs, base salaries are established and eligible for review and possible upward adjustment on an annual basis. \n\nANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES\n\nAnnual cash incentive opportunities are an important element of total compensation for our NEOs. By tying a meaningful portion of cash compensation to achievement of objectively measured financial results for the year, annual cash bonus opportunities support and encourage the achievement of the Company’s business goals and strategies and lead to increased value for our stockholders. \n\nOur executive employment agreements provide for participation in the Company’s annual incentive plan. Thereunder, each NEO is eligible for a cash bonus as a percentage of his or her annual base salary, based upon the achievement of performance measures described below. Our plan caps maximum bonus opportunities to avoid encouraging excessive risk-taking and to avoid any focus on maximizing short-term results at the expense of long-term soundness. The plan also requires positive Company earnings in order for any bonuses to be paid. \n\nThe amount of any annual bonus actually earned is determined based upon quantitative and qualitative analyses of Company performance completed by the Compensation Committee. The quantitative analysis examines the Company’s performance relative to our peer group with respect to three key financial measures. The qualitative analysis considers any items deemed relevant by the Compensation Committee, including, for example, regulatory actions, if any, and Company profitability and credit quality. Based on the qualitative analysis, the Compensation Committee may increase or decrease the bonus amounts indicated from the quantitative peer group comparison. The calculation and adjustment of bonuses rest within the Compensation Committee’s sole discretion, and its determinations about bonuses are final. \n\nThe quantitative analysis has two parts:\n\n(1)the Company’s net profit; and\n\n(2)the Company’s performance relative to our peer group, based on three key metrics (equally weighted):\n\na.return on average equity;\n\nb.efficiency ratio; and\n\nc.nonperforming assets to total assets ratio.\n\nEach ratio is defined in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, as filed with the SEC. The Compensation Committee selected these measures because they encompass important aspects of our financial performance: earnings, capital levels, expense control and asset quality. The nonperforming assets to total assets ratio performance metric is measured by comparing the average of the four fiscal quarter-ending ratios of the Company to the average of the four fiscal quarter-ending ratios of the peer group. \n\n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 32\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nBased on our ranking among our peers in each of these key metrics, our CEO is eligible for a cash bonus payment for 2023 performance equal to a percentage of salary, according to the following schedule. Prior to 2023, the CEO was eligible for a cash bonus payment equal to the same percentage of salary as the non-CEO NEOs. The CEO’s percent of salary increased in 2023 to more closely align total cash compensation with the peer group median and differentiate the CEO’s compensation from that of the other NEOs.\n\nPerformance| Peer Rating| Percent of Salary  \n---|---|---  \nMaximum| At/above 75th percentile| 80%  \nTarget| 50th percentile| 60%  \nThreshold| 25th percentile| 40%  \nBelow 25th percentile| 0%  \n  \nBased on our ranking among our peers in each of these key metrics, our non-CEO NEOs are eligible for a cash bonus payment equal to a percentage of salary, according to the following schedule, which remains unchanged from the prior year.\n\nPerformance| Peer Rating| Percent of Salary  \n---|---|---  \nMaximum| At/above 75th percentile| 60%  \nTarget| 50th percentile| 40%  \nThreshold| 25th percentile| 20%  \nBelow 25th percentile| 0%  \n  \nFor 2023, based upon our results and the results of our peers for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, actual annual incentive cash bonuses were 62.9 percent of base salary for the CEO and 42.9 percent of base salary for each of the non-CEO NEOs. Our rankings among our peer group were between the threshold and target performance ratings for both the return on average equity and efficiency ratio metrics, and above the maximum performance rating for the nonperforming assets to total assets ratio metric.\n\nLONG-TERM EQUITY INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES\n\nEquity compensation is the third primary element of compensation for our NEOs. The purpose of annual equity grants is to provide long-term incentives that align with stockholder interests, tie pay to performance, provide a long-term planning horizon, mitigate adverse risk taking and attract and retain key employees.\n\nThe employment agreements with our NEOs generally provide for participation in the Company’s equity incentive plan then in effect. Equity awards made prior to April 2021 were made under our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2017 Equity Plan”), which was adopted by our Board and approved by our stockholders in 2017. In April 2021, our stockholders approved the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (“2021 Equity Plan”) and upon such approval the 2017 Equity Plan was frozen with respect to future grants. The 2021 Equity Plan was designed to promote the Company’s long-term financial success by providing a means to attract, retain and reward individuals who can and do contribute to such success and to further align their interests with those of the Company’s stockholders. Awards vest, become exercisable and contain such other terms and conditions as determined by the Compensation Committee and set forth in individual agreements with the participants receiving the awards. As of December 31, 2023, there were 266,963 remaining shares available for issuance under the 2021 Equity Plan. If the Company’s stockholders approve Proposal 4, the 2021 Equity Plan will be amended to add an additional 550,000 shares for issuance, which will bring the 2021 Equity Plan’s total share reserve to 1,175,000 shares. The RSU awards granted to our NEOs in 2023 were made under the 2021 Equity Plan. \n\nPursuant to the terms of the 2017 Equity Plan and 2021 Equity Plan, and the award agreements governing the terms of the awards thereunder, unvested awards are forfeited upon early termination, other than a termination in connection with a change in control or due to the NEO’s death, disability or retirement. Outstanding RSUs do not pay or accumulate dividend equivalents during the applicable vesting periods. In addition, the award agreements contain standard confidentiality and non-solicitation covenants for periods following termination of employment. Accordingly, the structure of our equity awards provides a retention incentive and provides important protections for the Company and our stockholders.\n\nIn February 2023, the CEO was granted 8,500 Time RSUs and 8,500 Performance RSUs and the non-CEO NEOs were each granted 7,500 Time RSUs and 7,500 Performance RSUs. Each of the awards will be subject to a holding period such that 50 percent of the covered shares must be retained for a period of three years following the vesting date. The Time RSUs are scheduled to vest in five equal annual installments, on March 25 of 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028.\n\n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 33\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nThe Performance RSUs are scheduled to vest on March 25, 2026, based on the relative financial performance of the Company to the identified peer group during a three-year performance period consisting of the Company’s 2023, 2024 and 2025 fiscal years (the “Performance Period”). The Performance RSUs are subject to three performance targets, each of which is to be weighted equally, and (i) with respect to ROE, calculated as an average of each of the three year-end results; (ii) with respect to efficiency ratio calculated as an average of each of the three year-end results; and (iii) with respect to nonperforming assets to total assets ratio, calculated as an average of each of the twelve quarterly results. Each of these ratios is compared to those of the companies in the S&P U.S. Small Cap Banks Index (“Performance RSU Peer Group”) as of the grant date. The Performance RSU Peer Group is “frozen” as of the grant date. Companies may drop out (but may not be added) if financial information becomes unavailable prior to the conclusion of the Performance Period.\n\nThese three measures are commonly utilized by banking organizations as reflective of important aspects of their overall financial performance. For the Performance Period, the maximum number of shares of 8,500 for the CEO and of 7,500 for each non-CEO NEOs would be issued on March 25, 2026 for each of the participants if the Company achieves the 75th percentile performance on all three performance measures over the Performance Period. Up to one-third of the maximum number of RSUs subject to the award may be earned for achievement of a given performance metric. None of the Performance RSUs subject to a metric will be earned if performance is below threshold level, while approximately 33 percent will be earned for threshold level performance, approximately 67 percent will be earned for target level performance, and 100 percent will be earned for maximum level performance (or above). Performance between the threshold and maximum levels will earn a number of RSUs based on linear interpolation. \n\nPerformance Criteria and Goals for Performance RSUs  \n---  \nPerformance Measure| Performance RSUs Subject to Performance Measure| Threshold Goal| Target Goal| Maximum Goal  \nReturn on Average Equity| 1/3 of RSUs| 25th Percentile| 50th Percentile| 75th Percentile  \nEfficiency Ratio| 1/3 of RSUs| 25th Percentile| 50th Percentile| 75th Percentile  \nNonperforming Assets to Total Assets Ratio| 1/3 of RSUs| 25th Percentile| 50th Percentile| 75th Percentile  \n  \nPerformance RSU Award Opportunities(as approximate percentage of maximum number of Performance RSUs subject to the performance measure)  \n---  \nReturn on Average Equity(1/3 of Performance RSUs)| Efficiency Ratio (1/3 of Performance RSUs)|  Nonperforming Assets to Total Assets Ratio (1/3 of Performance RSUs)  \nThreshold| 33%| 33%| 33%  \nTarget| 67%| 67%| 67%  \nMaximum| 100%| 100%| 100%  \n  \nUpon the conclusion of the Performance Period, the performance of the Company and each member of the Performance RSU Peer Group will be calculated for each of the three metrics identified above, (i) with respect to ROE, as an average of each of the three year-end results; (ii) with respect to efficiency ratio, as an average of each of the three year-end results; and (iii) with respect to nonperforming assets to total assets ratio, as an average of each of the twelve quarterly results. Based upon such calculations, the Company’s percentile relative to the peer group will be determined. The Compensation Committee expects future awards to NEOs to have a similar structure. \n\nFor performance periods prior to 2022, the Company utilized the Texas ratio as a performance criterion for annual bonus calculations and Performance RSU vesting. The Texas ratio was replaced with the nonperforming assets to total assets ratio for the 2022 and 2023 Performance RSU grants. While this new criterion also addresses an important qualitative measure of the Company’s assets, it is more commonly reported by the Company’s peer group members than the Texas ratio. The Compensation Committee expects future bonus and Performance RSU grants to include the nonperforming assets to total assets ratio. \n\n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 34\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nDEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN\n\nOur NEOs are eligible to participate in the West Bancorporation, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”). The Deferred Compensation Plan was adopted effective January 1, 2013, to provide key individuals, including our non-employee directors and the NEOs, with additional deferral opportunities in planning for retirement. The Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan that provides an opportunity for eligible participants to voluntarily defer receipt of a portion of their cash compensation. Though permitted under the plan document, the Company has not made any matching or discretionary Company contributions into the Deferred Compensation Plan on behalf of any of our NEOs. Pursuant to the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan, the Compensation Committee has set the crediting rate equal to the prime rate, adjusted each January 1, on any amounts voluntarily deferred by plan participants. The crediting rate utilized under the plan is notionally based upon the prime rate as of the first business day of the year and was 7.50 percent for 2023 and 8.50 percent for 2024. Our CEO and two other NEOs currently participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan. None of our non-employee directors are currently participating in the Deferred Compensation Plan. \n\n2024 COMPENSATION DECISIONS\n\nThe Compensation Committee has approved no changes to NEO compensation for 2024. Base salary for the CEO will remain the same at $590,000. Messrs. Olafson and Winterbottom will each continue to receive the same base salary of $375,000, and Ms. Funk and Mr. Peters will each continue to receive the same base salary of $325,000. The annual cash incentive opportunities will also remain unchanged in 2024. The CEO’s long-term equity award remains the same at 8,500 Performance RSUs and 8,500 Time RSUs. The non-CEO NEOs’ long-term equity award remains the same at 7,500 Performance RSUs and 7,500 Time RSUs. \n\nEMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS\n\nThe Company has employment agreements with certain of its executives, including each NEO, that provide the NEOs with certain severance benefits, as described in this proxy statement under the heading “Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control.” The Compensation Committee believes these severance benefits reflect market levels of benefits when they were negotiated and represent fair and appropriate consideration for the executive’s agreement to the post-termination restrictive covenants. The Company believes that the protections afforded by the agreements are a valuable incentive for attracting and retaining top executives. The Company also believes that in the event of an extraordinary corporate transaction, the agreements could prove important to the Company’s ability to retain top management through the transaction process and to provide motivation to the executives to act in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders before, during and after the transaction. \n\nPERQUISITES, RETIREMENT AND OTHER BENEFITS\n\nAs a best practice, we have generally avoided the use of perquisites and other types of benefits for executives, emphasizing instead compensation tied to performance. In 2023, none of the NEOs received any perquisites. Our NEOs participate in our broad-based employee benefit programs, such as medical, dental, disability and life insurance coverage, on the same terms as other eligible employees. \n\nOur NEOs are also eligible to participate in our 401(k) retirement plan on the same terms as other eligible employees. During 2023, the Company made a 100 percent Company matching contribution for participant deferrals into the 401(k) retirement plan, up to a maximum of six percent of a participant’s pay. In addition, for 2023, the Company made an additional discretionary Company contribution into the 401(k) retirement plan of two percent of a participant’s pay. The Company’s contributions, in each case, were subject to applicable IRS limitations.\n\n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 35\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nAll employees of West Bank, including our NEOs, are eligible to receive a discretionary annual holiday bonus paid as a percentage of annual salary. Our NEOs participate in the holiday bonus program on the same terms as our other employees. In 2023, as in prior years, this discretionary bonus was equal to two percent of base salary.\n\nNEOs| Vice Presidents and Above| Full-Time Employees  \n---|---|---  \nHealth Plans  \nLife and Disability Insurance| X| X| X  \nMedical/Dental/Vision Plans| X| X| X  \nRetirement Plans  \n401(k) Plan/Profit Sharing| X| X| X  \nDeferred Compensation Plan| X| As Determined by Compensation Committee| Not Offered  \nOther  \nCountry Club Membership| Not Offered| As Duties Require| Not Offered  \nHoliday Bonus| X| X| X  \n  \nREGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS\n\nAs a publicly traded financial institution, the Company must comply with multiple layers of regulations when considering and implementing compensation decisions. Although these regulations do not set specific parameters within which compensation decisions must be made, they do require that the Company and the Compensation Committee be mindful of the risks associated with compensation programs designed to incentivize superior performance. \n\nUnder the FDIC’s 2015 Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness (the “Safety and Soundness Standards”), excessive compensation is prohibited as an unsafe and unsound practice. When determining whether compensation is excessive, the FDIC has directed financial institutions to consider whether aggregate cash amounts paid or non-cash benefits provided to an employee are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services the employee performs. The Safety and Soundness Standards set forth a framework within which financial institutions should evaluate an employee’s compensation, with factors including compensation history, internal pay equity and, if appropriate, comparable compensation practices at peer institutions. This framework also requires the Company to consider its overall financial condition.\n\nSeparately, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision, together, issued the Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies, (the “Joint Guidance”) in 2010. The Joint Guidance complements the Safety and Soundness Standards and establishes a framework within which financial institutions must assess the soundness of their incentive compensation plans, programs and arrangements. Because the Joint Guidance is limited to senior executive officers and those other individuals who, either alone or as a group, could pose a material risk to the financial institution, it is somewhat narrower in scope than the Safety and Soundness Standards. With respect to those individuals to which it applies, the Joint Guidance aims to ensure that any available incentive compensation arrangements appropriately balance risk and reward, are compatible with effective controls and risk management and have the support of strong corporate governance.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, proposed rules under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) that intend to implement further risk assessment guidelines and procedures may eventually be finalized by the financial institution regulatory agencies and the SEC. It is likely the Company will be subject to those further guidelines and procedures if and when they become finalized and effective. During 2011, the regulatory agencies issued initial proposed guidance with respect to the Dodd-Frank Act risk assessment guidelines and procedures, and they revised and re-proposed this guidance in 2016. In large part, any guidance under the Dodd-Frank Act would likely restate and codify the frameworks presently set forth in the Safety and Soundness Standards and the Joint Guidance.\n\nThe Company is also subject to the SEC’s rules regarding risk assessment, which apply to all publicly traded companies. The SEC rules require the Company to determine whether any of its existing incentive compensation plans, programs or arrangements create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Accordingly, the Company’s Compensation Committee completes a risk assessment of the Company’s compensation programs and components on an annual basis. The Committee has determined that the Company’s incentive compensation plans, programs and arrangements do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 36\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nThe Compensation Committee believes that its regular, overall assessment of the compensation plans, programs and arrangements established for the Company’s NEOs includes a sensible, responsible approach toward balancing risks and rewarding reasonable, but not necessarily easily attainable, goals. The Committee annually revisits the frameworks set forth in the Safety and Soundness Standards and the Joint Guidance, as both are effective parts of the Committee’s overall assessment of the balance between risk and reward in the Company’s compensation arrangements. In addition, the Committee continues to monitor the status of the proposed guidance under the Dodd-Frank Act and remains prepared to incorporate into its risk assessment procedures any new guidelines and procedures as may be necessary or appropriate.\n\nFinally, when making decisions about executive compensation, the Company also considers the impact of other regulatory provisions, including: Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), regarding the tax deductibility of certain compensation; Section 409A of the Code regarding nonqualified deferred compensation; Section 280G of the Code regarding excise taxes and deduction limitations on golden parachute payments made in connection with a change in control; and the impact of FASB ASC Topic 718, which requires the Company to recognize the compensation cost of grants of equity awards based upon their grant date fair value.\n\nOTHER COMPENSATION AND GOVERNANCE POLICIES\n\nSHARE OWNERSHIP AND RETENTION GUIDELINES\n\nWe believe our NEOs and non-employee directors should have a significant equity interest in the Company. To promote equity ownership and align the interests of our executives and directors with those of our stockholders, we maintain the following share retention and ownership guidelines for our senior officers and directors. \n\nCEO| 3x base salary  \n---|---  \nOther NEOs or Executive Vice Presidents| 3x base salary  \nNon-employee Directors| 3x annual cash compensation  \n  \nThe ownership guidelines are the same for each executive, including the CEO, to reflect the same team approach applicable to other elements of our executive compensation program. Until the stock ownership guidelines are met, executives and directors are expected to retain at least 50 percent of any applicable shares received (on a net after-tax basis) pursuant to our equity incentive plans. If an officer fails to satisfy the guidelines and fails to retain at least 50 percent of any applicable shares received pursuant to our equity incentive plans, 25 percent of such officer’s annual incentive bonus, if any, is paid in shares of Company stock until the ownership guideline is satisfied. A failure to satisfy the guidelines by a director is considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee when evaluating such director’s qualifications for nomination. These guidelines are subject to periodic review by the Compensation Committee, and compliance is monitored on an annual basis. The guidelines for non-employee directors include annual cash compensation received from both the Company and West Bank.\n\nFor purposes of compliance with these guidelines, share ownership includes shares owned outright by the individual or his or her immediate family members who share the same household, shares held by the individual in an IRA account, fully vested shares held by the individual under a Company retirement plan and RSUs (both vested and unvested) granted to the individual under any Company equity incentive plan. \n\nAs of December 31, 2023, all of our NEOs and non-employee directors hold shares in excess of the requirements in the guidelines, with the exception of two non-employee directors who first became subject to the retention guidelines in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and one NEO who first became subject to the retention guidelines in 2022. They are expected to make continuing progress towards compliance with the guidelines and until they individually reach the required minimums, they will each be required to retain at least 50 percent of any applicable shares received (on a net after-tax basis) pursuant to our equity incentive plans. \n\nCLAWBACK POLICY\n\nEffective July 26, 2023, we adopted an enhanced clawback policy in accordance with the latest SEC rules and NASDAQ listing standards, a copy of which is publicly filed with our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A and may be viewed on the Investor Relations — Overview — Corporate Governance section of the Company’s website (www.westbankstrong.com). The new policy replaces and supersedes the prior clawback policy that we had in place since January of 2021. \n\n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 37\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nIn addition to the formal clawback policy, in the event the Company is required to seek or demand recoupment of any payments made to our NEOs pursuant to law, our employment agreements provide for return of any severance-related payments upon request of the Company. Additionally, all equity awards granted under our 2017 Equity Plan and the 2021 Equity Plan, are subject to cancellation, recoupment, rescission or payback in accordance with applicable law.\n\nINSIDER TRADING POLICY\n\nThe Company has adopted an insider trading policy governing the purchase, sale and/or other dispositions of its securities by directors, officers and employees, as well as by the Company itself, that is designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws, rules and regulations and any applicable listing standards. The Company’s insider trading policy permits open market transactions in Company stock beginning the day after the second full trading day after quarterly earnings have been made public until the 10th day of the third month in the quarter. In addition, our NEOs may purchase Company stock through the 401(k) retirement plan. Changes to purchases under the 401(k) retirement plan may be made only during the period when open market transactions are permitted.\n\nANTI-HEDGING POLICY\n\nThe Company’s insider trading policy prohibits all employees and directors from entering into any hedging transactions involving the Company’s stock.\n\nANTI-PLEDGING POLICY\n\nThe Company’s insider trading policy prohibits all NEOs and directors from keeping Company stock in a margin account. In addition, NEOs and directors may not pledge Company stock as collateral for a loan.\n\nACCELERATION OF EQUITY AWARDS\n\nOur award agreements under the 2017 Equity Plan and the 2021 Equity Plan utilize a “double trigger” approach to vesting upon a change in control, rather than a “single trigger” approach under which awards would vest solely upon a change in control. Under our double trigger approach, vesting of our time-based equity awards occurs upon a change in control only if the outstanding equity awards are not fully assumed by the acquiror, or if they are assumed but the participant is subsequently terminated without cause or resigns for good reason. With respect to the Performance RSUs granted to our NEOs beginning in 2021, the awards vest immediately in connection with a change in control based upon the greater of actual performance through the date of a change in control or target-level performance without proration. We believe this approach provides adequate employment protection while reducing, for our stockholders’ benefit, potential transaction costs associated with the awards, as compared to plans with single trigger acceleration upon a change in control. \n\nNO TAX GROSS-UPS\n\nUnder Section 280G of the Code, an executive may be subject to excise taxes on certain benefits received in relation to a change in control of the Company. While some companies provide excise tax gross-ups to executives, to place the executive in the same tax position as if the excise tax did not apply, we do not believe it is necessary to provide this benefit to our executives. Our employment agreements with the NEOs therefore omit any provision for such a gross-up.\n\nCOMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT\n\nThe incorporation by reference of this proxy statement into any document filed with the SEC by the Company shall not be deemed to include the following report unless such report is specifically stated to be incorporated by reference into such document. \n\nThe Compensation Committee hereby states as follows: \n\n•It has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement with management; and\n\n•Based on the review and discussion referred to immediately above, it recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement. \n\nThe undersigned members of the Compensation Committee have submitted this report. \n\nSteven K.

In the event that the participant retires (as defined under each plan), the outstanding RSUs will continue to vest as scheduled provided that the participant signs a release and waiver and does not compete with the Company.\n\nUnder the 2021 Equity Plan, with respect to the Performance RSUs granted to our NEOs in 2021 and thereafter, the awards will vest immediately in connection with a change in control based upon the greater of actual performance through the date of a change in control or target level performance without proration. \n\nTERMINATION UNDER DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN \n\nIn the event of a change in control of the Company or the participant’s separation from service due to death or disability, amounts deferred by a participant will be distributed in a lump sum, and Company contributions, if any, will be distributed in accordance with the participant’s elections.\n\nCEO PAY RATIO\n\nAs required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of our median employee’s annual total compensation and the annual total compensation of Mr. Nelson, our President and CEO (the “Pay Ratio”) as of December 31, 2023. The Pay Ratio, as set forth below, is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.\n\nWe identified our median employee as of December 31, 2021, excluding Mr. Nelson, using a measure of “total cash compensation,” which is defined as the sum of base salary, bonus, incentives, holiday, paid time off and overtime pay, as reflected in our payroll records. We believe this is a reasonable measure of total compensation. Our employee population consisted of 181 employees as of December 31, 2021. This population includes all full-time and part-time employees. We annualized the compensation of employees who were hired during 2021, based on the portion of the year for which they were employed. No full-time equivalent adjustments were made for part-time employees. Since we do not widely distribute annual equity awards to our employees, such awards were excluded from our compensation measure for identifying our median employee.\n\nTo calculate the 2023 ratio of compensation of our median employee to that of Mr. Nelson, we calculated the median employee’s annual total compensation consistent with the calculation of Mr. Nelson’s annual total compensation as reported for 2023 in the “Total” column of the Summary Compensation Table included in this proxy statement. This includes total cash compensation as described above as well as Company matching and discretionary contributions to participants in our 401(k) retirement plan and equity awards, as applicable. The annual total compensation for the median employee was $75,462. Mr. Nelson’s total compensation was $1,303,388. The Pay Ratio of Mr. Nelson’s annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of the identified median employee for 2023 was approximately 17.3 to 1. \n\n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 46\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nPAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE\n\nIn August 2022, the SEC adopted final rules (the “Final Rules”) implementing Section 14(i) (“Section 14(i)”) of the Exchange Act, as added by Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act.

Properly executed proxies on the accompanying proxy card will be voted “FOR” approval of the 2023 compensation of the named executive officers unless contrary instructions are given.  \n  \nSection 14A of the Exchange Act requires the Company to conduct an advisory stockholder vote to approve the compensation of NEOs. This proposal, commonly known as a “say-on-pay” proposal, gives stockholders the opportunity to endorse or not endorse the Company’s pay program for its NEOs. We currently hold our say-on-pay vote every year. The Company is requesting stockholder approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of the Company’s NEOs for 2023 as listed in the Summary Compensation Table, appearing in the “Executive Compensation” section in this proxy statement, and as described in more detail in this proxy statement. The Company believes that its executive compensation programs, as explained in the “Executive Compensation” section of this proxy statement, are straightforward and reasonable. As explained, the general objectives of, and important factors for, the Company’s executive compensation program include significant emphasis on the long-term success of the Company through long-term performance of its executives. Stockholders are urged to carefully read the “Executive Compensation” section of this proxy statement, as well as the Summary Compensation Table and narrative disclosures that describe the compensation of our NEOs in 2023. The Board has previously approved the 2023 compensation.\n\nThe following resolution is submitted for stockholder approval:\n\n“RESOLVED, that West Bancorporation, Inc.’s stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, its executive compensation as described in the section captioned ‘Executive Compensation’ and the tabular disclosure regarding named executive officer compensation contained in the West Bancorporation Inc. proxy statement dated March 5, 2024.”\n\nApproval of this resolution requires that the number of votes cast “FOR” the proposal exceed the number of votes cast “AGAINST” such proposal. In tabulating the votes, abstentions and broker non-votes will be disregarded and have no effect on the outcome of the vote. While this say-on-pay vote is required, as provided in Section 14A of the Exchange Act, it is not binding on the Board and may not be construed as overruling any decision by the Board. However, the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the votes when considering future compensation arrangements.\n\n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 50\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nPROPOSAL 3| APPROVE THE FREQUENCY OF THE NONBINDING VOTETO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY’SNAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.   \n---|---  \nü| The Board recommends a vote “FOR” the ONE YEAR frequency when voting on this proposal. Properly executed proxies on the accompanying proxy card will be voted “FOR” approval of one-year frequency unless contrary instructions are given.  \n  \nSection 14A of the Exchange Act requires the Company to conduct an advisory stockholder vote to approve the frequency with which our stockholders will vote on the compensation of NEOs, such as the one contained in Proposal 2, above, in future years. Stockholders are provided with the option of selecting a frequency of every year, every two years, or every three years, or they may abstain from the vote.\n\nSection 14A of the Exchange Act requires the Company to hold an advisory vote on the frequency of say-on-pay votes at least once every six years. The next such vote on the frequency of say-on-pay advisory votes will be held at the 2030 annual meeting.\n\nThe Board is recommending that future stockholder say-on-pay votes continue to be conducted annually as is the current practice. The Board values and encourages constructive input from our stockholders regarding the Company’s compensation philosophy, policies and practices, and believes it is important that such policies and practices are aligned with the best interests of our stockholders. An annual say-on-pay vote will provide the Board and the Compensation Committee with useful information on stockholder sentiment about these important matters on the most frequent and consistent basis. \n\nAlthough the Board recommends a say-on-pay vote annually, stockholders are not voting to approve the Board’s recommendation. Rather, Stockholders are being asked to vote on the following: \n\n“RESOLVED, that West Bancorporation, Inc.’s stockholders determine, on an advisory basis, that the frequency with which the stockholders shall have an advisory vote on the compensation of the named executive officers contained in the West Bancorporation Inc. proxy statement dated March 5, 2024 shall be [every year] [every two years] [every three years].”\n\nThe choice which received the highest number of votes will be deemed the choice of the stockholders. In tabulating the votes, abstentions and broker non-votes will be disregarded and have no effect on the outcome of the vote. While this advisory vote is required, as provided in Section 14A of the Exchange Act, it is not binding on the Board and may not be construed as overruling any decision by the Board. However, the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the votes when considering future compensation arrangements.\n\n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 51\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nPROPOSAL 4| APPROVE AN AMENDMENT TO THE WEST BANCORPORATION, INC. 2021 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN.   \n---|---  \nü| The Board recommends a vote “FOR” approval of an amendment to the West Bancorporation, Inc. 2021 Equity Incentive Plan. Properly executed proxies on the accompanying proxy card will be voted “FOR” approval of an amendment to the 2021 Equity Plan unless contrary instructions are given.  \n  \nOur Board adopted, and our stockholders approved, the West Bancorporation, Inc. 2021 Incentive Plan (the “2021 Equity Plan”) to promote the long-term financial success of the Company and its subsidiaries by attracting and retaining key employees and other individuals. We are submitting an amendment to the 2021 Equity Plan to our stockholders at this time solely to increase the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock reserved for issuance under the 2021 Equity Plan by 550,000 shares (the “Plan Amendment”). The Board believes that the approval of the Plan Amendment is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.\n\nThe Plan Amendment, which would provide for 550,000 additional shares reserved for issuance under the 2021 Equity Plan, was approved by our Board of Directors on February 21, 2024, subject to stockholder approval of this proposal at the Annual Meeting. The additional shares would increase the total share reserve under the 2021 Equity Plan from 625,000 shares to 1,175,000 shares. A copy of the Plan Amendment is attached hereto as Appendix A. Of the original 625,000 shares available for issuance under the 2021 Equity Plan, there are approximately 266,963 shares remaining for issuance under the 2021 Equity Plan. The Plan Amendment is intended to provide continued flexibility to the Company in its ability to motivate, attract and retain the services of directors, officers and employees whose judgement, interest and talents are integral to successfully conducting the Company’s operations. The Company has historically been prudent in its usage of shares available for issuance under the 2021 Equity Plan, as described further below under “Grant Practices and Key Data”. Furthermore, the Plan Amendment represents the first time since 2021 that the Company has asked stockholders to approve an increase to the number of shares reserved for issuance as equity compensation, and we expect these additional shares will cover our needs for years to come, assuming no strategic transactions or similar acquisitions that increase the size of our organization and the number of our equity-eligible employees.\n\nAdoption of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of the Company’s common stock represented, in person by attending the Annual Meeting via webcast or by proxy, and entitled to vote on the matter at the Annual Meeting. An abstention will count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal, because an abstention represents a share entitled to vote and thus is included in the denominator in determining the percentage approved. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the proposal because they are not “entitled to vote” on this matter. If the Plan Amendment is not approved by our stockholders at the Annual Meeting, it will not be adopted and the Company will continue to operate under the 2021 Equity Plan until no more shares remain available for issuance, at which time the Company believes that higher cash compensation may be required to attract and retain key employees and other individuals, which would reduce alignment with stockholder interests.\n\nA summary of the material provisions of the 2021 Equity Plan is set forth below. \n\n2021 Equity Incentive Plan, as Amended\n\nIn determining the number of shares of the Company’s common stock to be authorized under the 2021 Equity Plan, the Board considered the effects of our size, number of outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock and employee headcount, and the Board believes that an increase in the share reserve of 550,000 shares, to a total of 1,175,000 shares, is appropriate. The Compensation Committee engaged McLagan to assist in determining the appropriate number of shares to reserve under the 2021 Equity Plan (discussed more fully below under Important Considerations).\n\n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 52\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nStockholder Approval; Best Practices\n\nThe 2021 Equity Plan previously approved by our stockholders in 2021 reflects current practices in equity incentive plans that we consider best practices, such as: \n\n•Independent Oversight. The 2021 Equity Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board, which is comprised of independent members of our Board.\n\n•Double Trigger Change in Control Provisions. The change in control provisions under the 2021 Equity Plan provide for acceleration of vesting of time vested awards in the event of a change in control only if the 2021 Equity Plan does not become an obligation of the successor entity or the participant incurs a termination of service without cause or for good reason following the change in control. Performance vested awards will vest based upon the greater of target performance or the Company performance through the date of the change in control.\n\n•No Evergreen Feature. The number of authorized shares under the 2021 Equity Plan was fixed at 625,000. The Plan Amendment would increase the total share reserve to 1,175,000 shares. The 2021 Equity Plan does not include an “evergreen” feature that would cause the number of authorized shares to automatically increase in future years.\n\n•Conservative Share Reuse Provision. Shares subject to an award under the 2021 Equity Plan will not be available for reuse if such shares are delivered or withheld to satisfy any tax withholding obligation, or not issued upon the settlement of an award. \n\n•Minimum Vesting Periods. Stock awards that are vested solely based on continued service, must have a vesting period of at least one year, with the exception that up to 5 percent of the share reserve may have a shorter vesting period.\n\n•Dividends Subject to Vesting.Dividend payments or dividend equivalent payments on shares subject to outstanding awards may only be distributed upon the vesting of the underlying award.\n\n•Clawback Policy Implementation. All awards under the 2021 Equity Plan will be subject to any applicable law respecting recapture of compensation or the Company’s newly adopted clawback policy, as may be in effect from time to time.\n\n•Forfeiture Provisions. Upon a breach of a restrictive covenant, participants forfeit all outstanding awards (whether vested or unvested) and must repay to the Company any shares or profits realized, within one year prior to the participant’s termination of service and thereafter, from the subsequent disposition of shares received in connection with the 2021 Equity Plan. \n\n•Multiple Award Types. The 2021 Equity Plan permits the issuance of restricted stock units, restricted stock and other types of full value equity grants, subject to the share limits of the Plan. This breadth of award types will enable the Compensation Committee to tailor awards in light of the accounting, tax and other standards applicable at the time of grant. Historically, these standards have changed over time. \n\nImportant Considerations \n\nWe have adopted and are recommending that our stockholders approve the Plan Amendment increasing the number of shares reserved under the 2021 Equity Plan because we believe the design of the plan and the number of shares reserved for issuance are consistent with the interests of our stockholders and good corporate governance practices. In approving the Plan Amendment, subject to stockholder approval, our Compensation Committee and Board of Directors considered the following:\n\n•Burn Rate; Longevity of Authorized Shares. Burn rate, which is a measure of the annual rate at which companies use (or burn) shares available for grant in their equity compensation plans, is an important factor for stockholders concerned about dilution. The burn rate is defined in terms of the gross number of equity awards granted during a calendar year divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. We believe our current three-year average burn rate of 1.00 percent should be viewed favorably by our stockholders. We do not anticipate a significant increase in our average burn rate going forward. \n\nWest Bancorporation Burn Rate| 2023| 2022| 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nRSU Awards Granted| 175,680| 169,357| 156,000  \nWeighted Average Common Shares Outstanding | 16,704,284| 16,620,117| 16,534,237  \nAnnual Burn Rate:| 1.05 | %| 1.02 | %| 0.94 | %  \n3 Year Average Burn Rate| 1.00 | %  \n  \n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 53\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\n•Overhang. Overhang is another measure that is sometimes used to assess the aggregate dilutive impact of equity programs such as the 2021 Equity Plan. Overhang indicates the amount by which existing stockholder ownership would be diluted if the shares authorized for issuance under the 2021 Equity Plan, including the Plan Amendment (1,175,000), coupled with the shares subject to outstanding awards, were issued. The estimated overhang as of the stockholder meeting date of April 25, 2024, taking into account the Plan Amendment and currently outstanding awards that will vest and settle prior to such date, would be approximately 6.78 percent, as shown in the table below.We believe this level of overhang should be viewed favorably by our stockholders as it is below the median level for our industry and the median level for our peer group.\n\n(A)| Shares available under the 2021 Equity Plan, including the Plan Amendment| 672,463  \n---|---|---  \n(B)| Shares underlying outstanding awards| 623,980  \n(C)| Less: Outstanding awards scheduled to vest prior to April 25, 2024| (152,400)  \n(D)| Adjusted Shares underlying outstanding awards as of April 25, 2024| 471,580  \n(E)| Total Shares authorized or outstanding as of April 25, 2024 (A+D)| 1,144,043  \n(F)| Total Shares outstanding (est. as of April 25, 2024)| 16,885,975  \n(G)| Overhang (E divided by F)| 6.78 | %  \n  \nGeneral\n\nThe 2021 Equity Plan was adopted by our Board to promote the growth, profitability and long-term financial success of the Company, to provide a means to incentivize officers, other employees and non-employee directors to achieve long-term corporate objectives and to attract, retain, and award such individuals who can and do contribute to such success, to further align the interests of such individuals with those of the Company’s stockholders, and to provide such individuals with an opportunity to acquire shares of the Company’s common stock. The 2021 Equity Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee, which has the authority to select award recipients from the eligible participants, determine the types of awards to be granted, and determine the applicable terms, conditions, performance criteria, restrictions and other provisions of such awards, including any vesting or accelerated vesting requirements or conditions applicable to an award or awards.\n\nThe 2021 Equity Plan incorporates a broad variety of cash-based and equity-based incentive compensation elements to provide the Compensation Committee with significant flexibility to appropriately address the requirements and limitations of applicable legal, regulatory and financial accounting standards in a manner mutually consistent with the purposes of the 2021 Equity Plan and stockholder interests.\n\nSubject to permitted adjustments for certain corporate transactions, the maximum number of shares that may be delivered to participants, or their beneficiaries, under the 2021 Equity Plan, including the Plan Amendment, is 1,175,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. To the extent that any shares of stock covered by an award (including stock awards) under the 2021 Equity Plan expire or are not delivered for any reason, including because the award is forfeited, cancelled, or settled in cash, such shares will not be deemed to have been delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of shares of stock available for delivery under the 2021 Equity Plan. Additionally, shares that are tendered to, or withheld by, the Company to satisfy any tax withholding obligations will be deemed to have been delivered for purposes of these limitations.\n\nThe 2021 Equity Plan’s effective date was April 29, 2021. The Plan Amendment effective date will be April 25, 2024, subject to approval by stockholders. The 2021 Equity Plan will continue in effect as long as any awards are outstanding; provided, however, that no awards may be granted under the 2021 Equity Plan after the ten-year anniversary of the effective date. Any awards that are outstanding after the tenth anniversary of the effective date shall remain subject to the terms of the 2021 Equity Plan.\n\nThe maximum number of shares that may be subject to share-based awards which may be granted to any one director participant during any calendar year shall not exceed 10,000 shares. The foregoing limitations with respect to directors will not apply to cash-based director fees that the director elects to receive in the form of shares or share based units equal in value to the cash-based director fees. Director participants are not eligible to receive cash based incentive awards under the 2021 Equity Plan.\n\nThe Compensation Committee may use shares of stock available under the 2021 Equity Plan as the form of payment for grants or rights earned or due under any other compensation plans or arrangements of the Company or a subsidiary, including the plans and arrangements of the Company or a subsidiary assumed in business combinations.\n\n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 54\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nIn the event of a corporate transaction involving the stock of the Company (including, without limitation, any stock dividend, stock split, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, exchange of shares, or other similar event which the Committee determines affects the stock such that an adjustment is appropriate to prevent the enlargement or dilution of rights), the foregoing share limitations and all outstanding awards will automatically be adjusted proportionally and uniformly to reflect such event; provided, however, that the Compensation Committee may adjust awards, or prevent the automatic adjustment of awards, to preserve the benefits or potential benefits of the awards.\n\nExcept as provided by the Compensation Committee, awards granted under the 2021 Equity Plan are not transferable except as designated by the participant by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a domestic relations order. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to permit the transfer of awards under the 2021 Equity Plan; provided, however, that such transfers shall be limited to immediate family members of participants, trusts, partnerships, limited liability companies and other entities established for the primary benefit of such family members or to charitable organizations, and as long as such transfers are made without value to the participant and are not made to any third-party financial institution.\n\nIf the right to become vested in an award granted under the 2021 Equity Plan to a participant is conditioned on the completion of a specified period of service with the Company or a subsidiary, without achievement of performance measures or other performance conditions being required as a condition of vesting, and without being granted instead of or in exchange for other compensation or awards, then the required period of service for full vesting must be at least one year. This minimum required period of service for full vesting does not apply to stock awards granted to director participants where the aggregate of such grants does not exceed five percent of the total share reserve under the 2021 Equity Plan.\n\nThe Compensation Committee may provide a participant with the right to receive dividend payments or dividend equivalent payments on shares subject to outstanding awards provided that such dividend payments or dividend equivalent payments will be withheld or accrued by the Company and only distributed upon the release of restrictions subject to the underlying award. If the underlying award is forfeited, the participant will have no rights to such dividend payments or dividend equivalent payments.\n\nEligibility\n\nSelected employees and directors of the Company or its subsidiaries are eligible to become participants in the 2021 Equity Plan. The Compensation Committee will determine the specific individuals who will be granted awards under the 2021 Equity Plan and the type and amount of any such awards.\n\nStock Awards\n\nA stock award is a grant of shares of the Company’s common stock or a right to receive shares of the Company’s common stock, an equivalent amount of cash or a combination thereof in the future. Such awards may include, but are not be limited to, bonus shares, stock units, performance shares, performance units, restricted stock, restricted stock units or any other equity-based award as determined by the Compensation Committee. The specific performance measures, performance objectives or period of service requirements are set by the Compensation Committee in its discretion.\n\nCash Incentive Awards\n\nA cash incentive award is the grant of a right to receive a payment of cash, or the Company’s common stock having a value equivalent to the cash otherwise payable, determined on an individual basis or as an allocation of an incentive pool that is contingent on the achievement of performance objectives established by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may grant cash incentive awards that may be contingent on achievement of a participant’s performance objectives over a specified period established by the Compensation Committee. The grant of cash incentive awards may also be subject to such other conditions, restrictions and contingencies, as determined by the Compensation Committee.\n\nAcceleration\n\nAny awards granted under the 2021 Equity Plan may be subject to acceleration of vesting, to the extent permitted by the Compensation Committee.\n\n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 55\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nForfeiture\n\nUnless specifically provided to the contrary in the applicable award agreement, if a participant’s service is terminated for cause, any outstanding award held by such participant (whether vested or unvested) will be forfeited immediately and such participant will have no further rights under the award.\n\nFurther, except as otherwise provided by the Compensation Committee, if a participant breaches a non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disclosure, non-disparagement or other restrictive covenant in any agreement between the participant and the Company or a subsidiary, whether before or after the participant’s termination of service, the participant will forfeit or pay the following to the Company:\n\n•all outstanding awards granted to the participant under the 2021 Equity Plan, including awards that have become vested; \n\n•any shares held by the participant in connection with the 2021 Equity Plan that were acquired after the participant’s termination of service and within the 12-month period immediately preceding the participant’s termination of service; and\n\n•the profit realized by the participant from the sale or other disposition of any shares received by the participant in connection with the 2021 Equity Plan after the participant’s termination of service and within the 12-month period immediately preceding the participant’s termination of service, where such sale or disposition occurs in such similar time period.\n\nChange in Control\n\nUnless otherwise provided in an award agreement, upon the occurrence of a change in control, all awards will become fully earned and vested immediately if (i) the 2021 Equity Plan is not an obligation of the successor entity following a change in control or (ii) the 2021 Equity Plan is an obligation of the successor entity following a change in control and the participant incurs a termination of service without cause or for good reason following the change in control. Performance vested awards will vest at the time of the change in control based upon the greater of target performance or theCompany’s performance through the date of the change in control.\n\nFor purposes of the 2021 Equity Plan, a “change in control” generally will be deemed to occur when (i) any person acquires the beneficial ownership of 51 percent or more of the voting stock of the Company, except that the acquisition of an interest by a benefit plan sponsored by the Company or a corporate restructuring in which another member of the Company’s controlled group acquires such an interest generally will not be a change in control for purposes of the 2021 Equity Plan, (ii) during any 12-month period, a majority of the Board members serving as of the 2021 Equity Plan’s effective date, or whose election was approved by a vote of a majority of the directors then in office, no longer serve as directors, or (iii) the Company combines or merges with another company and, immediately after the combination, the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to the combination hold, directly or indirectly, 49 percent or less of the voting stock of the resulting company.\n\nHowever, a change in control generally will not be deemed to occur solely because 51 percent or more of the voting stock of the Company is acquired by (i) a trustee or other fiduciary under one or more Company employee benefit plans, or (ii) any entity that is owned by the Company’s stockholders in the same proportion as their ownership of the Company’s common stock.\n\nFurther notwithstanding any provision in the foregoing definition of Change in Control to the contrary, in the event that any Award constitutes deferred compensation, and the settlement of, or distribution of benefits under such Award is to be triggered by a change in control, then such settlement or distribution shall be subject to the event also constituting a “change in control event” under Code Section 409A.\n\nAmendment and Termination\n\nThe Board may at any time amend or terminate the 2021 Equity Plan or any award granted under the 2021 Equity Plan, provided that no amendment or termination may impair the rights of any participant without the participant’s written consent. The Board may not amend the provision of the 2021 Equity Plan to materially increase the original number of shares that may be issued under the 2021 Equity Plan (other than as provided in the 2021 Equity Plan), materially increase the benefits accruing to a participant, or materially modify the requirements for participation in the 2021 Equity Plan, without approval of stockholders. However, the Compensation Committee may amend the 2021 Equity Plan or any award agreement at any time, retroactively or otherwise, to ensure that the 2021 Equity Plan complies with current or future law without stockholder approval, and the Compensation Committee may unilaterally amend the 2021 Equity Plan and any outstanding award, without participant consent, in order to avoid the application of, or to comply with, Section 409A of the Code, and applicable regulations and guidance thereunder.\n\n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 56\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nClawback Policy \n\nAll awards, amounts and benefits received under the 2021 Equity Plan will be subject to potential cancellation, recoupment, rescission, payback or other action in accordance with the terms of any applicable Company clawback policy, as may be in effect from time to time, or any applicable law even if adopted after the 2021 Equity Plan becomes effective. \n\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations \n\nThe following is a summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may arise in conjunction with participation in the 2021 Equity Plan.\n\nStock Awards. A participant who has been granted a stock award generally will not realize taxable income at the time of grant, provided that the stock subject to the award is not delivered at the time of grant, or if the stock is delivered, it is subject to restrictions that constitute a “substantial risk of forfeiture” for U.S. income tax purposes. Upon the later of delivery or vesting of shares subject to an award, the holder generally will realize ordinary income in an amount equal to the then fair market value of those shares and the Company generally will be entitled to a corresponding deduction. Gains or losses realized by the participant upon disposition of such shares generally will be treated as capital gains and losses, with the basis in such shares equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time of delivery or vesting. Dividends paid to the holder during the restriction period, if so provided, generally will also be compensation income to the participant and the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction.\n\nCash Incentive Awards. A participant who has been granted a cash incentive award generally will not realize taxable income at the time of grant, provided that no cash is actually paid at the time of grant. Upon the payment of any cash in satisfaction of the cash incentive award, the participant generally will realize ordinary income in an amount equal to the cash award received and the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction.\n\nWithholding of Taxes. The Company may withhold amounts from participants to satisfy withholding tax requirements. Except as otherwise provided by the Compensation Committee, participants may tender cash, have shares withheld from awards or may tender previously owned shares to the Company to satisfy tax withholding requirements. The shares withheld from awards may not be used to satisfy more than the individual statutory tax rate for each applicable tax jurisdiction.\n\nChange in Control. Any acceleration of the vesting or payment of awards under the 2021 Equity Plan in the event of a change in control in the Company may cause part or all of the consideration involved to be treated as an “excess parachute payment” under Section 280G of the Code, which may subject the participant to a 20 percent excise tax and preclude deduction by the Company.\n\nTax Advice\n\nThe preceding discussion is based on U.S. federal tax laws and regulations presently in effect, which are subject to change, and the discussion does not purport to be a complete description of the U.S. federal income tax aspects of the 2021 Equity Plan. A participant may also be subject to state and local taxes in connection with the grant of awards under the 2021 Equity Plan. The Company strongly encourages participants to consult with their individual tax advisors to determine the applicability of the tax rules to the awards granted to them in their personal circumstances.\n\n* * * * *\n\nNew Plan Benefits\n\nBecause the grant of awards under the 2021 Equity Plan is within the discretion of the Compensation Committee, and possibly subject to various performance factors which cannot, as yet, be determined, we cannot determine the dollar value or number of awards that will in the future be received by or allocated to any participant in the 2021 Equity Plan. No individual awards have been granted to any employee or director under the 2021 Equity Plan that are contingent on the approval of the Company’s stockholders.

Properly executed proxies on the accompanying proxy card will be voted “FOR” the ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2024, unless contrary instructions are given.  \n  \nThe Audit Committee of the Board has reappointed RSM, independent registered public accountants, as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2024. RSM will conduct the annual audit of the Company and its subsidiaries for 2024. RSM has served as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm since 1998. In support of the reappointment of RSM as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee considered the following factors:\n\n•The firm’s independence, objectivity and professional skepticism;\n\n•The firm’s compliance with the SEC requirement to rotate the lead engagement partner and engagement quality review partner every five years;\n\n•Quality of services provided;\n\n•Quality of communication and interaction with the firm;\n\n•A review of the firm’s most recent Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) inspection report; and\n\n•Audit and non-audit fees.\n\nThe Company is asking its stockholders to ratify the appointment of RSM as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for 2024. A description of the fees for services rendered by RSM for 2023 and 2022 and a description of the Company’s policy regarding the approval of independent registered public accountants’ fees are set forth in the next sub-section.\n\nIn the event the stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will consider this factor when making any future determination regarding RSM. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Ratification of the appointment of RSM requires that the number of votes cast “FOR” the proposal exceed the number of votes cast “AGAINST” such proposal. In tabulating the votes, abstentions and broker non-votes will be disregarded and have no effect on the outcome of the vote. \n\nA representative from RSM will be present at the Annual Meeting. The representative will have the opportunity to make a statement and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders.\n\n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 59\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nAUDIT FEES\n\nDuring the period covering the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, RSM performed the professional services listed in the following table.\n\n2023| 2022  \n---|---  \nAudit fees (1)| $388,000| $335,000  \nAudit-related fees (2)| 44,000| 84,000  \nTax fees (3)| 5,397| 12,978  \nAll other fees (4)| —| 12,345  \nTotal| $437,397| $444,323  \n  \n(1)Audit fees represent fees for professional services provided for the audit of the Company’s annual financial statements, review of the Company’s quarterly financial statements in connection with the filing of current and periodic reports and reporting on internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for the fiscal years indicated.\n\n(2)Audit-related fees represent fees for assurance and related professional services reasonably related to the audit or review of the Company’s financial statements, including professional services provided for the audit of the Company’s 401(k) retirement plan and fees related to procedures performed in conjunction with the Company’s subordinated debt offering in 2022.\n\n(3)Tax fees represent fees for professional services related to tax compliance, which included review of tax returns, tax planning and advice, and a cost segregation study in 2022.\n\n(4)All other fees represent fees for other services provided by RSM, including information technology services.\n\nThe Audit Committee considered whether the non-audit services provided to the Company by RSM are compatible with maintaining RSM’s independence and concluded that the independence of RSM is not compromised by the provision of such services. The Audit Committee pre-approves all audit services and permitted non-audit services, including the fees for and terms of services to be performed for the Company by its independent registered public accounting firm prior to engagement.\n\nAUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT\n\nThe incorporation by reference of this proxy statement into any document filed with the SEC by the Company shall not be deemed to include the following report unless such report is specifically stated to be incorporated by reference into such document.\n\nThe Audit Committee hereby states as follows:\n\n•It has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, with management;\n\n•It has discussed with the independent registered public accountants the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB and the SEC;\n\n•It has received the written disclosures and the letter from RSM required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accountant’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with the independent registered public accountants, the independent registered public accountant’s independence, qualifications and performance;\n\n•At each of its meetings, it has met with the internal auditors and independent registered public accountants, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the Company’s internal controls and the overall quality of the Company’s financial reporting.\n\n•It has reviewed and approved or ratified all related-party transactions between the Company and its directors; \n\n•Based on the review and discussions referred to above, it recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, for filing with the SEC;\n\n•The Board has reviewed and approved the Audit Committee charter;\n\n•It has discussed with the Company’s internal and independent registered public accountants the overall scope and plans for their respective audits; and\n\n•It has selected RSM as the independent registered public accounting firm for 2024.\n\nThe undersigned members of the Audit Committee have submitted this report.\n\nJames W.

As a stockholder of record on the Record Date, you are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. This proxy statement describes the matters that will be presented for consideration by the stockholders at the Annual Meeting. It also gives you information concerning those matters to assist you in making an informed decision on each matter.If you vote pursuant to the instructions set forth in the notice and herein, you appoint the proxy holders as your representatives at the Annual Meeting. The proxy holders will vote your shares as you have instructed, thereby ensuring your shares will be voted whether or not you attend the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we ask that you instruct the proxies how to vote your shares in advance of the meeting just in case your plans change.  \nWhy did I receive a notice regarding the internet availability of proxy materials instead of paper copies of the proxy materials? | We are using the SEC’s notice and access rule that allows us to furnish our proxy materials over the internet to our stockholders instead of mailing paper copies of those materials to each stockholder. As a result, beginning on or about March 5, 2024, we sent our stockholders by mail a notice containing instructions on how to (i) access our proxy materials over the internet and (ii) vote their shares of Company stock. This notice is not a proxy card and cannot be used to vote your shares. If you received a notice this year, you will not receive paper copies of the proxy materials unless you request the materials by following the instructions on the notice.   \nWhat matters will be voted on at the meeting?| You are being asked to vote on the following matters proposed by our Board: (1)the election of 12 directors to serve on the Board until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors are elected and qualified; (2)the approval, on a nonbinding basis, of the 2023 compensation of the named executive officers, commonly known as a “say-on-pay” proposal; (3)the approval, on a nonbinding basis, of the frequency (every one, two or three years) of the nonbinding vote to approve the compensation of the named executive officers disclosed in the proxy statement; (4)the approval of an amendment to the West Bancorporation, Inc. 2021 Equity Incentive Plan; and(5)the ratification of the appointment of RSM as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2024 fiscal year. These matters are more fully described in this proxy statement. We are not aware of any other matters that will be voted on at the Annual Meeting. However, if any other business properly comes before the meeting, the persons named as proxies for stockholders will vote on such matters in a manner they consider appropriate.  \n  \n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 61\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nHow do I vote?| After reviewing this document, please submit your proxy using any of the voting methods indicated on the notice. You may vote by telephone, by internet, by mail if you complete, sign, date and mail the proxy card you received in the mail, if you received paper copies of the proxy materials, or in person at the Annual Meeting. By submitting your proxy, you authorize the individuals named in it to represent you and vote your shares at the Annual Meeting in accordance with your instructions. Your vote is important. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, please submit your proxy card promptly in the enclosed envelope, or through the internet or via telephone by following the instructions on the proxy card.If you sign and return your proxy card but do not mark the card to provide voting instructions, the shares represented by your proxy card will be voted “FOR” all 12 director nominees named in this proxy statement, “FOR” the approval of the say-on-pay proposal, “FOR” the approval of one-year say-on-pay vote frequency, “FOR” the approval of Plan Amendment, and “FOR” the ratification of the appointment of RSM as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2024 fiscal year.If you are a beneficial owner and a broker or other fiduciary is the record holder of your shares (which is usually referred to as “street name” ownership), then you received this proxy statement from the record holder of the shares that you beneficially own. The record holder should have given you instructions for directing how the record holder should vote your shares. It will then be the record holder’s responsibility to vote your shares in the manner you direct.If you want to vote in person, please attend the Annual Meeting. We will distribute ballots to anyone who wants to vote at the meeting. Please note, however, that if your shares are held in the name of a broker or other fiduciary (i.e., in street name), you will need to arrange to obtain a legal proxy from the record holder to vote in person at the meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we ask that you complete and return your proxy card or vote via the internet or by telephone in advance of the Annual Meeting in case your plans change.  \n---|---  \nIf I hold shares in the name of a broker, who votes my shares?| If your broker holds your shares in its name and you have not provided voting instructions for your shares, your broker may choose to either leave your shares unvoted or vote your shares on certain “routine” matters on which the broker is deemed to have discretionary voting authority. The ratification of the appointment of a company’s independent registered public accounting firm is considered a routine matter, while the election of directors, the approval of say-on-pay proposals, the approval of say-on-pay vote frequency and amendments to an equity plan are considered non-routine matters. Thus, if you do not provide instructions to your broker as to how it should vote the shares beneficially owned by you, your broker will be able to vote on the ratification of the appointment of RSM as our independent registered public accounting firm, but will not be permitted to vote on the election of directors, the approval of the say-on-pay proposal, the say-on-pay vote frequency or the Plan Amendment. If your broker does not receive instructions from you on how to vote on a particular matter on which your broker does not have discretionary authority to vote, your broker will return the proxy to us indicating the broker does not have authority to vote on these matters. This is referred to as a “broker non-vote” with respect to the non-routine matters and may affect the outcome of the voting as described below under “What options do I have in voting on each of the proposals?” Therefore, we encourage you to provide directions to your broker as to how you want your shares voted on all matters brought before the Annual Meeting.  \nIf I hold shares in the West Bancorporation 401(k) retirement plan, who votes my shares?| If you are a holder of stock in the Company’s 401(k) retirement plan (the “Plan”), you can direct the trustee of the Plan (the “Trustee”) how to vote the number of shares you hold in the Plan for each proposal included in this proxy statement. If you do not provide timely voting directions to the Trustee, then the Trustee shall vote the shares held for your benefit in the same proportion as those shares of stock held in the Plan for which the Trustee has received proper directions for voting.  \nWhat if I change my mind after I return my proxy?| If you hold your shares in your own name, you may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before the polls close for the meeting. You may do this by:•signing another proxy card with a later date and returning that proxy card to Vote Processing, c/o Broadridge, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717;•timely submitting another proxy via the internet;•timely submitting another proxy via telephone;•sending notice to us at the address below that you are revoking your proxy; or•voting in person at the meeting.All written notices of revocation and other written communications with respect to revocation of proxies should be sent to Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. If you hold your shares in the name of your broker and desire to revoke your proxy, you will need to contact your broker.  \n  \n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 62\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nHow many votes do we need to hold the Annual Meeting?| The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company entitled to vote as of the Record Date must be present in person or by proxy at the meeting in order to hold the meeting and conduct business. Shares are counted as present at the meeting if the stockholder either:•has properly submitted a signed proxy card or other form of proxy (through the internet or telephone); or•attends the Annual Meeting in person.Shares of common stock held by stockholders abstaining from voting but otherwise present at the meeting in person or by proxy, votes withheld, and broker non-votes are included in determining whether a quorum is present. On the Record Date, there were 16,725,094 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, all of which were entitled to vote. Therefore, at least 8,362,547 shares need to be present, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting to conduct business. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote.   \n---|---  \nWhat happens if a director nominee is unable to stand for re-election?| The Board may, by resolution, provide for a lesser number of directors or designate a substitute director nominee. In the latter case, shares represented by proxies may be voted for a substitute nominee at the discretion of the proxy holders. Proxies cannot be voted for more than 12 nominees. We have no reason to believe any nominee will be unable to stand for election.  \nWhat options do I have in voting on each of the proposals?| The directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote, and the 12 nominees receiving the greatest number of votes cast “FOR” their election will be elected as directors of the Company. Votes withheld from any nominee, abstentions and broker “non-votes” will have no effect on the election of directors due to the fact that such elections are by a plurality of the votes cast. The number of votes cast “FOR” the proposal must exceed the number of votes cast “AGAINST” such proposal to approve the say-on-pay proposal and the ratification of the appointment of RSM as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. The vote on our executive compensation is advisory and is not binding on the directors of the Company. However, the Compensation Committee of the Board will consider stockholder votes in establishing our compensation plans for subsequent years.Broker non-votes and abstentions will not be counted as votes cast, but will count for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. So long as a quorum is present, unless stated otherwise in this proxy statement, broker non-votes and abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the matters to be presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. The voting option which receives the highest number of votes will be deemed the choice of the stockholders with respect to the proposal to approve, on a nonbinding basis, the frequency of the say-on-pay vote. Abstentions and broker “non-votes” will have no effect on the result for this proposal. Adoption of the Plan Amendment requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, provided that a quorum is present. Abstentions will count as votes “AGAINST” the proposal, as abstentions represent a share entitled to vote. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the proposal because they are not “entitled to vote” on this matter.   \nWhere do I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting?| We will announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting. The voting results will also be disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K that we will file with the SEC within four business days after the Annual Meeting.  \nWho bears the cost of soliciting proxies?| The Company will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to solicitations by mail, our officers, directors or employees, without extra compensation, may solicit proxies in person, via email or by telephone. We may reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy and solicitation materials to stockholders.  \nWhat is householding? | In some instances, only one notice is being delivered to two or more stockholders who share an address. The Company will promptly deliver a notice to any stockholder who makes such a request. Any stockholder who wishes to receive a separate copy of the notice in the future may notify Melissa L. Gillespie, Corporate Secretary, at 1601 22nd Street, West Des Moines, Iowa 50266, or by calling 515-222-2300. Alternatively, any stockholders sharing an address who are receiving multiple copies of the notice may also notify Ms. Gillespie to request delivery of only one copy.  \n  \nYOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT. PLEASE VOTE BY INTERNET OR TELEPHONE OR RETURN YOUR MARKED AND SIGNED PROXY CARD PROMPTLY SO YOUR SHARES CAN BE REPRESENTED, EVEN IF YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE MEETING IN PERSON.\n\n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 63\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS\n\nCertain directors of the Company have direct and indirect material interests in loans made by West Bank. All such loans were made in West Bank’s ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral requirements, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with other persons not related to West Bank or the Company, and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. None of the loans have been classified as nonaccrual, past due, troubled debt restructured or potential problem loans.The Board considered these loans when reviewing the independence of its directors and determined that such loans did not prevent the relevant directors from being able to serve as independent directors. Similarly, all certificates of deposit and depository relationships with these persons were made in the ordinary course of business and involved substantially the same terms, including interest rates, as those prevailing at the time for comparable depository relationships with persons not related to the Company or West Bank. \n\nThe Audit Committee’s charter requires the Audit Committee to review and approve all related-party transactions that must be disclosed. All transactions between the Company or its subsidiaries and any related person, including loans made by West Bank involving amounts of $120,000 or more, are reviewed to determine whether all material facts of the transaction are known to the Audit Committee, the transaction complies with known legal requirements, and the transaction is fair to the Company and West Bank. The Audit Committee completed the required review of the fiscal year 2023 related-party transactions, and all transactions were approved and ratified.\n\n![WestBancorporation \\(4\\).jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/05/0001166928-24-000029_wtba-20240304_g1.jpg) 2024 Proxy Statement | 64\n\n[Proxy Statement Table of Contents](#WTBA-20240304_HTM_i08b092f6d3ad48ce80997d88d5986280_16)\n\n2025 STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS\n\nIn order for a proposal from a stockholder to be eligible for inclusion in the Company’s proxy statement and proxy card relating to the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders, the proposal from a stockholder of record eligible to vote and setting forth the information required by SEC Rule 14a-8 must be received by the Company’s Corporate Secretary not later than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the anniversary date of the mailing of this proxy statement, which is November 5, 2024.

Our incredible team of dedicated West Bankers positions us\nwell to face today’s challenges and to capitalize on opportunities. We believe those\nopportunities will continue to grow as we have completed the construction of\npermanent offices in both St. Cloud and Mankato, Minnesota, and look forward to\nthe completion of our new corporate headquarters in West Des Moines, Iowa, and a\npermanent office in Owatonna, Minnesota, later this year.\nLike others in our industry, our company experienced some significant margin\nchallenges during 2023. The interest rate environment, including dramatic\nincreases in short-term rates, an ongoing inverted yield curve, and aggressive\ndeposit competition, all significantly impacted our cost of funds and net interest\nmargin. We understand the forces challenging our industry, and we have a clear\nvision of our path forward to more normalized margins.\nDespite the challenges of this environment, our credit quality remains pristine. We\nhold no loans greater than 30 days past due and essentially no problem loans as of\nDecember 31, 2023. We continue to closely monitor and manage our credit quality\nas the economy changes and our customers respond to the higher interest rate environment.\nWest Bank is 131 years old and is the oldest business of any type to be founded and remain\nheadquartered in West Des Moines, Iowa. The development of our new headquarters has been many\nyears in the making as part of our strategic plan. We have been a tenant in our current building for\n52 years and planned for the creation of a new bank-owned headquarters to coincide with the\nexpiration of our lease in 2024. Because of our steadfast commitment to invest in our community,\nwe chose to construct the building on a site badly in need of revitalization. Redevelopment—versus\nbuilding on clean ground—added complexity to our project, but we believe this step to help our\ncommunity provides both strong leadership and an investment model for other businesses to follow.\nOur newest facilities serve as a point of pride in which our teams will work, collaborate, and continue\nto provide excellent service to our customers for decades to come. They also serve as venues for\nbusiness development events and provide opportunities to cultivate new and existing customer\nrelationships, which are central to our business model.\nWe appreciate and thank you for your continued support and interest in our company.\nSincerely,\nDavid D.

Kay is a highly experienced banking\nprofessional with an impressive 51-year career at West Bank. She has held many leadership positions within\nthe bank, ranging from financial and accounting to heading up the customer service department, ensuring that\nWest Bank’s customers received top-notch service.\nKay joined the company in 1972 as a teller shortly after graduating from Grandview College. Kay was hired\nwhen West Bank was adding additional staff in anticipation of opening the brand new “Main” Bank at 1601\n22nd Street in West Des Moines. Throughout her time at West Bank, Kay has demonstrated her versatility and\nexpertise by taking on various customer-facing roles. However, her passion for the intricacies of banking led\nher to transition to a back-office role in the bookkeeping department, where she developed a keen attention to\ndetail and meticulousness, which became the foundation of her successful banking career.\nThroughout her impressive tenure at West Bank, Kay has continued to learn and grow, making valuable\ncontributions along the way.

Leach Leadership\nAward in 2023, during the Iowa Bankers Association (IBA) Annual Convention at Veterans Memorial Auditorium. The IBA\ncreated the Leach Award in 2000 in honor of Congressman James A. Leach, a previous chairman of the U.S. House Banking\nCommittee. This annual award honors an Iowa banker who, like Leach, has worked to support and uplift Iowa banking and\nIowa communities.\nDave began his 39-year career in community banking in 1984, becoming a bank president in Rochester, Minnesota, in\n1995. He served in that capacity until joining West Bank as CEO in 2010. He is an approachable leader who is personally\ncommitted to and invested in the success of not just his West Bank team and customers, but also the bank’s communities.\nDuring his time at West Bank, Dave has made significant contributions both to the success of West Bank and to community\nbanking in Iowa. Under his leadership, West Bank has been repeatedly recognized as one of the best-performing banks in\nAmerica by numerous national publications; in many of those instances, West Bank was one of very few in the Midwest to\nbe recognized.\nAs an advocate for community banking, Dave served as chairman of the Iowa Bankers Association from 2016-2017. He now\nserves on the board of directors for the American Bankers Association (ABA). He regularly travels to Washington, D.C., to\ntalk to representatives in Congress and keeps in regular contact with our elected representatives to consult with them on\nmatters impacting community banks.\nDAVE NELSON\nIOWA BANKERS ASSOCIATION JAMES A.
