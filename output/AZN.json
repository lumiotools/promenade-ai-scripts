Total Revenue and Core EPS were up 21% and 27% respectively in the third quarter, reflecting the increasing demand for our medicines across Oncology, BioPharmaceuticals and Rare Disease and supporting an upgrade to our full year 2024 guidance.\n\nIn the year to date we have announced the results for multiple positive high-value trials and are working to bring these new options to patients as quickly as possible. Additionally, the quality and impact of our scientific research was well recognised this quarter with data for AstraZeneca medicines featuring in an unprecedented five Presidential Plenary sessions at the two major oncology conferences in September.\n\nWe are highly encouraged by the broad-based underlying momentum we are seeing across our company in 2024, and growth looks set to continue through 2025, providing a solid foundation to deliver on our 2030 ambition.\n\nFinally, we take the matters in China very seriously. If requested we will fully cooperate with the authorities. We remain committed to delivering innovative life-changing medicines to patients in China.”\n\n### **Downloads**\n\n[ 9M and Q3 2024 results announcement PDF 1,251KB  ](/content/dam/az/PDF/2024/9mq3/9M-and-Q3-2024-results-announcement.pdf)\n\n[ 9M and Q3 2024 results presentation PDF 5,353KB  ](/content/dam/az/PDF/2024/9mq3/9M-and-Q3-2024-results-presentation.pdf)\n\n[ 9M and Q3 2024 results clinical trials appendix PDF 3,260KB  ](/content/dam/az/PDF/2024/9mq3/9M-and-Q3-2024-results-clinical-trials-appendix.pdf)\n\n[ Explore our clinical trials appendix ](/investor-relations/clinical-trials-appendix.html)\n\n**Adrian Kemp Company Secretary AstraZeneca PLC**\n\n### tags\n\n  * Corporate and financial \n\n\n\n**You are now leaving AstraZeneca.com**\n\nYou have selected a link that will take you to a site maintained by a third party who is solely responsible for its contents.\n\nAstraZeneca provides this link as a service to website visitors.
