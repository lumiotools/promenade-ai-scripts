This recommendation was based on the absence of any dose limiting toxicities (DLT’s). In addition, no rash was observed in any of the first 9 patients who received PAS-004. The Company has decided to add a cohort 4b to the trial, which will consist of 3 additional patients and introduce an alternate formulation which is intended for commercial use.\n\nDr. Tiago Reis Marques, Chief Executive Officer of Pasithea stated, “We are pleased to observe that as we continue to dose escalate, we have not yet seen rash emerge. Rash is a common adverse event (AE) that is observed at low doses with competitor MEK inhibitors and may lead to the high discontinuation rate in real world practice. In addition, we are excited to dose patients with our potential commercial formulation.”\n\nThe Phase 1 clinical trial is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation 3+3 study design to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and preliminary efficacy of PAS-004 in patients with MAPK pathway driven advanced solid tumors with a documented RAS, NF1 or RAF mutation, or patients who have failed BRAF/MEK inhibition ([NCT06299839](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7kFTkW_O81fT8zRjcWLPDjfmXB3GfA9UQ3KtentZPxuWJmJsjpzK8qJw_vIYoGutaZDq9JH6KBfo6f98t4kqc-64LyUnpcGIz93nD8A0wV_IiCgWV-nXLTDihhBFnqZC \"Opens in a new window\")).\n\n**PAS-004 Demonstrates a Differentiated MEK Inhibitor Profile** Unlike first-generation MEK inhibitors for the treatment of NF1 that require twice-daily dosing (BID) and exhibit short half-lives (<8 hours), PAS-004 has the potential to achieve prolonged target inhibition and once-daily dosing (QD) due to its long half-life of approximately 70 hours. As disclosed previously, the PK profile shows consistent plasma levels at steady-state, as reflected by a low Cmax to Cmin ratio, potentially reducing the risks for Cmax-related toxicity. These findings provide a compelling rationale for the advancement of PAS-004 into clinical trials for both the treatment of cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas in NF1, cancer and other MAPK-driven opportunities. The company expects to provide additional trial updates on a periodic basis as the trial progresses.\n\n**About Pasithea Therapeutics Corp.**\n\nPasithea is a biotechnology company focused on the discovery, research and development of innovative treatments for central nervous system (CNS) disorders and RASopathies.

We believe these data demonstrate a PK and safety profile that differentiates PAS-004 as a next-generation MEK inhibitor. We have already achieved significant PAS-004 exposures with a favorable safety profile and have not seen adverse side effects such as rash or GI toxicity, which are typical for MEK inhibitors even at low doses. The long half-life at approximately 70 hours, and the ability to achieve a flat PK curve at steady-state, aim to provide a constant target inhibition while avoiding peak plasma toxicities, which is a unique PK profile among MEK inhibitors used for the treatment of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1),” stated Dr. Tiago Reis Marques, Chief Executive Officer of Pasithea.\n\n“In addition, we are encouraged to see early potential signs of efficacy, with a heavily pre-treated patient with colorectal cancer showing prolonged stable disease. Colorectal cancer is known to not provide a RECIST response when treated with single-agent MEK inhibitors. This patient has a BRAF K601E mutation, a mutational status with no approved therapies. We are encouraged that this patient has been treated continuously into the 6th 28-day dosing cycle with no toxicities or AEs observed. While still early in clinical development, we believe PAS-004 is showing early signs of differentiation, indicating PAS-004 has the potential to outperform current MEK inhibitors in terms of safety, reduced administration frequency, and potentially efficacy. Our goal is to provide a once-daily or less frequent dosing treatment with broader application, not only for NF1 but also for other indications.”\n\n**Interim Phase 1 Results**\n\n![Interim Phase 1 Results](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/4765238d-9961-438e-b459-509a5c917974/interim-phase-1-results.jpg)\n\n_Pharmacokinetics (PK)_\n\n  * Plasma exposure increased with an increase in dose and linear PK is observed\n  * Long half-life of approximately 70 hours will allow for once daily dosing or longer intervals\n  * Prolonged systemic exposure with minimal fluctuation in PAS-004 plasma concentration at steady state (Cmax/Cmin ratio of 1.2) indicates a potential to achieve constant target inhibition \n\n\n\n![PK plasma curve](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/0e484fc9-7068-4c8f-8060-f4109228d013/pk-plasma-curve.jpg)\n\nAt steady-state, drug levels peaked at about 5 hours with a geometric mean maximum concentration (Cmax) of 16.2 and 61.3 ng/mL for the 2 mg and 4 mg dose groups, respectively. The mean elimination half-life was 67.9 hours supporting once-daily or less frequent oral dosing.\n\n“PAS-004 has demonstrated distinct properties that we believe are significant advantages for an oral MEK inhibitor. PAS-004 has a significantly longer half-life compared to early-generation MEK inhibitors, particularly those used for the treatment of NF1, which have half-lives of less than 8 hours. The ability to achieve prolonged plasma exposures, as reflected in stable plasma concentrations at steady state, may potentially allow PAS-004 to achieve efficacious doses with a favorable safety profile,” stated Dr. Tiago Reis Marques, Chief Executive Officer of Pasithea.\n\n_Safety & Tolerability_\n\n  * No treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) or dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed to date \n\n\n\nIn the first 2 dosing cohorts (n=6), PAS-004 was shown to be well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile with no drug-related dose interruptions, reductions or discontinuations. There were no drug-related serious AEs (SAE) in any dose arm and no protocol-defined stopping criteria were met. Importantly, at the 2 and 4 mg dose levels no rash or skin toxicity, gastro-intestinal (GI) toxicity, or ocular toxicity have been observed to date.\n\nThe study independent Safety Review Committee has completed its safety review of data from the second dose cohort of 4 mg and the Company has initiated cohort 3 dosing at an increased dose of 8 mg in capsules and has filed a protocol amendment to increase dosing schedule.\n\n**PAS-004 Demonstrates a Differentiated MEK Inhibitor Profile**\n\nUnlike first-generation MEK inhibitors for the treatment of NF1 that require twice-daily dosing (BID) and exhibit short half-lives (<8 hours), PAS-004 has the potential to achieve prolonged target inhibition due to its long half-life of approximately 70 hours with once-daily dosing (QD). The PK profile shows consistent plasma levels at steady-state, as reflected by a low Cmax to Cmin ratio, potentially reducing the risks for Cmax-related toxicity. These findings provide a compelling rationale for the advancement of PAS-004 into clinical trials for both the treatment of cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas in NF1, cancer and other MAPK-driven opportunities. The company expects to provide additional trial updates on a periodic basis as the trial progresses.\n\n**About Pasithea Therapeutics Corp.**\n\nPasithea is a biotechnology company focused on the discovery, research and development of innovative treatments for central nervous system (CNS) disorders and RASopathies.
