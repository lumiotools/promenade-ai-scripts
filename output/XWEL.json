(Nasdaq: XWEL) (\"XWELL\" or the \"Company\"), an authority in wellness solutions for people on the go, today reported results for the third quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Recent Highlights:**\n\n  * XWELL delivered 2024 third quarter revenue growth of approximately 13% from the comparable quarter in 2023. Additionally, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, XWELL delivered revenue growth of approximately 16% from the comparable nine-month period in 2023.\n  * XWELL continues to focus on reducing its cost structure and returning to profitability. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company: \n    * Reduced cost of sales by approximately 6% when compared with the comparable nine-month period in 2023.\n    * Reduced general and administrative expenses by approximately 5% when compared with the comparable nine-month period in 2023.\n    * Reduced total operating expenses by approximately 35% when compared with the comparable nine-month period in 2023.\n  * In August of 2024, XWELL continued to fuel its future growth plans by executing a registered direct offering resulting in gross proceeds of $1.4 million, which was priced at a premium to market.\n\n\n\n“We're pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance, marked by the successful implementation of growth and productivity initiatives across our organization,” said Ezra Ernst, CEO of XWELL. “As we focus on achieving healthy, sustainable growth and returning to profitability, we're seeing considerable opportunities across all of our brands. Looking forward, we believe we're well-positioned for a strong 2025, and we remain confident that our consistent strategy execution will benefit our customers, partners, employees, and shareholders.”\n\n**Travel Wellness Portfolio - XpresSpa®** XpresSpa is the leading airport retailer of wellness services and related products. As of September 30, 2024, there were 19 domestic XpresSpa locations and 10 international locations operating, including two XpresSpa locations in Dubai International Airport in the United Arab Emirates, one XpresSpa location in Zayad International Airport in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, three XpresSpa locations in Schiphol Amsterdam Airport in the Netherlands and four XpresSpa locations in the Istanbul Airport in Turkey.\n\nAs previously announced, XpresSpa opened a new location in Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) during the 2024 second quarter. Located in Terminal B near Gate B2, the PHL XpresSpa includes the Company’s new branding as well as innovative offerings including its new Ceragem therapeutic massage and compression beds, Clockwork MiNiCURE and Human Touch automated massages.\n\n**Out-of-Airport Wellness Portfolio - Naples Wax Center®** XWELL’s first off-airport brand, Naples Wax Center, is a group of upscale hair removal and aesthetic services boutiques with three locations in Florida. Acquired in mid-September 2023, Naples Wax Center provides core products and service including face and body waxing as well as a range of skincare and cosmetic products from its current three locations.\n\nThe Company is in the process of executing additional leases in Florida, forecasting approximately 10 XWELL out-of-airport locations in 2025.\n\n**New York City’s Penn Station XpresSpa** Consistent with XWELL’s strategy to extend its footprint into transportation hubs, the Company is executing plans to open an XpresSpa location in New York City’s Penn Station in 2025.\n\nThe labor-lite, tech-forward spa will serve commuters, neighborhood locals, and tourists with wellness-focused retail, autonomous massage, and nail care services, enabling seamless and efficient experiences for time-crunched New York City travelers.\n\n**Life Sciences & Biosurveillance -- XpresCheck® and HyperPointe™**The Company’s XpresTest, Inc. subsidiary (“XpresCheck”), in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and Ginkgo Bioworks, currently operates 7 biosurveillance stations in 6 of the nation’s busiest airports. \n\nXpresTest, Inc. began conducting bio surveillance monitoring with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in collaboration with Concentric by Ginkgo BioWorks in 2021. The CDC's Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance (TGS) program is a flexible, multimodal platform that consists of complementary approaches of sample collection from arriving international travelers at U.S. airports, including voluntary nasal swabbing, aircraft wastewater, air monitoring and airport wastewater sampling to enhance early detection of new SARS-CoV-2 variants and other pathogens, and fill gaps in global surveillance.\n\nAdditionally, the Company began reporting operating results for HyperPointe within its XpresCheck business. Beginning in June 2020, and following its acquisition by XWELL in January 2022, HyperPointe’s management team and suite of services and technology have been utilized to develop and deploy the technological infrastructure necessary to scale the growth of the XpresCheck business. HyperPointe’s experience in this space continues to play a critical role in the expansion of ongoing biosurveillance efforts created in partnership with Ginkgo BioWorks and the CDC.\n\n**_Liquidity and Financial Condition_** As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $4.4 million of cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash), approximately $11.7 million in marketable securities, total current assets of approximately $19.5 million, and no long-term debt.\n\nOn August 8, 2024, the Company closed its registered direct offering priced at a premium to market for the issuance and sale of an aggregate of 652,705 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a purchase price of $2.18 per share. The gross proceeds to the Company from the offering were approximately $1.4 million, before deducting offering expenses payable by the Company.

(Nasdaq: XWEL) (“XWELL” or the “Company”), an authority in wellness solutions for people on the go, today announced the appoint of Ezra T. Ernst as Chief Executive Officer. Ernst succeeds Scott Milford, who will serve in a consultative role through the end of 2024.\n\n“Ezra brings the combination of operational and strategic excellence to the position, while also having a deep understanding of the company, the industry and key partners,” said XWELL Chairman of the Board, Bruce Bernstein. “This strategic leadership change will propel XWELL forward in its next phase. I trust that Ezra will deliver purpose-driven growth for XWELL through continued innovation and expansion, ultimately returning the company to profitability. We appreciate Scott’s hard work transforming the company into what it is today.”\n\nErnst has a strong track record with more than 30 years of experience driving revenue, developing strategic partnerships and cultivating operational excellence. Most recently he served as CEO of XWELL brands XpresCheck® and HyperPointe™ since January 2022 and March 2020, respectively.\n\nErnst has successfully increased revenue and reputational awareness through his leadership of XpresCheck where he developed the Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance (TGS) program with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The TGS program has expanded from a small pilot program leveraging XpresCheck’s leading COVID-19 testing program and HyperPointe’s marketing expertise to a more permanent part of the United States’ biosecurity infrastructure.\n\n“I am excited for the opportunity to lead XWELL in the next chapter of its evolution,” said Ernst. “We are positioned for growth across our brands, and I am very confident in our people to carry through the vision and strategy we have developed.”\n\nErnst will build on the framework Milford created for the Company’s long-term success including XWELL’s out of airport strategy, its Naples Wax Center® acquisition, which increased the number of physical retail units and expanded innovative products and services, XpresSpa®’s tech-forward strategy and XpresCheck’s leadership in biosecurity.\n\nIn the near term, Ernst plans to evolve the Company’s current footprint in and out of the airport by further integrating technology across its portfolio. This includes the successful opening of XpresSpa at Philadelphia International Airport’s Terminal B and the upcoming launch of XpresSpa at New York Penn Station. Ernst will also continue to integrate HyperPointe to support XWELL more broadly as it seeks new marketing opportunities.\n\nErnst added, “I look forward to making meaningful progress through geographic expansion, acquisitions and technology, while also focusing on broadening the full potential of autonomous technology and catering to the preferences of today’s tech-savvy consumers. Thank you to the board of directors and the senior leadership team for your continued support and commitment to this company.”\n\nFor more information about this new offering, visit [xwell.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=z30DSf0JzZ7QA6-msqep8mRQORbAGYQuvKoeRwQ2obfqvmpSMlsaBddWcQaq2FKsNcfKTBEMQ839P_Bu2kaWAw==).\n\n**About XWELL, Inc.**XWELL, Inc.

Adopts Tax Benefits Preservation Plan\n\n##  News Release Details \n\n# \n\nXWELL, Inc. Adopts Tax Benefits Preservation Plan\n\n08/16/24\n\n[Download PDF](/node/14941/pdf)\n\nNEW YORK, Aug. 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XWELL, Inc. (Nasdaq: XWEL) (the “Company”) announced today that its Board of Directors has adopted a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan (the “Plan”) intended to preserve the value of certain of the Company’s tax attributes related to previously recorded net operating losses (the “Tax Attributes”).\n\nAs of August 16, 2024, the Company has Tax Attributes which may entitle the Company to reduce taxable income with respect to the Company’s current 2024 tax year. The Company currently has approximately $67.3 million of net operating losses available to offset taxable income. However, these Tax Attributes may be materially reduced or eliminated by a “change of ownership” of the Company under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, a change of ownership would occur if stockholders that own (or are deemed to own) at least 5% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock increased their cumulative ownership in the Company by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period.\n\nAs part of the Plan, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a dividend of one Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock purchase right (the “Rights”) on each outstanding share of the Company’s Common Stock. The dividend will be payable on August 26, 2024 to holders of record as of the close of business on August 26, 2024. Shares of the Company’s Common Stock issued after the record date will be issued together with the Rights.\n\nThe Rights are not currently exercisable and initially will trade only with the Company’s Common Stock. However, if any person or group acquires 4.99% or more of the Company’s Common Stock, or if a person or group that already owns 4.99% or more of the Company’s Common Stock acquires one or more additional shares of Common Stock, then, subject to certain exceptions, the Rights would separate from the Common Stock and become exercisable for shares of the Company’s Common Stock having a market value equal to twice the exercise price, resulting in significant dilution to the ownership interests of the acquiring person or group.\n\nThe Plan includes a procedure pursuant to which the Company’s Board of Directors may consider requests to exempt acquisitions of the Company’s Common Stock from the Plan if it determines that doing so would not limit or impair the availability of the Tax Attributes.\n\nThe Rights will expire on August 16, 2027. The Rights may also expire on an earlier date upon the occurrence of other events, including a determination by the Company’s Board of Directors that the Tax Attributes have been utilized or are no longer available, or that the Plan is no longer necessary to protect the Tax Attributes. The Plan also may be terminated at any time by the Company’s Board of Directors before the Rights become exercisable.\n\nThe Plan is similar to Section 382 rights plans adopted by many other public companies with significant Tax Attributes. The issuance of the Rights will not affect the Company’s reported earnings or loss per share and is not taxable to the Company or its stockholders.\n\nAdditional information regarding the Plan will be set forth in a Current Report on Form 8-K and in a Registration Statement on Form 8-A that the Company is filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\n\n**About XWELL, Inc.**\n\nXWELL, Inc.

(Nasdaq: XWEL) (\"XWELL\" or the \"Company\"), an authority in wellness solutions for people on the go, today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Recent Highlights:**\n\n  * XWELL delivered 2024 second quarter revenue growth of approximately 14% from the comparable quarter in 2023 driven by stronger demand for services and retail products.\n  * In June, XpresSpa opened a new spa in Philadelphia International Airport -- its first in a U.S. airport in more than 5 years and the first to leverage the Company’s “labor-lite, tech-forward” offering.\n  * In June, the CDC issued a new three-year biosurveillance program RFP which XpresTest is answering and, if awarded, will commence during the third quarter of 2024. It is anticipated that the value of this new contract will be similar to prior contracts.\n  * In May, Naples Wax began offering aesthetic services as part of its evolution as a full-service spa.\n  * In May, XpresSpa launched a program to introduce IV-hydration therapy into its spa locations.\n  * XWELL continues to focus on reducing its cost structure and returning to profitability including: \n    * Reducing cost of sales by approximately 11% when compared to the 2023 second quarter.\n    * Reducing general and administrative expenses by approximately 3% when compared to the 2023 second quarter.\n    * Reducing salaries and benefits by approximately 22% when compared to the 2023 second quarter.\n    * Reducing operating expenses by approximately 16% when compared to the 2023 second quarter.\n  * In August, XWELL continued to fuel its future growth plans by executing a $1.4 million registered direct offering, which was priced at a premium to market.\n\n\n\n“We continue to look towards the future, successfully implementing our strategy to balance our portfolio with growth outside the airport, and cost-effectively integrating innovative services and retail products into our offering,” commented Scott Milford, XWELL’s Chief Executive Officer. “At the same time, we remain laser-focused on returning to profitability and are pleased with the significant progress we’ve made reducing costs and operating expenses. Looking ahead, we remain focused on continuous improvement across our business, and we believe we’re well positioned to extend our collaboration with the CDC for our traveler-based SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance program.”\n\n**Travel Wellness Portfolio - XpresSpa®** XpresSpa is the leading airport retailers of wellness services and related products, with 33 locations in 16 airports globally.\n\nDuring the 2024 second quarter, XpresSpa opened a new location in Philadelphia International Airport (PHL).

Beginning in June 2020, and following its acquisition by XWELL in January 2022, HyperPointe’s management team and suite of services and technology have been utilized to develop and deploy the technological infrastructure necessary to scale the growth of the XpresCheck business.

(Nasdaq: XWEL) (“XWELL” or the “Company”), an authority in wellness solutions for people on the go, today announced that the notice materials submitted by CPC Pain & Wellness SPV, LLC (“CPC”), which purported to provide notice of CPC’s intent to nominate four candidates for election to the Company’s five-member Board of Directors (the “Board”) at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, is invalid. \n\nCPC, a special purpose vehicle that was recently formed by two principals of private equity firm Caydan Capital Partners, LLC, rapidly accumulated a 9.42% equity stake in XWELL last month and subsequently filed a Schedule 13D on June 17th without including specific details pertaining to its plans for the Company. The Company offered CPC opportunities to cure the deficiencies in its purported notice and went out of its way to provide clarity on what information CPC needed to submit to comply with the advance notice provisions of our plainly stated bylaws. Additionally, XWELL entered into a non-disclosure agreement with CPC to initiate discussions about a negotiated resolution that could be in the best interests of all stockholders. \n\nDespite the aforementioned efforts, CPC did not cure the deficiencies in its notice and opted to file litigation against XWELL in an apparent attempt to advance its own objectives. For instance, since receipt of the purported notice, XWELL has had reason to believe that CPC and its private equity partners are seeking to obtain control of a majority of the Board to engineer a transaction involving one of their underperforming affiliates in the pain and wellness space that has not been monetized via a reverse merger or sale (despite many attempts to do so). XWELL maintains that any such ‘Take-Under’ deal pursued by CPC could: \n\n  1. Severely undervalue the Company. \n  2. Significantly dilute current stockholders. \n  3. Siphon tremendous value to CPC, as well as its affiliates, at the expense of fellow stockholders, who would be deprived of an adequate control premium. \n\n\n\nIn violation of XWELL’s bylaws, CPC’s purported notice is bereft of even a passing reference of its plans. XWELL also maintains that CPC’s Schedule 13D disclosure is woefully deficient, representing a violation of the rules and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for such public filings. In particular, CPC appears to have failed to update the filing in a timely manner to account for its plans. XWELL calls on CPC to promptly update its Schedule 13D to transparently inform all of the Company’s stockholders and the broader investing public of its plans and related legal action, which XWELL intends to dispute vigorously. \n\nStockholders are not required to take any action at this time. However, XWELL encourages stockholders to be on alert and question any communications from CPC given the entity’s actions to date. \n\n**About XWELL, Inc.**\n\nXWELL, Inc.
