We believe\nthat the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner\nsimilar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance. The nature of\nthese exclusions is for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations. Since these adjusted financial measures\nand other non-GAAP metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in\nisolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to their corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures at other companies.\n10\nThree Months Ended\n%\nSeptember 30, Change\nAs\n2024 2023 Reported\nNet earnings $ 956.3 $ 859.4 11 %\nAdjustments:\nProvision for income taxes 279.9 233.4\nAll other interest expense (a) 20.5 18.0\nAll other interest income (a) (23.9) (18.2)\nTransformation initiatives — 0.7\nLegal settlements (b) (0.3) —\nAdjusted EBIT $ 1,232.5 $ 1,093.3 13 %\nAdjusted EBIT Margin 25.5 % 24.2 %\nProvision for income taxes $ 279.9 $ 233.4 20 %\nAdjustments:\nTransformation initiatives (c) — 0.2\nLegal settlements (c) (0.1) —\nAdjusted provision for income taxes $ 279.8 $ 233.6 20 %\nAdjusted effective tax rate (d) 22.6 % 21.4 %\nNet earnings $ 956.3 $ 859.4 11 %\nAdjustments:\nTransformation initiatives — 0.7\nIncome tax (benefit)/provision for transformation initiatives (c) — (0.2)\nLegal settlements (b) (0.3) —\nIncome tax (benefit)/provision for legal settlements (c) 0.1 —\nAdjusted net earnings $ 956.1 $ 859.9 11 %\nDiluted EPS $ 2.34 $ 2.08 13 %\nAdjustments:\nTransformation initiatives (c) — —\nLegal settlements (b) (c) — —\nAdjusted diluted EPS $ 2.33 $ 2.08 12 %\n11\n(a) In Adjusted EBIT, we include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy\nand interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be\nfundamental to the underlying operations of our business model.

The impact of acquisitions and dispositions is calculated by\nexcluding the current year revenues of acquisitions until the one year anniversary of the transaction and by excluding the prior year\nrevenues of divestitures for the one year period preceding the transaction. The impact of foreign currency is determined by calculating the\ncurrent year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year. The PEO segment is not impacted by acquisitions,\ndispositions or foreign currency.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nRevenue growth consolidated: 2024 2023\nEmployer Services 7 % 9 %\nPEO Services 7 % 3 %\nConsolidated revenue growth as reported 7 % 7 %\nAdjustments:\nImpact of acquisitions — % — %\nImpact of foreign currency — % — %\nConsolidated revenue growth, organic constant currency 7 % 7 %\nSegment:\nEmployer Services revenue growth as reported 7 % 9 %\nAdjustments:\nImpact of acquisitions — % — %\nImpact of foreign currency — % (1) %\nEmployer Services revenue growth, organic constant currency 7 % 8 %\nNote: Numbers may not foot due to rounding.\n12\nAutomatic Data Processing, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nFiscal 2024 to Fiscal 2025 Non-GAAP Guidance Reconciliation\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nFiscal 2025\nFiscal 2024 Outlook\nEarnings before income taxes / margin (GAAP) $ 4,872.3 25.4 % 20 to 40 bps\nAll other interest expense (a) 71.4 40 bps 15 bps\nAll other interest income (a) (97.0) (50) bps 15 bps\nTransformation initiatives (b) - FY24 5.4 - -\nTransformation initiatives - FY25 - - -\nLegal settlements - FY24 (4.0) - -\nWorkforce optimization - FY24 42.0 20 bps (20) bps\nAdjusted EBIT margin (Non-GAAP) $ 4,890.1 25.5 % 30 to 50 bps\nEffective tax rate (GAAP) 23.0 % 23.0 %\nTransformation initiatives (b) - FY24 - -\nTransformation initiatives - FY25 - -\nLegal settlements - FY24 - -\nWorkforce optimization - FY24 - -\nAdjusted effective tax rate (Non-GAAP) 23.0 % 23.0 %\nDiluted earnings per share (GAAP) $ 9.10 8% to 10%\nTransformation initiatives (b) - FY24 0.01 -\nTransformation initiatives - FY25 - -\nLegal settlements - FY24 (0.01) -\nWorkforce optimization - FY24 0.08 (1) %\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (Non-GAAP) $ 9.18 7% to 9%\n(a) In Adjusted EBIT, we include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and\ninterest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to\nthe underlying operations of our business model.

This morning, we reported strong first quarter results that included 7% revenue growth,\n130 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion and 12% adjusted EPS growth. I'm excited to share the considerable progress we made across\nour three strategic priorities in the quarter, but let me first begin with some additional financial highlights.\nWe had a solid start to the year from an Employer Services new business bookings perspective with record volume for a first quarter. This performance\nwas broad-based as our small business portfolio benefited from our continued strength in retirement services.\nOur mid-market and HR outsourcing businesses also showed good growth, and our international business maintained its strong momentum from\nlast year. Overall, HCM demand remained steady, and our new business pipelines were healthy at the end of the quarter.\nOur Q1 Employer Services retention rate exceeded our expectations and only declined slightly. Our overall client satisfaction score reached a new\nall-time high for a first quarter, driven by improvements in our mid-market, enterprise and HR outsourcing businesses. Moving forward, we expect\nour record client satisfaction levels to continue to support our strong retention results.\nEmployer Services pays per control increased 2% for the first quarter as our clients continue to hire employees at a moderate pace. Finally, PEO\nrevenue growth of 7% and average worksite employee growth of 3% for the first quarter exceeded our expectations as strong PEO new business\nbookings growth more than offset the impact of modest further deceleration in PEO pays per control growth.\nWe are very proud of our strong first quarter financial results and equally excited by the significant progress made across our strategic business\npriorities. As the needs of today's global workforce continues to shift, employers require dynamic workforce management solutions that will help\nthem maintain compliance and flexibility while engaging their employees. We continuously aim to offer solutions that will solve our clients' complex\nbusiness challenges.\nAs part of this approach, we recently acquired WorkForce Software, a leading workforce management solutions provider that specializes in\nsupporting large global enterprises. This acquisition expands our current array of time and attendance, absent management and scheduling tools\nand strengthens our ability to win in a highly attractive market.\nWorkForce Software is a leader in serving large complex organizations and their robust solutions can adapt to the dynamic needs of today's\nemployers by offering tools that create resiliency, help drive optimal performance and make managing a global workforce easy.\nWe are thrilled to bring together these capabilities as well as their trusted global support organization to broaden our suite of workforce management\nsolutions. Based in Michigan, WorkForce Software serves over 1,000 clients in more than 100 countries, including many well-known global brands.\nI'd like to officially welcome the members of the WorkForce Software team to ADP. Together, we will continue to drive the future of WorkForce\nmanagement innovation, and we are looking forward to all the great things we will accomplish.\nAdditionally, in September, we introduced ADP Lyric, our flexible, intelligent and human-centric global HCM platform. Lyric is the new name for\nour Next Gen HCM offering, which is designed to meet the evolving needs of the modern workforce.\nThis is a differentiated offering, combining global HR, global payroll and global service to adapt to unique structures and workloads and to offer\nemployers a human-centric approach to managing their people. Thanks to its integrated generative AI technology and the power of ADP's\nunmatched data set, Lyric provides insights and intelligence like predictive analytics and anomaly detection to provide clients with personalized\nrecommendations.\n3\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

It can support payroll in over 75 countries today, and we are focused on expanding its international reach moving forward.\nFollowing its successful launch at this year's HR Tech Conference, we are seeing very strong interest in Lyric, and we look forward to sharing our\nfuture progress with you. The acquisition of WorkForce Software and the introduction of Lyric position us to provide our enterprise clients with a\nunique global HR, payroll, time and service solution.\nWe continue to invest in generative AI capabilities to enhance the experience of our clients and empower our associates. During the first quarter,\nwe expanded access to our robust generative AI-based service tools, which are designed to bring speed to our service interactions and improve\nthe client experience.\nThese tools seamlessly integrate productivity-enhancing technologies like call summarization, virtual knowledge assist and guided workflows for\nour associates so they can best support our clients. We expanded the use of these tools to our associates, supporting our small business clients in\nthe first quarter. Early feedback is impressive, and we look forward to continuing along this journey to drive productivity gains and even higher\nclient satisfaction.\nWe're also excited to share that we recently launched intelligent workflow automation technology in Workforce Now. These dynamic workflows\ndeliver a personalized and satisfying employee experience at pivotal moments in an employee's career like onboarding, while at the same time,\ndramatically reducing manual work for HR practitioners.\nThis functionality enhances the experience of mid-market clients and their employees on our Workforce Now platform, and we look forward to\nadding similar capabilities to our other HCM platforms over time. These meaningful steps collectively demonstrate our continued focus on our\nthree strategic priorities, which are: to lead with best-in-class HCM technology; provide unmatched expertise in outsourcing; and benefit our clients\nwith our global scale. We remain confident in our ability to advance our strategic goals, drive our competitive differentiation and deliver strong\nfinancial results.\nAnd with that, I'd like to take a moment to recognize our associates whose efforts and outstanding performance are positioning us to consistently\ndeliver for our clients and our shareholders.\nThank you all. And now I'll turn it over to Don.\nDonald Mcguire - ADP Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some more color on our results for the first quarter and then update our fiscal 2025\noutlook which now includes our WorkForce Software acquisition and our recent debt issuance.\nLet me begin with our Employer Services results and outlook. ES segment revenue increased 7% on both a reported basis and organic constant\ncurrency basis coming in ahead of our expectations. As Maria shared, ES new business bookings were solid to start the year. With a stable demand\nbackdrop and healthy pipelines, we are maintaining our 4% to 7% full year growth guidance. ES retention declined slightly in Q1 versus the prior\nyear, but still came in modestly better than anticipated.\nWe are continuing to forecast a 10 basis points to 30 basis points decline in full year retention based on an expected increase in small business\nlosses due to higher out of business rates. ES pays per control growth of 2% met our expectation for the quarter, and we continue to forecast 1%\nto 2% growth for the full year.\nClient funds interest revenue increased a bit more than we anticipated in Q1, helped by stronger average client funds balance growth. While the\nyield curve has broadly declined since our last update, this impact is partially offset by our stronger client funds balance growth.\nFor the full year, we are reducing our client funds interest revenue forecast by $10 million. However, we are maintaining our net impact from client\nfunds extended investment strategy forecast as lower reinvestment rates are almost entirely offset by lower average borrowing costs.\n4\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Our ES margin increased 260 basis points in Q1, driven by both operating leverage and continued\nclient funds interest revenue growth. On a full year basis, we are adjusting our ES margin outlook to incorporate the expected impact of the\nacquisition, and now forecast an increase of 40 basis points to 60 basis points for fiscal '25.\nMoving on to the PEO. Revenue growth of 7% and average worksite employee growth of 3% exceeded our expectations. As Maria mentioned,\nstrong PEO new business bookings growth more than offset the impact of further modest deceleration in PEO pays per control growth.\nAs a result, we now expect fiscal 2025, PEO revenue growth of 5% to 6% and average worksite employee growth of 2% to 3%, which at the midpoint\nof the ranges are each up 50 basis points from our prior forecast. We continue to expect PEO pays per control growth to be slower than ES pays\nper control growth in fiscal '25.\nPEO margin decreased 80 basis points in Q1, which is less than we anticipated, due primarily to stronger revenue growth. The margin decline versus\nlast year stemmed mainly from higher workers' compensation program costs and higher zero-margin benefits pass-through revenue growth. We\nnow expect PEO margin to be down between 70 basis points and 90 basis points in fiscal '25, which is 20 basis points better than our prior outlook.\nPutting it all together, we are increasing our fiscal 2025, consolidated revenue growth forecast to 6% to 7%. While we anticipate future revenue\nsynergies from the WorkForce Software acquisition, we expect it to pressure our adjusted EBIT margin this fiscal year.\nWe now forecast full year adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 30 basis points to 50 basis points. In addition, in September, we enhanced our capital\nstructure by issuing $1 billion in 10-year notes. And subsequently, our corporate interest expense will increase by about $40 million for fiscal 2025.\nWe continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of around 23%. After incorporating the anticipated impacts of the acquisition and our recent\ndebt issuance, we now forecast 7% to 9% adjusted EPS growth for fiscal 2025.\nThank you, and I'll now turn it back to Michelle for Q&A.\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Bryan Bergin, TD Cowen.\nZachary Ajzenman - TD Cowen - Analyst\nThis is Zack Ajzenman on for Bryan. First question is on Employer Services, just the demand and bookings backdrop. If you can just dig into the\nareas of strength in Q1, and kind of how it progressed through the quarter? And then we have a follow-up.\nMaria Black - ADP Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer\nSure, Zack. Thanks for joining us today. So demand overall, we feel good about it. We feel good about the HCM demand. We had a great sales\nquarter. We have a great sales and marketing organization. It was solid, and it was broad-based.\nI think from a demand perspective, I called out a few areas of strength, one of which is the Retirement Services offering in our down market. We\ncontinue to execute there against opportunity and our strategy. And so excited to see them continue the great progress.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

And then we saw continued strength in international. I think that's a great story\non the heels of the strength that we saw in international, all 4 quarters last year.\nSo really pleased with the broad-based result. And I think the demand remains pretty consistent. I think the down-market, companies are still hiring\nand they're buying. I think in the mid-market, certainly not getting any easier. It's still very complex.\nWe do also have those offerings beyond tech-only in the mid-market that extend our reach into the HR outsourcing offerings. And you heard the\nPEO result was solid as well. So -- and again, we're always watching what's happening in the global space, which is why we continue to be as pleased\nas we are with the execution on new business bookings in international.\nZachary Ajzenman - TD Cowen - Analyst\nGot it. And then a follow-up on PEO retention. So it sounds like worksite employee retention came in above plan in Q1. As we think about the\nbalance of the year, are you still anticipating an improvement in PEO worksite employee retention year-over-year growth for fiscal '25? And is it an\noffset -- enough to offset the decel and pays per control?\nMaria Black - ADP Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer\nSo the biggest contributor to the outperformance in worksite employees, average worksite employees was really bookings, right? So we did have\na strong first quarter, albeit the first quarter for PEO is generally relatively light on the year, so we still have to execute that.\nAnd that is the focus. We've been laser-focused on accelerating PEO new business bookings. That remains to be the case. That was the biggest\ncontributor, and that is the piece that can really overcome the deceleration in worksite employee pays per control or PEO pays per control. Retention\ndoes contribute.\nIt contributes very modestly compared to new business bookings. That's really what we saw in fiscal '24 as well. We saw that retention was\nyear-on-year up, but only contributed modestly and that's really what we expect for '25 as well.\nDonald Mcguire - ADP Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Maybe just to add some color to the -- maybe just add a little bit of color to that. In terms of the pays for control growth, we do expect to see\npays per control growth lower in PEO than in Employer Services. That's what we called out -- the outside of the year. We're going to talk about, ES,\nI'm sure, later. But PEO is definitely showing growth but slowing growth.\nOperator\nAshish Sabadra, RBC Capital Markets.\nDavid Paige Papadogonas - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst\nThis is David Paige on for Ashish. I was wondering if we could double-click on the WorkForce Software business. Maybe what's the financial profile\nin terms of revenue growth, the annualized revenue and the margin profile? And then a follow-up after that.\n6\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

So David, maybe I'll let Don talk through the financial element, but maybe before we do that, it's prudent to just kind of comment on the\nstrategic rationale behind the acquisition. As you can imagine, we're pretty excited to have the opportunity to speak to it today. This is a company\nWorkForce Software that we've been aware of for quite some time, aware of their capabilities, aware of how they're able to support some very\nmarquee clients.\nI think we talked about in the prepared remarks, they have -- they serve about 1,000 companies around the world. These are marquee well-known\nglobal brands. So we're really excited about the product set. We're excited about the clients.\nBut I have to tell you, too, we're pretty excited about the organization as a whole. I was out there on October 15, a couple of weeks ago for day one.\nAnd in addition to a fantastic product and a pretty marquee set of clients, it's also an incredible team.\nIt's a great team with great domain expertise in this space. And so we're really excited to add this deep expertise to ADP's overall workforce\nmanagement solutions and how we incorporate that with our organization to really drive further opportunities. So this is a growth story for us\nabout the future, and we're pretty strategically excited about it. But with that, I'll let Don kind of walk you through the financial implications.\nDonald Mcguire - ADP Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So David, I expect we're going to get this question later on. So maybe I'll just elaborate a little bit more on the impact of the WorkForce\nSoftware acquisition. So if you look at the -- we took up our revenue expectation, but on the ES side, out of the 1% increase to our consolidated FY\n'25 revenue growth outlook, about half of that is coming from WorkForce Software, and the remainder is coming from the strong results in the rest\nof the business.\nWe had a good first quarter. And we're certainly expecting to see strength throughout the balance of the year as well. And this is certainly more a\nstrategic transaction for us, as Maria just went through, gives us the ability to serve complex global companies with a much broader offer. Now\nHCM payroll service and now, time and attendance or WorkForce management in that marketplace.\nAnd so when we move on and look at some of the additional expenses and some of the things that are causing some drag on our EPS expectations,\nwe only closed the transaction about two weeks ago. So we're not going to be terribly precise on this point.\nSo we do expect some modest pressure. It's important to remember the biggest pieces to are coming from debt intangibles, integration of the\ndeal cost itself. So nothing unusual. I do want to point out that this is a very -- it's a relatively small company with a relatively large capability.\nAnd when I say that, we're not expecting a significant amount of expense synergies from this transaction because they run themselves pretty lean\nand they're pretty effective. And then when you move on and you look at what we did in our -- to the midpoint of our ES margin and our adjusted\nEBIT margin were down 60 points and 30 points, respectively. And so the question could be is that all from WorkForce Software as anticipated\ndrag? And the answer is actually more of the drag is coming from WorkForce Software.\nSo the other businesses are compensating somewhat for that. So we do anticipate about a 0.5 point of EBIT margin pressure as a result of the\ntransaction in fiscal '25. So if you -- if we look at the EPS growth as well, it's expected to be a bit more than 1% of the drag. So we've outperformed\nin other parts of the business, so we overcome some of that. And as I said earlier, most of the dilution is coming from integration costs, amortization\nof intangibles and interest expense.\nAnd then I'll jump ahead of the anticipated question I have, and that is when do we think this is going to be accretive to ADP? And I think the short\nanswer is, give us a couple of quarters to get things in line, and we'll come back and we'll be very excited about sharing success stories and client\nwins over the next couple of quarters, but it's a bit early given this transaction only closed about two weeks ago.\n7\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Baird & Co. - Analyst\nFirst of all, congratulations on the first quarter results, really strong particularly. Maria, you mentioned client satisfaction scores are at all-time highs.\nCan you talk a little bit about some of the factors that drove that? And then I'd like to do a follow-up on WorkForce Software.\nMaria Black - ADP Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, Mark, and thank you very much for the congratulations. We're pretty excited about the quarter as well. To the NPS question that you had.\nSo what I mentioned in the prepared remarks is we had an all-time high for a first quarter, and we did see strength.\nAgain, it was broad-based. I think some of the call-outs that we've been making over the last couple of years, specifically as it relates to the business\nthat really have been broad-based, and it's been near record levels really kind of across the various businesses. I think we've talked quite a bit about\nthe mid-market.\nWe've talked about the last couple of years that we've been speaking to the mid-market. A lot of that, Mark, comes from the investments we've\nbeen making in product, the investments we've been making in some of the tools that we provide to our service organization.\nI mentioned some of those as we extend the reach into the product and in Workforce Now. During the remarks, I also mentioned some of the other\nwork that we've done in SBS specifically, the extension of generative AI tools into the SBS service organization.\nAnd again, the thesis behind it and what it's proving itself to be true is the more we invest in making things easy for our clients and frictionless, the\ngreater our NPS results, and it seems to be resulting in pretty favorable retention results as well. So from an NPS perspective, on a year-on-year\nbasis, just kind of rounded out.\nWe did see the mid-market, enterprise and HR outsourcing businesses from a year-on-year perspective kind of have those the biggest improvements.\nBut from a broad-based perspective, I would say almost every business is at record levels. And year-on-year, it was a record for a first quarter.\nMark Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. - Analyst\nGot it. We had a chance to demo the WalkMe tool within Lyric, and that was pretty impressive. I imagine that's going to end up continuing the\nupward surge in terms of the NPS. Wondering with regards to WorkForce Software, what's the integration plan?\nI mean the strategic rationale seems fairly obvious. But just how long -- how soon will we be able to see you fully integrate them in terms of a\ngo-to-market plan? When will you start doing joint sales? How much of their client base, which does include similar marquee already ADP clients?\nWhat are the opportunities with regards to potentially penetrating some of those that aren't? Can you talk a little bit about whether it's going to\nbe domestic as well as international in terms of when you go to market and how quickly you can do that?\nMaria Black - ADP Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, sure. By the way, I love every single one of your questions, Mark, because they're the exact same questions that we've all been asking ourselves\nas we looked at this great organization and also post the signature, if you will, as we really started comparing kind of what we all have. And so I\nthink it's probably too early to comment on the exact overlap of clients, things of that nature.\n8\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

You can only imagine that there's overlap there.\nSo what we're focused on is exactly what you're referring to, which is adding this offering into our global and enterprise call it, go-to-market growth\nopportunity. We're pretty excited, and you mentioned Lyric and what you saw with WalkMe with Lyric. I hope we get to the Lyric conversation\ntoday because we're really excited about where that is on the heels of HR tech. If you imagine marrying Lyric to the great story now of WorkForce\nSoftware, that's an exciting opportunity for us as we extend our reach into that global MNC, call it, enterprise space.\nSo that is the intention. It is an offer that's where it sits today. I think it does add to the plethora of offerings that ADP does have across our workforce\nmanagement solutions. So if you imagine, we have products already in that space. We also have partnerships in that space.\nWe have products in the mid-market. We also have partnerships there. And certainly, we have time and attendance offerings also in the down\nmarket, inclusive of, I think we have well over almost 100 marketplace partners in the down-market.\nSo this offering is going to be a great addition to our overall suite, specifically in that global enterprise space. And that is a growth story for us, and\nit's married directly to our Lyric excitement. And so that's the intent, and we're working through each and every one of the questions you asked as\nwe speak.\nOperator\nScott Wurtzel, Wolfe Research.\nScott Wurtzel - Wolfe Research - Analyst\nI wanted to go back to the to PEO segment to start, and thought the results there were very encouraging, especially on the bookings side. So I\nwould love to hear just a little bit about that bookings outperformance. And has there been any sort of change to the sales strategy, to your benefits\npackaging and offering? A little bit of a combination of both? Any color on that would be very helpful.\nMaria Black - ADP Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer\nSure. I think it's intense focus and execution. And so I think the team has been very focused. We've been speaking about this since the strangeness\nin the PEO post pandemic. We've been very focused on reaccelerating bookings. And so I think it's great execution by the team. I think the offering,\nthe value proposition, and I've been pretty bullish about this. Well, probably since about 1997. But listen, the PEO value proposition, it continues\nto only gain in strength. You mentioned health offerings and things of that nature that sits squarely in that space.\nIf you are a company of the target market of our PEO, in the industries that we target with our PEO offering here at ADP, you need the types of\nthings that the PEO offers. That's best-in-class health benefits. It's a competitive workers' compensation program. It's best-in-class retirement\nservices offerings.\nAnd so I think continuing to lean into that value proposition, and as I always say, and I said it earlier today, it's not getting any easier for those types\nof clients to be employers that's only getting more complex. And so I think we're aligning our sales organization to be laser-focused on it, and I\nthink it's a byproduct of strong execution.\n9\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up on the WorkForce Software acquisition. And as we sort of think about maybe incremental revenue\nopportunities, I mean is there -- I know it's an enterprise-focused solution. Is there an opportunity to maybe also bring this down to serve your\nmid-market customers as well?\nMaria Black - ADP Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer\nSo again, I think that's in the same bucket as Mark's question. I think that is a big piece of what we are working through at this time. I think they\nhave, across their thousand clients, they certainly have clients in that space. I think, again, the way I sort through it, if you again go back to the big\nplethora as I use that word to describe the varied offerings we have across each segment, down-market, mid-market, upmarket. Across each one\nof the global businesses -- the in-country offerings. In fact, we were not too long ago, actually bought a attendance offering in Asia Pac.\nAnd so we have organic and we have proprietary offerings. We partner and we go to market in this giant array of offerings and how we sort through\nthat. I think the easiest way that I think about it is client by client. And so I think we kind of put the client at the center, making sure that we are\nallowing the best possible solutions for our clients. And certainly, as we absorb WorkForce Software's offerings into our ecosystem of time and\nattendance, we will be taking a close look at the mid-market clients and making sure that -- call it, client by client, they have the right offering at\nthe right time.\nOperator\nSamad Samana, Jefferies.\nSamad Samana - Jefferies - Analyst\nI'll echo the congrats on a good quarter. Don, maybe first one for you. Just as I think about the size of the WorkForce deal, it's one of your bigger\ntransactions. Any signal in that, that we should take whether that's the company willing to be more acquisitive or if multiples are in a state where\nADP is maybe ramping up M&A more broadly overall? Or is this a one-off as part of a strategy or kind of a broader signal? And then I have a follow-up\nfor Maria.\nDonald Mcguire - ADP Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nOkay. So thanks for the question. Yes, in terms of absolute dollars, definitely one of the larger acquisitions or the largest acquisition ADP has ever\ndone. Although I think the company is a lot bigger than it was when we did some of those acquisitions a number of years back. So I think it fits in\nsquarely. I don't think our M&A -- be more precise than that. Our M&A strategy hasn't changed. We look for opportunities, and we've been looking\nfor opportunities for quite some time, but we need to make sure that they're additive.\nWe need to make sure they complement our offer and they don't complicate our offer. Spent a lot of time over the last 10 years or so, cleaning up\nour portfolio and making sure we get fewer platforms to do the same thing. And so looking at things that are additive to us, are in good tight\nadjacencies as this acquisition was and making sure that the business model, the recurring revenue model is particularly important to us the way\nwe go to market. Looking at all those things is important and will continue to be important to us. So we will continue to look. And if things show\nup that we think are going to be additive to us and we have an opportunity, we'll move again. But certainly, we haven't really changed our philosophy\nat all on how we approach and what we're looking for in terms of M&A.\n10\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

And then, Maria, just maybe a question on Lyric. This is something that investors have talked to us a lot about. Just thinking about how it\nbuilds on Lifion, which was a focus before and with the rebranding, I guess the question we've gotten is, is this -- what was the evolutionary or\nrevolutionary moment that led to the rebranding now? Is it product market fit is finally right, and maybe there's an inflection that we're reaching?\nIs it about -- from a go-to-market perspective, like what led to it now at this particular moment? And should we see maybe an inflection in demand\ngoing forward?\nMaria Black - ADP Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer\nI'm so glad you asked Samad. I've been excited to talk about Lyric for quite some time. So just to level set, just everyone's clear, Lyric is the new\nname for Next Gen HCM. And I think we're all tired of saying Next Gen HCM. I think that was part of it. But all kidding aside, listen, we're -- we couldn't\nbe more thrilled to bring ADP Lyric HCM into the market.\nPersonally, I love the name. I think it's a name that evokes emotion. It speaks to the rhythm of what it looks like to be a worker in today's environment\nand making sure that's something that perhaps was static in the past, that didn't have the right type of Lyric to it ultimately comes alive with the\nname. And so I think it's the right name at the right time. I think to answer the why now, I think the world is ready for this next offer of HCM in this\nspace.\nThis product, it's flexible, it's intelligent. It's designed with humanity in mind. It's human-centric and its design is how we speak about it. And that\nis groundbreaking and that is orchestrated really around the person. And what that allows for things, as I mentioned earlier, such as flexible\nworkflows.\nIt allows for inserting generative AI that can drive everything from anomaly detection to nudges. And so it is a unique offer and that it is married\nto, call it, the other strengths of ADP. It's a global HCM, global payroll and global service, that's unique, and we're pretty excited.\nAnd so I think part of it is the market is ready. I think the other part is we're ready. And so as we unveil this, there's been tremendous demand from\nthe clients. I think we saw in the heels of HR Tech. We saw great analyst reviews.\nMark just mentioned seeing some of the functionality. And so I think the buzz is out there. We see that also in the pipelines but -- as you can imagine,\nit's still early days. So it's going to take some time until it contributes to the overall ADP financials. But from a product perspective, it's the right\nproduct at the right time with the right name. We're pretty excited to lean into that growth story. Marry it now to the WorkForce Software offering\nthat we're folding in. I think it's a great growth opportunity for ADP.\nOperator\nRamsey El-Assal, Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal - Barclays - Analyst\nRetention continues to outperform expectations. Can you update us on the drivers here, new products, technology, maybe fewer SMB bankruptcies?\nI'm not sure if that's still an important driver. And also, what was the retention rate in the quarter?\nMaria Black - ADP Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer\nSure. So I think happy to talk about the drivers. I mentioned some of them earlier. Listen, all of the things that we're doing, best-in-class service,\nthe investments we make into our product set, it is yielding a better experience. You see that directly on the NPS. NPS correlates to retention.\n11\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

I will say that from an outperformance perspective in the first quarter, we did see,\nwhile retention was down slightly or declined slightly, we did see that the SBS or the small businesses held. And so our belief in how we're looking\nat the outlook for the rest of the year is that while we are almost normalized back to kind of the out of business rates from fiscal '19, we're not all\nthe way normalized.\nAnd so we do still expect that there could be some pullback. Part of how we've also modeled it, so many of our businesses last year specifically,\nwere at record highs on the retention. So I think we modeled kind of assuming that those businesses were at record highs, and we're assuming\nsome pullback in the down market, specifically as it relates to [out] of business.\nListen, we didn't see that in the first quarter. We're hoping that between the strength in small business, kind of the environment, coupled with\nstrong execution on our strategic road map around best-in-class products and best-in-class service will ultimately yield continued favorability. But\nwe believe at this time that the retention guide is prudent.\nRamsey El-Assal - Barclays - Analyst\nGreat. And a follow-up for me then is on PEO margins, they came in better than expected in the quarter and you listed your full year margin\nexpectations for the segment. Could you elaborate on the main drivers there? And also for the full year, are you anticipating any reserve releases\naround workers' comp. As I recall, I don't think that (inaudible) in last year at this time so I was curious.\nDonald Mcguire - ADP Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So Ramsey, firstly, the PEO margins were certainly better and really based on the stronger revenue that we had in the quarter. So stronger\nrevenue based on stronger worksite employee growth and also some help from rates -- wage rates. So that was really the biggest driver for the\nimprovement in margin in PEO. We did have a small release of the $4 million in the quarter. And certainly, that contributed a little bit as well, but\nwe are not anticipating to see releases for workers' compensation reserves as we did in prior years. So that is not something that we factored into\nour balance for the forecast. So strong worksite employees, strong growth in wage rates, strong growth in margin.\nOperator\nTien-Tsin Huang, JPMorgan.\nTien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan - Analyst\nI just want hoping Maria, you can elaborate on the strong pipeline comment. Any surprises or change in visibility across all of your markets, any\nchange in decision-making? I know we get a lot of questions up market around the elections. Can we see a little bit of a pause before we get back\nto normal, that kind of thing?\nMaria Black - ADP Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer\nSo the answer to your question is really no change. So we exited the fourth quarter. We talked about strong pipelines. We're exiting this quarter,\nfeeling confident in strong pipelines. We haven't seen any changes in buying behaviors as it relates to any of the things that are happening across\nthe world, if you will.\nThat's not to suggest that we're not keeping a watchful eye. I think we've spoken about deal cycle, specifically in the upmarket because as you\nmentioned it, that's where a lot of the questions come in the space. And I think we're in that new normal. I think it looks like it used to back in the\npre-pandemic.\n12\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Listen, as always, every quarter has a little bit of ebb and flow as it relates to some businesses. But I think\noverall, the strength was broad-based exiting the fourth quarter, exiting the first quarter and the strength on the pipeline side is also broad-based.\nAnd just a reminder, pipelines look different. In the down market, it's about net new appointments, it's about activities. It's about those things in\nthe mid-market and into the enterprise space. Obviously, these are year-on-year pipeline compares and we feel solid about the pipeline.\nTien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan - Analyst\nTerrific. Just my quick follow-up. I know Mark and others asked about cross-sell potential synergies with WorkForce Software, but it's got some\nreally nice logos going to the site when you first announced this. So is cross-sell an important consideration and decision to bring the asset in?\nMaria Black - ADP Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer\nI think -- and by the way, of course, those logos are also very exciting and the many logos, many would be familiar with from a marquee brand\nperspective. I think how we go to market together is an exciting story. So some of that will be the continued way that this company has been able\nto execute and win really marquee clients in the marketplace. I'd like to think it only helps them to have the scale and the brand of ADP behind\nthem.\nAnd so in a more simple way to say it, if you think about global marquee clients going out to RFPs, the exciting part is we're going to get invited\nto all of their parties. And hopefully, we get -- they get invited to all of our parties. And I think the strength between their product and our distribution\nand our scale and our brand, I think, leads us to be very optimistic on the growth narrative.\nOperator\nJason Kupferberg, Bank of America.\nCaroline Latta - BofA Securities - Analyst\nThis is Caroline Latta on for Jason. I just had a question on generative AI. I know you mentioned progress on rolling out some of those initiatives.\nDo you have any call-outs on potential further investment and cadence of that over the coming year?\nDonald Mcguire - ADP Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nCaroline, thanks for the question. No real -- I'll start with no real call-out on further investments. We are continuing to invest modestly as we've\nshared over the last few quarters. And we are continuing to see good results, maria touched on some of those earlier. Certainly, some of the call\nsummarization tools that have been deployed already are showing good results. We've seen good results in our sales area, things -- setting\nappointments, deciding which appointments to go to preparing for appointments, coaching salespeople when they're in live calls, and we're\ncontinuing to see opportunities and success in our technology area, coding and some of the Co-pilot tools that are available there. So really not a\nlot of incremental investment, really just continuing the course and looking to get more and more returns on the investments we've made over\nthe coming quarters.\nOperator\nKartik Mehta, Northcoast Research.\n13\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

But I'm wondering\nas you look at KPIs for your customers, what do you think about the health of small businesses? And if you've seen any change over the last few\nmonths?\nMaria Black - ADP Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer\nSure. Kartik, so yes, listen, it's pretty close to being normalized. We're almost there. In terms of the health of the small businesses overall, we look\nat a lot of indexes. We look at other organizations that serve similar type of -- call it nondiscretionary offerings that we serve. I think overall health\nof small business is strong. There are a couple of watchout items.\nOne of the ones that we pay close attention to is new business formations. And so while it's down year-on-year and it's down even fiscal year-to-date,\nthat is a watch-out item. That said, it's still elevated. So it's elevated from where -- call it, used to sit, pre-pandemic.\nAnd so it's still arguably considered strong. So on one hand, it's strong. On the other hand, it's pulled back a tiny bit from the strength that it used\nto have. That's just one thing. But we look at all of these things. I think the general sentiment as it relates to demand across the down market and\nas it relates to the small business side is it continues to be strong. I think we spoke quite a bit about the down market last year, and we continue\nto see good execution among small businesses and overall strength.\nKartik Mehta - Northcoast Research - Analyst\nAnd Don, just a follow-up. Any thoughts on change of strategy for the [ full ] portfolio? I know yields have been coming up a little bit. But I'm\nwondering if there's any thoughts on maybe changing some of the duration or just any other changes you might want to do for the portfolio based\non kind of yield?\nDonald Mcguire - ADP Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nNo, Kartik, we've looked at that, and we think we benefited significantly on our laddering that we've done over the last 20 years or so. And we did\nhave a bit of opportunity cost, as we've shared over the last couple of years as we've been dealing with an inverted yield curve. But that yield curve\nis slowly starting to normalize. So we should expect to see more benefit.\nWe also called out in our -- in the prepared remarks, we are taking our investment or client fund interest number down by $10 million, but we think\nthe net impact -- because borrowing is less expensive now at the short end, we do think that we're going to be flat to our initial guidance for the\nyear. So we don't see any compelling reason to change the structure of our portfolio.\nOperator\nDan Dolev, Mizuho.\nDan Dolev - Mizuho - Analyst\nReally good results here. Just a quick housekeeping question. Would you be able to quantify how much of the EBIT drag as a result of any incremental\namortization?\n14\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

And I think industry\naverages are somewhere in the neighborhood of 30%. So you can go from there and look at a seven to eight-year amortization period and kind of\nfigure it out. I'm sure all of you have done it already anyway. But rough numbers, I think that would get you in the ballpark.\nDan Dolev - Mizuho - Analyst\nOkay. Got it. And just a quick follow-up. I mean you're doing really well on the top line. Can you maybe discuss a little bit of your pricing strategies\nand the pricing environment for the deals? And -- if you had already been asked. I joined late.\nDonald Mcguire - ADP Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nSo pricing, we have had 100 basis points to 150 basis points over the last couple of years. I think as inflation moderates somewhat, we're expecting\nto get closer to 100 basis points this year, and that's where we're sitting. So really no changes to pricing strategy since we spoke last time. And we'll\nmake a small color though on price. It had a small impact in our revenue for the quarter.\nWe do have a couple of European countries where in the mid and the upmarket, the price increases are tied to various inflation indices and those\nindices came in higher. So we did get a little bit of contribution from price that we weren't expecting, but not a significant amount, like literally in\nthe 10-bp range for the quarter, so nothing significant. But no real change, no change for our pricing strategy.\nOperator\nPete Christiansen, Citi.\nPeter Christiansen - Citi Investment Research - Analyst\nNice trends this quarter. One quick one on WorkForce Software and a bit of a housekeeping on top of that. Just curious, Maria, in terms of the -- I\nunderstand the strategic rationale, I totally understand. You're still working through things. But if we think about the opportunity and framing that,\nis it more about new logo adds from their customer set? Or do you see upside more a function of scaling their solutions on your existing base? Just\nthe hypothesis there on sizing the upside opportunity.\nMaria Black - ADP Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Thanks, Pete. I think the answer to your question is both, right? But I think scaling their opportunity, leveraging a lot of ADP's strength our\nscale, our distribution, our brand. I also look at this, the workforce management space, it's a sizable total addressable market, right? So if you look\nat it from a TAM perspective, the TAM sits in the billions. We serve a lot of that today. Some of those billions are obviously domestic. Some of those\nare in the international space.\nI also look at this as an area across the world that will continue to expand. And there I'm not talking about the next quarter or perhaps even the\nnext year, when you think about the needs of global companies over the next decade, if you will, across ADP and what companies will look at as\nthey try to solve for their global workforces in new ways and new places, I think this is an area that is going to continue to grow in demand and\nhaving an offering that can grow and expand as that demand expands, I think, is all about the growth story of ADP both, call it, in quarter this year,\nbut also about the future of the company.\nSo really excited to more meaningfully step into this space. And I think that's what it's about. But certainly continuing their successful growth and\nour successful growth in this space. And in an ideal world, the execution here looks like that one plus one equals three, right, not two.\n15\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

That makes a lot of sense there. And then a quick housekeeping modeling question for Don. Just curious, plans for the assumed debt\nfrom the transaction? And if you could potentially size the interest expense impact to earnings for us, that would be helpful.\nDonald Mcguire - ADP Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I guess I'd point you to our release. We issued $1 billion of notes earlier in the year at 4.75%, and this transaction was $1.2 billion. So you can\nimpute the interest there.\nOperator\nKevin McVeigh, UBS.\nKevin McVeigh - UBS - Analyst\nJust one on the WorkForce acquisition. Any sense as that business scales, how much revenue it can contribute versus, I guess, what the multiplier\neffect could potentially be off of the acquired revenues, you scale it across your existing client base?\nDonald Mcguire - ADP Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nGood question and certainly a question that we looked at when we're putting our business case together and making the decision to pursue this\ncompany. But as I said earlier, it's a little bit early to start drawing out the expectations here. The excitement is palpable.\nThe sales forces are able to work together. There are a lot of things you can't do until you actually have the deal signed. And so it's really been two\nweeks and a bit since that's happened. And I think the work teams are hard at it, trying to identify opportunities.\nAnd I think there's lots of opportunity, as Maria said earlier. We have clients they don't have, they have clients we don't have, and there's a whole\nbunch of new logos out there that we can go pursue. And I think the great technology that came with WorkForce Software with ADP's financial\nstrength behind it, and more certainty perhaps in a smaller company, is going to contribute to this growth here. So we're excited about it, and we\nthink there's going to be more, but a little bit early at this point to call out the numbers.\nOperator\nZachary Gunn, FT Partners.\nZachary Gunn - FT Partners - Analyst\nI just wanted to go back to Lyric for a second. I understand it's still smaller, going to take a bit to have a meaningful impact. Just wondering if there's\nany thought process of how long it will take before it starts to have a meaningful impact to numbers? And just any data points you can give around\nthat? I know last quarter, I think there was some commentary of client count increasing 30% year-over-year. So just any commentary there would\nbe great.\n16\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Zach, we're very excited about the live clients we have, and they continue to increase. And as Maria said, there was an awful lot of excitement\ncoming out of HR Tech in Las Vegas. So the pipeline has increased pretty dramatically. Lots of work to do. Once again, it's going to take a little bit\nof time to move the needle. $20 billion of revenue, we're trying to move that needle a lot. It takes a lot. So once again, give a little bit of time. And\nas we package up these offers, the Lyric and the WorkForce Software, along with our tax compliance and the other solutions we have, global payroll,\nwe're expecting good things. But once again, a little bit early to share specifics.\nOperator\nJames Faucette, Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette - Morgan Stanley - Analyst\nJust had a couple of, I guess, nuanced questions. First, last quarter, you had suggested that PEO pays per control would be lower than that of\nemployer services. With it down ticking this quarter, do you still believe there's growth in PEO pays per control this year?\nDonald Mcguire - ADP Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So the short answer is yes. We believe there's growth in PEO pays per control this year. There was growth in the quarter, and we expect it to\nbe continued growth, but we do expect it to be softer than the 2% at the high end that we have for Employer Services. So yes, growth; yes, lower\nthan Employer Services.\nJames Faucette - Morgan Stanley - Analyst\nOkay. Got it. I just want to make sure I understood that. And then following up -- and -- if I missed this, but did you quantify Employer Services\nbookings growth for the quarter specifically? And it sounds like you're still pretty constructive on that front, but how you think about that for the\nfull year range?\nDonald Mcguire - ADP Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nNo, we did not. We did not quantify for the quarter, and we're still sticking to our 4% to 7% guidance that we established at the outset of the year.\nAs you know, things can get lumpy. But Maria said, we had a record first quarter on bookings, new business bookings, and we're comfortable with\nwhere we landed, and we're happy with the pipelines. Demand is strong. So we're still thinking that 4% to 7% range.\nJames Faucette - Morgan Stanley - Analyst\nGot it. Got it. And just maybe just one last question there is, what are some of the swing factors that would push you towards one end of that range\neither to the upside or to the lower end?\nDonald Mcguire - ADP Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, it's all about execution. I think that demand remains strong. Demand for HCM remains strong, demand for payroll. We don't work in a\nnondiscretionary industry. People need what we have and what we sell. So we do think that demand is consistent, and we'll have to watch and\nsee how things go, and we've got one quarter behind us.\n17\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

But I can't think of any specific things other than massive macro changes, et cetera, which none\nof us are anticipating. Certainly, if we look at some of the GDP numbers, we look at the inflation numbers, we look at the labor numbers, they all\npoint to pretty solid and stable demand. So I think we're going to stick with our 4% to 7% for the time being.\nOperator\nThere are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Maria Black for closing remarks.\nMaria Black - ADP Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Michelle, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. I have to say it's not every day you get to get on and talk about such a solid quarter, both\nwith respect to the overall performance of the business, but also making meaningful steps in our strategic priority agenda. So really excited about\nthe quarter. I want to thank my team specifically. There's a lot that comes together to execute what we just did. I want to thank my team, I want to\nthank, obviously, the broader ADP organization as I did earlier, really proud of the execution across the entire company.\nAnd then once again, welcome to WorkForce Software.

Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its subsidiaries\nand variable interest entity (“ADP” or the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto are\nunaudited. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments, which\nare of a normal recurring nature, that are necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s interim financial results.\nThe Company has a grantor trust, which holds the majority of the funds provided by its clients pending remittance to employees\nof those clients, tax authorities, and other payees. The Company is the sole beneficial owner of the trust. The trust meets the\ncriteria in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810, “Consolidation” to be characterized as a variable interest entity\n(“VIE”). The Company has determined that it has a controlling financial interest in the trust because it has both (1) the power to\ndirect the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trust (including the power to make all\ninvestment decisions for the trust) and (2) the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the trust (in the\nform of investment returns) and, therefore, consolidates the trust. Further information on these funds and the Company’s\nobligations to remit to its clients’ employees, tax authorities, and other payees is provided in Note 6, “Corporate Investments\nand Funds Held for Clients.”\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and accumulated other comprehensive income that are reported\nin the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto.

Leases\nThe Company records leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, records the\ncurrent portion of operating lease liabilities within accrued expenses and other current liabilities and, separately, records long-\nterm operating lease liabilities. The difference between total ROU assets and total lease liabilities is primarily attributable to\nprepayments of our obligations and the recognition of various lease incentives.\nThe Company has entered into operating lease agreements for facilities and equipment. The Company's leases have remaining\nlease terms of up to approximately eleven years.\nThe components of operating lease expense were as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nOperating lease cost $ 27.5 $ 34.0\nShort-term lease cost 0.3 0.5\nVariable lease cost 6.6 3.2\nTotal operating lease cost $ 34.4 $ 37.7\nThe following table provides supplemental cash flow information related to the Company's leases:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nCash paid for operating lease liabilities $ 28.8 $ 30.5\nOperating lease ROU assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities $ 13.7 $ 26.9\nOther information related to our operating lease liabilities is as follows:\nSeptember 30, June 30,\n2024 2024\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years) 5 5\nWeighted-average discount rate 3.3 % 3.3 %\nCurrent operating lease liability $ 96.0 $ 92.2\n13\nAs of September 30, 2024, maturities of operating lease liabilities are as follows:\nNine months ending June 30, 2025 $ 82.4\nTwelve months ending June 30, 2026 98.5\nTwelve months ending June 30, 2027 85.2\nTwelve months ending June 30, 2028 64.7\nTwelve months ending June 30, 2029 42.2\nThereafter 76.9\nTotal undiscounted lease obligations 449.9\nLess: Imputed interest (37.8)\nNet lease obligations $ 412.1\nNote 8.

All intangible assets have finite lives and, as such, are subject to amortization. The weighted average remaining\nuseful life of the intangible assets is 5 years (6 years for software and software licenses, 3 years for customer contracts and lists,\nand 1 year for other intangibles). Amortization of intangible assets was $89.0 million and $95.7 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n14\nEstimated future amortization expenses of the Company's existing intangible assets are as follows:\nAmount\nNine months ending June 30, 2025 $ 327.7\nTwelve months ending June 30, 2026 $ 265.5\nTwelve months ending June 30, 2027 $ 195.1\nTwelve months ending June 30, 2028 $ 152.2\nTwelve months ending June 30, 2029 $ 124.0\nTwelve months ending June 30, 2030 $ 86.0\nNote 9. Short-term Financing\nThe Company has a $4.55 billion, 364-day credit agreement that matures in June 2025 with a one year term-out option. The\nCompany also has a $2.25 billion, five year credit facility that matures in June 2028 that contains an accordion feature under\nwhich the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. In\naddition, the Company also has a five year, $3.5 billion credit facility maturing in June 2029 that contains an accordion feature\nunder which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments.\nThe interest rate applicable to committed borrowings is tied to SOFR, the effective federal funds rate, or the prime rate\ndepending on the notification provided by the Company to the syndicated financial institutions prior to borrowing. The\nCompany is also required to pay facility fees on the credit agreements. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide\nliquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. The Company had no\nborrowings through September 30, 2024 under the credit agreements.\nThe Company's U.S. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis\nthrough the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been\ninvested in available-for-sale securities. This commercial paper program provides for the issuance of up to $10.3 billion in\naggregate maturity value. The Company’s commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard & Poor’s, Prime-1 (“P-1”) by\nMoody’s and F1+ by Fitch. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial\npaper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. At September 30, 2024, the Company had $4.4 billion of commercial paper\noutstanding, which was repaid in early October 2024. At June 30, 2024, the Company had no commercial paper borrowing\noutstanding. Details of the borrowings under the commercial paper program are as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nAverage daily borrowings (in billions) $ 4.8 $ 4.1\nWeighted average interest rates 5.3 % 5.3 %\nWeighted average maturity (approximately in days) 2 days 2 days\nThe Company’s U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are\nsometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally\nby government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already\nbeen invested in available-for-sale securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five\nbusiness days. At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company had $679.1 million and $385.4 million of outstanding\nobligations related to reverse repurchase agreements. All outstanding reverse repurchase obligations matured and were fully\npaid in early October 2024 and early July 2024, respectively. The Company has $7.3 billion available on a committed basis\nunder the U.S. reverse repurchase agreements. Details of the reverse repurchase agreements are as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nAverage outstanding balances (in billions) $ 3.8 $ 1.4\nWeighted average interest rates 5.3 % 5.3 %\n15\nNote 10. Debt\nThe Company issued four series of fixed-rate notes with staggered maturities of 7 and 10 years totaling $4.0 billion\n(collectively the “Notes”). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations, and interest is payable in arrears, semi-annually.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued $1.0 billion of senior notes due in 2034 bearing a\nfixed interest rate of 4.450%. In connection with the senior notes issuance, the Company terminated several derivative contracts\nin place to hedge exposure in changes in benchmark interest rates for the senior notes issued with an aggregate notional amount\ntotaling $1.0 billion (of which $400.0 million were executed during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $600.0\nmillion were executed on the day of issuance). Since these derivative contracts were classified as cash flow hedges, the\nunamortized loss of $12.5 million was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized to earnings\nover the life of the issued Notes as the interest payments are made.\nThe principal amounts and associated effective interest rates of the Notes and other debt as of September 30, 2024 and June 30,\n2024, are as follows:\nEffective September 30, June 30,\nDebt instrument Interest Rate 2024 2024\nFixed-rate 3.375% notes due September 15, 2025 3.47% $ 1,000.0 $ 1,000.0\nFixed-rate 1.700% notes due May 15, 2028 1.85% 1,000.0 1,000.0\nFixed-rate 1.250% notes due September 1, 2030 1.83% 1,000.0 1,000.0\nFixed-rate 4.450% notes due September 9, 2034 4.75% 1,000.0 —\nOther 3.7 4.1\n4,003.7 3,004.1\nLess: current portion (1,000.3) (1.1)\nLess: unamortized discount and debt issuance costs (22.0) (11.7)\nTotal long-term debt $ 2,981.4 $ 2,991.3\nThe effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes and amortization of the discount and debt issuance\ncosts.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $3,779.3 million. For a description of the\nfair value hierarchy and the Company's fair value methodologies, including the use of an independent third-party pricing\nservice, see Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal\n2024.\nNote 11. Employee Benefit Plans\nA. Stock-based Compensation Plans. Stock-based compensation consists of the following:\nThe Company's share-based compensation consists of stock options, time-based restricted stock, time-based restricted stock\nunits, performance-based restricted stock, and performance-based restricted stock units. The Company also offers an employee\nstock purchase plan for eligible employees. Beginning in September 2022, the Company discontinued granting stock options,\ntime-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock. Any such future awards will be grants of time-based\nrestricted stock units and/or performance-based restricted stock units, depending on employee eligibility. Time-based restricted\nstock unit awards and performance-based restricted stock unit awards granted to employees with a home country of the United\nStates are settled in stock, and for awards granted to employees with a home country outside the United States are generally\nsettled in cash.\n• Restricted Stock.\n• Time-Based Restricted Stock Units. Time-based restricted stock units generally vest ratably over 3 years.\nAwards are generally forfeited if the employee ceases to be employed by the Company prior to vesting.\nTime-based restricted stock unit awards granted to employees with a home country of the United States are\nsettled in stock and cannot be transferred during the vesting period. Time-based restricted stock unit awards\ngranted to employees with a home country outside the United States are generally settled in cash and cannot\nbe transferred during the vesting period. Compensation expense relating to the issuance of share-settled units\n16\nis measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date and recognized on a straight-line basis over\nthe vesting period. Compensation expense relating to the issuance of cash-settled units is recorded over the\nvesting period and is initially based on the fair value of the award on the grant date and is subsequently\nremeasured at each reporting date during the vesting period based on the change in the ADP stock price.\nDividend cash equivalents are paid on share-settled units, and dividend cash equivalents are not paid on cash-\nsettled units.\n• Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units. Performance-based restricted stock units generally vest over a\none to three year performance period and a subsequent service period of up to 38 months. Under these\nprograms, the Company communicates “target awards” at the beginning of the performance period with\npossible payouts at the end of the performance period ranging from 0% to 200% of the “target awards.”\nAwards are generally forfeited if the employee ceases to be employed by the Company prior to vesting.\nPerformance-based restricted stock units cannot be transferred and are settled in either cash or stock,\ndepending on the employee's home country. Compensation expense relating to the issuance of performance-\nbased restricted stock units settled in cash is recognized over the vesting period initially based on the fair\nvalue of the award on the grant date with subsequent adjustments to the number of units awarded during the\nperformance period based on probable and actual performance against targets. In addition, compensation\nexpense is remeasured at each reporting period during the vesting period based on the change in the ADP\nstock price. Compensation expense relating to the issuance of performance-based restricted stock units settled\nin stock is recorded over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the grant date with\nsubsequent adjustments to the number of units awarded based on the probable and actual performance against\ntargets. Dividend equivalents are paid on awards under the performance-based restricted stock unit program.\n• Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company offers an employee stock purchase plan that allows eligible\nemployees to purchase shares of common stock at a price equal to 95% of the market value for the Company's\ncommon stock on the last day of the offering period. This plan has been deemed non-compensatory and, therefore,\nno compensation expense has been recorded.\nThe Company currently utilizes treasury stock to satisfy stock option exercises, issuances under the Company's employee stock\npurchase plan, and restricted stock awards. From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under\nits authorized share repurchase program. The Company repurchased 1.4 million and 1.0 million shares in the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute\nshare repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows,\nissuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.\n17\nThe following table represents pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nOperating expenses $ 9.1 $ 7.4\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 42.3 42.8\nResearch and development 9.2 8.6\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 60.6 $ 58.8\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the following activity occurred under the Company’s existing plans.\nStock Options:\nWeighted\nNumber Average\nof Options Price\n(in thousands) (in dollars)\nOptions outstanding at July 1, 2024 2,042 $ 159\nOptions granted — $ —\nOptions exercised (498) $ 162\nOptions forfeited/cancelled — $ —\nOptions outstanding at September 30, 2024 1,544 $ 158\nTime-Based Restricted Stock and Time-Based Restricted Stock Units:\nNumber of Number of\nShares Units\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nRestricted shares/units outstanding at July 1, 2024 124 1,053\nRestricted shares/units granted — 578\nRestricted shares/units vested (114) (418)\nRestricted shares/units forfeited — (11)\nRestricted shares/units outstanding at September 30, 2024 10 1,202\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units:\nNumber of Number of\nShares Units\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nRestricted shares/units outstanding at July 1, 2024 88 753\nRestricted shares/units granted — 293\nRestricted shares/units vested (58) (293)\nRestricted shares/units forfeited (2) (2)\nRestricted shares/units outstanding at September 30, 2024 28 751\n18\nB. Pension Plans\nThe components of net pension income were as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nService cost – benefits earned during the period $ 1.5 $ 1.3\nInterest cost on projected benefits 21.9 21.2\nExpected return on plan assets (29.0) (29.0)\nNet amortization and deferral 0.7 0.7\nNet pension (income)/expense $ (4.9) $ (5.8)\nNote 12. Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 22.6% and 21.4%, respectively. The\nincrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to lower reserves for uncertain tax positions and a valuation allowance release\nin the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nNote 13. Commitments and Contingencies\nIn May 2020, a putative class action complaint was filed against ADP, TotalSource and related defendants in the U.S. District\nCourt, District of New Jersey. The complaint asserts violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n(“ERISA”) in connection with the ADP TotalSource Retirement Savings Plan’s fiduciary administrative and investment\ndecision-making. The complaint seeks statutory and other unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief and attorney’s fees.\nThe Company is unable to estimate any reasonably possible loss, or range of loss, with respect to this matter. The Company is\nvigorously defending against this lawsuit.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, litigation, and regulatory compliance matters in the normal course of business. When\na loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records a liability in the amount of its best estimate for the\nultimate loss. Management currently believes that the resolution of these claims, litigation and regulatory compliance matters\nagainst us, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations,\nfinancial condition or cash flows. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters\nmay change in the future.\nIt is not the Company’s business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. In the normal course of business, the\nCompany may enter into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the\nCompany’s services and products. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and\nwarranties.\nNote 14.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Tabular dollars are presented in millions, except per share amounts)\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis document and other written or oral statements made from time to time by Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its subsidiaries\nand variable interest entity (“ADP” or the “Company”) may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements that are not historical in nature and which may be identified by\nthe use of words like \"outlook\", “expects,” “assumes,” “projects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “we believe,” “could,” “is\ndesigned to” and other words of similar meaning, are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on\nmanagement’s expectations and assumptions and depend upon or refer to future events or conditions and are subject to risks\nand uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed. Factors that could cause actual results\nto differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements or that could contribute to such difference\ninclude: ADP's success in obtaining and retaining clients, and selling additional services to clients; the pricing of products and\nservices; the success of our new solutions; our ability to respond successfully to changes in technology, including artificial\nintelligence; compliance with existing or new legislation or regulations; changes in, or interpretations of, existing legislation or\nregulations; overall market, political and economic conditions, including interest rate and foreign currency trends and inflation;\ncompetitive conditions; our ability to maintain our current credit ratings and the impact on our funding costs and profitability;\nsecurity or cyber breaches, fraudulent acts, and system interruptions and failures; employment and wage levels; availability of\nskilled associates; the impact of new acquisitions and divestitures; the adequacy, effectiveness and success of our business\ntransformation initiatives and the impact of any uncertainties related to major natural disasters or catastrophic events; and\nsupply-chain disruptions. ADP disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new\ninformation, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. These risks and uncertainties, along with the risk factors\ndiscussed under “Item 1A. - Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 (“fiscal\n2024”), and in other written or oral statements made from time to time by ADP, should be considered in evaluating any\nforward-looking statements contained herein.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn addition to our U.S. GAAP results, we use adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics to evaluate our operating\nperformance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT\nmargin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate and organic constant currency are\nall non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the accompanying financial tables in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\nsection for a discussion of why ADP believes these measures are important and for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to their comparable GAAP financial measures.\n23\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nWe are a leading global provider of cloud-based Human Capital Management (“HCM”) technology solutions to employers\naround the world. Our HCM solutions, which include both software and outsourcing services, are designed to help our clients\nmanage their workforce through a dynamic business and regulatory landscape and the changing world of work.

We continuously aim to offer\nsolutions that solve our clients’ complex business challenges. As part of this approach, in October 2024, we acquired\nWorkForce Software, a premier workforce management solutions provider that specializes in supporting large, global\nenterprises. Additionally, in September, we introduced ADP Lyric HCM, our flexible, intelligent and human-centric Global\nHCM platform. This is a unique offering, combining global HR, global payroll, and global service to adapt to a variety of\nstructures and workflows and offer employers a human-centric approach to managing their people. Finally, we continued to\ninvest in generative AI capabilities to enhance the experience of our clients and empower our associates. During the first\nquarter, we expanded access to our robust generative AI-based service tools which are designed to bring speed to our service\ninteractions and improve the client experience.\nHighlights from the three months ended September 30, 2024 include:\n• Revenue growth of 7% to $4,832.7 million; 7% organic constant currency\n• Earnings before income taxes margin expansion of 140 bps, and adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 130 bps\n• Diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") growth of 13%, to $2.34 and 12%, to $2.33, respectively.\n• Cash returned via shareholder friendly actions of $940M, including $570M of dividends and $370M of share\nrepurchases\n• Acquired WorkForce Software for approximately $1.2 billion in cash\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, we delivered solid revenue growth of 7%, on a reported and organic constant\ncurrency basis. Our pays per control metric, which represents the number of employees on ADP clients' payrolls in the United\nStates when measured on a same-store-sales basis for a subset of clients ranging from small to large businesses, grew 2% for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. PEO average worksite\nemployees increased 3% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30,\n2023.\nWe have a strong business model, generating significant cash flows with low capital intensity, and offer a suite of products that\nprovide critical support to our clients’ HCM functions.

The\nincrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to lower reserves for uncertain tax positions and a valuation allowance release\nin the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nAdjusted Provision for Income Taxes\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 22.6% and 21.4%, respectively.\nThe increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to lower reserves for uncertain tax positions and a valuation allowance\nrelease in the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nNet Earnings and Diluted EPS, Unadjusted and Adjusted\nFor the three months ended September 30:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nYoY\n2024 2023 Growth\nNet earnings $ 956.3 $ 859.4 11 %\nDiluted EPS $ 2.34 $ 2.08 13 %\nAdjusted net earnings $ 956.1 $ 859.9 11 %\nAdjusted diluted EPS $ 2.33 $ 2.08 12 %\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, net earnings reflect the changes described above in our earnings before income\ntaxes and our effective tax rate.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, in addition to the increase in net earnings, diluted EPS increased as a result of\nthe impact of fewer shares outstanding resulting from the repurchase of approximately 1.4 million shares during the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, and 1.0 million shares during the three months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset\nby the issuances of shares under our employee benefit plans.\n27\nANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS\nRevenues\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, % Change\nOrganic\nAs constant\n2024 2023 Reported currency\nEmployer Services $ 3,261.0 $ 3,046.4 7 % 7 %\nPEO Services 1,574.5 1,469.6 7 % 7 %\nOther (2.8) (3.6) n/m n/m\n$ 4,832.7 $ 4,512.4 7 % 7 %\nEarnings before Income Taxes\nThree Months Ended\n%\nSeptember 30, Change\nAs\n2024 2023 Reported\nEmployer Services $ 1,164.3 $ 1,008.5 15 %\nPEO Services 225.6 222.9 1 %\nOther (153.7) (138.6) n/m\n$ 1,236.2 $ 1,092.8 13 %\nMargin\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nYoY\n2024 2023 Growth\nEmployer Services 35.7 % 33.1 % 260 bps\nPEO Services 14.3 % 15.2 % (80) bps\nn/m - not meaningful\nEmployer Services\nRevenues\nRevenues increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to new business started from New Business Bookings,\nstrong client retention, an increase in pricing, an increase in interest earned on funds held for clients, and an increase in our pays\nper control of 2%.\nEarnings before Income Taxes\nEmployer Services' earnings before income taxes increased 15% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to\ncontributions from client funds interest revenues discussed above, and operating efficiencies for costs of servicing our clients on\ngrowing revenue, partially offset by increased selling expenses.\nMargin\n28\nEmployer Services' margin increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to contributions from client funds\ninterest revenues discussed above, operating efficiencies for costs of servicing our clients on growing revenue, and a decrease in\nresearch and development costs.\nPEO Services\nRevenues\nPEO Revenues\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ %\nPEO Services' revenues $ 1,574.5 $ 1,469.6 $ 104.9 7 %\nLess: PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs 1,049.2 976.7 72.5 7 %\nPEO Services' revenues excluding zero-margin benefits pass-throughs $ 525.3 $ 492.9 $ 32.4 7 %\nPEO Services' revenue increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to increase in zero-margin benefits pass-\nthroughs, and increase in average worksite employees of 3%, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nEarnings before Income Taxes\nPEO Services' earnings before income taxes increased 1% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to increased\nrevenues discussed above, partially offset by increases in selling expenses, and zero-margin benefits pass-through costs as\ncompared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nMargin\nPEO Services' margin decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to increases in zero-margin benefits pass-\nthrough costs, operating costs related to workers' compensation and less favorable actuarial loss development in workers’\ncompensation reserves in ADP Indemnity.\nADP Indemnity provides workers’ compensation and employer’s liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for\nPEO Services’ worksite employees up to $1 million per occurrence. PEO Services has secured a workers’ compensation and\nemployer’s liability insurance policy that caps the exposure for each claim at $1 million per occurrence and has also secured\naggregate stop loss insurance that caps aggregate losses at a certain level in fiscal years 2012 and prior from an admitted and\nlicensed insurance company of AIG. We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated\nclaim liability, and changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are included in the PEO segment.\nAdditionally, starting in fiscal year 2013, ADP Indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ACE\nAmerican Insurance Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chubb Limited (“Chubb”), to cover substantially all losses\nincurred by the Company up to the $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employer's liability\ndeductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services' worksite employees. Each of these reinsurance arrangements\nlimits our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit. The Company believes the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this\nlimit is remote. ADP Indemnity recorded a pre-tax benefit of approximately $4.8 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, as compared to approximately $6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was\nprimarily a result of less favorable actuarial loss development in workers’ compensation reserves. In July 2024, ADP Indemnity\npaid a premium of $276 million to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred\nby ADP Indemnity for the fiscal 2025 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2024 reinsurance policy.\n29\nOther\nThe primary components of “Other” are certain corporate overhead charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the\nreportable segments, including corporate functions, costs related to our transformation office, severance costs, non-recurring\ngains and losses, the elimination of intercompany transactions, and other interest income and expense.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our U.S. GAAP results, we use the adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics set forth in the table below to\nevaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods:\nAdjusted Financial Measure U.S. GAAP Measures\nAdjusted EBIT Net earnings\nAdjusted provision for income taxes Provision for income taxes\nAdjusted net earnings Net earnings\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share\nAdjusted effective tax rate Effective tax rate\nOrganic constant currency Revenues\nWe believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and\nanalyze results against our expectations and against prior period, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying\noperations. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors\nto view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess\nour operating performance. The nature of these exclusions is for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying\nbusiness operations. Since these adjusted financial measures and other non-GAAP metrics are not measures of performance\ncalculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to\ntheir corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies.\n30\nThree Months Ended\n%\nSeptember 30, Change\nAs\n2024 2023 Reported\nNet earnings $ 956.3 $ 859.4 11 %\nAdjustments:\nProvision for income taxes 279.9 233.4\nAll other interest expense (a) 20.5 18.0\nAll other interest income (a) (23.9) (18.2)\nTransformation initiatives — 0.7\nLegal settlements (b) (0.3) —\nAdjusted EBIT $ 1,232.5 $ 1,093.3 13 %\nAdjusted EBIT Margin 25.5 % 24.2 %\nProvision for income taxes $ 279.9 $ 233.4 20 %\nAdjustments:\nTransformation initiatives (c) — 0.2\nLegal settlements (c) (0.1) —\nAdjusted provision for income taxes $ 279.8 $ 233.6 20 %\nAdjusted effective tax rate (d) 22.6 % 21.4 %\nNet earnings $ 956.3 $ 859.4 11 %\nAdjustments:\nTransformation initiatives — 0.7\nIncome tax (benefit)/provision for transformation initiatives (c) — (0.2)\nLegal settlements (b) (0.3) —\nIncome tax (benefit)/provision for legal settlements (c) 0.1 —\nAdjusted net earnings $ 956.1 $ 859.9 11 %\nDiluted EPS $ 2.34 $ 2.08 13 %\nAdjustments:\nTransformation initiatives (c) — —\nLegal settlements (b) (c) — —\nAdjusted diluted EPS $ 2.33 $ 2.08 12 %\n(a) In Adjusted EBIT, we include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended\ninvestment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe\nthese amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model.

The impact of acquisitions\nand dispositions is calculated by excluding the current year revenues of acquisitions until the one-year anniversary of the\ntransaction and by excluding the prior year revenues of divestitures for the one-year period preceding the transaction. The\nimpact of foreign currency is determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the\nprior year.

Our financial condition remains\nsolid at September 30, 2024 and we have sufficient liquidity.\nFor client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short-term\ncommercial paper program and our U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom short-term reverse repurchase agreements ($7.3 billion\nof which is available on a committed basis in the U.S.), together with our $10.3 billion of committed credit facilities and our\nability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.\nPlease see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for a further discussion of the risks related to our\nclient funds extended investment strategy. See Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-\nterm financing including commercial paper.\n32\nOperating, Investing and Financing Cash Flows\nOur cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are summarized as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change\nCash provided by / (used in):\nOperating activities $ 824.4 $ 326.5 $ 497.9\nInvesting activities (1,644.4) (216.1) (1,428.3)\nFinancing activities (6,491.5) (1,903.7) (4,587.8)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted\ncash, and restricted cash equivalents 17.0 (16.3) 33.3\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash\nequivalents $ (7,294.5) $ (1,809.6) $ (5,484.9)\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities increased due to favorable changes in the components of working capital and an\nincrease in growth in our business, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities changed due to the timing of purchases and proceeds of corporate and client funds\nmarketable securities of $1,426.7 million.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities changed due to a net decrease in the cash flow from client funds obligations of\n$9,495.6 million, which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients' employees and other\npayees, along with a net decrease in cash received from the Internal Revenue Service as of September 30, 2024, to be refunded\nto our clients, offset by proceeds from commercial paper borrowing and issuance of debt.\nFrom time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase\nprogram. The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other\nthings, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity,\nand market conditions. We purchased approximately 1.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of\n$259.47 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to purchases of 1.0 million shares at an average price\nper share of $242.26 during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nCapital Resources and Client Funds Obligations\nWe have $4.0 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2025, 2028, 2030 and 2034. We may from time to time\nrevisit the long-term debt market to refinance existing debt, finance investments including acquisitions for our growth, and\nmaintain the appropriate capital structure. However, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit\nmarkets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all. See Note 10 of our\nConsolidated Financial Statements for a description of our long-term financing.\nOur U.S. short-term funding requirements primarily related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis\nthrough the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been\ninvested in available-for-sale securities. This commercial paper program provides for the issuance of up to $10.3 billion in\naggregate maturity value. Our commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard & Poor’s, Prime-1 (“P-1”) by Moody’s and\nF1+ by Fitch. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range\nfrom overnight to up to 364 days. At September 30, 2024, the Company had $4.4 billion of commercial paper outstanding,\nwhich was repaid in early October 2024. At June 30, 2024, the Company had no commercial paper borrowing outstanding.\nDetails of the borrowings under the commercial paper program are as follows:\n33\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nAverage daily borrowings (in billions) $ 4.8 $ 4.1\nWeighted average interest rates 5.3 % 5.3 %\nWeighted average maturity (approximately in days) 2 days 2 days\nOur U.S., Canadian, and United Kingdom short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes\nobtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by\ngovernment and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been\ninvested in available-for-sale securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business\ndays. We have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as-needed basis to meet short-\nterm funding requirements related to client funds obligations. We have $7.3 billion available to us on a committed basis under\nthe U.S. reverse repurchase agreements. At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company had $679.1 million and\n$385.4 million of outstanding obligations related to reverse repurchase agreements which were fully paid in early October 2024\nand early July 2024, respectively. Details of the reverse repurchase agreements are as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nAverage outstanding balances (in billions) $ 3.8 $ 1.4\nWeighted average interest rates 5.3 % 5.3 %\nWe vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility. We have a $4.55\nbillion, 364-day credit agreement that matures in June 2025 with a one year term-out option. In addition, we have a five-year\n$2.25 billion credit facility and a five-year $3.5 billion credit facility maturing in June 2028 and June 2029, respectively, each\nwith an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability\nof additional commitments. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program\nand funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. We had no borrowings through September 30, 2024 under the credit\nfacilities. We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder and\nwe are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $10.3 billion available to us under\nthe revolving credit agreements. See Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-term\nfinancing, including credit facilities.\nOur investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of sub-prime mortgages,\nalternative-A mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized\nloan obligations, credit default swaps, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment\ngrade fixed-income securities. We own AAA-rated senior tranches of primarily fixed rate auto loan, credit card, and equipment\nlease receivables, secured predominantly by prime collateral. All collateral on asset-backed securities has performed as\nexpected through September 30, 2024. In addition, we own U.S. government securities which primarily include debt directly\nissued by Federal Farm Credit Banks and Federal Home Loan Banks. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow\nus to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case\nof the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). This investment strategy is supported by our\nshort-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. See\nNote 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients.\nCapital expenditures for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $55.6 million, as compared to $42.2 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 to be between $200 million and $225\nmillion, as compared to $211.7 million in fiscal 2024.\n34\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities) and\nclient funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but have not yet been remitted to the applicable tax authorities or\nclient employees).\nOur corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities.\nThese assets are available for our regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, as\nwell as other corporate operating purposes. All of our short-term and long-term fixed-income securities are classified as\navailable-for-sale securities.\nOur client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. Consistent\nwith those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income. Client funds\nassets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of\npurchase, and money market securities and other cash equivalents.\nWe utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-\nterm financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Our client funds\ninvestment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our\ninvestments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). As\npart of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client\nfunds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale\nsecurities. In circumstances where we experience a reduction in employment levels due to a slowdown in the economy, we may\nmake tactical decisions to sell certain securities or not reinvest maturing securities in order to reduce the size of the funds held\nfor clients to correspond to client funds obligations. We minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available\nat the time such client’s obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the client’s funds in advance of the\ntiming of payment of such client’s obligation. As a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of\nclient funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations.\nThere are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets. Such risks\ninclude liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in\na timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations. However, our investments are made with the safety of principal,\nliquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client\nfunds obligations. We also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client\nfunds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances,\navailable borrowings under our $10.3 billion commercial paper program (rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s, P-1 by Moody’s,\nand F1+ by Fitch, the highest possible short-term credit ratings), and our ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreement\ntransactions ($7.3 billion of which is available on a committed basis in the U.S.) and available borrowings under our $10.3\nbillion committed credit facilities. The reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers\nwith the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our\nbusiness. In addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below.\nWe have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments. The minimum allowed credit rating at\ntime of purchase for Corporate, Canadian government agency and Canadian provincial bonds is BBB, for asset-backed\nsecurities is AAA, and for municipal bonds is A. The maximum maturity at time of purchase for BBB-rated securities is 5\nyears, and for single A rated securities, AA-rated and AAA-rated securities is 10 years. Time deposits and commercial paper\nmust be rated A-1 and/or P-1. Money market funds must be rated AAA/Aaa-mf.\n35\nDetails regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nAverage investment balances at cost:\nCorporate investments $ 10,669.8 $ 7,129.0\nFunds held for clients 32,787.0 31,129.4\nTotal $ 43,456.8 $ 38,258.4\nAverage interest rates earned exclusive of realized\n(gains)/losses on:\nCorporate investments 3.4 % 2.6 %\nFunds held for clients 3.1 % 2.6 %\nTotal 3.2 % 2.6 %\nNet realized losses on available-for-sale securities $ 0.2 $ 1.9\nSeptember 30, 2024 June 30, 2024\nNet unrealized pre-tax losses on available-for-sale securities $ (651.2) $ (1,515.8)\nTotal available-for-sale securities at fair value $ 33,673.1 $ 31,207.5\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are\nreinvested. Factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested\nfunds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments. This mix varies during the fiscal year and is\nimpacted by daily interest rate changes. The annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio increased from 2.6% for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. A hypothetical change in both\nshort-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis\npoints applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in\napproximately a $15 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending\nSeptember 30, 2025. A hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average\nshort-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $7 million impact to\nearnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending September 30, 2025.\nWe are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers\nto meet the terms of the securities. We limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily AAA-rated and\nAA- rated securities, as rated by Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, DBRS for Canadian dollar denominated securities, and Fitch for\nasset-backed and commercial-mortgage-backed securities. In addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security\nother than U.S. government and government agency, Canadian government, and United Kingdom government securities.\nWe operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We\nmanage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed\nappropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We may use derivative financial instruments as risk\nmanagement tools and not for trading purposes.\n36\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires\nmanagement to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,\nexpenses, and other comprehensive income. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable\nunder current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management.\nRefer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for changes to our accounting policies effective for the fiscal 2025.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 2, New Accounting Pronouncements, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent\naccounting pronouncements.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe information called for by this item is provided under the caption “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market\nRisk” under Item 2 – Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nThe Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management,\nincluding its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and\nprocedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “evaluation”). Disclosure\ncontrols and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and\ncommunicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons\nperforming similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation,\nthe Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 in ensuring that (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in\nreports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the Company's\nmanagement, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure and (ii) such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.\nThere was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nExcept as noted below, all other items are either inapplicable or would result in negative responses and, therefore, have been\nomitted.\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various claims and litigation. While the outcome of any litigation\nis inherently unpredictable, the Company believes it has valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against it and\nthe Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on its financial\ncondition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWith respect to the disclosure of administrative or judicial proceedings arising under any Federal, State, or local provisions\nregulating the discharge of materials into the environment or that are primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment,\nthe Company has determined that the following threshold is reasonably designed to result in disclosure of any such proceeding\nthat is material to its business or financial condition: any proceeding when the potential monetary sanctions exceed $1 million.\n37\nItem 1A.
