The net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $419,535 compared to a net loss of $257,609 for the first quarter of the prior fiscal year. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 was $0.05 compared to basic and diluted loss per common share of $0.03 for the comparable three-month period one year ago.\n\n“Sales to our domestic distributors were down versus the prior year mainly due to timing of orders. We also saw a decline in sales to our Education and Music customers,” Michael J. Koss, Chairman and CEO, said today. “Backed by the launch of the next generation Porta Pro Wireless 2.0 in September 2024, sales to our two largest European distributors surpassed last year’s levels by over 30%. The Company also had an increase in Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) sales compared to the prior year, driven by several record-setting daily sales on Amazon, as well as the success of the Company’s Porta Pro Wireless 2.0 launch.”\n\nKoss went on to explain that a favorable mix of customer and product sales drove a gross margins improvement to 36.6% compared to 31.6% one year ago as higher margins on sales of the new product complemented a higher volume of higher margin DTC sales.\n\n“The adverse impact of a write-off in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 of some older, excess inventory was partially mitigated by the capitalization of freight costs into inventory for product purchases for the coming season,” Koss continued. “We saw a slight increase in freight rates, along with extended lead times related to port congestion, throughout the first quarter of fiscal year 2025.” Koss also pointed out that the Company expects transit rate increases to continue into the next quarter. “We continue to monitor potential disruptions in the supply chain and will react as necessary to ensure adequate inventory levels in advance of the upcoming holiday season,” Koss said.\n\n_About Koss Corporation_\n\nKoss Corporation markets a complete line of high-fidelity headphones, wireless Bluetooth® speakers, computer headsets, telecommunications headsets, active noise canceling headphones, and wireless headphones.\n\n_Forward-Looking Statements_\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements.

The team’s ingenuity enabled us to create new inventions which we have sought to protect by applying for patents at the United States Patent and Trademark Office,” said Michael J. Koss, Jr., Vice President – Marketing & Product. “We focused on maintaining the iconic sound, collapsibility, fit, comfort, and performance of the Porta Pro Classic to celebrate its 40th Anniversary.”\n\nThe next generation Koss Porta Pro Wireless Bluetooth® headphones feature an ultra lightweight rechargeable lithium-ion battery that can last more than 20 hours after a single charge using the included USB-C charging cord. If the battery runs low or there is no time to charge, the Koss Porta Pro Wireless has an analog bypass mode that can be enabled with an included USB-C to 3.5mm standard headphone jack.\n\n“The addition of the analog bypass feature and our decision to include an analog cable makes the next generation Porta Pro Wireless an incredibly versatile headphone,” Michael J. Koss Jr. continued. “Almost all wireless headphones on the market stop working when their battery dies. Not with the new Porta Pro Wireless. If your 20+ hour battery somehow runs low, just plug in your analog bypass cable that comes included with the product and carry on – with what is essentially a Porta Pro Classic.”\n\nIntegrated on-board controls including a microphone on the new Porta Pro Wireless Bluetooth® Headphones allow users to change songs, answer calls, adjust volume, and much more. Designed for maximum portability, the all-new next generation Porta Pro Wireless can be collapsed and stored safely inside the included hard shell Koss Porta Pro Carrying Case. The compact design and case enabled Koss to reduce the size of the packaging by over 50% compared to the Porta Pro Classic, which helps minimize environmental impact.\n\nThe Porta Pro® Wireless Bluetooth® headphones are available today in the USA for $99.99 at [Koss.com](http://Koss.com) and [Amazon.com/Koss](http://Amazon.com/Koss) (while supplies last). Immediate international availability is limited to certain partners and varies by territory. International customers are encouraged to contact their local Koss Distributor or contact our US Customer Support team at: [www.koss.com/contact-us](http://www.koss.com/contact-us) for more information.\n\nKoss® Corporation: The Original American Stereophone Company since 1958Koss Corporation markets a complete line of high-fidelity headphones, wireless Bluetooth® speakers, computer headsets, telecommunications headsets, active noise canceling headphones, and wireless headphones.\n\n*Some features are source dependent\n\nThe Bluetooth® word mark is a registered trademark owned by Bluetooth SIG, Inc. and any use of such mark by Koss® Corporation is under license.\n\nContact:media@koss.com\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at [https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/e90ce948-688c-49b2-8496-589beef121ca](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mcjaWdgJoD9p2E7plERDNErtIhP_ZICWYW0LvtNeXe6hTAkERtL5HYQ1QJ1TZ0uJNiYH6HC7BpFexvWpXG8wWfAWn4kZNyygP3Lt4ywqm0JftaAIatkZ1VC073vgMRJcgKElpF4qWZoJPjf1aVVBbNlxt5eRm-fZZ6xxzCIr-UGW4q12e3m-0b8cAB26f0m_YebrOI5wmnvXkASHCsE_ersku2tUqDrZK1OA9mE1skEQnL5WnczpMD_ghoZ6YZAqOW_ACVkE2Bz2xsBsM7Q4bw==)\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTIzMDYzNyM2NDc4NDg4IzIwMjg4MzU=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZTY2NTQ3OWUtMzY5OS00M2RmLTg5MDUtMjMwNWRiNTMwZWY1LTEwNDA0MDY=/tiny/Koss-Corporation.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/001ed5b3-d3a0-4bb2-acac-83d79671e833/small/koss-stereophones-logo-small-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/001ed5b3-d3a0-4bb2-acac-83d79671e833)\n\n##### Koss Reinvents the Iconic Koss Porta Pro with the Next Generation Koss Porta Pro Wireless\n\n[![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/e90ce948-688c-49b2-8496-589beef121ca/medium/koss-reinvents-the-iconic-koss-porta-pro-with-the-next-gener.jpg) ](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/e90ce948-688c-49b2-8496-589beef121ca/en)\n\n##### Koss Porta Pro Wireless\n\nSource: Koss Corporation\n\n© 2024 Koss Corporation.
