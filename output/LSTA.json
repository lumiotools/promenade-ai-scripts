(Nasdaq: LSTA) (“Lisata” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing innovative therapies for the treatment of advanced solid tumors and other serious diseases, provided a business update and reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“We are pleased to share the progress made in the third quarter of 2024, highlighted by the advancement of our robust development portfolio centered around our novel product candidate, certepetide,” stated David J. Mazzo, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Lisata. “While we await preliminary results from Cohort A of the Phase 2b ASCEND trial expected this quarter, we continue to explore the broad application of certepetide’s unique mechanism of action. Our development portfolio now encompasses multiple clinical and preclinical trials evaluating certepetide for the treatment of various solid tumors, including pancreatic, cholangiocarcinoma, glioblastoma, colon, appendiceal, and melanoma. In addition, certepetide is being evaluated in a preclinical non-cancerous setting for endometriosis. All our studies are designed to yield data during the coming year, and we look forward to a data-rich 2025.”\n\n**Development Portfolio Highlights**\n\n**_Certepetide as a treatment for solid tumors in combination with other anti-cancer agents_**\n\nCertepetide is an investigational drug designed to selectively activate the C-end rule active transport mechanism in a tumor specific manner, resulting in systemically co-administered anti-cancer agents more efficiently penetrating and accumulating in the tumor. Additionally, certepetide has been shown to modify the tumor microenvironment, diminishing its immunosuppressive nature, enhancing cytotoxic T cell concentration and inhibiting the metastatic cascade. Lisata and its collaborators have amassed significant non-clinical data demonstrating enhanced delivery of various existing and emerging anti-cancer therapies, including chemotherapies, immunotherapies, and RNA-based therapeutics. To date, certepetide has also demonstrated favorable safety, tolerability, and clinical activity in completed and ongoing clinical trials designed to demonstrate its ability to enhance the effectiveness of standard-of-care (“SoC”) chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer as well as the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in a variety of solid tumors. Certepetide has been awarded Fast Track designation (U.S.) and Orphan Drug Designation for pancreatic cancer (U.S. and E.U.) as well as Orphan Drug Designation for glioma, osteosarcoma, and cholangiocarcinoma (U.S.). Additionally, certepetide has received Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for osteosarcoma (U.S.). Currently, certepetide is the subject of multiple ongoing or planned Phase 2a and 2b clinical studies being conducted globally in a variety of solid tumor types in combination with a variety of anti-cancer regimens, including:\n\n  * ASCEND: Phase 2b double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating two dosing regimens of certepetide in combination with SoC chemotherapy (gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel) in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (“mPDAC”). The trial is being conducted at 25 sites in Australia and New Zealand led by the Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group (“AGITG”) in collaboration with the University of Sydney and with the National Health and Medical Research Council Clinical Trial Centre at the University of Sydney as the Coordinating Centre. Following the completion of enrollment in the fourth quarter of 2023, data from an interim analysis of the 95 Cohort A patients (single dose of certepetide administered with SoC) will be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium in January of 2025. Data from the 60 patients in Cohort B patients (single dose of certepetide administered with SoC plus a second dose of certepetide four hours after the first) is expected in mid-2025 with a final analysis of both Cohorts available thereafter. \n  * BOLSTER: Phase 2a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, randomized trial in the U.S. evaluating certepetide in combination with SoC in first- and second-line cholangiocarcinoma (“CCA”). The Company achieved complete enrollment in first-line CCA nearly six months ahead of plan, accelerating anticipated topline data readout to mid-2025. Based on this rapid enrollment rate and the pressing need to improve treatment outcomes in patients that have progressed after first-line CCA treatment, a second cohort has been added to the BOLSTER trial evaluating subjects in second-line CCA. Lisata previously announced that the first patient has been treated in the second-line CCA cohort, with enrollment completion expected in the first half of 2025.\n  * CENDIFOX: Phase 1b/2a open-label trial in the U.S. of certepetide in combination with neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX based therapies in pancreatic, colon and appendiceal cancers. The trial has completed enrollment in the pancreatic cohort and expects to complete enrollment in the remaining two cohorts by the end of 2024. \n  * Qilu Pharmaceutical, the licensee of certepetide in the Greater China territory, is currently evaluating certepetide in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel as a treatment for mPDAC. During the 2023 ASCO Annual Meeting, Qilu Pharmaceutical presented an abstract sharing preliminary data from the study which corroborated previously reported findings from the Phase 1b/2a trial of certepetide plus gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel conducted in Australia in patients with mPDAC. As previously reported, Qilu has begun treating patients in their Phase 2 placebo-controlled trial in mPDAC. \n  * iLSTA: Phase 1b/2a randomized, single-blind, single-center, safety and pharmacodynamic trial in Australia evaluating certepetide in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab, plus SoC gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy versus SoC alone in patients with locally advanced non-resectable PDAC. With 24 of the 30 patients enrolled, enrollment remains on track to be completed by the first half of 2025. \n  * A Lisata-funded Phase 2a, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, proof-of-concept study evaluating certepetide in combination with SoC temozolomide versus temozolomide alone in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (“GBM”) is being conducted across multiple sites in Estonia and Latvia and is targeted to enroll 30 patients with a randomization of 2:1 in favor of the certepetide treatment group. Enrollment completion is expected in the second half of 2025.\n  * FORTIFIDE: Phase 1b/2a, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm, randomized study in the U.S. to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a 4-hour continuous infusion of certepetide in combination with SoC in subjects with second-line mPDAC who have progressed on FOLFIRINOX. As part of this study, Lisata has engaged Haystack Oncology to use its MRD™ technology to measure circulating tumor DNA levels at multiple timepoints in patients throughout the study as an exploratory endpoint for analyzing the early therapeutic effect of certepetide. The Company expects to enroll the first patient in the study by the first quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\nAs recently announced, Lisata has entered into multiple research collaborations, including a sponsored research agreement with the University of Cincinnati to assess certepetide in combination with bevacizumab (a VEGF inhibitor) in a preclinical murine model for the treatment of endometriosis. Lisata is also partnering with Valo Therapeutics (“ValoTx”) to investigate the benefits of combining certepetide with ValoTx's platform technology, PeptiCRAd, and a checkpoint inhibitor in a preclinical murine model for the treatment of melanoma.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses totaled $5.3 million, compared to $6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing a decrease of $0.6 million or 10.5%.\n\nResearch and development expenses were approximately $2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing a decrease of $0.8 million or 24.8%. This was primarily due to a reduction in clinical research organization expenses associated with the Company’s Phase 2a BOLSTER trial as a result of trial protocol modifications and lower equity expenses. In addition, there were start-up expenses in the prior year related to the GBM study.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were approximately $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of $0.2 million or 8.1%. This was primarily due to higher consulting expenses.\n\nOverall, net losses were $4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**_Balance Sheet Highlights_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Lisata had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of approximately $35.9 million. Based on its current expected capital needs, the Company believes that its projected capital will fund its current proposed operations into early 2026, encompassing anticipated data milestones from all its ongoing and planned clinical trials.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nLisata will hold a live conference call today, November 12, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss financial results, provide a business update, and answer questions.\n\nThose wishing to participate must register for the conference call by way of the following link: [**CLICK HERE TO REGISTER**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BUL6NUxabTwJOVCh-CapOeCzh-MjUEgXP-TrH47Da6DXvZpWCaUohq31cyhz_mPFqtTXL1FbL7r9YBhLIq-AWI8FVxYKwrs9G3S_CN5BXmCXgwnSrDp06_jGVF3-soqNwvm8VeXWM5YdjbLN21DW9Ij74_arGrHTzbSb1uZ8gKg=).

(Nasdaq: LSTA), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing innovative therapies for the treatment of advanced solid tumors and other serious diseases, and Valo Therapeutics Oy (“ValoTx”), a private company developing novel, adaptable immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, are pleased to announce a preclinical research collaboration to investigate the benefits of combining Lisata's novel product candidate, certepetide, with ValoTx's innovative platform technology, PeptiCRAd, and a checkpoint inhibitor in a melanoma mouse model. Under the agreement, ValoTx will be conducting the research, while Lisata will supply certepetide product.\n\n“Building on previous preclinical work demonstrating certepetide's synergistic effects with immunotherapies, we aim to uncover additional benefits by combining certepetide with ValoTx's PeptiCRAd immunotherapy,” stated Kristen K. Buck, M.D., Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Medical Officer of Lisata. “Given the complementary mechanisms of action of these therapies, including certepetide’s ability to modify the tumor microenvironment making it less immunosuppressive, we believe this approach could ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes by addressing the challenges facing current melanoma treatments, including resistance, recurrence, and metastasis.”\n\n“We are thrilled to partner with Lisata Therapeutics on this promising research collaboration,” stated Sari Pesonen, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and Chief Scientific Officer of ValoTx. “The combination of our proprietary PeptiCRAd and Lisata's innovative certepetide tumor targeting and penetration technology has the potential to unlock new frontiers in cancer immunotherapy. Together, we hope to accelerate the development of more effective treatments for patients in desperate need, ultimately translating our preclinical findings into life-changing therapies for cancer patients.”\n\nMelanoma is a serious and potentially life-threatening form of skin cancer. According to the World Health Organization, melanoma is amongst the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally, responsible for approximately 58,000 deaths annually. Current standard-of-care includes checkpoint inhibitor therapies with an overall response rate of 35-60%. Despite advancements in treatment, there remains a significant unmet need for effective therapies, particularly for patients with advanced or metastatic disease.\n\n**About Certepetide**\n\nCertepetide is an investigational drug designed to selectively activate the C-end rule active transport mechanism in a tumor specific manner, resulting in systemically co-administered anti-cancer agents more efficiently penetrating and accumulating in the tumor. Additionally, certepetide has been shown to modify the tumor microenvironment, diminishing its immunosuppressive nature and inhibiting the metastatic cascade. Lisata and its collaborators have amassed significant non-clinical data demonstrating enhanced delivery of various existing and emerging anti-cancer therapies, including chemotherapies, immunotherapies and RNA-based therapeutics. To date, certepetide has also demonstrated favorable safety, tolerability, and clinical activity in completed and ongoing clinical trials designed to demonstrate its ability to enhance the effectiveness of standard-of-care chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer as well as the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in a variety of solid tumors. Certepetide has been awarded Fast Track designation (U.S.) and Orphan Drug Designation for pancreatic cancer (U.S. and E.U.), as well as Orphan Drug Designation for glioma, osteosarcoma, and cholangiocarcinoma (U.S.). Additionally, certepetide has received Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for osteosarcoma (U.S.).\n\n**About Lisata Therapeutics**\n\nLisata Therapeutics is a [_clinical-stage pharmaceutical company_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=LKokNwlSl69SNlWksoMbxHS6LvfKdctjz__B38SOEoVq4fcVCgFU3jwXD4g36rO0p1dfQQ657d6MuwfeadAcbkOibWZYGmNrqK-af7hA1FQ_kB5Dl6kS_ef6rBB1YVHPRGaXInghXJiJ04H201tLOemeKUjqPan8eCVX3bw1H1s=) dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of advanced solid tumors and other major diseases.

This virus-based platform can be customized to activate the tumor microenvironment (“TME”) optimally. Its lead candidate, PeptiCRAd-1, encodes two immunostimulatory proteins—CD40L and OX40L—that are directly delivered to the TME. What sets PeptiCRAd apart from other viral immunotherapies is its ability to carry multiple tumor antigens on the virus surface, eliciting broad T-cell and antibody responses against multiple tumor antigens simultaneously. These antigens are easy to mix and match, enabling targeted treatment against the varied tumor antigen profiles in solid tumors. PeptiCRAd can be administered subcutaneously or directly into tumors, depending on disease stage. As a monotherapy, PeptiCRAd has demonstrated an abscopal effect and the induction of protective memory responses upon rechallenge with the previously treated tumor. Currently, PeptiCRAd-1, targeting NY-ESO-1 and MAGE A3-expressing tumors, is in Phase 1 clinical testing with pembrolizumab for triple-negative breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, and sarcoma.\n\n**About Valo Therapeutics**\n\nValo Therapeutics Oy (ValoTx) is an immunotherapy company developing tumor antigen-coated replication-competent viruses as therapeutic vaccines against cancer. The ValoTx lead platform, PeptiCRAd (Peptide-coated Conditionally Replicating Adenovirus), was developed out of the laboratory of Professor Vincenzo Cerullo at the University of Helsinki. It turns oncolytic adenoviruses into powerful activators of systemic anti-tumor cytotoxic T-cell immunity without the need to generate and manufacture multiple genetically modified viruses. PeptiCRAd-1 is the company’s lead product made up of its proprietary virus VALO-D102 coated with MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO-1 peptides. The company is also developing PeptiCHIP, an innovative microchip-based solution that enables rapid, accurate, and standardized tumor neoantigen identification from very small tumor biopsies.

(Nasdaq: LSTA) (“Lisata” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing innovative therapies for the treatment of advanced solid tumors and other serious diseases, provided a business update and reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“We are pleased to share the progress made in the third quarter of 2024, highlighted by the advancement of our robust development portfolio centered around our novel product candidate, certepetide,” stated David J. Mazzo, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Lisata. “While we await preliminary results from Cohort A of the Phase 2b ASCEND trial expected this quarter, we continue to explore the broad application of certepetide’s unique mechanism of action. Our development portfolio now encompasses multiple clinical and preclinical trials evaluating certepetide for the treatment of various solid tumors, including pancreatic, cholangiocarcinoma, glioblastoma, colon, appendiceal, and melanoma. In addition, certepetide is being evaluated in a preclinical non-cancerous setting for endometriosis. All our studies are designed to yield data during the coming year, and we look forward to a data-rich 2025.”\n\n**Development Portfolio Highlights**\n\n**_Certepetide as a treatment for solid tumors in combination with other anti-cancer agents_**\n\nCertepetide is an investigational drug designed to selectively activate the C-end rule active transport mechanism in a tumor specific manner, resulting in systemically co-administered anti-cancer agents more efficiently penetrating and accumulating in the tumor. Additionally, certepetide has been shown to modify the tumor microenvironment, diminishing its immunosuppressive nature, enhancing cytotoxic T cell concentration and inhibiting the metastatic cascade. Lisata and its collaborators have amassed significant non-clinical data demonstrating enhanced delivery of various existing and emerging anti-cancer therapies, including chemotherapies, immunotherapies, and RNA-based therapeutics. To date, certepetide has also demonstrated favorable safety, tolerability, and clinical activity in completed and ongoing clinical trials designed to demonstrate its ability to enhance the effectiveness of standard-of-care (“SoC”) chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer as well as the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in a variety of solid tumors. Certepetide has been awarded Fast Track designation (U.S.) and Orphan Drug Designation for pancreatic cancer (U.S. and E.U.) as well as Orphan Drug Designation for glioma, osteosarcoma, and cholangiocarcinoma (U.S.). Additionally, certepetide has received Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for osteosarcoma (U.S.). Currently, certepetide is the subject of multiple ongoing or planned Phase 2a and 2b clinical studies being conducted globally in a variety of solid tumor types in combination with a variety of anti-cancer regimens, including:\n\n  * ASCEND: Phase 2b double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating two dosing regimens of certepetide in combination with SoC chemotherapy (gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel) in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (“mPDAC”). The trial is being conducted at 25 sites in Australia and New Zealand led by the Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group (“AGITG”) in collaboration with the University of Sydney and with the National Health and Medical Research Council Clinical Trial Centre at the University of Sydney as the Coordinating Centre. Following the completion of enrollment in the fourth quarter of 2023, data from an interim analysis of the 95 Cohort A patients (single dose of certepetide administered with SoC) will be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium in January of 2025. Data from the 60 patients in Cohort B patients (single dose of certepetide administered with SoC plus a second dose of certepetide four hours after the first) is expected in mid-2025 with a final analysis of both Cohorts available thereafter. \n  * BOLSTER: Phase 2a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, randomized trial in the U.S. evaluating certepetide in combination with SoC in first- and second-line cholangiocarcinoma (“CCA”). The Company achieved complete enrollment in first-line CCA nearly six months ahead of plan, accelerating anticipated topline data readout to mid-2025. Based on this rapid enrollment rate and the pressing need to improve treatment outcomes in patients that have progressed after first-line CCA treatment, a second cohort has been added to the BOLSTER trial evaluating subjects in second-line CCA. Lisata previously announced that the first patient has been treated in the second-line CCA cohort, with enrollment completion expected in the first half of 2025.\n  * CENDIFOX: Phase 1b/2a open-label trial in the U.S. of certepetide in combination with neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX based therapies in pancreatic, colon and appendiceal cancers. The trial has completed enrollment in the pancreatic cohort and expects to complete enrollment in the remaining two cohorts by the end of 2024. \n  * Qilu Pharmaceutical, the licensee of certepetide in the Greater China territory, is currently evaluating certepetide in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel as a treatment for mPDAC. During the 2023 ASCO Annual Meeting, Qilu Pharmaceutical presented an abstract sharing preliminary data from the study which corroborated previously reported findings from the Phase 1b/2a trial of certepetide plus gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel conducted in Australia in patients with mPDAC. As previously reported, Qilu has begun treating patients in their Phase 2 placebo-controlled trial in mPDAC. \n  * iLSTA: Phase 1b/2a randomized, single-blind, single-center, safety and pharmacodynamic trial in Australia evaluating certepetide in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab, plus SoC gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy versus SoC alone in patients with locally advanced non-resectable PDAC. With 24 of the 30 patients enrolled, enrollment remains on track to be completed by the first half of 2025. \n  * A Lisata-funded Phase 2a, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, proof-of-concept study evaluating certepetide in combination with SoC temozolomide versus temozolomide alone in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (“GBM”) is being conducted across multiple sites in Estonia and Latvia and is targeted to enroll 30 patients with a randomization of 2:1 in favor of the certepetide treatment group. Enrollment completion is expected in the second half of 2025.\n  * FORTIFIDE: Phase 1b/2a, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm, randomized study in the U.S. to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a 4-hour continuous infusion of certepetide in combination with SoC in subjects with second-line mPDAC who have progressed on FOLFIRINOX. As part of this study, Lisata has engaged Haystack Oncology to use its MRD™ technology to measure circulating tumor DNA levels at multiple timepoints in patients throughout the study as an exploratory endpoint for analyzing the early therapeutic effect of certepetide. The Company expects to enroll the first patient in the study by the first quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\nAs recently announced, Lisata has entered into multiple research collaborations, including a sponsored research agreement with the University of Cincinnati to assess certepetide in combination with bevacizumab (a VEGF inhibitor) in a preclinical murine model for the treatment of endometriosis. Lisata is also partnering with Valo Therapeutics (“ValoTx”) to investigate the benefits of combining certepetide with ValoTx's platform technology, PeptiCRAd, and a checkpoint inhibitor in a preclinical murine model for the treatment of melanoma.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses totaled $5.3 million, compared to $6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing a decrease of $0.6 million or 10.5%.\n\nResearch and development expenses were approximately $2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing a decrease of $0.8 million or 24.8%. This was primarily due to a reduction in clinical research organization expenses associated with the Company’s Phase 2a BOLSTER trial as a result of trial protocol modifications and lower equity expenses. In addition, there were start-up expenses in the prior year related to the GBM study.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were approximately $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of $0.2 million or 8.1%. This was primarily due to higher consulting expenses.\n\nOverall, net losses were $4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**_Balance Sheet Highlights_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Lisata had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of approximately $35.9 million. Based on its current expected capital needs, the Company believes that its projected capital will fund its current proposed operations into early 2026, encompassing anticipated data milestones from all its ongoing and planned clinical trials.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nLisata will hold a live conference call today, November 12, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss financial results, provide a business update, and answer questions.\n\nThose wishing to participate must register for the conference call by way of the following link: [**CLICK HERE TO REGISTER**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BUL6NUxabTwJOVCh-CapOeCzh-MjUEgXP-TrH47Da6DXvZpWCaUohq31cyhz_mPFqtTXL1FbL7r9YBhLIq-AWI8FVxYKwrs9G3S_CN5BXmCXgwnSrDp06_jGVF3-soqNwvm8VeXWM5YdjbLN21DW9Ij74_arGrHTzbSb1uZ8gKg=).
