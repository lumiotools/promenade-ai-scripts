The Company will no longer be sending physical meeting documents unless you request a copy to be posted.\n\nThe Company therefore encourages all shareholders to provide an email address so we can communicate with you electronically when shareholder notices (e.g. annual report or notice of meetings) become available online.\n\nShareholders can still elect to receive some or all of their communications in physical or electronic form, or elect not to receive certain documents such as annual reports. To review your communications preferences, or sign up to receive your shareholder communications via email, please update your details at <https://www.computershare.com/au>.\n\nIf you are a shareholder and would like a physical copy of a communication, need further information about the options available to you or have questions about your holding, visit <https://www.computershare.com/au> or contact the Share Registry:\n\n_Address_\n\nComputershare Investor Services Pty Limited\n\nGPO Box 2975\n\nMelbourne VIC 3001\n\nAustralia\n\n_Phone (Business hours: Monday to Friday between 8.30am and 5.00pm)_\n\nWithin Australia: 1300 850 505\n\nOutside Australia: +61 (0) 3 9415 4000\n\nThe Share Registry has also made available alternative means of communications for shareholders and these are available at [Contact us (computershare.com)](https://www.computershare.com/au/individuals/i-am-a-shareholder/contact-us)\n"
